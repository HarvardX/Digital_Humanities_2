part iii  a voyage to laputa balnibarbi luggnagg glubbdubdrib and
japan


chapter i


the author sets out on his third voyage  is taken by pirates  the
malice of a dutchman  his arrival at an island  he is received into
laputa

i had not been at home above ten days when captain william robinson a
cornish man commander of the hopewell a stout ship of three hundred
tons came to my house  i had formerly been surgeon of another ship
where he was master and a fourth part owner in a voyage to the levant
he had always treated me more like a brother than an inferior officer
and hearing of my arrival made me a visit as i apprehended only out of
friendship for nothing passed more than what is usual after long
absences  but repeating his visits often expressing his joy to find i
me in good health asking whether i were now settled for life adding
that he intended a voyage to the east indies in two months at last he
plainly invited me though with some apologies to be surgeon of the
ship that i should have another surgeon under me beside our two mates
that my salary should be double to the usual pay and that having
experienced my knowledge in seaaffairs to be at least equal to his he
would enter into any engagement to follow my advice as much as if i had
shared in the command

he said so many other obliging things and i knew him to be so honest a
man that i could not reject this proposal the thirst i had of seeing
the world notwithstanding my past misfortunes continuing as violent as
ever  the only difficulty that remained was to persuade my wife whose
consent however i at last obtained by the prospect of advantage she
proposed to her children

we set out the 5th day of august 1706 and arrived at fort st george
the 11th of april 1707  we staid there three weeks to refresh our crew
many of whom were sick  from thence we went to tonquin where the
captain resolved to continue some time because many of the goods he
intended to buy were not ready nor could he expect to be dispatched in
several months  therefore in hopes to defray some of the charges he
must be at he bought a sloop loaded it with several sorts of goods
wherewith the tonquinese usually trade to the neighbouring islands and
putting fourteen men on board whereof three were of the country he
appointed me master of the sloop and gave me power to traffic while he
transacted his affairs at tonquin

we had not sailed above three days when a great storm arising we were
driven five days to the northnortheast and then to the east after
which we had fair weather but still with a pretty strong gale from the
west  upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates who soon
overtook us for my sloop was so deep laden that she sailed very slow
neither were we in a condition to defend ourselves

we were boarded about the same time by both the pirates who entered
furiously at the head of their men but finding us all prostrate upon our
faces for so i gave order they pinioned us with strong ropes and
setting guard upon us went to search the sloop

i observed among them a dutchman who seemed to be of some authority
though he was not commander of either ship  he knew us by our
countenances to be englishmen and jabbering to us in his own language
swore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea  i spoke
dutch tolerably well i told him who we were and begged him in
consideration of our being christians and protestants of neighbouring
countries in strict alliance that he would move the captains to take
some pity on us  this inflamed his rage he repeated his threatenings
and turning to his companions spoke with great vehemence in the japanese
language as i suppose often using the word christianos

the largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a japanese captain
who spoke a little dutch but very imperfectly  he came up to me and
after several questions which i answered in great humility he said we
should not die  i made the captain a very low bow and then turning to
the dutchman said i was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen than in
a brother christian  but i had soon reason to repent those foolish
words for that malicious reprobate having often endeavoured in vain to
persuade both the captains that i might be thrown into the sea which
they would not yield to after the promise made me that i should not
die however prevailed so far as to have a punishment inflicted on me
worse in all human appearance than death itself  my men were sent by
an equal division into both the pirate ships and my sloop new manned
as to myself it was determined that i should be set adrift in a small
canoe with paddles and a sail and four days provisions which last
the japanese captain was so kind to double out of his own stores and
would permit no man to search me  i got down into the canoe while the
dutchman standing upon the deck loaded me with all the curses and
injurious terms his language could afford

about an hour before we saw the pirates i had taken an observation and
found we were in the latitude of 46 n and longitude of 183  when i was
at some distance from the pirates i discovered by my pocketglass
several islands to the southeast  i set up my sail the wind being
fair with a design to reach the nearest of those islands which i made a
shift to do in about three hours  it was all rocky however i got many
birds eggs and striking fire i kindled some heath and dry seaweed
by which i roasted my eggs  i ate no other supper being resolved to
spare my provisions as much as i could  i passed the night under the
shelter of a rock strewing some heath under me and slept pretty well

the next day i sailed to another island and thence to a third and
fourth sometimes using my sail and sometimes my paddles  but not to
trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses let it
suffice that on the fifth day i arrived at the last island in my sight
which lay southsoutheast to the former

this island was at a greater distance than i expected and i did not
reach it in less than five hours  i encompassed it almost round before
i could find a convenient place to land in which was a small creek
about three times the wideness of my canoe  i found the island to be all
rocky only a little intermingled with tufts of grass and sweetsmelling
herbs  i took out my small provisions and after having refreshed myself
i secured the remainder in a cave whereof there were great numbers i
gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks and got a quantity of dry
seaweed and parched grass which i designed to kindle the next day and
roast my eggs as well as i could for i had about me my flint steel
match and burningglass  i lay all night in the cave where i had lodged
my provisions  my bed was the same dry grass and seaweed which i
intended for fuel  i slept very little for the disquiets of my mind
prevailed over my weariness and kept me awake  i considered how
impossible it was to preserve my life in so desolate a place and how
miserable my end must be yet found myself so listless and desponding
that i had not the heart to rise and before i could get spirits enough
to creep out of my cave the day was far advanced  i walked awhile among
the rocks the sky was perfectly clear and the sun so hot that i was
forced to turn my face from it when all on a sudden it became obscure
as i thought in a manner very different from what happens by the
interposition of a cloud  i turned back and perceived a vast opaque
body between me and the sun moving forwards towards the island it seemed
to be about two miles high and hid the sun six or seven minutes but i
did not observe the air to be much colder or the sky more darkened than
if i had stood under the shade of a mountain  as it approached nearer
over the place where i was it appeared to be a firm substance the
bottom flat smooth and shining very bright from the reflection of the
sea below  i stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore
and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me at less
than an english mile distance  i took out my pocket perspective and
could plainly discover numbers of people moving up and down the sides of
it which appeared to be sloping but what those people where doing i was
not able to distinguish

the natural love of life gave me some inward motion of joy and i was
ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might some way or other
help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition i was in  but
at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment to
behold an island in the air inhabited by men who were able as it
should seem to raise or sink or put it into progressive motion as they
pleased  but not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise
upon this phenomenon i rather chose to observe what course the island
would take because it seemed for awhile to stand still  yet soon after
it advanced nearer and i could see the sides of it encompassed with
several gradations of galleries and stairs at certain intervals to
descend from one to the other  in the lowest gallery i beheld some
people fishing with long angling rods and others looking on  i waved my
cap for my hat was long since worn out and my handkerchief toward the
island and upon its nearer approach i called and shouted with the
utmost strength of my voice and then looking circumspectly i beheld a
crowd gather to that side which was most in my view  i found by their
pointing towards me and to each other that they plainly discovered me
although they made no return to my shouting  but i could see four or
five men running in great haste up the stairs to the top of the island
who then disappeared  i happened rightly to conjecture that these were
sent for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion

the number of people increased and in less than half an hour the
island was moved and raised in such a manner that the lowest gallery
appeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from the
height where i stood  i then put myself in the most supplicating
posture and spoke in the humblest accent but received no answer  those
who stood nearest over against me seemed to be persons of distinction
as i supposed by their habit  they conferred earnestly with each other
looking often upon me  at length one of them called out in a clear
polite smooth dialect not unlike in sound to the italian and therefore
i returned an answer in that language hoping at least that the cadence
might be more agreeable to his ears  although neither of us understood
the other yet my meaning was easily known for the people saw the
distress i was in

they made signs for me to come down from the rock and go towards the
shore which i accordingly did and the flying island being raised to a
convenient height the verge directly over me a chain was let down from
the lowest gallery with a seat fastened to the bottom to which i fixed
myself and was drawn up by pulleys



chapter ii


the humours and dispositions of the laputians described  an account of
their learning  of the king and his court  the authors reception
there  the inhabitants subject to fear and disquietudes  an account of
the women

at my alighting i was surrounded with a crowd of people but those who
stood nearest seemed to be of better quality  they beheld me with all
the marks and circumstances of wonder neither indeed was i much in their
debt having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their
shapes habits and countenances  their heads were all reclined either
to the right or the left one of their eyes turned inward and the other
directly up to the zenith  their outward garments were adorned with the
figures of suns moons and stars interwoven with those of fiddles
flutes harps trumpets guitars harpsichords and many other
instruments of music unknown to us in europe  i observed here and
there many in the habit of servants with a blown bladder fastened like
a flail to the end of a stick which they carried in their hands  in
each bladder was a small quantity of dried peas or little pebbles as i
was afterwards informed  with these bladders they now and then flapped
the mouths and ears of those who stood near them of which practice i
could not then conceive the meaning  it seems the minds of these people
are so taken up with intense speculations that they neither can speak
nor attend to the discourses of others without being roused by some
external action upon the organs of speech and hearing for which reason
those persons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper the
original is climenole in their family as one of their domestics nor
ever walk abroad or make visits without him  and the business of this
officer is when two three or more persons are in company gently to
strike with his bladder the mouth of him who is to speak and the right
ear of him or them to whom the speaker addresses himself  this flapper
is likewise employed diligently to attend his master in his walks and
upon occasion to give him a soft flap on his eyes because he is always
so wrapped up in cogitation that he is in manifest danger of falling
down every precipice and bouncing his head against every post and in
the streets of justling others or being justled himself into the
kennel

it was necessary to give the reader this information without which he
would be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of these
people as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island and
from thence to the royal palace  while we were ascending they forgot
several times what they were about and left me to myself till their
memories were again roused by their flappers for they appeared
altogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance and
by the shouts of the vulgar whose thoughts and minds were more
disengaged

at last we entered the palace and proceeded into the chamber of
presence where i saw the king seated on his throne attended on each
side by persons of prime quality  before the throne was a large table
filled with globes and spheres and mathematical instruments of all
kinds  his majesty took not the least notice of us although our
entrance was not without sufficient noise by the concourse of all
persons belonging to the court  but he was then deep in a problem and
we attended at least an hour before he could solve it  there stood by
him on each side a young page with flaps in their hands and when they
saw he was at leisure one of them gently struck his mouth and the other
his right ear at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden and
looking towards me and the company i was in recollected the occasion of
our coming whereof he had been informed before  he spoke some words
whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side and
flapped me gently on the right ear but i made signs as well as i could
that i had no occasion for such an instrument which as i afterwards
found gave his majesty and the whole court a very mean opinion of my
understanding  the king as far as i could conjecture asked me several
questions and i addressed myself to him in all the languages i had
when it was found i could neither understand nor be understood i was
conducted by his order to an apartment in his palace this prince being
distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to
strangers where two servants were appointed to attend me  my dinner
was brought and four persons of quality whom i remembered to have seen
very near the kings person did me the honour to dine with me  we had
two courses of three dishes each  in the first course there was a
shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle a piece of beef into
a rhomboides and a pudding into a cycloid  the second course was two
ducks trussed up in the form of fiddles sausages and puddings resembling
flutes and hautboys and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp  the
servants cut our bread into cones cylinders parallelograms and several
other mathematical figures

while we were at dinner i made bold to ask the names of several things
in their language and those noble persons by the assistance of their
flappers delighted to give me answers hoping to raise my admiration of
their great abilities if i could be brought to converse with them  i was
soon able to call for bread and drink or whatever else i wanted

after dinner my company withdrew and a person was sent to me by the
kings order attended by a flapper  he brought with him pen ink and
paper and three or four books giving me to understand by signs that he
was sent to teach me the language  we sat together four hours in which
time i wrote down a great number of words in columns with the
translations over against them i likewise made a shift to learn several
short sentences for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch
something to turn about to make a bow to sit or to stand or walk
and the like  then i took down the sentence in writing  he showed me
also in one of his books the figures of the sun moon and stars the
zodiac the tropics and polar circles together with the denominations
of many plains and solids  he gave me the names and descriptions of all
the musical instruments and the general terms of art in playing on each
of them  after he had left me i placed all my words with their
interpretations in alphabetical order  and thus in a few days by the
help of a very faithful memory i got some insight into their language
the word which i interpret the flying or floating island is in the
original laputa whereof i could never learn the true etymology
lap in the old obsolete language signifies high and untuh a
governor from which they say by corruption was derived laputa from
lapuntuh  but i do not approve of this derivation which seems to be a
little strained  i ventured to offer to the learned among them a
conjecture of my own that laputa was quasi lap outed lap
signifying properly the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea and outed
a wing which however i shall not obtrude but submit to the judicious
reader

those to whom the king had entrusted me observing how ill i was clad
ordered a tailor to come next morning and take measure for a suit of
clothes  this operator did his office after a different manner from
those of his trade in europe  he first took my altitude by a quadrant
and then with a rule and compasses described the dimensions and
outlines of my whole body all which he entered upon paper and in six
days brought my clothes very ill made and quite out of shape by
happening to mistake a figure in the calculation  but my comfort was
that i observed such accidents very frequent and little regarded

during my confinement for want of clothes and by an indisposition that
held me some days longer i much enlarged my dictionary and when i went
next to court was able to understand many things the king spoke and to
return him some kind of answers  his majesty had given orders that the
island should move northeast and by east to the vertical point over
lagado the metropolis of the whole kingdom below upon the firm earth
it was about ninety leagues distant and our voyage lasted four days and
a half  i was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion made
in the air by the island  on the second morning about eleven oclock
the king himself in person attended by his nobility courtiers and
officers having prepared all their musical instruments played on them
for three hours without intermission so that i was quite stunned with
the noise neither could i possibly guess the meaning till my tutor
informed me  he said that the people of their island had their ears
adapted to hear the music of the spheres which always played at certain
periods and the court was now prepared to bear their part in whatever
instrument they most excelled

in our journey towards lagado the capital city his majesty ordered that
the island should stop over certain towns and villages from whence he
might receive the petitions of his subjects  and to this purpose
several packthreads were let down with small weights at the bottom  on
these packthreads the people strung their petitions which mounted up
directly like the scraps of paper fastened by school boys at the end of
the string that holds their kite  sometimes we received wine and
victuals from below which were drawn up by pulleys

the knowledge i had in mathematics gave me great assistance in acquiring
their phraseology which depended much upon that science and music and
in the latter i was not unskilled  their ideas are perpetually
conversant in lines and figures  if they would for example praise the
beauty of a woman or any other animal they describe it by rhombs
circles parallelograms ellipses and other geometrical terms or by
words of art drawn from music needless here to repeat  i observed in
the kings kitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instruments
after the figures of which they cut up the joints that were served to his
majestys table

their houses are very ill built the walls bevil without one right angle
in any apartment and this defect arises from the contempt they bear to
practical geometry which they despise as vulgar and mechanic those
instructions they give being too refined for the intellects of their
workmen which occasions perpetual mistakes  and although they are
dexterous enough upon a piece of paper in the management of the rule
the pencil and the divider yet in the common actions and behaviour of
life i have not seen a more clumsy awkward and unhandy people nor so
slow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other subjects except
those of mathematics and music  they are very bad reasoners and
vehemently given to opposition unless when they happen to be of the
right opinion which is seldom their case  imagination fancy and
invention they are wholly strangers to nor have any words in their
language by which those ideas can be expressed the whole compass of
their thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementioned
sciences

most of them and especially those who deal in the astronomical part
have great faith in judicial astrology although they are ashamed to own
it publicly  but what i chiefly admired and thought altogether
unaccountable was the strong disposition i observed in them towards news
and politics perpetually inquiring into public affairs giving their
judgments in matters of state and passionately disputing every inch of a
party opinion  i have indeed observed the same disposition among most of
the mathematicians i have known in europe although i could never
discover the least analogy between the two sciences unless those people
suppose that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as the
largest therefore the regulation and management of the world require no
more abilities than the handling and turning of a globe but i rather
take this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human nature
inclining us to be most curious and conceited in matters where we have
least concern and for which we are least adapted by study or nature

these people are under continual disquietudes never enjoying a minutes
peace of mind and their disturbances proceed from causes which very
little affect the rest of mortals  their apprehensions arise from
several changes they dread in the celestial bodies for instance that
the earth by the continual approaches of the sun towards it must in
course of time be absorbed or swallowed up that the face of the sun
will by degrees be encrusted with its own effluvia and give no more
light to the world that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the
tail of the last comet which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes
and that the next which they have calculated for oneandthirty years
hence will probably destroy us  for if in its perihelion it should
approach within a certain degree of the sun as by their calculations
they have reason to dread it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand
times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron and in its absence
from the sun carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen
miles long through which if the earth should pass at the distance of
one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus or main body of the comet
it must in its passage be set on fire and reduced to ashes that the
sun daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them will
at last be wholly consumed and annihilated which must be attended with
the destruction of this earth and of all the planets that receive their
light from it

they are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these and the
like impending dangers that they can neither sleep quietly in their
beds nor have any relish for the common pleasures and amusements of
life  when they meet an acquaintance in the morning the first question
is about the suns health how he looked at his setting and rising and
what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching comet  this
conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boys
discover in delighting to hear terrible stories of spirits and
hobgoblins which they greedily listen to and dare not go to bed for
fear

the women of the island have abundance of vivacity they contemn their
husbands and are exceedingly fond of strangers whereof there is always
a considerable number from the continent below attending at court
either upon affairs of the several towns and corporations or their own
particular occasions but are much despised because they want the same
endowments  among these the ladies choose their gallants but the
vexation is that they act with too much ease and security for the
husband is always so rapt in speculation that the mistress and lover may
proceed to the greatest familiarities before his face if he be but
provided with paper and implements and without his flapper at his side

the wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island although
i think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world and although
they live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence and are allowed
to do whatever they please they long to see the world and take the
diversions of the metropolis which they are not allowed to do without a
particular license from the king and this is not easy to be obtained
because the people of quality have found by frequent experience how
hard it is to persuade their women to return from below  i was told that
a great court lady who had several children—is married to the prime
minister the richest subject in the kingdom a very graceful person
extremely fond of her and lives in the finest palace of the island—went
down to lagado on the pretence of health there hid herself for several
months till the king sent a warrant to search for her and she was found
in an obscure eatinghouse all in rags having pawned her clothes to
maintain an old deformed footman who beat her every day and in whose
company she was taken much against her will  and although her husband
received her with all possible kindness and without the least reproach
she soon after contrived to steal down again with all her jewels to the
same gallant and has not been heard of since

this may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an european or english
story than for one of a country so remote  but he may please to
consider that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climate
or nation and that they are much more uniform than can be easily
imagined

in about a months time i had made a tolerable proficiency in their
language and was able to answer most of the kings questions when i had
the honour to attend him  his majesty discovered not the least curiosity
to inquire into the laws government history religion or manners of
the countries where i had been but confined his questions to the state
of mathematics and received the account i gave him with great contempt
and indifference though often roused by his flapper on each side



chapter iii


a phenomenon solved by modern philosophy and astronomy  the laputians
great improvements in the latter  the kings method of suppressing
insurrections

i desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island
which he was graciously pleased to grant and ordered my tutor to attend
me  i chiefly wanted to know to what cause in art or in nature it
owed its several motions whereof i will now give a philosophical account
to the reader

the flying or floating island is exactly circular its diameter 7837
yards or about four miles and a half and consequently contains ten
thousand acres  it is three hundred yards thick  the bottom or under
surface which appears to those who view it below is one even regular
plate of adamant shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards
above it lie the several minerals in their usual order and over all is a
coat of rich mould ten or twelve feet deep  the declivity of the upper
surface from the circumference to the centre is the natural cause why
all the dews and rains which fall upon the island are conveyed in small
rivulets toward the middle where they are emptied into four large
basins each of about half a mile in circuit and two hundred yards
distant from the centre  from these basins the water is continually
exhaled by the sun in the daytime which effectually prevents their
overflowing  besides as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the
island above the region of clouds and vapours he can prevent the falling
of dews and rain whenever he pleases  for the highest clouds cannot rise
above two miles as naturalists agree at least they were never known to
do so in that country

at the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in
diameter whence the astronomers descend into a large dome which is
therefore called flandona gagnole or the astronomers cave situated
at the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the adamant
in this cave are twenty lamps continually burning which from the
reflection of the adamant cast a strong light into every part  the
place is stored with great variety of sextants quadrants telescopes
astrolabes and other astronomical instruments  but the greatest
curiosity upon which the fate of the island depends is a loadstone of a
prodigious size in shape resembling a weavers shuttle  it is in length
six yards and in the thickest part at least three yards over  this
magnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its
middle upon which it plays and is poised so exactly that the weakest
hand can turn it  it is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant
four feet yards in diameter placed horizontally and supported by eight
adamantine feet each six yards high  in the middle of the concave side
there is a groove twelve inches deep in which the extremities of the
axle are lodged and turned round as there is occasion

the stone cannot be removed from its place by any force because the hoop
and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which
constitutes the bottom of the island

by means of this loadstone the island is made to rise and fall and move
from one place to another  for with respect to that part of the earth
over which the monarch presides the stone is endued at one of its sides
with an attractive power and at the other with a repulsive  upon
placing the magnet erect with its attracting end towards the earth the
island descends but when the repelling extremity points downwards the
island mounts directly upwards  when the position of the stone is
oblique the motion of the island is so too for in this magnet the
forces always act in lines parallel to its direction

by this oblique motion the island is conveyed to different parts of the
monarchs dominions  to explain the manner of its progress let a b
represent a line drawn across the dominions of balnibarbi let the line
c d represent the loadstone of which let d be the repelling end
and c the attracting end the island being over c let the stone be
placed in position c d with its repelling end downwards then the
island will be driven upwards obliquely towards d  when it is arrived
at d let the stone be turned upon its axle till its attracting end
points towards e and then the island will be carried obliquely towards
e where if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in
the position e f with its repelling point downwards the island will
rise obliquely towards f where by directing the attracting end
towards g the island may be carried to g and from g to h by
turning the stone so as to make its repelling extremity to point
directly downward  and thus by changing the situation of the stone as
often as there is occasion the island is made to rise and fall by turns
in an oblique direction and by those alternate risings and fallings the
obliquity being not considerable is conveyed from one part of the
dominions to the other

but it must be observed that this island cannot move beyond the extent
of the dominions below nor can it rise above the height of four miles
for which the astronomers who have written large systems concerning the
stone assign the following reason that the magnetic virtue does not
extend beyond the distance of four miles and that the mineral which
acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth and in the sea about six
leagues distant from the shore is not diffused through the whole globe
but terminated with the limits of the kings dominions and it was easy
from the great advantage of such a superior situation for a prince to
bring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of
that magnet

when the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon the island
stands still for in that case the extremities of it being at equal
distance from the earth act with equal force the one in drawing
downwards the other in pushing upwards and consequently no motion can
ensue

this loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers who from time
to time give it such positions as the monarch directs  they spend the
greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies which
they do by the assistance of glasses far excelling ours in goodness
for although their largest telescopes do not exceed three feet they
magnify much more than those of a hundred with us and show the stars
with greater clearness  this advantage has enabled them to extend their
discoveries much further than our astronomers in europe for they have
made a catalogue of ten thousand fixed stars whereas the largest of ours
do not contain above one third part of that number  they have likewise
discovered two lesser stars or satellites which revolve about mars
whereof the innermost is distant from the centre of the primary planet
exactly three of his diameters and the outermost five the former
revolves in the space of ten hours and the latter in twentyone and a
half so that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the
same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the centre of mars
which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of gravitation
that influences the other heavenly bodies

they have observed ninetythree different comets and settled their
periods with great exactness  if this be true and they affirm it with
great confidence it is much to be wished that their observations were
made public whereby the theory of comets which at present is very lame
and defective might be brought to the same perfection with other arts of
astronomy

the king would be the most absolute prince in the universe if he could
but prevail on a ministry to join with him but these having their
estates below on the continent and considering that the office of a
favourite has a very uncertain tenure would never consent to the
enslaving of their country

if any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny fall into violent
factions or refuse to pay the usual tribute the king has two methods of
reducing them to obedience  the first and the mildest course is by
keeping the island hovering over such a town and the lands about it
whereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain and
consequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases and if the
crime deserve it they are at the same time pelted from above with great
stones against which they have no defence but by creeping into cellars
or caves while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces  but if
they still continue obstinate or offer to raise insurrections he
proceeds to the last remedy by letting the island drop directly upon
their heads which makes a universal destruction both of houses and men
however this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven
neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution nor dare his
ministers advise him to an action which as it would render them odious
to the people so it would be a great damage to their own estates which
all lie below for the island is the kings demesne

but there is still indeed a more weighty reason why the kings of this
country have been always averse from executing so terrible an action
unless upon the utmost necessity  for if the town intended to be
destroyed should have in it any tall rocks as it generally falls out in
the larger cities a situation probably chosen at first with a view to
prevent such a catastrophe or if it abound in high spires or pillars of
stone a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of the
island which although it consist as i have said of one entire
adamant two hundred yards thick might happen to crack by too great a
shock or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below
as the backs both of iron and stone will often do in our chimneys  of
all this the people are well apprised and understand how far to carry
their obstinacy where their liberty or property is concerned  and the
king when he is highest provoked and most determined to press a city to
rubbish orders the island to descend with great gentleness out of a
pretence of tenderness to his people but indeed for fear of breaking
the adamantine bottom in which case it is the opinion of all their
philosophers that the loadstone could no longer hold it up and the
whole mass would fall to the ground

by a fundamental law of this realm neither the king nor either of his
two eldest sons are permitted to leave the island nor the queen till
she is past childbearing



chapter iv


the author leaves laputa is conveyed to balnibarbi arrives at the
metropolis  a description of the metropolis and the country adjoining
the author hospitably received by a great lord  his conversation with
that lord

although i cannot say that i was ill treated in this island yet i must
confess i thought myself too much neglected not without some degree of
contempt for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any
part of knowledge except mathematics and music wherein i was far their
inferior and upon that account very little regarded

on the other side after having seen all the curiosities of the island i
was very desirous to leave it being heartily weary of those people
they were indeed excellent in two sciences for which i have great esteem
and wherein i am not unversed but at the same time so abstracted and
involved in speculation that i never met with such disagreeable
companions  i conversed only with women tradesmen flappers and
courtpages during two months of my abode there by which at last i
rendered myself extremely contemptible yet these were the only people
from whom i could ever receive a reasonable answer

i had obtained by hard study a good degree of knowledge in their
language i was weary of being confined to an island where i received so
little countenance and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity

there was a great lord at court nearly related to the king and for that
reason alone used with respect  he was universally reckoned the most
ignorant and stupid person among them  he had performed many eminent
services for the crown had great natural and acquired parts adorned
with integrity and honour but so ill an ear for music that his
detractors reported he had been often known to beat time in the wrong
place neither could his tutors without extreme difficulty teach him
to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics  he was
pleased to show me many marks of favour often did me the honour of a
visit desired to be informed in the affairs of europe the laws and
customs the manners and learning of the several countries where i had
travelled  he listened to me with great attention and made very wise
observations on all i spoke  he had two flappers attending him for
state but never made use of them except at court and in visits of
ceremony and would always command them to withdraw when we were alone
together

i entreated this illustrious person to intercede in my behalf with his
majesty for leave to depart which he accordingly did as he was pleased
to tell me with regret for indeed he had made me several offers very
advantageous which however i refused with expressions of the highest
acknowledgment

on the 16th of february i took leave of his majesty and the court  the
king made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds english
and my protector his kinsman as much more together with a letter of
recommendation to a friend of his in lagado the metropolis  the island
being then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it i was let
down from the lowest gallery in the same manner as i had been taken up

the continent as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying
island passes under the general name of balnibarbi and the
metropolis as i said before is called lagado  i felt some little
satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground  i walked to the city
without any concern being clad like one of the natives and sufficiently
instructed to converse with them  i soon found out the persons house to
whom i was recommended presented my letter from his friend the grandee
in the island and was received with much kindness  this great lord
whose name was munodi ordered me an apartment in his own house where i
continued during my stay and was entertained in a most hospitable
manner

the next morning after my arrival he took me in his chariot to see the
town which is about half the bigness of london but the houses very
strangely built and most of them out of repair  the people in the
streets walked fast looked wild their eyes fixed and were generally in
rags  we passed through one of the town gates and went about three
miles into the country where i saw many labourers working with several
sorts of tools in the ground but was not able to conjecture what they
were about neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass
although the soil appeared to be excellent  i could not forbear admiring
at these odd appearances both in town and country and i made bold to
desire my conductor that he would be pleased to explain to me what
could be meant by so many busy heads hands and faces both in the
streets and the fields because i did not discover any good effects they
produced but on the contrary i never knew a soil so unhappily
cultivated houses so ill contrived and so ruinous or a people whose
countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want

this lord munodi was a person of the first rank and had been some years
governor of lagado but by a cabal of ministers was discharged for
insufficiency  however the king treated him with tenderness as a
wellmeaning man but of a low contemptible understanding

when i gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants he made
no further answer than by telling me that i had not been long enough
among them to form a judgment and that the different nations of the
world had different customs with other common topics to the same
purpose  but when we returned to his palace he asked me how i liked
the building what absurdities i observed and what quarrel i had with
the dress or looks of his domestics  this he might safely do because
every thing about him was magnificent regular and polite  i answered
that his excellencys prudence quality and fortune had exempted him
from those defects which folly and beggary had produced in others  he
said if i would go with him to his countryhouse about twenty miles
distant where his estate lay there would be more leisure for this kind
of conversation  i told his excellency that i was entirely at his
disposal and accordingly we set out next morning

during our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers
in managing their lands which to me were wholly unaccountable for
except in some very few places i could not discover one ear of corn or
blade of grass  but in three hours travelling the scene was wholly
altered we came into a most beautiful country farmers houses at small
distances neatly built the fields enclosed containing vineyards
corngrounds and meadows  neither do i remember to have seen a more
delightful prospect  his excellency observed my countenance to clear up
he told me with a sigh that there his estate began and would continue
the same till we should come to his house that his countrymen ridiculed
and despised him for managing his affairs no better and for setting so
ill an example to the kingdom which however was followed by very few
such as were old and wilful and weak like himself

we came at length to the house which was indeed a noble structure built
according to the best rules of ancient architecture  the fountains
gardens walks avenues and groves were all disposed with exact
judgment and taste  i gave due praises to every thing i saw whereof his
excellency took not the least notice till after supper when there being
no third companion he told me with a very melancholy air that he
doubted he must throw down his houses in town and country to rebuild
them after the present mode destroy all his plantations and cast others
into such a form as modern usage required and give the same directions
to all his tenants unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride
singularity affectation ignorance caprice and perhaps increase his
majestys displeasure that the admiration i appeared to be under would
cease or diminish when he had informed me of some particulars which
probably i never heard of at court the people there being too much
taken up in their own speculations to have regard to what passed here
below

the sum of his discourse was to this effect that about forty years ago
certain persons went up to laputa either upon business or diversion
and after five months continuance came back with a very little
smattering in mathematics but full of volatile spirits acquired in that
airy region that these persons upon their return began to dislike the
management of every thing below and fell into schemes of putting all
arts sciences languages and mechanics upon a new foot  to this end
they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in
lagado and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people that there
is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy
in these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of
agriculture and building and new instruments and tools for all trades
and manufactures whereby as they undertake one man shall do the work
of ten a palace may be built in a week of materials so durable as to
last for ever without repairing  all the fruits of the earth shall come
to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose and increase a
hundred fold more than they do at present with innumerable other happy
proposals  the only inconvenience is that none of these projects are
yet brought to perfection and in the mean time the whole country lies
miserably waste the houses in ruins and the people without food or
clothes  by all which instead of being discouraged they are fifty
times more violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes driven equally
on by hope and despair that as for himself being not of an enterprising
spirit he was content to go on in the old forms to live in the houses
his ancestors had built and act as they did in every part of life
without innovation that some few other persons of quality and gentry had
done the same but were looked on with an eye of contempt and illwill
as enemies to art ignorant and ill commonwealths men preferring
their own ease and sloth before the general improvement of their
country

his lordship added that he would not by any further particulars
prevent the pleasure i should certainly take in viewing the grand
academy whither he was resolved i should go  he only desired me to
observe a ruined building upon the side of a mountain about three miles
distant of which he gave me this account that he had a very convenient
mill within half a mile of his house turned by a current from a large
river and sufficient for his own family as well as a great number of
his tenants that about seven years ago a club of those projectors came
to him with proposals to destroy this mill and build another on the side
of that mountain on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut for
a repository of water to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply
the mill because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water and
thereby made it fitter for motion and because the water descending down
a declivity would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose
course is more upon a level  he said that being then not very well
with the court and pressed by many of his friends he complied with the
proposal and after employing a hundred men for two years the work
miscarried the projectors went off laying the blame entirely upon him
railing at him ever since and putting others upon the same experiment
with equal assurance of success as well as equal disappointment

in a few days we came back to town and his excellency considering the
bad character he had in the academy would not go with me himself but
recommended me to a friend of his to bear me company thither  my lord
was pleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects and a person
of much curiosity and easy belief which indeed was not without truth
for i had myself been a sort of projector in my younger days



chapter v


the author permitted to see the grand academy of lagado  the academy
largely described  the arts wherein the professors employ themselves

this academy is not an entire single building but a continuation of
several houses on both sides of a street which growing waste was
purchased and applied to that use

i was received very kindly by the warden and went for many days to the
academy  every room has in it one or more projectors and i believe i
could not be in fewer than five hundred rooms

the first man i saw was of a meagre aspect with sooty hands and face
his hair and beard long ragged and singed in several places  his
clothes shirt and skin were all of the same colour  he has been eight
years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers which were
to be put in phials hermetically sealed and let out to warm the air in
raw inclement summers  he told me he did not doubt that in eight
years more he should be able to supply the governors gardens with
sunshine at a reasonable rate but he complained that his stock was low
and entreated me to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity
especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers  i made
him a small present for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose
because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them

i went into another chamber but was ready to hasten back being almost
overcome with a horrible stink  my conductor pressed me forward
conjuring me in a whisper to give no offence which would be highly
resented and therefore i durst not so much as stop my nose  the
projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy his
face and beard were of a pale yellow his hands and clothes daubed over
with filth  when i was presented to him he gave me a close embrace a
compliment i could well have excused  his employment from his first
coming into the academy was an operation to reduce human excrement to
its original food by separating the several parts removing the tincture
which it receives from the gall making the odour exhale and scumming
off the saliva  he had a weekly allowance from the society of a vessel
filled with human ordure about the bigness of a bristol barrel

i saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder who likewise showed
me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire which
he intended to publish

there was a most ingenious architect who had contrived a new method for
building houses by beginning at the roof and working downward to the
foundation which he justified to me by the like practice of those two
prudent insects the bee and the spider

there was a man born blind who had several apprentices in his own
condition their employment was to mix colours for painters which their
master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling  it was indeed
my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their
lessons and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken
this artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity

in another apartment i was highly pleased with a projector who had found
a device of ploughing the ground with hogs to save the charges of
ploughs cattle and labour  the method is this in an acre of ground
you bury at six inches distance and eight deep a quantity of acorns
dates chestnuts and other mast or vegetables whereof these animals are
fondest then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field
where in a few days they will root up the whole ground in search of
their food and make it fit for sowing at the same time manuring it with
their dung it is true upon experiment they found the charge and
trouble very great and they had little or no crop  however it is not
doubted that this invention may be capable of great improvement

i went into another room where the walls and ceiling were all hung round
with cobwebs except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out
at my entrance he called aloud to me not to disturb his webs  he
lamented the fatal mistake the world had been so long in of using
silkworms while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely
excelled the former because they understood how to weave as well as
spin  and he proposed further that by employing spiders the charge
of dyeing silks should be wholly saved whereof i was fully convinced
when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully coloured
wherewith he fed his spiders assuring us that the webs would take a
tincture from them and as he had them of all hues he hoped to fit
everybodys fancy as soon as he could find proper food for the flies of
certain gums oils and other glutinous matter to give a strength and
consistence to the threads

there was an astronomer who had undertaken to place a sundial upon the
great weathercock on the townhouse by adjusting the annual and diurnal
motions of the earth and sun so as to answer and coincide with all
accidental turnings of the wind

i was complaining of a small fit of the colic upon which my conductor
led me into a room where a great physician resided who was famous for
curing that disease by contrary operations from the same instrument  he
had a large pair of bellows with a long slender muzzle of ivory this he
conveyed eight inches up the anus and drawing in the wind he affirmed
he could make the guts as lank as a dried bladder  but when the disease
was more stubborn and violent he let in the muzzle while the bellows
were full of wind which he discharged into the body of the patient then
withdrew the instrument to replenish it clapping his thumb strongly
against the orifice of then fundament and this being repeated three or
four times the adventitious wind would rush out bringing the noxious
along with it like water put into a pump and the patient recovered
i saw him try both experiments upon a dog but could not discern any
effect from the former  after the latter the animal was ready to burst
and made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and my
companion  the dog died on the spot and we left the doctor endeavouring
to recover him by the same operation

i visited many other apartments but shall not trouble my reader with all
the curiosities i observed being studious of brevity

i had hitherto seen only one side of the academy the other being
appropriated to the advancers of speculative learning of whom i shall
say something when i have mentioned one illustrious person more who is
called among them the universal artist  he told us he had been thirty
years employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life  he had
two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities and fifty men at work
some were condensing air into a dry tangible substance by extracting the
nitre and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate others
softening marble for pillows and pincushions others petrifying the
hoofs of a living horse to preserve them from foundering  the artist
himself was at that time busy upon two great designs the first to sow
land with chaff wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be
contained as he demonstrated by several experiments which i was not
skilful enough to comprehend  the other was by a certain composition of
gums minerals and vegetables outwardly applied to prevent the growth
of wool upon two young lambs and he hoped in a reasonable time to
propagate the breed of naked sheep all over the kingdom

we crossed a walk to the other part of the academy where as i have
already said the projectors in speculative learning resided

the first professor i saw was in a very large room with forty pupils
about him  after salutation observing me to look earnestly upon a
frame which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of
the room he said perhaps i might wonder to see him employed in a
project for improving speculative knowledge by practical and mechanical
operations  but the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness and
he flattered himself that a more noble exalted thought never sprang in
any other mans head  every one knew how laborious the usual method is
of attaining to arts and sciences whereas by his contrivance the most
ignorant person at a reasonable charge and with a little bodily labour
might write books in philosophy poetry politics laws mathematics and
theology without the least assistance from genius or study  he then
led me to the frame about the sides whereof all his pupils stood in
ranks  it was twenty feet square placed in the middle of the room  the
superfices was composed of several bits of wood about the bigness of a
die but some larger than others  they were all linked together by
slender wires  these bits of wood were covered on every square with
paper pasted on them and on these papers were written all the words of
their language in their several moods tenses and declensions but
without any order  the professor then desired me to observe for he was
going to set his engine at work  the pupils at his command took each
of them hold of an iron handle whereof there were forty fixed round the
edges of the frame and giving them a sudden turn the whole disposition
of the words was entirely changed  he then commanded sixandthirty of
the lads to read the several lines softly as they appeared upon the
frame and where they found three or four words together that might make
part of a sentence they dictated to the four remaining boys who were
scribes  this work was repeated three or four times and at every turn
the engine was so contrived that the words shifted into new places as
the square bits of wood moved upside down

                           picture the frame

six hours a day the young students were employed in this labour and the
professor showed me several volumes in large folio already collected of
broken sentences which he intended to piece together and out of those
rich materials to give the world a complete body of all arts and
sciences which however might be still improved and much expedited if
the public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such
frames in lagado and oblige the managers to contribute in common their
several collections

he assured me that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his
youth that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame and made
the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books
between the numbers of particles nouns and verbs and other parts of
speech

i made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person for his
great communicativeness and promised if ever i had the good fortune to
return to my native country that i would do him justice as the sole
inventor of this wonderful machine the form and contrivance of which i
desired leave to delineate on paper as in the figure here annexed  i
told him although it were the custom of our learned in europe to steal
inventions from each other who had thereby at least this advantage that
it became a controversy which was the right owner yet i would take such
caution that he should have the honour entire without a rival

we next went to the school of languages where three professors sat in
consultation upon improving that of their own country

the first project was to shorten discourse by cutting polysyllables
into one and leaving out verbs and participles because in reality all
things imaginable are but norms

the other project was a scheme for entirely abolishing all words
whatsoever and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health
as well as brevity  for it is plain that every word we speak is in
some degree a diminution of our lungs by corrosion and consequently
contributes to the shortening of our lives  an expedient was therefore
offered that since words are only names for things it would be more
convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were necessary
to express a particular business they are to discourse on  and this
invention would certainly have taken place to the great ease as well as
health of the subject if the women in conjunction with the vulgar and
illiterate had not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be
allowed the liberty to speak with their tongues after the manner of
their forefathers such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are
the common people  however many of the most learned and wise adhere to
the new scheme of expressing themselves by things which has only this
inconvenience attending it that if a mans business be very great and
of various kinds he must be obliged in proportion to carry a greater
bundle of things upon his back unless he can afford one or two strong
servants to attend him  i have often beheld two of those sages almost
sinking under the weight of their packs like pedlars among us who when
they met in the street would lay down their loads open their sacks and
hold conversation for an hour together then put up their implements
help each other to resume their burdens and take their leave

but for short conversations a man may carry implements in his pockets
and under his arms enough to supply him and in his house he cannot be
at a loss  therefore the room where company meet who practise this art
is full of all things ready at hand requisite to furnish matter for
this kind of artificial converse

another great advantage proposed by this invention was that it would
serve as a universal language to be understood in all civilised nations
whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind or nearly
resembling so that their uses might easily be comprehended  and thus
ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes or
ministers of state to whose tongues they were utter strangers

i was at the mathematical school where the master taught his pupils
after a method scarce imaginable to us in europe  the proposition and
demonstration were fairly written on a thin wafer with ink composed of
a cephalic tincture  this the student was to swallow upon a fasting
stomach and for three days following eat nothing but bread and water
as the wafer digested the tincture mounted to his brain bearing the
proposition along with it  but the success has not hitherto been
answerable partly by some error in the quantum or composition and
partly by the perverseness of lads to whom this bolus is so nauseous
that they generally steal aside and discharge it upwards before it can
operate neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an
abstinence as the prescription requires



chapter vi


a further account of the academy  the author proposes some improvements
which are honourably received

in the school of political projectors i was but ill entertained the
professors appearing in my judgment wholly out of their senses which
is a scene that never fails to make me melancholy  these unhappy people
were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favourites upon
the score of their wisdom capacity and virtue of teaching ministers to
consult the public good of rewarding merit great abilities eminent
services of instructing princes to know their true interest by placing
it on the same foundation with that of their people of choosing for
employments persons qualified to exercise them with many other wild
impossible chimeras that never entered before into the heart of man to
conceive and confirmed in me the old observation that there is nothing
so extravagant and irrational which some philosophers have not
maintained for truth

but however i shall so far do justice to this part of the academy as
to acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary  there was a most
ingenious doctor who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature
and system of government  this illustrious person had very usefully
employed his studies in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases
and corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are
subject by the vices or infirmities of those who govern as well as by
the licentiousness of those who are to obey  for instance whereas all
writers and reasoners have agreed that there is a strict universal
resemblance between the natural and the political body can there be any
thing more evident than that the health of both must be preserved and
the diseases cured by the same prescriptions  it is allowed that
senates and great councils are often troubled with redundant ebullient
and other peccant humours with many diseases of the head and more of
the heart with strong convulsions with grievous contractions of the
nerves and sinews in both hands but especially the right with spleen
flatus vertigos and deliriums with scrofulous tumours full of fetid
purulent matter with sour frothy ructations with canine appetites and
crudeness of digestion besides many others needless to mention  this
doctor therefore proposed that upon the meeting of the senate certain
physicians should attend it the three first days of their sitting and at
the close of each days debate feel the pulses of every senator after
which having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the
several maladies and the methods of cure they should on the fourth day
return to the senate house attended by their apothecaries stored with
proper medicines and before the members sat administer to each of them
lenitives aperitives abstersives corrosives restringents
palliatives laxatives cephalalgics icterics apophlegmatics
acoustics as their several cases required and according as these
medicines should operate repeat alter or omit them at the next
meeting

this project could not be of any great expense to the public and might
in my poor opinion be of much use for the despatch of business in those
countries where senates have any share in the legislative power beget
unanimity shorten debates open a few mouths which are now closed and
close many more which are now open curb the petulancy of the young and
correct the positiveness of the old rouse the stupid and damp the pert

again because it is a general complaint that the favourites of princes
are troubled with short and weak memories the same doctor proposed
that whoever attended a first minister after having told his business
with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words should at his
departure give the said minister a tweak by the nose or a kick in the
belly or tread on his corns or lug him thrice by both ears or run a
pin into his breech or pinch his arm black and blue to prevent
forgetfulness and at every levee day repeat the same operation till
the business were done or absolutely refused

he likewise directed that every senator in the great council of a
nation after he had delivered his opinion and argued in the defence of
it should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary because if that
were done the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the
public

when parties in a state are violent he offered a wonderful contrivance
to reconcile them  the method is this you take a hundred leaders of
each party you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest
of a size then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple
at the same time in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided
let the occiputs thus cut off be interchanged applying each to the
head of his opposite partyman  it seems indeed to be a work that
requires some exactness but the professor assured us that if it were
dexterously performed the cure would be infallible  for he argued
thus that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between
themselves within the space of one skull would soon come to a good
understanding and produce that moderation as well as regularity of
thinking so much to be wished for in the heads of those who imagine
they come into the world only to watch and govern its motion and as to
the difference of brains in quantity or quality among those who are
directors in faction the doctor assured us from his own knowledge that
it was a perfect trifle

i heard a very warm debate between two professors about the most
commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money without
grieving the subject  the first affirmed the justest method would be
to lay a certain tax upon vices and folly and the sum fixed upon every
man to be rated after the fairest manner by a jury of his neighbours
the second was of an opinion directly contrary to tax those qualities
of body and mind for which men chiefly value themselves the rate to be
more or less according to the degrees of excelling the decision whereof
should be left entirely to their own breast  the highest tax was upon
men who are the greatest favourites of the other sex and the
assessments according to the number and nature of the favours they have
received for which they are allowed to be their own vouchers  wit
valour and politeness were likewise proposed to be largely taxed and
collected in the same manner by every persons giving his own word for
the quantum of what he possessed  but as to honour justice wisdom and
learning they should not be taxed at all because they are
qualifications of so singular a kind that no man will either allow them
in his neighbour or value them in himself

the women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill
in dressing wherein they had the same privilege with the men to be
determined by their own judgment  but constancy chastity good sense
and good nature were not rated because they would not bear the charge
of collecting

to keep senators in the interest of the crown it was proposed that the
members should raffle for employment every man first taking an oath and
giving security that he would vote for the court whether he won or not
after which the losers had in their turn the liberty of raffling upon
the next vacancy  thus hope and expectation would be kept alive none
would complain of broken promises but impute their disappointments
wholly to fortune whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of
a ministry

another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering
plots and conspiracies against the government  he advised great
statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons their times
of eating upon which side they lay in bed with which hand they wipe
their posteriors take a strict view of their excrements and from the
colour the odour the taste the consistence the crudeness or maturity
of digestion form a judgment of their thoughts and designs because men
are never so serious thoughtful and intent as when they are at stool
which he found by frequent experiment for in such conjunctures when he
used merely as a trial to consider which was the best way of murdering
the king his ordure would have a tincture of green but quite different
when he thought only of raising an insurrection or burning the
metropolis

the whole discourse was written with great acuteness containing many
observations both curious and useful for politicians but as i
conceived not altogether complete  this i ventured to tell the author
and offered if he pleased to supply him with some additions  he
received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers
especially those of the projecting species professing he would be glad
to receive further information

i told him that in the kingdom of tribnia 454a by the natives called
langdon 454b where i had sojourned some time in my travels the bulk
of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers witnesses
informers accusers prosecutors evidences swearers together with
their several subservient and subaltern instruments all under the
colours the conduct and the pay of ministers of state and their
deputies  the plots in that kingdom are usually the workmanship of
those persons who desire to raise their own characters of profound
politicians to restore new vigour to a crazy administration to stifle
or divert general discontents to fill their coffers with forfeitures
and raise or sink the opinion of public credit as either shall best
answer their private advantage  it is first agreed and settled among
them what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot then effectual
care is taken to secure all their letters and papers and put the owners
in chains  these papers are delivered to a set of artists very
dexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words syllables and
letters for instance they can discover a close stool to signify a
privy council a flock of geese a senate a lame dog an invader the
plague a standing army a buzzard a prime minister the gout a high
priest a gibbet a secretary of state a chamber pot a committee of
grandees a sieve a court lady a broom a revolution a mousetrap an
employment a bottomless pit a treasury a sink a court a cap and
bells a favourite a broken reed a court of justice an empty tun a
general a running sore the administration 455

when this method fails they have two others more effectual which the
learned among them call acrostics and anagrams  first they can decipher
all initial letters into political meanings  thus n shall signify a
plot b a regiment of horse l a fleet at sea or secondly by
transposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected paper they can
lay open the deepest designs of a discontented party  so for example
if i should say in a letter to a friend our brother tom has just got
the piles a skilful decipherer would discover that the same letters
which compose that sentence may be analysed into the following words
resist — a plot is brought home—the tour  and this is the
anagrammatic method

the professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these
observations and promised to make honourable mention of me in his
treatise

i saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer
continuance and began to think of returning home to england



chapter vii


the author leaves lagado arrives at maldonada  no ship ready  he takes
a short voyage to glubbdubdrib  his reception by the governor

the continent of which this kingdom is apart extends itself as i have
reason to believe eastward to that unknown tract of america westward of
california and north to the pacific ocean which is not above a hundred
and fifty miles from lagado where there is a good port and much
commerce with the great island of luggnagg situated to the northwest
about 29 degrees north latitude and 140 longitude  this island of
luggnagg stands southeastward of japan about a hundred leagues distant
there is a strict alliance between the japanese emperor and the king of
luggnagg which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island
to the other  i determined therefore to direct my course this way in
order to my return to europe  i hired two mules with a guide to show
me the way and carry my small baggage  i took leave of my noble
protector who had shown me so much favour and made me a generous
present at my departure

my journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating  when i
arrived at the port of maldonada for so it is called there was no ship
in the harbour bound for luggnagg nor likely to be in some time  the
town is about as large as portsmouth  i soon fell into some
acquaintance and was very hospitably received  a gentleman of
distinction said to me that since the ships bound for luggnagg could
not be ready in less than a month it might be no disagreeable amusement
for me to take a trip to the little island of glubbdubdrib about five
leagues off to the southwest  he offered himself and a friend to
accompany me and that i should be provided with a small convenient bark
for the voyage

glubbdubdrib as nearly as i can interpret the word signifies the island
of sorcerers or magicians  it is about one third as large as the isle of
wight and extremely fruitful it is governed by the head of a certain
tribe who are all magicians  this tribe marries only among each other
and the eldest in succession is prince or governor  he has a noble
palace and a park of about three thousand acres surrounded by a wall of
hewn stone twenty feet high  in this park are several small enclosures
for cattle corn and gardening

the governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of a
kind somewhat unusual  by his skill in necromancy he has a power of
calling whom he pleases from the dead and commanding their service for
twentyfour hours but no longer nor can he call the same persons up
again in less than three months except upon very extraordinary
occasions

when we arrived at the island which was about eleven in the morning one
of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor and desired
admittance for a stranger who came on purpose to have the honour of
attending on his highness  this was immediately granted and we all
three entered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards armed
and dressed after a very antic manner and with something in their
countenances that made my flesh creep with a horror i cannot express  we
passed through several apartments between servants of the same sort
ranked on each side as before till we came to the chamber of presence
where after three profound obeisances and a few general questions we
were permitted to sit on three stools near the lowest step of his
highnesss throne  he understood the language of balnibarbi although it
was different from that of this island  he desired me to give him some
account of my travels and to let me see that i should be treated
without ceremony he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his
finger at which to my great astonishment they vanished in an instant
like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden  i could not recover
myself in some time till the governor assured me that i should receive
no hurt and observing my two companions to be under no concern who had
been often entertained in the same manner i began to take courage and
related to his highness a short history of my several adventures yet not
without some hesitation and frequently looking behind me to the place
where i had seen those domestic spectres  i had the honour to dine with
the governor where a new set of ghosts served up the meat and waited at
table  i now observed myself to be less terrified than i had been in the
morning  i stayed till sunset but humbly desired his highness to excuse
me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace  my two
friends and i lay at a private house in the town adjoining which is the
capital of this little island and the next morning we returned to pay
our duty to the governor as he was pleased to command us

after this manner we continued in the island for ten days most part of
every day with the governor and at night in our lodging  i soon grew so
familiarized to the sight of spirits that after the third or fourth time
they gave me no emotion at all or if i had any apprehensions left my
curiosity prevailed over them  for his highness the governor ordered me
to call up whatever persons i would choose to name and in whatever
numbers among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the
present time and command them to answer any questions i should think fit
to ask with this condition that my questions must be confined within
the compass of the times they lived in  and one thing i might depend
upon that they would certainly tell me the truth for lying was a talent
of no use in the lower world

i made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour
we were in a chamber from whence there was a fair prospect into the
park  and because my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes
of pomp and magnificence i desired to see alexander the great at the
head of his army just after the battle of arbela which upon a motion
of the governors finger immediately appeared in a large field under
the window where we stood  alexander was called up into the room it was
with great difficulty that i understood his greek and had but little of
my own  he assured me upon his honour that he was not poisoned but
died of a bad fever by excessive drinking

next i saw hannibal passing the alps who told me he had not a drop of
vinegar in his camp

i saw cæsar and pompey at the head of their troops just ready to engage
i saw the former in his last great triumph  i desired that the senate
of rome might appear before me in one large chamber and an assembly of
somewhat a later age in counterview in another  the first seemed to be
an assembly of heroes and demigods the other a knot of pedlars
pickpockets highwayman and bullies

the governor at my request gave the sign for cæsar and brutus to
advance towards us  i was struck with a profound veneration at the sight
of brutus and could easily discover the most consummate virtue the
greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind the truest love of his
country and general benevolence for mankind in every lineament of his
countenance  i observed with much pleasure that these two persons were
in good intelligence with each other and cæsar freely confessed to me
that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal by many
degrees to the glory of taking it away  i had the honour to have much
conversation with brutus and was told that his ancestor junius
socrates epaminondas cato the younger sir thomas more and himself
were perpetually together a sextumvirate to which all the ages of the
world cannot add a seventh

it would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers
of illustrious persons were called up to gratify that insatiable desire i
had to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me  i
chiefly fed mine eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants and
usurpers and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nations
but it is impossible to express the satisfaction i received in my own
mind after such a manner as to make it a suitable entertainment to the
reader



chapter viii


a further account of glubbdubdrib  ancient and modern history corrected

having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and
learning i set apart one day on purpose  i proposed that homer and
aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators but these
were so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court
and outward rooms of the palace  i knew and could distinguish those two
heroes at first sight not only from the crowd but from each other
homer was the taller and comelier person of the two walked very erect
for one of his age and his eyes were the most quick and piercing i ever
beheld  aristotle stooped much and made use of a staff  his visage was
meagre his hair lank and thin and his voice hollow  i soon discovered
that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company and
had never seen or heard of them before and i had a whisper from a ghost
who shall be nameless that these commentators always kept in the most
distant quarters from their principals in the lower world through a
consciousness of shame and guilt because they had so horribly
misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity  i introduced
didymus and eustathius to homer and prevailed on him to treat them
better than perhaps they deserved for he soon found they wanted a genius
to enter into the spirit of a poet  but aristotle was out of all
patience with the account i gave him of scotus and ramus as i presented
them to him and he asked them whether the rest of the tribe were as
great dunces as themselves

i then desired the governor to call up descartes and gassendi with whom
i prevailed to explain their systems to aristotle  this great
philosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy
because he proceeded in many things upon conjecture as all men must do
and he found that gassendi who had made the doctrine of epicurus as
palatable as he could and the vortices of descartes were equally to be
exploded  he predicted the same fate to attraction whereof the
present learned are such zealous asserters  he said that new systems
of nature were but new fashions which would vary in every age and even
those who pretend to demonstrate them from mathematical principles
would flourish but a short period of time and be out of vogue when that
was determined

i spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned
i saw most of the first roman emperors  i prevailed on the governor to
call up heliogabaluss cooks to dress us a dinner but they could not
show us much of their skill for want of materials  a helot of agesilaus
made us a dish of spartan broth but i was not able to get down a second
spoonful

the two gentlemen who conducted me to the island were pressed by their
private affairs to return in three days which i employed in seeing some
of the modern dead who had made the greatest figure for two or three
hundred years past in our own and other countries of europe and having
been always a great admirer of old illustrious families i desired the
governor would call up a dozen or two of kings with their ancestors in
order for eight or nine generations  but my disappointment was grievous
and unexpected  for instead of a long train with royal diadems i saw
in one family two fiddlers three spruce courtiers and an italian
prelate  in another a barber an abbot and two cardinals  i have too
great a veneration for crowned heads to dwell any longer on so nice a
subject  but as to counts marquises dukes earls and the like i was
not so scrupulous  and i confess it was not without some pleasure that
i found myself able to trace the particular features by which certain
families are distinguished up to their originals  i could plainly
discover whence one family derives a long chin why a second has abounded
with knaves for two generations and fools for two more why a third
happened to be crackbrained and a fourth to be sharpers whence it
came what polydore virgil says of a certain great house nec vir
fortis nec foemina casta how cruelty falsehood and cowardice grew
to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much
as by their coats of arms who first brought the pox into a noble house
which has lineally descended scrofulous tumours to their posterity
neither could i wonder at all this when i saw such an interruption of
lineages by pages lackeys valets coachmen gamesters fiddlers
players captains and pickpockets

i was chiefly disgusted with modern history  for having strictly
examined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes for a
hundred years past i found how the world had been misled by prostitute
writers to ascribe the greatest exploits in war to cowards the wisest
counsel to fools sincerity to flatterers roman virtue to betrayers
of their country piety to atheists chastity to sodomites truth to
informers how many innocent and excellent persons had been condemned to
death or banishment by the practising of great ministers upon the
corruption of judges and the malice of factions how many villains had
been exalted to the highest places of trust power dignity and profit
how great a share in the motions and events of courts councils and
senates might be challenged by bawds whores pimps parasites and
buffoons  how low an opinion i had of human wisdom and integrity when i
was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and
revolutions in the world and of the contemptible accidents to which they
owed their success

here i discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write
anecdotes or secret history who send so many kings to their graves with
a cup of poison will repeat the discourse between a prince and chief
minister where no witness was by unlock the thoughts and cabinets of
ambassadors and secretaries of state and have the perpetual misfortune
to be mistaken  here i discovered the true causes of many great events
that have surprised the world how a whore can govern the backstairs
the backstairs a council and the council a senate  a general
confessed in my presence that he got a victory purely by the force of
cowardice and ill conduct and an admiral that for want of proper
intelligence he beat the enemy to whom he intended to betray the
fleet  three kings protested to me that in their whole reigns they
never did once prefer any person of merit unless by mistake or
treachery of some minister in whom they confided neither would they do
it if they were to live again and they showed with great strength of
reason that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption
because that positive confident restiff temper which virtue infused
into a man was a perpetual clog to public business

i had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner by what methods
great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honour and
prodigious estates and i confined my inquiry to a very modern period
however without grating upon present times because i would be sure to
give no offence even to foreigners for i hope the reader need not be
told that i do not in the least intend my own country in what i say
upon this occasion a great number of persons concerned were called up
and upon a very slight examination discovered such a scene of infamy
that i cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness  perjury
oppression subornation fraud pandarism and the like infirmities were
among the most excusable arts they had to mention and for these i gave
as it was reasonable great allowance  but when some confessed they owed
their greatness and wealth to sodomy or incest others to the
prostituting of their own wives and daughters others to the betraying
of their country or their prince some to poisoning more to the
perverting of justice in order to destroy the innocent i hope i may be
pardoned if these discoveries inclined me a little to abate of that
profound veneration which i am naturally apt to pay to persons of high
rank who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their
sublime dignity by us their inferiors

i had often read of some great services done to princes and states and
desired to see the persons by whom those services were performed  upon
inquiry i was told that their names were to be found on no record
except a few of them whom history has represented as the vilest of
rogues and traitors  as to the rest i had never once heard of them
they all appeared with dejected looks and in the meanest habit most of
them telling me they died in poverty and disgrace and the rest on a
scaffold or a gibbet

among others there was one person whose case appeared a little
singular  he had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side
he told me he had for many years been commander of a ship and in the
sea fight at actium had the good fortune to break through the enemys
great line of battle sink three of their capital ships and take a
fourth which was the sole cause of antonys flight and of the victory
that ensued that the youth standing by him his only son was killed in
the action  he added that upon the confidence of some merit the war
being at an end he went to rome and solicited at the court of augustus
to be preferred to a greater ship whose commander had been killed but
without any regard to his pretensions it was given to a boy who had
never seen the sea the son of libertina who waited on one of the
emperors mistresses  returning back to his own vessel he was charged
with neglect of duty and the ship given to a favourite page of
publicola the viceadmiral whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a
great distance from rome and there ended his life  i was so curious to
know the truth of this story that i desired agrippa might be called who
was admiral in that fight  he appeared and confirmed the whole account
but with much more advantage to the captain whose modesty had extenuated
or concealed a great part of his merit

i was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that
empire by the force of luxury so lately introduced which made me less
wonder at many parallel cases in other countries where vices of all
kinds have reigned so much longer and where the whole praise as well as
pillage has been engrossed by the chief commander who perhaps had the
least title to either

as every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done in
the world it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the race
of human kind was degenerated among us within these hundred years past
how the pox under all its consequences and denominations had altered
every lineament of an english countenance shortened the size of bodies
unbraced the nerves relaxed the sinews and muscles introduced a sallow
complexion and rendered the flesh loose and rancid

i descended so low as to desire some english yeoman of the old stamp
might be summoned to appear once so famous for the simplicity of their
manners diet and dress for justice in their dealings for their true
spirit of liberty for their valour and love of their country  neither
could i be wholly unmoved after comparing the living with the dead when
i considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for a
piece of money by their grandchildren who in selling their votes and
managing at elections have acquired every vice and corruption that can
possibly be learned in a court



chapter ix


the author returns to maldonada  sails to the kingdom of luggnagg  the
author confined  he is sent for to court  the manner of his admittance
the kings great lenity to his subjects

the day of our departure being come i took leave of his highness the
governor of glubbdubdrib and returned with my two companions to
maldonada where after a fortnights waiting a ship was ready to sail
for luggnagg  the two gentlemen and some others were so generous and
kind as to furnish me with provisions and see me on board  i was a
month in this voyage  we had one violent storm and were under a
necessity of steering westward to get into the trade wind which holds
for above sixty leagues  on the 21st of april 1708 we sailed into the
river of clumegnig which is a seaport town at the southeast point of
luggnagg  we cast anchor within a league of the town and made a signal
for a pilot  two of them came on board in less than half an hour by
whom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks which are very
dangerous in the passage to a large basin where a fleet may ride in
safety within a cables length of the townwall

some of our sailors whether out of treachery or inadvertence had
informed the pilots that i was a stranger and great traveller whereof
these gave notice to a customhouse officer by whom i was examined very
strictly upon my landing  this officer spoke to me in the language of
balnibarbi which by the force of much commerce is generally understood
in that town especially by seamen and those employed in the customs  i
gave him a short account of some particulars and made my story as
plausible and consistent as i could but i thought it necessary to
disguise my country and call myself a hollander because my intentions
were for japan and i knew the dutch were the only europeans permitted to
enter into that kingdom  i therefore told the officer that having been
shipwrecked on the coast of balnibarbi and cast on a rock i was
received up into laputa or the flying island of which he had often
heard and was now endeavouring to get to japan whence i might find a
convenience of returning to my own country  the officer said i must
be confined till he could receive orders from court for which he would
write immediately and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight  i was
carried to a convenient lodging with a sentry placed at the door
however i had the liberty of a large garden and was treated with
humanity enough being maintained all the time at the kings charge  i
was invited by several persons chiefly out of curiosity because it was
reported that i came from countries very remote of which they had never
heard

i hired a young man who came in the same ship to be an interpreter he
was a native of luggnagg but had lived some years at maldonada and was
a perfect master of both languages  by his assistance i was able to
hold a conversation with those who came to visit me but this consisted
only of their questions and my answers

the despatch came from court about the time we expected  it contained a
warrant for conducting me and my retinue to traldragdubh or
trildrogdrib for it is pronounced both ways as near as i can
remember by a party of ten horse  all my retinue was that poor lad for
an interpreter whom i persuaded into my service and at my humble
request we had each of us a mule to ride on  a messenger was despatched
half a days journey before us to give the king notice of my approach
and to desire that his majesty would please to appoint a day and hour
when it would by his gracious pleasure that i might have the honour to
lick the dust before his footstool  this is the court style and i
found it to be more than matter of form for upon my admittance two days
after my arrival i was commanded to crawl upon my belly and lick the
floor as i advanced but on account of my being a stranger care was
taken to have it made so clean that the dust was not offensive
however this was a peculiar grace not allowed to any but persons of the
highest rank when they desire an admittance  nay sometimes the floor
is strewed with dust on purpose when the person to be admitted happens
to have powerful enemies at court and i have seen a great lord with his
mouth so crammed that when he had crept to the proper distance from the
throne he was not able to speak a word  neither is there any remedy
because it is capital for those who receive an audience to spit or wipe
their mouths in his majestys presence  there is indeed another custom
which i cannot altogether approve of when the king has a mind to put any
of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner he commands the
floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition
which being licked up infallibly kills him in twentyfour hours  but in
justice to this princes great clemency and the care he has of his
subjects lives wherein it were much to be wished that the monarchs of
europe would imitate him it must be mentioned for his honour that
strict orders are given to have the infected parts of the floor well
washed after every such execution which if his domestics neglect they
are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure  i myself heard him
give directions that one of his pages should be whipped whose turn it
was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution but
maliciously had omitted it by which neglect a young lord of great hopes
coming to an audience was unfortunately poisoned although the king at
that time had no design against his life  but this good prince was so
gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping upon promise that he
would do so no more without special orders

to return from this digression  when i had crept within four yards of
the throne i raised myself gently upon my knees and then striking my
forehead seven times against the ground i pronounced the following
words as they had been taught me the night before inckpling
gloffthrobb squut serummblhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkuffh slhiophad
gurdlubh asht  this is the compliment established by the laws of the
land for all persons admitted to the kings presence  it may be
rendered into english thus may your celestial majesty outlive the sun
eleven moons and a half  to this the king returned some answer which
although i could not understand yet i replied as i had been directed
fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush which properly signifies
my tongue is in the mouth of my friend and by this expression was
meant that i desired leave to bring my interpreter whereupon the young
man already mentioned was accordingly introduced by whose intervention i
answered as many questions as his majesty could put in above an hour  i
spoke in the balnibarbian tongue and my interpreter delivered my meaning
in that of luggnagg

the king was much delighted with my company and ordered his
bliffmarklub or highchamberlain to appoint a lodging in the court
for me and my interpreter with a daily allowance for my table and a
large purse of gold for my common expenses

i staid three months in this country out of perfect obedience to his
majesty who was pleased highly to favour me and made me very honourable
offers  but i thought it more consistent with prudence and justice to
pass the remainder of my days with my wife and family



chapter x


the luggnaggians commended  a particular description of the struldbrugs
with many conversations between the author and some eminent persons upon
that subject

the luggnaggians are a polite and generous people and although they are
not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all eastern
countries yet they show themselves courteous to strangers especially
such who are countenanced by the court  i had many acquaintance and
among persons of the best fashion and being always attended by my
interpreter the conversation we had was not disagreeable

one day in much good company i was asked by a person of quality
whether i had seen any of their struldbrugs or immortals  i said
i had not and desired he would explain to me what he meant by such an
appellation applied to a mortal creature  he told me that sometimes
though very rarely a child happened to be born in a family with a red
circular spot in the forehead directly over the left eyebrow which was
an infallible mark that it should never die  the spot as he described
it was about the compass of a silver threepence but in the course of
time grew larger and changed its colour for at twelve years old it
became green so continued till five and twenty then turned to a deep
blue at five and forty it grew coal black and as large as an english
shilling but never admitted any further alteration  he said these
births were so rare that he did not believe there could be above eleven
hundred struldbrugs of both sexes in the whole kingdom of which he
computed about fifty in the metropolis and among the rest a young girl
born about three years ago that these productions were not peculiar to
any family but a mere effect of chance and the children of the
struldbrugs themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the
people

i freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight upon
hearing this account and the person who gave it me happening to
understand the balnibarbian language which i spoke very well i could
not forbear breaking out into expressions perhaps a little too
extravagant  i cried out as in a rapture happy nation where every
child hath at least a chance for being immortal  happy people who enjoy
so many living examples of ancient virtue and have masters ready to
instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages but happiest beyond all
comparison are those excellent struldbrugs who being born exempt
from that universal calamity of human nature have their minds free and
disengaged without the weight and depression of spirits caused by the
continual apprehensions of death  i discovered my admiration that i
had not observed any of these illustrious persons at court the black
spot on the forehead being so remarkable a distinction that i could not
have easily overlooked it and it was impossible that his majesty a most
judicious prince should not provide himself with a good number of such
wise and able counsellors  yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend
sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court
and we often find by experience that young men are too opinionated and
volatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors  however
since the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person i was
resolved upon the very first occasion to deliver my opinion to him on
this matter freely and at large by the help of my interpreter and
whether he would please to take my advice or not yet in one thing i was
determined that his majesty having frequently offered me an
establishment in this country i would with great thankfulness accept
the favour and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior
beings the struldbrugs if they would please to admit me

the gentleman to whom i addressed my discourse because as i have
already observed he spoke the language of balnibarbi said to me with a
sort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant that he
was glad of any occasion to keep me among them and desired my permission
to explain to the company what i had spoke  he did so and they talked
together for some time in their own language whereof i understood not a
syllable neither could i observe by their countenances what impression
my discourse had made on them  after a short silence the same person
told me that his friends and mine so he thought fit to express
himself were very much pleased with the judicious remarks i had made on
the great happiness and advantages of immortal life and they were
desirous to know in a particular manner what scheme of living i should
have formed to myself if it had fallen to my lot to have been born a
struldbrug

i answered it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a
subject especially to me who had been often apt to amuse myself with
visions of what i should do if i were a king a general or a great
lord and upon this very case i had frequently run over the whole system
how i should employ myself and pass the time if i were sure to live for
ever

that if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a
struldbrug as soon as i could discover my own happiness by
understanding the difference between life and death i would first
resolve by all arts and methods whatsoever to procure myself riches
in the pursuit of which by thrift and management i might reasonably
expect in about two hundred years to be the wealthiest man in the
kingdom  in the second place i would from my earliest youth apply
myself to the study of arts and sciences by which i should arrive in
time to excel all others in learning  lastly i would carefully record
every action and event of consequence that happened in the public
impartially draw the characters of the several successions of princes and
great ministers of state with my own observations on every point  i
would exactly set down the several changes in customs language fashions
of dress diet and diversions  by all which acquirements i should be a
living treasure of knowledge and wisdom and certainly become the oracle
of the nation

i would never marry after threescore but live in a hospitable manner
yet still on the saving side  i would entertain myself in forming and
directing the minds of hopeful young men by convincing them from my own
remembrance experience and observation fortified by numerous examples
of the usefulness of virtue in public and private life  but my choice
and constant companions should be a set of my own immortal brotherhood
among whom i would elect a dozen from the most ancient down to my own
contemporaries  where any of these wanted fortunes i would provide them
with convenient lodges round my own estate and have some of them always
at my table only mingling a few of the most valuable among you mortals
whom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance
and treat your posterity after the same manner just as a man diverts
himself with the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his garden
without regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding year

these struldbrugs and i would mutually communicate our observations
and memorials through the course of time remark the several gradations
by which corruption steals into the world and oppose it in every step
by giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind which added to
the strong influence of our own example would probably prevent that
continual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained of in all ages

add to this the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of states
and empires the changes in the lower and upper world ancient cities in
ruins and obscure villages become the seats of kings famous rivers
lessening into shallow brooks the ocean leaving one coast dry and
overwhelming another the discovery of many countries yet unknown
barbarity overrunning the politest nations and the most barbarous become
civilized  i should then see the discovery of the longitude the
perpetual motion the universal medicine and many other great
inventions brought to the utmost perfection

what wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy by outliving and
confirming our own predictions by observing the progress and return of
comets with the changes of motion in the sun moon and stars

i enlarged upon many other topics which the natural desire of endless
life and sublunary happiness could easily furnish me with  when i had
ended and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted as before to
the rest of the company there was a good deal of talk among them in the
language of the country not without some laughter at my expense  at
last the same gentleman who had been my interpreter said he was
desired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes which i had fallen
into through the common imbecility of human nature and upon that
allowance was less answerable for them  that this breed of struldbrugs
was peculiar to their country for there were no such people either in
balnibarbi or japan where he had the honour to be ambassador from his
majesty and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to
believe that the fact was possible and it appeared from my astonishment
when he first mentioned the matter to me that i received it as a thing
wholly new and scarcely to be credited  that in the two kingdoms above
mentioned where during his residence he had conversed very much he
observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind  that
whoever had one foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other as
strongly as he could  that the oldest had still hopes of living one day
longer and looked on death as the greatest evil from which nature
always prompted him to retreat  only in this island of luggnagg the
appetite for living was not so eager from the continual example of the
struldbrugs before their eyes

that the system of living contrived by me was unreasonable and unjust
because it supposed a perpetuity of youth health and vigour which no
man could be so foolish to hope however extravagant he may be in his
wishes  that the question therefore was not whether a man would choose
to be always in the prime of youth attended with prosperity and health
but how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages
which old age brings along with it  for although few men will avow their
desires of being immortal upon such hard conditions yet in the two
kingdoms before mentioned of balnibarbi and japan he observed that
every man desired to put off death some time longer let it approach ever
so late and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly except he
were incited by the extremity of grief or torture  and he appealed to
me whether in those countries i had travelled as well as my own i had
not observed the same general disposition

after this preface he gave me a particular account of the struldbrugs
among them  he said they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty
years old after which by degrees they grew melancholy and dejected
increasing in both till they came to fourscore  this he learned from
their own confession for otherwise there not being above two or three
of that species born in an age they were too few to form a general
observation by  when they came to fourscore years which is reckoned the
extremity of living in this country they had not only all the follies
and infirmities of other old men but many more which arose from the
dreadful prospect of never dying  they were not only opinionative
peevish covetous morose vain talkative but incapable of friendship
and dead to all natural affection which never descended below their
grandchildren  envy and impotent desires are their prevailing passions
but those objects against which their envy seems principally directed
are the vices of the younger sort and the deaths of the old  by
reflecting on the former they find themselves cut off from all
possibility of pleasure and whenever they see a funeral they lament and
repine that others have gone to a harbour of rest to which they
themselves never can hope to arrive  they have no remembrance of
anything but what they learned and observed in their youth and
middleage and even that is very imperfect and for the truth or
particulars of any fact it is safer to depend on common tradition than
upon their best recollections  the least miserable among them appear to
be those who turn to dotage and entirely lose their memories these meet
with more pity and assistance because they want many bad qualities which
abound in others

if a struldbrug happen to marry one of his own kind the marriage is
dissolved of course by the courtesy of the kingdom as soon as the
younger of the two comes to be fourscore for the law thinks it a
reasonable indulgence that those who are condemned without any fault of
their own to a perpetual continuance in the world should not have their
misery doubled by the load of a wife

as soon as they have completed the term of eighty years they are looked
on as dead in law their heirs immediately succeed to their estates only
a small pittance is reserved for their support and the poor ones are
maintained at the public charge  after that period they are held
incapable of any employment of trust or profit they cannot purchase
lands or take leases neither are they allowed to be witnesses in any
cause either civil or criminal not even for the decision of meers and
bounds

at ninety they lose their teeth and hair they have at that age no
distinction of taste but eat and drink whatever they can get without
relish or appetite  the diseases they were subject to still continue
without increasing or diminishing  in talking they forget the common
appellation of things and the names of persons even of those who are
their nearest friends and relations  for the same reason they never can
amuse themselves with reading because their memory will not serve to
carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end and by this
defect they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might
otherwise be capable

the language of this country being always upon the flux the
struldbrugs of one age do not understand those of another neither are
they able after two hundred years to hold any conversation farther
than by a few general words with their neighbours the mortals and thus
they lie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in their own
country

this was the account given me of the struldbrugs as near as i can
remember  i afterwards saw five or six of different ages the youngest
not above two hundred years old who were brought to me at several times
by some of my friends but although they were told that i was a great
traveller and had seen all the world they had not the least curiosity
to ask me a question only desired i would give them slumskudask or
a token of remembrance which is a modest way of begging to avoid the
law that strictly forbids it because they are provided for by the
public although indeed with a very scanty allowance

they are despised and hated by all sorts of people  when one of them is
born it is reckoned ominous and their birth is recorded very
particularly so that you may know their age by consulting the register
which however has not been kept above a thousand years past or at
least has been destroyed by time or public disturbances  but the usual
way of computing how old they are is by asking them what kings or great
persons they can remember and then consulting history for infallibly
the last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they were
fourscore years old

they were the most mortifying sight i ever beheld and the women more
horrible than the men  besides the usual deformities in extreme old age
they acquired an additional ghastliness in proportion to their number of
years which is not to be described and among half a dozen i soon
distinguished which was the eldest although there was not above a
century or two between them

the reader will easily believe that from what i had hear and seen my
keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated  i grew heartily
ashamed of the pleasing visions i had formed and thought no tyrant could
invent a death into which i would not run with pleasure from such a
life  the king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends
upon this occasion and rallied me very pleasantly wishing i could send
a couple of struldbrugs to my own country to arm our people against
the fear of death but this it seems is forbidden by the fundamental
laws of the kingdom or else i should have been well content with the
trouble and expense of transporting them

i could not but agree that the laws of this kingdom relative to the
struldbrugs were founded upon the strongest reasons and such as any
other country would be under the necessity of enacting in the like
circumstances  otherwise as avarice is the necessary consequence of old
age those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole
nation and engross the civil power which for want of abilities to
manage must end in the ruin of the public



chapter xi


the author leaves luggnagg and sails to japan  from thence he returns
in a dutch ship to amsterdam and from amsterdam to england

i thought this account of the struldbrugs might be some entertainment
to the reader because it seems to be a little out of the common way at
least i do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that
has come to my hands and if i am deceived my excuse must be that it is
necessary for travellers who describe the same country very often to
agree in dwelling on the same particulars without deserving the censure
of having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before them

there is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the great
empire of japan and it is very probable that the japanese authors may
have given some account of the struldbrugs but my stay in japan was so
short and i was so entirely a stranger to the language that i was not
qualified to make any inquiries  but i hope the dutch upon this notice
will be curious and able enough to supply my defects

his majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in his
court and finding me absolutely determined to return to my native
country was pleased to give me his license to depart and honoured me
with a letter of recommendation under his own hand to the emperor of
japan  he likewise presented me with four hundred and fortyfour large
pieces of gold this nation delighting in even numbers and a red
diamond which i sold in england for eleven hundred pounds

on the 6th of may 1709 i took a solemn leave of his majesty and all my
friends  this prince was so gracious as to order a guard to conduct me
to glanguenstald which is a royal port to the southwest part of the
island  in six days i found a vessel ready to carry me to japan and
spent fifteen days in the voyage  we landed at a small porttown called
xamoschi situated on the southeast part of japan the town lies on the
western point where there is a narrow strait leading northward into
along arm of the sea upon the northwest part of which yedo the
metropolis stands  at landing i showed the customhouse officers my
letter from the king of luggnagg to his imperial majesty  they knew the
seal perfectly well it was as broad as the palm of my hand  the
impression was a king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth  the
magistrates of the town hearing of my letter received me as a public
minister  they provided me with carriages and servants and bore my
charges to yedo where i was admitted to an audience and delivered my
letter which was opened with great ceremony and explained to the
emperor by an interpreter who then gave me notice by his majestys
order that i should signify my request and whatever it were it
should be granted for the sake of his royal brother of luggnagg  this
interpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with the
hollanders  he soon conjectured by my countenance that i was a
european and therefore repeated his majestys commands in low dutch
which he spoke perfectly well  i answered as i had before determined
that i was a dutch merchant shipwrecked in a very remote country
whence i had travelled by sea and land to luggnagg and then took
shipping for japan where i knew my countrymen often traded and with
some of these i hoped to get an opportunity of returning into europe i
therefore most humbly entreated his royal favour to give order that i
should be conducted in safety to nangasac  to this i added another
petition that for the sake of my patron the king of luggnagg his
majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on
my countrymen of trampling upon the crucifix because i had been thrown
into his kingdom by my misfortunes without any intention of trading
when this latter petition was interpreted to the emperor he seemed a
little surprised and said he believed i was the first of my countrymen
who ever made any scruple in this point and that he began to doubt
whether i was a real hollander or not but rather suspected i must be a
christian  however for the reasons i had offered but chiefly to
gratify the king of luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour he would
comply with the singularity of my humour but the affair must be managed
with dexterity and his officers should be commanded to let me pass as
it were by forgetfulness  for he assured me that if the secret should
be discovered by my countrymen the dutch they would cut my throat in the
voyage  i returned my thanks by the interpreter for so unusual a
favour and some troops being at that time on their march to nangasac
the commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither with
particular instructions about the business of the crucifix

on the 9th day of june 1709 i arrived at nangasac after a very long
and troublesome journey  i soon fell into the company of some dutch
sailors belonging to the amboyna of amsterdam a stout ship of 450 tons
i had lived long in holland pursuing my studies at leyden and i spoke
dutch well  the seamen soon knew whence i came last they were curious
to inquire into my voyages and course of life  i made up a story as
short and probable as i could but concealed the greatest part  i knew
many persons in holland  i was able to invent names for my parents whom
i pretended to be obscure people in the province of gelderland  i would
have given the captain one theodorus vangrult what he pleased to ask
for my voyage to holland but understanding i was a surgeon he was
contented to take half the usual rate on condition that i would serve
him in the way of my calling  before we took shipping i was often asked
by some of the crew whether i had performed the ceremony above
mentioned  i evaded the question by general answers that i had
satisfied the emperor and court in all particulars  however a
malicious rogue of a skipper went to an officer and pointing to me told
him i had not yet trampled on the crucifix but the other who had
received instructions to let me pass gave the rascal twenty strokes on
the shoulders with a bamboo after which i was no more troubled with such
questions

nothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage  we sailed with a fair
wind to the cape of good hope where we staid only to take in fresh
water  on the 10th of april 1710 we arrived safe at amsterdam having
lost only three men by sickness in the voyage and a fourth who fell
from the foremast into the sea not far from the coast of guinea  from
amsterdam i soon after set sail for england in a small vessel belonging
to that city

on the 16th of april we put in at the downs  i landed next morning and
saw once more my native country after an absence of five years and six
months complete  i went straight to redriff where i arrived the same
day at two in the afternoon and found my wife and family in good health
