    "This is the Jupyter Notebook you will use for the rest of this unit. We'll be using it to retrieve information from the Harvard Art Museum API. In working with this notebook, you will learn how to construct and modify queries to get tailored results, as well as a bit about reading API documentation and understanding the data, once you've got it. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you'll need an <b>API key</b>. Every time you submit a query to the Museum's API, you'll need to  validate your request by including this key, which is unique to you. You can sign up for one through the [main page](https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api). Once you fill out the request form, you can expect to receive your key by e-mail in a few seconds. Once you have it, copy it into a document that's readily available. You may want to set up a cheat sheet that you can return to throughout the course for just this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that other APIs may require different kinds of authentication. Sometimes, it can get pretty complicated. If it does, look for documentation on that particular website about how to use it. Thankfully, the Art Museum's API authentication is relatively simple, which makes things easy for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your key, we'll make it a <b>global variable</b>, which you can use throughout this notebook. Let's call it \"APIKEY\"."

Sometimes an API will specify a number of requests/second that you're allowed to make, sometimes not.
