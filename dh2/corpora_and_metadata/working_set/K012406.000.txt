ACT I.
A NAVAL OVERTURE. DUET -- by SALLY and NANCY.
( The Words from an old Lancashire Ballad.) The Music by Dr. Arnold.
WITH arms across, along the Strand
A shepherd walked, and hung his head;
Viewing the footsteps on the sand,
Which a bright nymph had made;
" The tide (says he) will soon erase
" The marks so lightly here impressed;
" But time, or tide, will never deface
" Her image in my breast.
" Am I some savage beast of prey,
" Am I some monster grown,
" That thus she flies so swift away,
" Or meets me with a frown?"
This said, he took a running leap,
A lover's leap indeed!
And plunged into the sounding deep,
Where hungry fishes feed:
The melancholy hern stalks by,
Around the squalling sea-gulls yell;
Aloft the croaking ravens fly,
And toll his passing bell.
II. -- SONG -- NANCY -- French Air.
What the deuce, do you think I Am a fool, pray,
And so plain, I Am not fit to be seen?
Sure I Am pretty enough in my own way,
And, my dear, I am now past fifteen;
Yes fifteen, yes fifteen.
You stun me with scolding! pray, sister, be quiet;
Then you will find me sufficiently tame;
But if you still scold, I can equal your riot,
And from coolness, I Will pass to a flame;
Yes a flame, yes a flame.
III. -- SONG -- SALLY. -- Dr. Arnold.
His presence gives birth
To good humor and mirth;
No pleasure on earth
Such delight can impart.
He Is so jaunty, so neat!
His looks are so sweet,
To the eyes he is a treat,
And a feast to the heart.
IV. -- SONG -- ROSEMARY.
The Music by the Author of the Piece.
When once master Love gets into your head,
You may go to bed, you may go to bed;
When once master Love gets into your head,
You may go to bed for life.
You frown and you smile, you laugh and you cry,
And you cannot tell why, and you cannot tell why:
You frown and you smile, you laugh and you cry,
And you wish you were a wife.
Love makes such a rout within and without,
You tumble and toss, you tumble and toss;
He makes such a rout within and without,
You tumble and toss for life.
Your heart goes pit-pat, you're mum, and you chat,
You cannot tell for what, you cannot tell for what,
Your heart goes pit-pat, you cannot tell for what,
And you wish you were a wife.
V. -- DUET -- SALLY and WILLIAMS.
The Words from Suckling; the Music by Dr. Arnold.
WILLIAMS. If fondly thou do not mistake,
And my defects for graces take;
Persuad'st thyself, that jests are broken,
When little is, or nothing, spoken;
Know this! thou love amiss,
And to love true,
Thou must begin again and love anew.
SALLY. If when thy Sally fills the room,
Thou do not quake, and art struck dumb;
And in striving this to cover,
Do not speak thy words twice over;
Know this! thou love amiss,
And to love true,
Thou must begin again, and love anew.
BOTH. Honest lover, whosoever,
If in all thy love there ever
Was one thought wavering; if thy flame
Was not still even, still the same;
Know this! thou love amiss,
And to love true,
Thou must begin again, and love anew.
VI. -- GLEE. -- Composed Anno Dom. 1614. SALLY, WILLIAMS, and ROSEMARY.
We be three poor mariners, newly come from the seas;
We spend our lives in jeopardy, while others live at ease:
Shall we go dance the round, the round, the round?
And he that is a bully boy, come pledge me on this ground!
We care not for those martial men that do our states disdain,
But we care for those merchantmen that do our states maintain:
To them we dance this round, around, around;
And he that is a bully boy, come pledge me on this ground!
VII. -- SONG -- TOM.
Altered from an old Ballad, -- Come, push the Glass around.
Come push the bowl about!
In that we'll drown all care, my boys;
Come push the bowl about,
Drink deep, and drink it out!
The liquor's sound;
'Twill raise your spirits higher, boys,
To fight, kill, or wound;
May we still be found,
Rejoicing in our fate, my boys,
On sea, or ground!
Chorus. -- The liquor's sound, etc.
II.
Why messmates, why!
Should we be melancholy, boys,
Why messmates, why!
Decreed to live or die?
What flinching? fie!
Damn care, drink on, be jolly, boys,
It Is he, you, or I.
Cold, hot, wet, or dry,
We Are always bound to follow, boys,
And scorn to fly.
Chorus. -- What, flinching? etc
III.
Let fate decide!
I mean not to upbraid ye, boys;
Whatever betide,
No sailor shall complain;
Should next broadside,
Send us to him that made us, boys,
We Are free from pain;
But if we remain,
A bottle and kind landlady
Cure all again.
Chorus. -- Should next broadside, etc.
VIII. -- SONG -- SALLY. -- Giordani.
It Is true I loved Tom Splicem dearly,
And very dearly Tom loved me;
Another since has touched me nearly,
As brave by land as Tom by sea:
I loved him living most sincerely,
But death still leaves the lover free.
IX. -- SONG -- TOM SPLICEM. French Air.
God of war, god of war!
Honor now summons to battle;
God of war, bear me far,
To the loud cannon's rattle!
I court no new desire;
Love, I contemn thy fire;
War's alarm can only charm,
And all my soul inspire.
X. -- SONG -- NANCY. La Lumiere.
When first you took me on your knee,
And told the wonders of the sea,
How waves on waves for ever roll,
And toss the ship from pole to pole;
How winds from every corner blow,
Now raise her high, now sink her low;
My heart kept beating at the tale,
And with my sighs I swelled your sail.
II.
But when, with all a sailor's pride,
You spoke of fleets drawn side by side;
Of French and English, ten to one,
Deck threatening deck, gun fired at gun!
My heart admired the gallant strife,
But throbb'd and trembled for your life;
And 'midst the fancied cannon's roar,
I wished Tom Splicem safe on shore.
XI. -- FINALE. -- NANCY.
The Music by the Author of the Piece.
Be gay, be gay, be gay!
It Is Friendship leads the way,
And gives you all a welcome here:
Her call obey,
Come haste away,
Her balmy smile dispels each care.
CHORUS. Away, away, O haste away;
Away, away, O haste away,
For time and tide for no man stay.
ROSEMARY. Away, away, away;
Make this a holiday;
My liquors like your hearts are sound:
Then sing and drink,
And never think
Grief can exist while the toast goes round.
CHORUS. Away, away, etc. etc.
SALLY. Be gay, be gay, be gay!
Each month it is not May,
The lily and the rose will fade:
Love while you're young,
Nor trust that tongue
Who would our youth from joys dissuade.
CHORUS. Away, away, away, etc. etc.
ACT II.
XII. -- SONG -- ROSEMARY. -- Dr. Arnold.
WHEN I gayly fill the cheerful glass,
I care not if the world goes down;
Hob or nob! let the bottle pass,
Social mirth our bumpers crown.
Chorus. Hob or Nob, etc.
Oh! the wisest man is but an ass
Who on convivial joys can frown;
Hob or nob! let the bottle pass,
Social mirth our bumpers crown.
Hob or Nob, etc.
The bewitching smile of a roguish lass
In this small bowl we can quickly drown;
Hob or nob! let the bottle pass,
Social mirth our bumpers crown.
Hob or Nob, etc.
XIII. -- SONG -- TOM -- Vauxhall Watch.
My name's Tom Splicem, I Will be bound,
A man, a boy, upon this ground
I Have gone the world around, around,
Crying, hip, hallo!
II.
When the Dons and Frenchmen come in sight,
O! then my heart it pants for fight,
And if they do not take their flight,
O! we'd trounce them so!
III.
But if like rips they will not stay,
We wait to fight another day;
Another comes, they run away,
So hip, hallo!
XIV. -- SONG, -- SALLY. -- Dr. Arnold.
The bark that holds our treasure,
When at a distance seen,
Fear mingles with our pleasure,
For danger lies between!
II.
But prosperous gales uprising
To waft her to the shore,
With double joy surprising
Confirm the danger over.
XV. -- SONG -- TOM. -- Admiral Benbow.
What sailor is anxious, great treasures to hoard?
No losses he minds while there is courage on board;
What though I am stranded, my fortune a wreck!
While two planks hold together, I Will still keep the deck.
II.
My heart's splic'd with many, and many a rope,
And still do I rest on the anchor of hope;
Again I Am afloat, should a fair wind befriend,
Or I go to the bottom, and so there is an end.
XVI. -- SONG -- NANCY. -- Dr. Arnold.
Take this, my gallant sailor,
From a young but faithful maid!
The powers of wealth may fail her,
But her friendship never can fade.
If you fly her, or deny her,
You will tear her heart in twain;
Then, oh! bless her! nor distress her,
Lest she never know peace again.
FINALE. Dr. Arnold. XVII. -- TOM SPLICEM.
Now fickle Goddess, do thy worst!
Fortune, I defy thee;
No longer I for glory thirst,
Far hence, Goddess, hie thee!
Hie thee to the briny wave,
To the tars that court thee;
Their country and their honor save,
Wealth and love support thee!
Chorus. Hie thee, etc.
WILLIAMS. If love is called a pleasure,
If every heart it warms,
If friendship is a treasure,
We brave approaching storms.
We each perform our duty,
To earn the smile from beauty,
While learning nods applause:
The story well may suit ye,
That pleads an honest cause.
Chorus. The story, etc.
SALLY. I Have run some risks this night, it is true,
I Have lost one honest lover;
Know, ladies all, the girls are few,
Who could the loss recover.
But honest Williams looked so kind,
So well he told his story,
You cannot blame a fickle mind
Which crowns the brave with glory.
CHORUS. But honest Williams, etc.
ROSEMARY. It Is wondrous strange, young fellows change
From one thing to another;
From love to war they cheerful range,
A plaguey foolish pother!
I Will fill a bowl, a swinging bowl,
A bowl as big as twenty,
In which I Will drown each critic's frown,
Nor fear the cognoscenti.
CHORUS. I Will fill a bowl, etc.
