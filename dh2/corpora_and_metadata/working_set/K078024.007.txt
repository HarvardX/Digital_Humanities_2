THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BRITISH INSECTS.
PLATE CCXVII. PAPILIO HIPPOTHOE. GREAT COPPER BUTTERFLY. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed. Wings erect when at rest. Fly by day.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings entire, margin white. Underside ash
color, with numerous black eye-shaped spots.

Papilio Hippothoe is the largest and rarest of that kind of Butterflies called
Coppers, by English collectors of Insects. We have not heard that it has been
taken in this country for some years past: our specimens were met with in
Scotland.

The female is larger than the male; it has also a greater number of black
spots on the wings.


PLATE CCXVIII.
FIG. I. CIMEX GONYMELAS. BLACK-KNEE FIELD BUG. HEMIPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Rostrum inflected. Antennae longer than the thorax. Back
flat. Thorax margined.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Brown. Abdomen red. Antennae annulated with black. Knees
of the same color.

We consider this as a nondescript Insect. It was taken at Darent Wood, Kent,
early in May.

FIG. II. CIMEX HAEMORRHOIDALIS. HEMIPTERA. CIMEX.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Greenish. Spines of the Thorax obtuse.
Breast-piece terminate in a long spine. Antennae black.

CIMEX HAEMORRHOIDALIS: thorace obtuse, spinoso subvirescens, antennis nigris,
sterno porrecto. Linn. Syst. Not. -- Fn. Sv. -- Fab. Ent. Syst. 4. p. 98. 76.
This Insect was found at the same time and place as the preceding species. It
is the most elegantly colored creature of its tribe we have hitherto found.
Cimex Luridus is more beautiful in the larva, but not in the winged state.


PLATE CCXIX. PHALAENA PRODROMARIA. OAK-BEAUTY MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae setaceous. Wings in general deflexed, when at
rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae feathered. Wings white, speckled
with numerous black spots. Two irregular, and nearly transverse bars of dark
brown, on the upper wings.

PHALAENA PRODROMARIA, pectinicornis alis albis nigro punctatis: fasciis duabus
latis fuscis. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 1. 159. 105. Phalaena Prodromaria. Wien.
Verz. 99. 1.
The larva of this Moth, like others of the geometrae, raises itself when
walking, into the form of an arch or loop: it is of an obscure gray and brown
color, faintly mottled: the head is red. This larva is seldom taken, and when
taken, is reared to the fly state with the utmost difficulty. It seems a local
species; for we have never heard that it has been found, except on the Oak
trees It feeds also on Lime trees.
in Richmond Park. It feeds on the highest branches of the trees, but descends
into the earth to become a pupa. It appears in the fly state in March.

The male Insect is considerably smaller than the female. Its horns, or
antennae, are also larger, and more feathered. This is a scarce Insect. It is
found in Germany; and a variety of it has been received from North America.


PLATE CCXX. PHRYGANEA RHOMBICA. SPRING FLY. NEUROPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Mouth furnished with four palpi. Antennae longer than the
Thorax. First Wings lay horizontally on the body. Under Wings folded, and
concealed beneath.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings greyish brown. First pair marked with
rhombic whitish spots.

Schaeff. Icon. tab. 99. fig. 5. 6.

The Phryganea undergo their transformations in the water: in the larva state
they are taken by the fishermen for bait; and, in some parts of Holland, are
found so abundant, that they are used as a cheap manure for the land. In the
larva state, they generally form a sort of covering, or tube, for their
defenseless bodies. It is open only at one end, at which its head and fore legs
are protruded, to take its prey. Some species form these coverings of weeds and
small shells, gravel, sand, etc. That of our present species, is composed of
little pieces of the stalks of grass, cut into an even form, and laid
transversely on each other. It attaches this tube to the roots of some aquatic
plants, and undergoes its transformations in it. In the annexed plate, we have
represented the larva taken from the tube, and the pupa having the tube opened
to exhibit its situation therein.

The Fly is very common about ponds, rivers, and marshy places.


PLATE CCXXI. PHALAENA MYRTILLI. SCARCE BROAD BORDER YELLOW UNDERWING MOTH.
LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Wings deflexed, brown,
spotted with white. Anterior wings yellow, with a deep black border.

luteis, fascia lata submarginali nigra. Lin. Syst. Not. -- Fab. Ent. Syst. T.
3. p. 2. 126. 379.
A small Insect, but of singular beauty; it feeds on the whortle berry and sloe.

This species has been taken by Mr. Crow, of Faversham. The only specimen we
ever met with, was found in the caterpillar state, in Kent, in the month of
May. The Fly came forth in June.


PLATE CCXXII.
FIG. I. CARABUS VIOLACEUS. COLEOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae setaceous. Thorax somewhat heart shaped, margined.
Elytra margined also.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Apterous, black. Margin of the Thorax and
Wing cases, glossy violet. Edges smooth.

CARABUS VIOLACEUS apterus niger thorace elytrorumque marginibus violaceis,
elytris laevibus. -- Fab. Ent. Syst. 1. 19. 125. Carabus Violaceus. Paykull
Monogr. 12. 4. Frisch Ins. 13. tab. 23.

The larva of some Carabi live in the ground, others in decayed wood. They prey
on the smaller kinds of Insects. Fabricius describes one hundred and
ninety-five species; a considerable number of these are natives of Europe.
Carabus Violaceus is found in fields.

FIG. II. CARABUS GEMMATUS. COLEOPTERA. CARABUS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Apterous, black. Wing cases marked with
striae; and three rows of indented double spots, bronzed.

6.
This species has commonly been mistaken for Carabus hortensis: the difference,
however, between the two Insects, is considerable. The color of the Beetle is
black; but when not damaged, is entirely covered with a rich bronze, partaking
of a green and golden hue on the wing cases, and a fine purple on the thorax:
the underside is plain black.

FIG. III. CARABUS GRANULATUS. COLEOPTERA. CARABUS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Apterous, black, bronzed. Wing cases
striated; three rows of elevated, or convexed-oblong spots, with an
intermediate elevated line on each.

Some authors say, this species is very common in the fields near London. It is
often found in Battersea meadows; and we have not found it elsewhere.


PLATE CCXXIII.
FIG. I. PHALAENA DERASA. BUFF ARCHES MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Crested. Wings deflexed. Anterior pair buff
color, with small arched markings.

A rare species, is found in the Fly state early in August.

The larva of this phalaena is unknown to us, and has neither been figured or
described in any of the entomological works recently published. The notes of
Harris are not altogether satisfactory; he mentions the time of its changing
from the caterpillar to the pupa, but has given no figure or description of
either. The entomologists of Germany, where the phalaena is not scarce, seem
unacquainted with its metamorphosis. Fabricius, the latest writer on the
subject, has not described it.

FIG. II. PHALAENA TRAGOPOGINIS. GOAT'S-BEARD MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA. PHALAENA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Anterior wings flark brown, with three black
points or spots in the center, posterior pair livid.

Found on the Goat's beard, Spinach, and Docks. -- Our specimen was taken in
June.

FIG. III. PHALAENA LICHENES. LIVER-WORT MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA. PHALAENA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Anterior wings green, with
black marks. Posterior pair brown. Underside brown.

NOCTUA LICHENES: cristata, alis deflexis: anticis viridibus, maculis variis

Ent. Syst. 3. p. 2. p. 104. 312. Noctua glandifera. Wien. Verz. 70. 2.
We have found this species against walls on which the Lichen fusco-ater was
growing. The larva is supposed to feed on plants of that genus. One specimen
was found in October, another early in the spring, from which we conclude there
must be two broods of them in the year.


PLATE CCXXIV. PHALAENA NUPTA. RED UNDERWING MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Anterior wings greyish,
varied with brown. Posterior pair red, with two broad black waves across.
Abdomen hoary above, white beneath.

PHALAENA NUPTA cristata alis planis cinerascentibus: posticis rubris; fasciis
nigris, abdomine cano subtus albo. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 841. 119. Wilks pap. 33.
tab. 1. a. 1. Roes. Ins. 1. phal. 2. tab. 15.

The larva of the Red Underwing Moth seeds on the willow: it is found in that
state in June and July. The Fly appears in August, after having remained in the
pupa state about twenty-one days.

Collectors of English Insects enumerate near twenty species of Phalaena under
the trivial distinctions of yellow underwing, copper underwing, orange
underwing, pink underwing, etc. etc. Among these the most conspicuous both for
beauty and magnitude, are the red underwing, and crimson underwing. The first
is by no means uncommon in the winged state. The latter is very rare, or at
least a local species: it is found in the larva state on the tops of the
highest oaks in Richmond Park, and was formerly found in similar situations in
Burnt Wood, Essex. We are not informed that it has been taken in any other part
of this kingdom.

These two species have been confounded with a third sort that is found in some
parts of Europe, but does not, we have every reason to conclude, inhabit this
country. This is the Noctua Pacta of Linnaeus and Fabricius. Linnaeus himself,
in the first editions of the Systema Natura, considered the Red Underwing Moth,
figured by Roesel, tab. 15, as the Phalaena Pacta, and adds it in his Synonyms;
but it appears corrected in the later editions Corrected after 1759.
.

After that time, Harris, in his Aurelian, and other works, called the Red
Underwing Phalaena Pacta, and the Crimson Underwing Phalaena Nupta. And Dr.
Berkenhout, following Harris, or inattentive to the express language of the
author he translated, has made the same error in his Synopsis of the Natural
History of Great Britain Not corrected in the last edition.
. Indeed, it may be doubted, whether any later English work on Insects has
detected the error; for, examining a little tract of Mr. Matthew Martin, of the
Bath Society, published in 1785, we find the Red Underwing called therein
Phalaena Pacta.

To place our remarks in a clear point of view, we need only quote the
descriptions of Linnaeus: -- "NOCTUA PACTA Cristata alis grisescentibus
subundatis: posticis rubris; fasciis du^b^s nigris. Abdomine supra rubro." And
again in the general description: "Abdomen supra roseum." Without adverting to
the other characteristic marks, this proves that the Linnaean species of Pacta
cannot be the same with that of the authors before quoted, because in their
species the upper part of the abdomen is hoary, inclining to brown, and not red
Berkenhout says the abdomen is reddish above; but by this he only increases the
mistake; for his species agrees in every other respect with the Willow Moth, on
which plant he also says it is ^ound. Page 140. Vol. 1.
. Their Phalaena Pacta can be no other than the Phalaena Nupta of Linnaeus and
Fabricius; the precise species represented in our plate; of which Linnaeus and
Fabricius say: "Habitat in Europae Sallce Vitellina;" and of the Phalaena Pacta
and Sponsa, "Habitat in Europae Quercu." The first lives on willows, the two
others on oaks.

We close our remarks with observing, that the above quoted English authors
have been no less mistaken as to Phalaena Nupta, which they have made the
Crimson Underwing Moth. We have before expressed our doubt whether Phalaena
Pacta has ever been found in this country; -- we add, that the Insect, known to
English collectors by the trivial name of Crimson Underwing, is the Phalaena
Sponsa of Linnaeus and Fabricius Vide Entomologia Systematica. Vol. 111. p. 2.
p. 53. 147.
, and consequently not connected in the least with Phalaena Nupta.

The readers of the works of Harris, Berkenhout, etc. are requested to read For
Phalaena Nupta, Phalaena Sponsa, Crimson Underwing Moth. For Phalaena Pacta,
Phalaena Nupta, Willow Red Underwing Moth.
And finally, remove Phalaena Pacta from the list of British species, till it
is proved to be a native of this country.


PLATE CCXXV. SIREX SPECTRUM. BLACK-BODIED TAILED WASP. HYMENOPTERA.
Wings four, membraneous in general. Tail of the females armed with a sting.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Mouth armed with strong jaws. Palpi two, truncated.
Antennae filiform, containing upwards of twenty-four articulations. Sting
projected, strong, and serrated.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Abdomen black. Thorax rather hairy, a yellow
stripe on each side, next the base of the wing.

Schaeff. Icon. tab. 4. fig. 9. 10.
This species bears much resemblance to some Insects of the Ichneumon genus. We
have found it among the leaves of the Horseradish in June.

All the sirices are rare in England. Sirex spectrum is an active and vigorous
creature, and which cannot be taken without danger of its stinging. The sting
is small, and fine as a needle, but formed of such hard or horny substance,
that it will pierce the finger to the bone.


PLATE CCXXVI. VESPA VULGARIS. COMMON WASP. HYMENOPTERA.
Wings 4, membranous in general. Tail of the female armed with a sting.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Mouth armed with jaws. The sting sharp-pointed and
concealed within the abdomen. Body smooth, without hair. The upper wings folded.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. A yellow line on each side of the thorax:
four yellow spots on the scutellum, a black belt, and two black spots on each
segment of the abdomen.

Most kinds of Wasps live in societies; and, like the bees, construct combs, in
which they deposit their eggs, and rear their young. Some species are solitary,
and each individual forms a nest for itself.

The common Wasp lives in societies: they collect the juices of fruits,
insects, etc. and make honey, but it is inferior to that of bees. The
metamorphosis of the wasps and bees are similar.


PLATE CCXXVII. PHALAENA MONACHA. BLACK ARCHES MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings deflexed, white, with black arches.
Abdomen red.

PHALAENA MONACHA: alis deflexis albis atro undatis, abdominis incisuris

Icon. tab. 68. fig. 2, 3.

We have in few instances been able to present a species of Phalaena, with all
its metamorphosis, more deserving attention than the Black Arches Moth. It is
uncommonly rare in the winged state, and its larva and pupa is, we presume,
unknown to the English Entomologists at this time. We imagine Harris met with,
and bred this Insect, though he has not figured it: he says it fed on the Oak,
that it changed into chrysalis June 9th, and appeared in the winged state July
9th, which is very near the time of our specimen changing.

The larva is rather a general feeder; for though Harris mentions only Oak, we
found that it would not refuse the leaves of fruit trees, such as Apples,
Pears, etc.; it seeds also on the Willow and Sallow. The female is larger than
the male, and has antennae like bristles.


PLATE CCXXVIII. SPHINX CONVOLVULI. BIND-WEED HAWK MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thickest in the middle. Wings, when at rest,
deflexed. Fly slow, morning and evening only.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings entire, clouded. Posterior pair marked
with zigzag transverse bands. Abdomen belted with alternate marks of red, black
and white.

This is the largest of the Hawk Moths that inhabits Great Britain, except
Sphinx ligustri and Sphinx Atropos. It is rarely taken in this country; the
curious in English Insects have them from Germany, where they are more common
than with us.

A beautiful variety of this Insect is found in North America: the wings are
more richly varied with different shades of bright browns than the European
kind; the posterior wings are of a fine rose-colour. It has all the
characteristic marks of Sphinx Convolvuli, or we should hesitate to admit it as
the same species. We received it from Mr. Abbot, in whose folio work it is also
figured; he found it on the Wild Vine. Mr. Drury had the same variety sent to
him from St. Christopher's.


PLATE CCXXIX. THE LARVA AND PUPA OF SPHINX CONVOLVULI, OR BIND WEED HAWK MOTH.
After much research, we have not been so fortunate as to meet with the Larva
of this rare Insect; nor can we learn that it has been taken by any Collector
of English Insects for many years. In the winged state one Specimen was said to
be taken in the fields near Hoxton about two years ago.

To perfect the History of this species, we have copied the Figures of the
Caterpillar and Pupa, from No 7, Der Nacht-Voegel, etc. etc. of Roesel's
Insecten Bellustigung, Vol. I.

Our readers will observe that the Fly produced from the Caterpillars
represented by Roesel is nearly one-third larger than the specimens supposed to
be bred in England; the Caterpillars must therefore be larger in the same
proportion in the specimens found in Germany. -- The Caterpillars are of two
colors, one green with stripes of yellow and spots of black; The other dull
brown with ochre colored stripes, and sides of the same. The Caterpillar
figured by Abbot has a rose-coloured band on the side.

FIG. II. PHALAENA LUCIPARA. SCARCE ANGLE SHADES MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA. PHALAENA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Crested. Wings deflexed, greyish, with
angular dark marks. An angular light colored space on the exterior part of the
Wing, and a pale band across the middle of each.

The common Angle-shades Moth, (Phalaena Meticulosa) is figured in a former
part of this Work. Phalaena Lucipara is an Insect nearly allied to it, but is
far more scarce; we have only met with the Specimen figured in the annexed
Plate. -- The Larva is supposed to feed on the internal substance of Willows.
The Fly has also been observed among those trees.


PLATE CCXXXI.
FIG. I. I. ATTELABUS APIARIUS. COLEOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thickest toward the apex. Head protruded, broad,

Only a few species of this genus have been discovered in this country; and
neither of those are very common. We apprehend Attelabus Formicarius is rare,
having only met with one specimen of it. It was found in May, on a sand-bank,

A very common and destructive creature. It insinuates itself into all kinds of
fur, or the dried skins of animals; and in the state of larva, injures them
considerably. The larvae of this tribe of Insects are numerous where they are
suffered to breed: they enter into and destroy furniture, clothing, and even
food. Some species are found upon the careases of animals; while others, more
tenacious of life, penetrate harder substances, and resist the camphor,
verdigrease, musk, arsenic, and other drying or corroding substances, that
prevent the depredations of most Insects. One or two species are in particular
much to be dreaded by Collectors of Natural Curiosities: they perforate the
cabinet, or case, and when the larva is hatched, effect their destruction. In
collections of animals, birds, insects, and plants, they do great mischief.

Phalaena Quercifolia is a rare and interesting Insect, and is the largest of
the English bombyces, if we follow the arrangement of the Entomologia
Systematica of Fabricius, and remove the Linnaean Bombyx Cossus Goat Moth.
to a new genus Cossus ligniperda. -- Fab.
.

The trivial name Lappet Moth has been given to this species by some early
Collectors of English Insects, because they observed, when the creature was at
rest, and the wings expanded in a natural position, the anterior part of the
second pair lapped over the first, instead of the first pair laying on the
second, as in many other species of Phalaena. This appearance is very striking,
but not peculiar to Phalaena Quercifolia. Bombyces, with similar reversed
wings, are numerous, and several of them natives of this country; as Phal.
Quercus, and Potatoria.

In a former volume we have given The Pine Lappet Moth; an Insect that is
extremely uncommon in Great Britain; that, with the present species, are the
only two British Phalaena called Lappet Moths; another Insect, closely allied
to P. Quercifolia, and supposed to be the Phal. Populifolia, is said to be an
English Insect, but on what authority, we are not informed. The very different
appearances of the larva of Phal. Quercifolia in different stages of its
growth, may possibly have caused some mistake; for in one skin they are brown,
with whitish marks; in another greyish, with dark brown marks; and when of a
full size, are more inclined to brown and gray in some specimens than in
others. Notwithstanding, however, the variation of colors, in all its changes,
we find that the two oval blue marks on the second and third segment of the
body are constant, and sufficient to determine the species. The larva of Bombyx
Populifolia is very similar to that of B. Quercifolia, when young, if we may
judge by the only figure of it extant, but the mark across the second segment
is narrow and black; that on the third segment broader, with two semi-lunated
red spots. -- Vide Kleeman's Beytraege, etc. Vol. 3. tab. 14.

The larva of P. Quercifolia we have taken in Darent Wood, Kent, on the grass;
it feeds also on Willow, Blackthorn, and Whitethorn. At the end of April, or
not later than May, it forms a large and loose spinning interwoven with its
hairs, of black, reddish, and gray colors. The pupa is black, but appears
perfectly white, being covered with a fine white pollen, or powder; each
segment is encircled by a belt, of a red color. In July and August it is found
in the Fly state.

Fabricius describes the larva of this rare Moth: -- It is ash-colored, with a
black collar or mark on the neck: feet reddish brown, and the back spotted with
the same color.

The trivial English name, Phoenix Moth, has been given to this Insect from a
circumstance little known, and scarcely deserving notice, except as it proves
the impropriety of naming Insects from local circumstances, when any other can
be well applied. A small part of a wood near London had been cut down, and a
quantity of charcoal made on the spot. This place had been often visited by
Aurelians, but the Phalaena Prunaria had never been discovered there, nor
indeed was then known as a British Insect. On the following year, when the
ground was cleared, and the underwood grown up, this Moth was found, it
continued to be taken constantly in the months of June and July for many years,
in this place, and then totally disappeared. The late Mr. Bentley, known as a
collector of English Insects, discovered a breeding-place of this Moth on
Epping Forest, and commonly found three or four specimens every season. We are
not certain that it has been found in any other part of the kingdom. It feeds
on the thorn, plumb and current.

Very uncommon in this country. The larva has been found on the Willow, but
unless taken when ready to become a pupa, it is impossible to rear it to the
winged state. We are little acquainted with the peculiar habits of these
Insects, and cannot therefore feed them in a proper manner.

Most of the Tenthredines enshroud themselves in a network covering, and
remain in the earth till the Fly burst forth; others fasten the web against the
branches of trees, or on the trunk near the earth. The habits of Tenthredo
lutea are very similar to those of T. Vitellinae; the winged Insect appears in
June.

The natural size of this Insect is given at Fig. I. in the annexed plate. It
is far inferior in beauty to either Chrysis ignita or bidentata, figured in the

figure of this species. It is very abundant on all k^nds of fruit trees in the
summer.

FIG. I. I. PAPILIO HYALE. CLOUDED YELLOW BUTTERFLY. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed. Wings erect when at rest. Fly by day.

the same.

PAPILIO HYALE: alis rotundatis flavis: posticis macula fulva; subtus puncto
sesquialtero argentes. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 764. 100.
Though we cannot but admire the Linnaean definitions, for their perspicuity in
general; we must in some instances blame him for that inattention which has
betrayed succeeding naturalists into errors, and even absurdities. The force of
this remark, however harsh it may appear, will apply in a particular degree to
the specific definition and quoted Synonyms of Papilio Hyale, and consequently
to two other similar species involved in the same error.

Linnaeus gave the description of Papilio Hyale, as above quoted in the Systema
Natura, from an insect in his own cabinet, and quotes, in the Synonyms, the
Butterfly figured by Roesel, Vol. 3. tab. 46. fig. 4. 5. The works of that
author being known in every part of Europe, the entomologists of that time
received the figure as that of the true Hyale; and relying on the accuracy of
the Linnaean references, the mistake has been overlooked to the present period.
Fabricius, who is the latest systematic writer on this science, quotes the
figures in Roesel, as Linnaeus had himself in the first instance; and he also
refers to figures of the same insect in the works of Cramer and Schaeffer. An
error of such specious appearance could only be detected by a reference to the
specimen in the Linnaean Cabinet, at this time in the possession of Dr. Smith,
and by this it appears that every author has mistaken the species of Linnaeus,
and that Linnaeus was himself mistaken in supposing the insect described was
the same as that figured by Roesel, and to which he refers: that the Linnaean
Papilio Hyale is what later authors have considered Papilio Palaeno, and that
the true Papilio Palaeno is not a British species.

These errors are so complicated that we must examine the characters assigned
to each species with the utmost attention, and we shall then find his
descriptions correct, but the synonyms erroneous. Papilio Hyale is described
with yellow wings; the color of the wings in the supposed Hyale is not of that
kind which Linnaeus would have called yellow, (flavis,) but fulvis, being of a
deep orange color, much inclining to red. Either of these expressions will
certainly admit of great latitude, but we must not therefore confound one with
the other. The two silver spots are not constant, though it forms a part of the
specific character; we have seen in both the clouded yellow and clouded orange
butterflies, sometimes only one spot, though in general it has two. On the
whole, the Linnaean description of Papilio Hyale seems to agree with the
fictitious P. Palaeno of our collections, and the specimen in the Linnaean
cabinet places it beyond conjecture.

Fabricius has not attended to the errors of former authors on this subject;
even in his last work, Syst. Ent. he adds to the specific description of his P.
Hyale, Mas margin alarm nigro immaculato, foemina maculato The wings in the
males have a broad black bar on the exterior margin; in the female the bars are
spotted.
, by this it is evident he alludes to the clouded orange, for it is not so in
the Linnaean insect; the broad bar of black being constantly spotted in both
sexes. We have also observed that the rare variety with white wings is only the
female; that which is yellow is the male: the same is observed also of Papilio
Rhamni, or Brimstone Butterfly; and as the males of all insects are more
abundant than the females, and the males of P. Hyale are rare, the variety, or
sex with white wings must be extremely so. These have been taken in a clover
field in the month of August, in company with the clouded orange.

It may be proper to close this description with a few observations on the true
Papilio Palaeno, as the subject before us has hitherto passed under that name.
Linnaeus says, alis integerrimis flavis apice nigris margineque fulvis:
posticis subtus puncto argenteo; this does not agree with, or at least express
the Insect generally called Palaeno, and the specimen in the Linnaean cabinet
proves it to be a different species; the P. Palaeno has no yellow spots on the
black margins of the wings, and the spot in the center of the anterior pair is
small and shaped like a shuttle; its native place is unknown. A variety of the
pale clouded yellow is found in America, and by mistake is sometimes placed in
cabinets as a British species.

FIG. II. PAPILIO EDUSA. CLOUDED ORANGE BUTTERFLY. LEPIDOPTERA. PAPILIO.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings entire, fulvous, or orange, with a
black spot and margin of the same color. On the under side greenish; a black
spot on the anterior wings; silver on the posterior wings.

PAPILIO EDUSA: alis integerrimis fulvis: puncto margineque nigris, subtus
virescentibus: anticis puncto nigro, posticis argenteo. Fab. Ent. Syst. 3. p.
2. 206. 643.
If our observations on the preceding species are satisfactory and conclusive,
the Insect before us must be a distinct species, and not the true P. Hyale, for
which it has ever been received. This involves another interesting
consideration, for Linnaeus must have been acquainted with this species, as he
refers to figures of it in several Authors. It is probable he considered it as
a variety, for it does not appear under another name in any part of his
Writings.

Fabricus has described a new species of butterfly, under the name Edusa, in
his last work Ent. Syst. which seems to agree with our insect, and we are
confirmed in our opinion by Mr. Jones of Chelsea, who assisted Fabricius with
considerable information, and assures us it is certainly the P. Edusa of that
author.

In a former part of this work we have given the male of this insect as P.
Hyale: the annexed figure represents the female, having large yellow spots in
the black border of the wings. Both this and the preceding species are figured
by Esper, in the Papiliones de l'Europe; and by Schaeffer, in the Icones
Rabisbon, etc.

The Swallow Prominent Moth is scarce, the larva is supposed to live under the
bark of willows, but it is more certain that the Moth is seldom found, except
among those trees. In the daytime it has been seen against the trunk of trees,
in the manner represented in the Plate.

We quote the authority of Fabricius with diffidence; his character is
ambiguous; and can only be defined by the very general description he has added
to it.

This is a rare Insect, and has not been described by Linnaeus or Fabricius. It
bears a distant resemblance to Meloe Proscarabaeus; but the singular structure
of the Antennae will alone prove it a distinct species. The Antennae in Meloe
Proscarabaeus are moniliform, or composed of several bead-like articulations,
nearly of the same size: those of this new species are thickest in the middle;
and in one point of view the fourth, fifth, and sixth articulations appear
remarkably large and globular: in another, they seem writhed or distorted, and
very concave; the other joints are as in the former species. -- The whole
Insect has a shining blue gloss: Meloe Proscarabaeus is coal black. It is
smaller, and the Wing-cases nearly cover the Abdomen. In Meloe Proscarabaeus
the wing-cases are only one-third the length of the Abdomen.

In some Cabinets, this Insect is arranged with a new specific name autumnalis;
but as we find it is not a non-descript, we prefer that, under which it has
been already described. In this we not only avoid the confusion arising from a
change of names, but reject one merely local for another expressive of its
specific character.

Our Specimens were found on Epping Forest, in July.

This beautiful Insect is very common in this country, and not less so in every
other part of Europe: it feeds on the poplar and willow in the larva state, and
frequents those trees in the winged state also. About the month of September,
the Larva or Caterpillars are full grown, and change to the Pupa: the Sphinx
appears in May.

PAPILIO CAMILLA: alis dentatis fuscis subconcoloribus albo fasciatis
maculatisque, angulo any rubro. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 781. 187. Roes. 3. tab. 33.
fig. 3. 4.
The White Admirable Butterfly feeds upon the common honey suckle or woodbine,
and is found in the winged state in the months of June and July, in the skirts
of woods; its habit is much the same as that of P. Atalanta, Red Admirable, but
it is by no means so common.

This species has hitherto been deemed the Papilio Camilla of Linnaeus, though
it differs in a slight degree from the descriptions and figures of authors who
describe only German or Swedish specimens of it. In the late editions of the
Systema Naturae, P. Camilla is described with P. Sibilla, a Papilio nearly
allied to it, but which Linnaeus considered as a distinct species; his
description of Camilla expressly saying "angulo any rubro." -- The angulis any,
of P. Sibilla Roesel's figure, vol. 3. tab. 70. has an obscure red band
entirely across the posterior wings. -- Schaeffer's figure has no trace of red
on that part.
, not being of a red color, removes it from the English species.

Fabricius is of a different opinion, and in dissenting from his authority it
is incumbent to state our objections. In the Species insectorum of that author,
the P. Camilla with the Linnaean specific character, is made a variety b of
Sibilla. The synonyms of the two insects are ambiguous, and the references not
more satisfactory. Among others he refers for P. Sibilla, to Drury's Ins. 2.
tab. 16. fig. 1, 2. -- to Roesel Ins. 3. tab. 70. fig. 1, 2, 3, -- and to
Schaeffer 152 Erratum. -- Designed for 153 -- for 152 is the German variety of
Papilio Iris, Purple Emperor Butterfly.
. fig. 1, 2. The two last are perhaps the same species: the first is
unquestionably different. For P. Camilla he refers to Roesel tab. 33. fig. 3,
and this agrees with our specimen, except in the colors of the upper surface
being somewhat paler; so that we may conclude our English Insect is not only
the P. Camilla of Linnaeus but also the b Camilla of Fabricius.

The ultimate opinion of Fabricius is however different, for in the Entomologia
Systematica since published, Camilla and Sibilla stands a dictinct species; and
Camilla is thus described, "alis dentatis atris cocruleo micantibus: fascia
utrinque maculari alba, posticis fubtus basi argentea immaculata." Linn. Syst.
Not. 2. 781. 187. habitat in Austria. Thus P. Camilla will no longer agree with
our insect, nor with that figured by Roesel, plate 33. fig 3. But if we refer
to the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus, we discover another error, for instead of
the above quoted specific character, Linnaeus only says, "Alis dentatis fuscis
subconcoloribus albo fasciatis maculatisque, angulo any rubro." p. 781. 187.
and this is clearly our insect. -- From this the whole of the Fabrician account
is obviously a complicated error of description and synonyms, and without
attempting to investigate it further, we shall speak of both species as they
appear to us.

We consider the Common English Admirable, as the true P. Camilla; and that
Sibilla, and not Camilla is the Austrian species, as we have received it from
that country; it is much darker in the upper surface, and has a row of shining
blue spots all round the wings: the base of the posterior wings, beneath
silvery and without spots, as Fabricius describes his Camilla. Our insect on
the contrary has no row of blue spots on the upper surface, but a red spot at
the inner angle of the posterior wings; the base of the lower wings are also
silvery beneath, but has black spots upon it. They differ in many other
respects: these alone determine them to be two species, and ours to be the
Camilla of Linnaeus.

We have inspected the drawings of Mr. Jones, from which Fabricius describes
most of his Papiliones, and are confirmed in our opinion.

alters it to Vidua. It is not figured by any author unless the Ph. Geom. Glauco
fasciata Gozii, figured in Kleman. T. 1. tab. 40. fig. 4, 5, be the same insect.

Papilio Paphia is an elegant species of the British Papiliones. In size,
color, and general appearance of the upper side it is very similar to Papilio
Agala; in the underside, it is extremely different. Both of these Butterflies
are remarkable for that pecular shining appearance of polished silver with
which a few other of the european Fritillary Butterflies are ornamented; but in
Papilio Agala, this silver is disposed in distinct splashes or spots, while in
Papilio Paphia it appears in transverse streaks. These streaks are finely
softened into the red and olive green of the wings, and produce altogether a
singular and charming effect. It is from the latter circumstance the early
English collectors termed this the silver-wash Fritillary.

The Caterpillar of this butterfly is found on the grass in May. It is of a
plain yellowish brown, with several longitudinal stripes of dark brown; it is
also thickly beset with barbed spines, a quarter of an inch in length, and has
in particular two of a remarkable form on the first annulation next the head.
It remains in the chrysalis twenty or twenty one days; and appears in the
winged state early in June.

FIG. I. II. PHALAENA ATOMARIA. DARK HEATH MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae feathered. Wings entirely yellowish;
with bands of brown, and the whole thickly sprinkled with atoms of the same
color.

PHALAENA ATOMARIA: pectinicornis; alis omnibus lutescentibus fasciis atomisque

isoselata. Scop. carn. 558. female. Phalaena pennata. Scop. carn. 569. male.
The Dark Heath Moth is considered as the Phalaena Atomaria of Linnaeus, in the
Faun. Suec. and Systema Naturae. Fabricius adopts the Linnaean character,
though in the Synonyms it is confounded with another Geometrae, the Hirtaria of
some entomologists. He refers to the Phalaena issoselata and Phalaena pennata
of Scopoli, which are evidently the two sexes of the Dark Heath Moth; but the
Insect figured in Plate XXXIV. Kleman's Ins. is very distinct, and is the P.
Hirtaria before alluded to. We cannot but observe how closely the Linnaean
description will apply in this instance, to two Insects which at first sight
appear so extremely different.

This species is very common on heaths in May. The male is much darker in
color than the female, and has curious pectinated and ciliated antennae, as
Scopoli observes. The female has been mistaken for a distinct species.

FIG. III. PHALAENA CLATHRATA. PALE HEATH MOTH.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae setaceous. Wings entirely yellowish,
with transverse and longitudinal dark lines intersecting each other.

PHALAENA CLATHRATA: seticornis alis omnibus flavescentibus: lineis nigris

Hist. Ins. tab. 23. fig. 2.

This is a rare insect, except in Kent, where Dr. Latham informs us it is more
common than the preceding species. Both sexes are very similar to the female
Dark Heath Moth. The larva is unknown, but is supposed to feed on the Erica,
being always found on these plants in the winged state. These insects have been
called Heath Moths because they live in heaths, chalk-pits, and other barren
places. -- The Moths appear in June.
