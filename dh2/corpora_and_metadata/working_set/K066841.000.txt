THE CONTEMPLATIST: A NIGHT PIECE.
I.
THE nurse of CONTEMPLATION, Night,
Begins her balmy reign;
Advancing, in their varied light,
Her silver-vested train.
II.
It Is strange, the many marshalled stars,
That ride yon sacred round,
Should keep, among their rapid cars,
A silence so profound!
III.
A kind, a philosophic calm,
The cool creation wears!
And what Day drank of dewy balm,
The gentle Night repairs.
IV.
Behind their leafy curtains hid
The feathered race how still!
How quiet, now, the gamesome kid
That gamboll'd round the hill!
V.
The sweets, that bending over their banks,
From sultry Day declined,
Revive in little velvet ranks,
And scent the western wind.
VI.
The Moon, preceded by the breeze
That bade the clouds retire,
Appears, amongst the tufted trees,
A Phoenix-nest on fire.
VII.
But soft -- The golden glow subsides!
Her chariot mounts on high!
And now, in silent pomp she rides,
Pale regent of the sky!
VIII.
Where TIME, upon the withered tree
Has carved the moral chair,
I sit, from busy passions free,
And breath the tempered air.
IX.
The withered tree was once in prime;
Its branches braved the sky!
Thus, at the touch of ruthless TIME
Shall Youth and Vigor die.
X
I Am lifted to the blue expanse:
It glows serenely gay!
Come SCIENCE, by my side, advance,
To search the Milky Way.
XI.
Let us descend -- The daring flight
Fatigues my feeble mind;
And SCIENCE, in the maze of light,
Is impotent, and blind.
XII.
What are those wild, those wandering fires,
That over the moorland ran?
Vapors. How like the vague desires
That cheat the heart of MAN!
XIII.
But there is a friendly guide! -- a flame,
That lambent over its bed,
Enlivens, with a gladsome beam,
The hermits osier shed.
XIV.
Amongst the russet shades of night,
It glances from afar!
And darts along the dusk; so bright,
It seems a silver star!
XV.
In coverts, (where the few frequent)
If VIRTUE deigns to dwell;
It Is thus, the little lamp CONTENT,
Gives luster to her cell.
XVI.
How smooth that rapid river slides,
Progressive to the deep;
The poppies pendent over its sides
Have charmed the waves to sleep.
XVII.
PLEASURE'S intoxicated sons!
Ye indolent! ye gay!
Reflect -- for as the river runs,
Life wings its tractless way.
XVIII.
That branching grove of dusky green,
Conceals the azure sky;
Save, where a starry space between,
Relieves the darkened eye.
XIX.
Old ERROR, thus, with shades impure,
Throws sacred TRUTH behind:
Yet, sometimes, through the deep obscure,
She bursts upon the mind.
XX.
Sleep, and her sister Silence reign --
They lock the Shepherds fold!
But hark -- I hear a lamb complain,
It Is lost upon the would!
XXI.
To savage herds, that hunt for prey,
An unresisting prize!
For having trod a devious way,
The little rambler dies.
XXII.
As luckless, is the virgin's lot
Whom pleasure once misguides,
When hurried from the halcyon cot
Where INNOCENCE presides --
XXIII
The Passions, a relentless train!
To tear the victim run:
She seeks the path of peace in vain,
Is conquered -- and undone.
XXIV.
How bright the little insects blaze,
Where willows shade the way;
As proud, as if their painted rays
Could emulate the Day!
XXV.
It Is thus, the pigmy sons of power
Advance their vain parade!
Thus, glitter in the darkened hour,
And like the glowworms fade!
XXVI.
The soft serenity of night,
Ungentle clouds deform!
The silver host that shone so bright,
Is hid behind a storm!
XXVII.
The angry elements engage!
An oak, (an ivied bower!)
Repells the rough winds noisy rage,
And shields me from the shower.
XXVIII.
The rancour, thus, of rushing fate,
I Have learnt to render vain:
For whilst Integrity's her seat,
The soul will sit serene.
XXIX.
A raven, from some greedy vault
Amidst that cloistered gloom,
Bids me, and it is a solemn thought!
Reflect upon the tomb.
XXX.
The tomb! -- The consecrated dome!
The temple raised to PEACE!
The port, that to its friendly home,
Compells the human race!
XXXI.
Yon village, to the moral mind,
A solemn aspect wears;
Where sleep has lulled the labored hind,
And killed his daily cares:
XXXII.
It Is but the churchyard of the Night;
An emblematic bed!
That offers to the mental sight,
The temporary dead.
XXXIII.
From hence, I Will penetrate, in thought,
The grave's unmeasured deep;
And tutored, hence, be timely taught,
To meet my final sleep.
XXXIV.
It Is peace -- (The little chaos past!)
The gentle moon's restored!
A breeze succeeds the frightful blast,
That through the forest roared!
XXXV.
The nightingale, a welcome guest!
Renews her wonted strains;
And HOPE, (just wandering from my breast)
Her wonted seat regains.
XXXVI.
Yes -- When yon lucid orb is dark,
And darting from on high;
My soul, a more celestial spark,
Shall keep her native sky.
XXXVII.
Fanned by the little lenient breeze,
My limbs refreshment find;
And moral rhapsodies, like these,
Give vigor to my mind.
XXXVIII.
Can the lewd orgies of your nights,
Ye sons of rage, and wine!
Afford, amongst your false delights,
An hour of Peace, like MINE!
FINIS.
