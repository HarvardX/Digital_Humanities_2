ADVERTISEMENT.
THE present work is submitted with the utmost deference to the Reader as a
general and very copious elucidation of all the larger kinds of Shells found in
this country.

At the commencement of this undertaking the Author proposed that the five
volumes of which this work consists should include figures and descriptions of
all the British Shells; so far at least as they could be correctly ascertained.
The amount of these collectively, he was induced to think might be very nearly
appreciated from the several works of Lister, Merret, Petiver, Walker, Pennant,
and Da Costa: from the number of nondescript British Shells that came into his
possession with the original collection of the latter writer, together with
those in his own cabinet independent of them; the whole amount of which was far
from inconsiderable.

In this estimate, which the Author at first conceived would be completely
adequate to every purpose of his design, he afterward perceived himself in
some degree mistaken. During the course of publication he has in various
instances been kindly favored with British Shells not before described:
neither are the acquisitions which he has himself discovered in several remote
parts of the country altogether unworthy of attention. Many of the species thus
obtained were deemed too interesting to be omitted in a work of this nature,
and it was therefore thought advisable to exclude those, which, from their
extreme minuteness, are usually denominated Microscopic Shells, in order to
admit the most important of them. The omission of the more diminutive species,
for the sake of inserting Shells of conspicuous figure, that had not been
before described as English, the Author trusts will rather be considered as an
advantage, than detriment to this work. Nothing of material consequence, either
in the collection of the Author, or the cabinets of his friends, to which he
has access, has been neglected in this selection; and he could not feel himself
completely justified in extending the work beyond the limits originally
prescribed for no other purpose than to introduce the Microscopic Shells.

THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BRITISH SHELLS.
INTRODUCTION. VERMES.
THIS class of Animals was formerly confounded with Insects and Plants: the
Intestina and Mollusca were referred to the first class: the Zoophyta and
Lithophyta to the latter; and some Authors had even classed the testacea, or
Shells, as a branch of Mineralogy, without regarding the Animals inhabiting
them. Linnaeus, in the Systema Naturae, comprehends the whole of these
creatures in the last class of Zoology; and forms their classical character
from their internal structure, as in larger and more perfect animals: COR
uniloculare, inauritum; Sanie frigida, albida, Tentaculatis Vermibus. Heart
furnished with one ventricle, without auricle; sanies cold and whitish, or
colorless. The five orders of the Linnaean class Vermes are thus defined: --

Intestina, simple, naked, destitute of limbs. Mollusca, simple, naked; but not
without limbs. Testacea, animal with a calcareous covering. Lithophyta, animal
composite, affixed to, and fabricate a calcareous base. -- Coral. Zoophyta, a
vegetating stem like a plant; animal composite, and resemble flowers.
Linnaeus has included in the Testacea Order the whole tribe of Shells. In the
generic characters he regards both the Shell and its inhabitant: in the
definition of species, the former only is attended to. There are very strong
arguments against the method of arranging this tribe by the Animals, although
it cannot be denied, that the Shells are only the coverings or habitations, and
should not demand our primary attention Vide DONOVAN'S Instructions for
collecting and preserving Subjects of Natural History. London, 1794.
.

The TESTACEA are Vermes of the soft and simple kind, and are covered with a
calcareous habitation. These are separated into three divisions, according to
the number of valves of which the Shell consists. The first division includes
only three genera, Chiton, Lepas, and Pholas; these are called Multivalves, and
are formed of many valves, or pieces, disposed transversely on each other. The
second division consists of Bivalves, or Shells of two pieces, connected
together with a hinge, or cartilage. The third division is of Univalves, and
have the Shell complete in one piece, as the word implies. The Linnaean genera
are --

FIG. I.I.I.I. OSTREA VARIA. VARIEGATED, OR ONE-EARED SCALLOP.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal a Tethys. Shell bivalve unequal. The hinge without a
tooth, having a small oval cavity.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell almost equally unequal; about thirty
rays, scabrous, imbricated, or beset with transverse scales. One ear It has two
ears, but one is considerably larger than the other.

ONE EARED ESCALLOP. Parvus angustior, aequivalvis, inaequaliter auritus,
strigis echinatis. Da Costa. Tab. 10. fig. 1. 2. 4. 5. 7. 9.


Many beautiful kinds of this species are found on our coasts. Some are of an
uniform, obscure, reddish, or purple color, without any markings: some are
violet, and others bright yellow, or orange. The most elegant kinds are
variegated with different colors, as white, red, purple, and brown. The purple
kind marbled with irregular spots, and waves of white; and the coral red, with
black and white markings, and white on the upper part, are select specimens of
these elegant varieties.

Pennant says, this species is often found in oyster-beds, and dragged up with
them. "It is frequent on most of the shores of England; as in Wales; at
Margate, and Sheerness, in Kent; in Sussex and Dorsetshire; in Devonshire; at
Lelant and Whitsand Bay, etc. in Cornwall; the ostium of the river Aln in
Northumberland, and many other places." Da Costa.

FIG. II. PECTEN OBSOLETUS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Ostrea. Linn.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. One large striated ear, with smooth equal
shells; eight obsolete rays; of a dark purple color. Penn. Br. Zool. No. 66.
tab. 61. fig. 66. PECTEN PARVUS: parvus fuscus longitudinaliter striatus, Da
Costa. Br. Conch. 153. 8.


This is a very rare species; da Costa received his specimen from Cornwall.

The valves are equal and shallow; the shell thin, and semitransparent; the
ears unequal, one being very small. The inside is smooth and brown, with a
pearly gloss. The outside is a dull purplish brown, with numerous fine
longitudinal striae The figure in Pennant's work is represented with transverse
striae; this appears, however, to be an error of the engraver.
, eight or ten of which are more prominent than the rest. These are surely not
the obsolete rays of Pennant, as da Costa imagines; the former author must
allude to the intermediate rays which are depressed and appear worn, as he
describes them.

FIG. I. I. TURBO CIMEX. LATTICED WHELKE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Univalve, spiral, or of a taper form.
Aperture somewhat compressed, orbicular, entire.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell oblong-oval. Striae decussate, or
intersect each other in a spiral direction. TURBO CIMEX, testa oblongo-ovata,
striis decussatis: punctis eminentibus. Lin. Syst. Not. p. 1233. No. 609. Turbo
Cancellatus, Latticed. Turbo minimus albus cancellatim vel decussatim striatus.
Da Costa Br. Conch. 104. 60. tab. 8. fig. 6. 9.


The natural size of this shell is shown at Fig. I. together with its
microscopic appearance. It is a very small species, thick, without gloss. The
striae are elevated, broad, and cross each other so as to form a deep
latticed-work of thick ridges. This species is noted from Cornwall and
Guernsey: it is also found in the Mediterranean.

FIG. II. III. IV. VI. V. TURBO PULLUS. PAINTED WHELKE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Shell univalve, spiral, or of a taper form.
Aperture rather compressed, orbicular, entire.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. TURBO PULLUS. Turbo testa imperforata ovata
laevi, apertura antice diducta. Linn. Syst. Not. p. 1233. No. 610. Turbo

albo et rubro perbelle pictus, da Costa, p. 103. 59. tab. 8. fig. 1. 3.


A minute, but elegant species; it is a very delicate shell, thin and
transparent, smooth and glossy. The varieties are numerous; generally white or
blush-rose color, with the markings crimson or reddish purple, disposed in
zones, spiral circles, transverse streaks, irregular waves, lines, spots, and
specklings. Some are variegated with different shades of brown in a similar
manner.

Fig. II. represents the natural size: Fig. III. a full grown specimen. Fig.
IV. IV. IV. are elegant varieties, as they appear under the microscope. Da
Costa notes this species from the coast of Cornwall, and from Exmouth in
Devonshire.


PLATE III.
FIG. I*. I. I. PATELLA PELLUCIDA. BLUE RAYED LIMPET.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Shell univalve, subconic, without spires.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell entire, gibbous, pellucid, marked with
longitudinal blue rays. PATELLA PELLUCIDA: testa integerrima obovato gibba
pellucida: radiis quatuor caeruleis. Gmelin. Lin. Syst. Not. 3717. 153. Patella

In the young state, this shell is very transparent and horny, the aperture
ovoid, and the margins smooth and level; it has also several longitudinal lines
of bright blue color, which extend from the vertex down the back to the
margin. According to Linnaeus, these should be four in number; some authors say
five, and Borlase mentions nine. The blue color is disposed in spots in some
specimens; in others in lines; and again in some others in short and
interrupted dashes. Linnaeus observes that the bright blue color has not been
found in any Shell except this.

The old shells are very different from the young ones, and have been mistaken
by some Authors for distinct species. The young shell is remarkable for its
pellucidity. The old ones are thicker and larger: the aperture irregular: the
vertex two-thirds of the shell; and the rays of blue, dusky. Fig. I. *
represents the natural size.

The Shell is found on the coast of Cornwall, and on the Dorset coast, near
Weymouth. Martin, Sibbald, and Wallace, received it from the western isles of
Scotland and the Orkneys.

PATELLA FISSURA. SLIT-LIMPET.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal limax. Shell univalve, subconic, without spires.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Oval, striated, reticulated. Vertex recurved,
or bent back. A slit in the anterior part. Patella Fissura: testa ovali

A very singular, but not uncommon shell on some of our coasts, as Cornwall,
Devonshire, Durham and Sussex. In Carnarvonshire and Merionethshire, in Wales,
on the coast of Scotland, and in the Orkneys.


PLATE V. HALIOTIS TUBERCULATA. TUBERCULATED SEA EAR.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal a slug. Shell univalve, dilated, or flat, almost
open a row of orifices its length, spire near one end turned in.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Oblong-oval. Outside furrowed transversely,
rugged, tuberculated. HALIOTIS TUBERCULATA, testa subovata, dorso transversim

Pennant says this species is frequently cast upon the southern coast of
Devonshire. It is common on the eastern coast of Sussex; and on the coast of
the isle of Guernsey. -- It adheres like limpets, to the rocks, when living.


PLATE VI. CARDIUM ACULEATUM. SPIKED COCKLE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Two teeth near the beak; and another remote one on each
side of the shell.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell nearly heart-shaped. Ribs high,
sulcated down the middle, and beset with long canaliculated spines. CARDIUM
ACULEATUM: C. testa subcordata: sulcis convexis linea exaratis: exterius

This is the largest of the Cardium, or Cockle genus, that inhabits any of the
British shores. It is noted by Wallace as a Shell of the Orkneys; and also by
Pennant, who likewise found it off the Hebrides. -- It is a thick shell, with
high radiated ribs, and beset with large processes or spines that are hollowed.
It is covered with a fibrous epidermis, of a blackish color, varied with light
browns; the color beneath is white, with a faint tint of red, or rose color.
-- Marginal circumference ten inches and an half.

This is one of the six rare species Da Costa could not procure for his work,
and to which he alludes in the preface I have described the shells from the
objects themselves, except in six instances, where I could not procure the
originals to complete the series; in which case I have borrowed them from
authors of veracity; and the Reader will find those species distinguished by
Roman characters.

The Lepas Anatifera is found on the coasts of England and Ireland, but more
frequently on that of Scotland. It adheres by means of its branches, or
pedicles, to the bottoms of ships, planks, logs, and other substances floaring
in the water.

This curious marine production consists of many unequal membraneous branches,
or arms, at the ends of which the Shells are disposed in an irregular manner;
the larger clustering with the smaller in groups, and forming bunches of
various sizes. The branches are of a fine red; the Shells of a bluish violet.
The animal within is a triton, and is furnished with many cirrhi, or tentacula,
with which it takes its food. These tentacula are pectinated like feathers, and
hang out of the Shells when open. In the sixteenth century they were, in fact,
supposed to be feathers, and hence arose the whimsical belief that a barnacle
produced a goose^. Nor was this a vulgar opinion only; it was sanctioned by the
grave details of learned naturalists of that time. Vide Anas Albifrons, Plate
102. -- Hist. Brit. Birds.
and particularly by Gerard "What our eyes have seen, and hands have touched,
we shall declare. There is a small island in Lancashire called the Pile of
Foulders, wherein are found the broken pieces of old and bruised ships, some
whereof have been cast thither by shipwrake, and also the trunks and bodies
with the branches of old and rotten trees, cast up there likewise; whereon is
found a certain spume, or froth, that in time breeds unto certain shells, in
shape like those of the muskle, but sharper pointed, and of a whitish color,
wherein is contained a thing in form like a lace of silk finely woven, as it
were, together, of a whitish color; one end whereof is fastened unto the
inside of the shell, even as the fish of oisters and muskles are: the other end
is made fast unto the belly of a rude mass, or lump, which in time comes to
the shape and form of a bird. When it is perfectly formed, the shell gapeth
open, and the first thing that appears is the foresaid lace or string; next
come the legs of the bird, hanging out, and as it grows greater it opens
the shell by degrees, till at length it is all come forth, and hangs only by
the bill: in short space after it comes to full maturitie, and falls into
the sea, where it gathers feathers, and grows to foul bigger than a
Mallard and lesser than a Goose, having black legs and bill or beak, and
feathers black and white, spotted in such manner as is our Magpic, called in
some places a Pie-Annet, which the people of Lancashire call by no other name
than a tree Goose: which place aforesaid, and all those parts adjoining, do so
much abound therewith, that one of the best is bought for threepence. For the
truth hereof, if any doubt, may it please them to repair unto me, and I shall
satisfy them by the testimony of good witnesses." Vide GERARD'S HERBAL, p.
1587, 1588.

curious species.

This Shell is found on the coasts of Sussex, Dorset, Devonshire, Cornwall,
Wales, etc. -- It is an elegant species, commonly white, variegated with
zig-zag stripes and waves of fine red, as shown at Fig. 1. Sometimes, however,
they are of a dull yellowish tint, instead of white, with the stripes of a dark
brown. The Shell is of a rich pearl color when the outer coat is taken off.

Linnaeus proposes this as a species, (Conulus); but at the same time observes,
is may be a small variety of the Trochus Zizyphinus, because, like that
species, it is imperforated, and has a prominent ridge on the whirls. Pennant
says, it is scarcely distinct from T. Zizyphinus. Da Costa thinks it certainly
a distinct species.

If the shell, Fig. 104. Pennant, is correct, it is of a larger growth than any
of our specimens. Da Costa says, the size seldom exceeds that of a cherry
kernel. Not uncommon on the shores of Sussex; and has been received from the
coast of Devonshire.

This species in found in abundance on most of the British shores; it adheres
to shells, stones, claws of lobsters, etc. but chiefly to the leaves of Fucus
serratus, and other sub-marine plants. It is a strong Shell, white, and without
polish; is never complicated, or laid one on another, but are dispersed singly
over whatever substances they are affixed to. Petiver calls if the Wrack
Spangle, because it appears like so many white spangles on the dark-colored
leaves of the Wracks. -- A piece of this sub-marine plant, with the Shells
adhering to it, is a very pleasing object for the opake microscope.

Fig. I. represents the natural size of the Shells. Fig. II. shows one
magnified. Obs. Dr. Lister, in his original edition, ranked this Shell among
the Worm-Shells (tab. 533. fig. 5.) calling it Nautilcides, only from its
wreathed form like to a Nautilus; but his re-editor, the Rev. Mr. Huddesford,
has been pleased to reverse the Doctor's arrangement, by transposing it to the
Nautilus family, where it now is (tab. 553), and thereby fixes an error of
arrangement on Dr. Lister's memory, which that excellent and accurats
conchologist was not guilty of. DA COSTA, page 23.



PLATE X. PINNA MURICATA. THORNY WING, OR SEA HAM.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Hinge without a tooth, and placed on one side. Valves
equal; open, or gape at the bottom.

Dr. Rutty mentions a Pinna ten inches long and five broad, caught near the
Skerries, in Ireland; and Mr. Pennant "saw specimens of vast Pinnae, found
among the farther Hebrides, in the collection of Dr. Walker, at Moffat;" but it
is uncertain of what species either of these were: Mr. Pennant says, "they were
very rugged on the outside, but cannot recollect whether they were of the kind
found in the Mediterranean or West Indies This Author, however, arranges it as
a new British species, without further description: -- as, Pinna Ingens --
Great Nacre.
."

The only British species of Pinna we are acquainted with, is the P. Muricata
of Linnaeus, or P. Fragilis of Pennant, and that is very rare. The latter
author describes it from a specimen in the PORTLAND cabinet, which had been
fished up at Weymouth, in Dorsetshire. Da Costa says, he has seen a very small
one (of the same species) from the coast of Wales. -- Both of these are
represented in the annexed plate.

This Shell is extremely thin and brittle, and gapes open at the broadest end.
It is semi-pellucid, and of a horn color; the outside marked with longitudinal
ribs, roughened with rows of small prickles In Pennant's figure these are
obsolete.
. The inside is smooth, of a pale horn color also, with a pearly luster
toward the top.

This is a strong, thick shell, generally about one inch and a half length, of
a full pyramidal shape, with a point acute; it has five spires, furrowed: the
ridges of the lower wreath notched, or scaled, and very rough. Within the mouth
it has five long parallel teeth.

The colors are various, often of a simple and uniform yellowish brown, sandy,
or clay color; sometimes quite white, or white tinged with violet, and
fasciated with yellow or brown; the latter are the most elegant varieties of B.
Lapillus. -- These shells are found in great abundance near low water-mark, on
many of the shores of Great Britain. It is one of the species that yields the
purple dye analogous to the purpura of the ancients; and though the value of
its dye has been long superseded by the cochineal insect, the shells that
produced it are objects of curiosity. The Tyrian purple was the most admired,
and is known to have been extracted from a species of the Murex; but other
purples of inferior luster are also mentioned by the ancients. Da Costa
imagines that the liquor of this Whelke (Buccinum Lapillus) was a valuable
purple to the ancient English, and quotes the authority of Bid, who lived
about the seventh century, for this opinion. "There are," says Bid, "snails in
very great abundance, from which a scarlet or crimson dye is made, whose
elegant redness never fades, either by the heat of the sun, or the injuries of
rain, but the older it is, the more elegant Sunt cochleae, satis superque
abundantes, quibus tinctura coccinei coloris conficitur. Cujus ruber
pulcherrimus nullo unquam solis ardere, nulla valet pluviarum injuria
palle^cere; sed quo vetustier, eo solet esse venustior. -- Bid, Hist. Eedes.
(edit. opt.) l. i. c. i. p 277.
"

In 1684, Mr. Cole, of Bristol, described the process of extracting the purple
of this shell, in the Philosophical Transactions. His account is as follows:

"The Shells being harder than most of other kinds, are to be broken with a
smart stroke with a hammer, on a plate of iron, or firm piece of timber (with
their mouths downwards) so as not to crush the body of the fish within; the
broken pieces being picked off, there will appear a white vein, lying
transversely in a little furrow, or cleft, next to the head of the fish, which
must be dug out with the stiff point of a horse-hair pencil, being made
short and tapering. The letters, figures, or what else shall be made on the
linen (and perhaps silk too) will presently appear of a pleasant light green
color, and if placed in the sun, will change into the following colors, i. e.
if in winter, about noon; if in summer, an hour or two after sunrising, and so
much before setting; for, in the heat of the day in summer, the colors will
come on so fast, that the succession of each color will be scarcely
distinguished. Next to the first light green, it will appear of a deep green,
and in a few minutes change into a seagreen; after which, in a few minutes
more, it will alter into a watchet-blue; from that, in a little time more, it
will be of a purplish-red; after which, lying an hour or two, (supposing the
sun still shining) it will be of a very deep purple-red, beyond which the sun
can do no more.

"But then the last and most beautiful color, after washing in scalding water
and soap, will (the matter being again put into the sun or wind to dry) be of a
fair bright crimson, or near to the prince's color, which, afterward,
notwithstanding there is no use of any stiptick to bind the color, will
continue the same, if well ordered, as I have found in handkerchiefs that have
been washed more than forty times; only it will be somewhat allayed from what
it was after the first washing. While the cloth so writ upon lies in the sun,
it will yield a very strong and foetid smell, as if garlic and assafoetida
were mixed together."


PLATE XII. OSTREA SUBRUFUS.

This elegent species is found on several of the shores of Great Britain and
Ireland, particularly those of Cornwall, Dorset, and Northumberland. It is
generally about two inches and an half in length. Shell thin and rather unequal.
The inside is smooth and glossy, and commonly white, though sometimes of a
brownish color. The colors of the outside very various and beautiful. Da
Costa enumerates the chief varieties, as, 1. almost white, and white charged
with brown, red, or purple; 2. uniform bright yellow, and pale yellow, with
white; 3. uniform brown, and brown, red, or purplish grounds with white, etc.
all these colors are elegantly blended and variegated, sometimes marbled or
mottled or disposed in zones, girdles, broad longitudinal rays, etc.

Fig. 1. represents a fine colored specimen of the variegated red and white
kind. Fig. 2. The uniform deep orange, which we apprehend is less common.

Prof. Gmelin, in the last edition of the Systema Naturae, enumerates no less
than thirty-one varieties of this beautiful land Shell. Da Costa describes six
principal varieties in his British Conchology 1. Uniform, of a pale citron
color, or yellow of different shades: the mouth finely bordered within and
without, with a dark brown, and with a brownish shade or cloud on so much of
the body wreath as lies within the mouth, or from the outer lip quite across to
the edge of the pillar. Pretty frequent. 2. Uniform, of a flesh color of
different shades, with the mouth in like manner bordered with dark brown; and
the body wreath also shaded exactly the same as the last. Not very frequent.

3. Uniform, of different degrees of brown, with the same circumstances. Common.

4. The ground yellow or greenith yellow of different shades, with a regular
single spiral girdle, or according to the turn of the wreaths, in the very
middle of each wreath, with the brown border round the mouth, and the shade or
cloud on the body. Pretty frequent.

5. The ground flesh color of different shades, variegated in like manner with
a single girdle, the border round the mouth, and on the body. Not very frequent.

6. Many dark-brown spiral girdles on the yellow, flesh, or brownish grounds,
sometimes to five girdles at least on the body wreath; sometimes only four.
These girdles are of different breadths, some being very narrow, like streaks,
others broader, like belts; and others so extremely bread as to cover the
parts, and make the ground color only appear in girdles. They are also not
equidistant or regularly set; but the very broad girdles lie most generally on
the upper part of the shells. These girdled sorts are the most frequent or
common. DA COSTA Br. Conch. p. 78.


. Some of the kinds are rare, others extremely common, living in trees, hedges
and gardens. It is a widely diffused species being found in every part of
Europe as well as Great Britain.


PLATE XIV. PATELLA VULGATA, COMMON LIMPET.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Shell univalve, subconic, without spires.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS, Oblong ovoid with about fourteen obsolete
angles, margins deep or dilated. PATELLA VULGATA: testa subangulata: angulis

The Limpet is common on all the European shores. The outside is generally
encrusted with filth, balani, etc. beneath which, it has an epidermis of a
blackish color. The shells vary exceedingly in colors, not only in the
different stages of growth, but also in the adult state. When young, the
colors are remarkably vivid and elegantly disposed; the shell flat and the
margins deeply crenated: those of full growth are on the contrary very conic
and the colors less brilliant. The margins irregular and the ridges more
obsolete. Some authors have considered several varieties as distinct species.
Da Costa among others, deems the Patella depressa of Pennant, no other than a
young variety of the common kind.


PLATE XV. BUCCINUM LINEATUM, LINEATED.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Whelkes whose mouths are cut short at top, for the gutter
or beak does not ascend, but bends and falls on the back, oblique or awry,
exactly like the mouth of a soal or flat fish. Da Costa.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Small, pyramidal, or sharp pointed at bottom. Dark brown,
lineated spirally with white.

BUCCINUM LINEATUM: recurvirostrum minimum pullum, lineis albidis spiraliter
distinctum. Da Costa, Br. Conch. p. 130. sp. 77.

This species is found in great abundance on the coast of Cornwall. The annexed
plate exhibits several magnified figures of the most elegant varieties,
together with the natural size.

"This species," says Da Costa, "is rare in England. I found it at Mount's Bay
in Cornwall, where the fishermen told me they call it Queen Fish; it is also
found near Fowey and other shores of that county. I have seen some from
Weymouth, and Mr. Petiver received it from the island of Purbeck, in
Dorsetshire. Dr. Leigh mentions that it is got on the coasts of Cheshire."

Pennant has not noticed this Shell. Linnaeus described it as an Asiatic
species in the Systema Naturae, but adds it is perhaps an European species
also. In the last edition by Gmelin, it stands expressly as a British Shell.
Habitat in Mari Britannico, etc.

This Shell is thick, strong and heavy: the outside smooth and glossy, with
numerous concentric transverse wrinkles, and several faint rays in a
longitudinal direction. The margins are plain. The inside milk white and glossy.


PLATE XVIII. TURBO FASCIATUS. FASCIATED.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Univalve, spiral, or of a taper form.
Aperture somewhat compressed, orbicular, entire.

This is one of the six species Da Costa marks with a roman letter, because he
could not procure the originals to figure and describe in the British
Conchology. It is figured in the British Zoology of Pennant, who says it is
very frequent in Anglesea, in sandy soils near the coast.

This Shell is not uncommon on the shores of the Essex and Kentish coasts; on
the sandy shores of Lincolnshire, Dorsetshire, Devonshire, Cornwall, etc. The
same species is found in the Mediterranean and the West Indies. The colors are
very fine, particularly in the young Shells.

FIG. II. II. NERITA LITTORALIS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell thick, smooth vertex flat. Inner lip
spread obliquely. NERITA LITTORALIS: T. testa laevi, vertice carioso, labiis

This Shell is very common on all the British coasts, particularly the fine
yellow kinds. Those with broad bands or girdles, and also such as are
reticulated with dark greenish color on a light ground, are rare varieties of
this species.


PLATE XXI. PATELLA HUNGARICA. LARGE FOOL'S CAP.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Shell univalve, subconic, without spires.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell entire, conic, acuminated, striated,
with the vertex turning down, or hanging over one side. PATELLA UNGARICA: testa
integra conico acuminata striata vertice hamoso revoluto. Linn. Syst. Not. p.

"This species is only found on the Cornish coast, and even is very scarce
there, being most generally dredged some miles from the shore; for the Shell is
so thin, that it will hardly bear rolling from its native spot to the beach. It
is generally found affixed to a species of escallops, called frills, in
Cornwall." Da Costa.

FIG. II. II. PATELLA PARVA.. SMALL LIMPET.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Shell small, entire, without gloss, whitish, faintly rayed
with red. PATELLA PARVA: integra, parva, sublaevis, albescens radiis
rubentibus. Da Costa Br. Conch. p. 7. sp. 3.


Da Costa considers this as a nondescript species; he received several
specimens of it from the coasts of Dorsetshire, but never from any other of the
British shores, and therefore proposes it as a scarce Shell.

It is rather larger than a pea, thin, and semipellucid; of a depressed conic
shape, and the vertex inclining very much to one side. The inside is whitish,
outside the same, with a few longitudinal rays of pale red, or purplish brown.

FIG. III. III. PATELLA RETICULATA. RETICULATED MASK LIMPET.

Pennant says, this species inhabits the west of England. The specimens in Da
Costa's collection were also fished up near Weymouth, in Dorsetshire. This is a
rare Shell, and is not known to inhabit any other of the British coasts.

This Shell is about three quarters of an inch in length, half an inch in
breadth, and one quarter of an inch in height. The outside is deeply
reticulated, or wrought with prominent longitudinal and transverse ridges. The
vertex inclines to one end, and is perforated; its aperture is of an oblong
form, and about one tenth of an inch in length.


PLATE XXII.
FIG. I. I. TURBO CINCTUS. GIRDLED WREATH SHELL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Univalve, spiral, or of a taper form.
Aperture somewhat compressed, orbicular, entire.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Whitish, variegated with brown. Spires
swelled and ridged: two particularly large, broad, roundish ridges, in the
middle of each spire. TURBO CINCTUS: strombiformis medius albus pullo

This is a very rare Shell. Da Costa says he has received it only from the
coasts of Lincolnshire and Lancashire.

FIG. II. II. II. TURBO TEREBRA. AUGER SHELL.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell slender. Spires twelve, striated
spirally. Six of the striae rather prominent. TURBO TEREBRA: testa turrita

The colors in this species vary exceedingly; the ground color is generally
white, or cream color, with the streaks, dots, and markings of brown, pale
red, or orange. The length is from one inch and an half to two inches or more.

It is not uncommon on many of the British coasts This species is not uncommon
on many of our coasts, and in great plenty on some, as at the Scilly Islands;
at Liverpool, where they are called Cockspurs; at Scarborough, after winter
storms, according to Lister; at Exmouth, and other places on the western
shores; and I have received very fine and perfect ones from the coasts of
Wales, as Flintshire, Pwlhely in Carnarvonshire, and Barmouth in
Merionethshire. It is also a Shell of the Orkneys. Da Costa.
. Adanson has a variety of it (b) from Senegal; and other authors mention the
same species as a native of the East Indian and African seas.


PLATE XXIII. MYTILUS MODIOLUS. GREAT MUSCLE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge toothless, and consists of a longitudinal furrow.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. AND SYNONYMS. Shell large, blackish: one side angulated
near the middle, the other straight; but gibbous toward the beaks, and blunted
or obtuse at the upper end. MYTILUS MODIOLUS: testa laevi, margin anteriore

Mytilus Modiolus is the largest species of this genus that inhabits the
British shores; being from six to seven inches in length, and three in breadth.
It is a strong and heavy shell; the outside is of a blackish color inclining
to purple. It is covered with a thin filmy brown epidermis, and often with
balani and other remains of crustaceous animals. Within, it is smooth and
pearly, and sometimes richly colored with a variety of vivid hues, in which
red, purple and green chiefly predominate. These shells lie only in deep
waters, and are never cast upon shore; but sometimes they seize the bait of the
ground lines, and are hauled up by the fishermen.

Da Costa received the M. Modiolus, of a small size, from the Margate flats in
Kent; from Cornwall and other English shores. The specimen figured in the
annexed Plate is from Scarborough in Yorkshire; those found on the coast of
Wales and Scotland, and particularly the Orkneys, are not inferior in point of
size to those from Scarborough.


PLATE XXIV. DONAX CRENULATA. PURPLE OR TRUNCATED PURR.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Bivalve. One side very obtuse, margin crenated. Hinge
various, generally of two teeth.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. One side very blunt or truncated: thickly
striated longitudinally. Margin serrated. DONAX RUGOSA: testa antice rugosa

This is a very elegant and remarkable species: the annexed Plate exhibits five
of its most singular varieties. The young shells are sometimes quite white, or
white faintly marked with brown, red or violet; the old shells are of a deep
violet without, and variously marked with the same on the outside. Very common
on the western coasts of England, and also on those of Ireland and Scotland.


PLATE XXV.
FIG. I. I. MYTILUS DISCORS. DIVIDED MUSCLE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge tootheless, and consits of a longitudinal furrow.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. AND SYNONYMS. Shell oval, somewhat diaphanous and horny.
Outside divided into three compartments; the two exterior striated
longitudinally; the middle transversely, with extremely fine striae. MYTILLUS
DISCORS: testa ovali cornea subdiaphana, antice longitudinaliter posterius

The discovery of this rare species on our coast, is ascribed by Da Costa to
Dr. Richard Pultney, F. R. S. of Blandford in Dorsetshire; he found it on an
ascidia at Weymouth in that county. It has also been met with in Greenland,
Iceland, and Norway; and is likewise noted as a native of the Southern Ocean
Gmelin. -- Probably this variety found in the South Seas is that which Da Costa
notices in his description of Mytilus discors. "All that Linne has seen," (of
Mytilus discors) "as well as all those found on our coasts, are very small,
thin, and delicate; but a kind no wise different, except in size and color,
being larger than a great walnut, and quite brown, was brought from the
southern hemisphere by that great and national honor, Capt. Cook, the
circumnavigator, in the late expedition for the discoveries of new countries.
These also were entirely unknown to all our collectors; and, as they only
differ in size, thickness, and color, but are exactly the same in structure,
way of life, and other particulars as these of our coasts, is it a distinct
species or variety only?" -- As a figure of this very analogous kind may be
acceptable, it is introduced in the annexed Plate at fig. 2.
.

The shell found on the British coast is very small, brittle, and
semitransparent. The outside is of a brownish or rosy color, tinged with
green. The inside smooth, glossy, and somewhat pearly.


PLATE XXVI. ANOMIA EPHIPPIUM. LARGER OR ONION-PEEL ANOMIA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Bivalve. Valves unequal: one gibbous toward the beak, the
other flat, and perforated near the hinge.

The Anomia Ephippium is frequently found on the common oyster, to the shell of
which it adheres by means of a strong tendinous ligature, which passes through
the perforation of the upper valve. This Shell is of an irregular form; the
outside rugged and filmy; the inside smooth, pearly, and glowing with a variety
of elegant tints. in different specimens the colors vary considerably, some
being of a rich purple, others pale red, brown, or deep yellow, and all with a
silvery hue.


PLATE XXVII. BULLA LIGNARIA. WOOD DIPPER.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Shell sub-oval. Aperture oblong, very patulous, and smooth
or even. One end rather convoluted.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Oblong, oval, narrow toward one end, and
somewhat umbilicated, (or rather convoluted). Striated transversely. BULLA

This species is not very common. It is found on the coasts of Cornwall,
Devonshire, and Dorsetshire, and also on several of the coasts of Ireland.

The length is generally from one inch and an half to two inches; the shell is
brittle and without gloss, of a light, brownish color, wrought transversely,
with fine striae, and many narrow whitish veins. Its Latin and English names
are derived from its supposed resemblance to a piece of veined wood.

This Shell is very open; its animal a slug.


PLATE XXVIII. TURBO CLATHRATUS. BARRED or FALSE WENTLETRAP.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Univalve. spiral, or of a taper form.
Aperture somewhat compressed, orbicular, entire.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell taper, without umbilicus. Spires
swelled and separated by a deep channel. Several regular elevated ribs or
ridges extend in a longitudinal direction from the aperture to the apex. TURBO

This is one of the most singular species that is found on the British coasts.
It is very analagous to the famous Scalaris or Wentletrap of the East Indies,
which bears such a high price amongst Conchologists; and from this analogy it
is called the False Wentletrap. Its length is about an inch, and sometimes two
inches or even more. The mouth is perfectly round, and bordered with a thick
ring; from this ring arise several distinct equi-distant prominent ridges,
generally eight in number, which extend the whole length of the shell in an
obliquely longitudinal direction. These ridges appear the more remarkable and
prominent, as the spires are very unequal or swelled, and separated from each
other by a deep spiral channel. The color of most specimens is milk white, but
is sometimes obscured with brown, or marked transversely with distinct circles
of ferruginous interrupted lines.

Turbo Clathratus is found on several of the British coasts.

This pretty species is about one inch and a half in length. It is found on the
coasts of Essex, Sussex and Cornwall, and also on those of Wales, Scotland and
Ireland.

FIG. II. DONAX IRUS. FOLIATED PURR:
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Oval. Outside rugged or wrinkled transversely with
numerous raised membranous waved laminae or foliations. DONAX IRUS: testa

Frequent on the British coasts, adhering to rocks, shells, etc. -- It is large
and strong species, being seldom less than the size of a filbert, of a conic
form and rugged appearance, and is wrought with very prominent longitudinal
ridges.

FIG. II. LEPAS COSTATA. RIBBED ACORN SHELL.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Shell somewhat conic. Ribs equidistant and diverging from
the aperture. Operculum sharp pointed. LEPAS COSTATA: testa subconica operculis
acutis: valvulis costatis.


This curious and rare species, which has not been hitherto described or
figured, was found by the late T. Adams, Esquire. of Pembroke, adhering to pieces
of broken rock, and is in the possession of the Rev. T. Rachett, of Spetisbury,
Dorset, to whose liberality we indebted for figures of this, and several other
British shells not included in our own collection.

FIG. III. LEPAS CONOIDES.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Conic. Smooth, valves pointed at the apex: aperture very
small. LEPAS CONOIDES: testa conica laevi valvulis acuminatis, apertura

This is the largest of the turbinated univalves found in the British seas. It
inhabits deep water, and is said to be a common shell on the Essex, Sussex, and
many other of the English shores as well as in Scotland, the Orkneys and many
of the Irish shores also. On the Dorset coast it is rare.

It is frequently drawn up with oysters, and is sometimes eaten; but as it is
coarse food, it more commonly furnishes bait to fishermen.

The largest shells of this sort, found in our seas, sometimes exceeds five
inches in length; it is a strong, thick, and heavy shell; of a whitish color
on the outside; within of a most lovely yellow, inclining to orange, smooth,
and very glossy.

Pennant describes this species as having eighteen ribs, and Da Costa about
fifteen; we have specimens that agree, in this respect, with the descriptions
of both authors. The shell figured by the first is the size of a hazel nut; the
latter says, he has never seen it larger than a nutmeg: a worn shell, with the
habit of this species, that has been found since, is full twice that size.

This delicate shell is found on several of our coasts, as Cornwall,
Dorsetshire, and Devonshire; also in the Orkneys.

FIG. III. III. CARDIUM PYGMAEUM. PYGMY COCKLE.

It is needless to enter into detail on a species so well known as the Common
Periwinkle; yet it may be proper to observe, these shells, in many instances,
vary considerably. The young shells are reddish, whitish, yellowish, or brown,
of various hues, sometimes uniform, or without any markings; at others, girdled
spirally with darker colors. The adults also are sometimes bright red, orange,
chestnut, or whitish, or olive, with, and sometimes without, the spiral
lineations. They vary no less in size than in colors; and those of the
Orkneys, in particular, are quadruple, the size of those on the Irish or
English coast.

It is said, the name Periwinkle is a corruption of Petty Winkle, or small
Winkle, or Whelk.

FIG. III. III. TURBO RUDIS. THICK-LIPPED PERIWINKLE.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Shell somewhat tapering, without umbilicus. Volutions of
the spires, or turban swelled. Lip thick, and glossy within.

This shell has been kindly communicated by Dr. Maton, as a new species. It is
noticed in the first volume of that gentleman's Observations on the WESTERN
COUNTIES; but has not, we believe, been hitherto figured. It was discovered on
the banks of the Tamar, in Devonshire, near Bere-Alston, and is thus described:

"In the mud appeared a species of Turbo, which, though very similar to T.
Littoreus (the common Periwinkle), has some characters that seem to authorize
its being considered as a different shell. The anfractus are much more swollen,
as it were, than in the above species; the spire is more depressed; and,
besides, there is no appearance of striae, either transversely or
longitudinally. This shell has a sort of distorted or rude contour, that may,
perhaps, entitle it to the appellation of T. Rudis. Its color is greenish."

Dissimilar as the several figures in this plate may appear, they are merely
accidental varieties in size, growth, and color of an individual species.
These shells are generally about an inch, or more, in length, and of a somewhat
globose shape; but so extremely irregular and distorted, that it can with
difficulty be defined. Dr. Wallace calls these shells the twisted pectines of
Stroma, a little island that lies in the Pightland Frith; he found them on some
parts of the Orkneys, where he observed extraordinary cross and strong tides.
The irregular form of these pectines rather surprised him. He adds, "I cannot
think the odd strange tumbling the tides make there, can contribute any thing
to that frame; yet, after all, I never see them in any other place." -- These
shells are now found on several of the English shores, as Yorkshire,
Scarborough, Mouth of the River Tees, and Dorsetshire; and are also frequent in
the fossil state, in the chalk pits of Kent and Surry. Both valves are unequal,
and much distorted, but the under one is usually the most irregular; the ribs
are numerous, close set, longitudinal, and prominent. The inside of the lower
valve is smooth and white, when alive, and that of the upper has a pearly
gloss. The outside is generally of a dingy white, or yellowish cast; sometimes
pale violet, or russety; or white mottled, and varied with brown, or brilliant
red.

The ears of this shell are large, and nearly equal, but are often so distorted
as to appear much otherwise. It is proper to observe, that though the irregular
form this shell assumes may be attributed to some injury is has sustained in
its growth, every shell of this species is constantly found with the same
distorted appearance. This circumstance leaves no reason to doubt that such
distortions are characteristic of this extraordinary and peculiar species.


PLATE XXXV. MUREX ERINACEUS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Spiral, rough. The aperture ending in a strait and somewhat
produced gutter or canaliculation.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. AND SYNONYMS. Shell subangular, rugose, or covered
entirely with raised scales or points. Spires six. MUREX ERINACEUS: testa

island in Cheshire.


PLATE XXXVI.
FIG. I. LEPAS INTERTEXTA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Triton. Shell of many unequal valves: affixed by a
stem.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Sell rather depressed and ribbed obliquely.
LEPAS INTERTEXTA: testa subdepressa oblique costata. Lepas striata. Penn. Br.
Zool. t. 38. f. 7. Walker test. min. rar. f. 87.


This rare species is the Lepas intertexta of the Portland Museum; it was
fished up at Weymouth, adhering to a valve of the Ostrea subrufus.

The shells of this genus are in general very complex in structure, the present
is particularly so. Several shells of the natural size is represented on the
orange space of the Ostrea, Fig. I. -- Three figures are added to exhibit their
magnified appearance; to distinguish these, the space is colored green.

FIG. II. III. LEPAS BALANOIDES. COMMON ACORN SHELL.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNOYMS. Shell conic truncated, of six valves.
Operculum bifid. LEPAS BALANOIDES: testa conica truncata; operculo obtuso Linn.
Faun. Suec. 1. p. 385. No. 1348 2. No. 2123. Balanus vulgaris parvus conicus e

Balani parva species. List. H. An. Angl. p. 196. tit. 41. tab. 5. fig. 41.


These shells are found in the greatest abundance on all the British shores,
adhering to rocks, shells, etc. etc.

Da Costa says, this species, when not affixed on flat, but unevea surfaces,
sometimes, but rarely, extend down into a pretty long rugged tubular stalk or
root. This variety is noted by Pennant, and an extraordinary, but mutilated
specimen of it, is shown at fig. 3.
