To the READER.
(1.) THAT this Concordance does not pretend to comprehend more than any other
larger ones, but to contain the principal substance of the small in little
room. (2.) By observing what is One or More principal words of any remembered
text, and what are the three first letters of them, and searching under
answerable words in the Concordance, the sentence will be found. (3.) The
original words, whether Nouns or Verbs, are marked in CAPITAL or double
letters, and these derived from them come after in Italics. (4.) Where words
are found in many places, the plural is distinguished from the singular, and
the parts of verbs ending in -- ed, -- est, -- eth, from their original. But
when the examples are few, no such distinction is made, but may be easily
observed. (5.) The Concordant words, except the first are marked by the first
letter a. b. c. etc. and the names of the -- mark stands for several words
above marked in Italics, divine Persons by answerable capitals. (6.) Even other
words, especially names of divine Persons, are often marked by one or more of
their first letters, that the sense of the line might be more complete. (7.)
Notwithstanding considerable care, both in writing and printing, sometimes one
figure of a number is omitted, as in 4. for 14, or one like figure is put for
another as 16. for 26. etc. But by remembering this, the place of the text may
be easily found.
