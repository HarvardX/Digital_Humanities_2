^ LETTER from the Famous ^ir Humphry Polesworth, etc.
^ ^rog.] COusin Richard and Brother Tom, let us fall into serious
Consultation: It Is in every one's Mouth, current (...) upon Change, that John
Bull is resolved shame^^^ to compound the Lawsuit, which we have (...) on
Successfully for so many Years.


(...) Frog.] I suppose, Brother, you mean successful^^ (...) the Frogs; poor
John has small Reason to (...) of the matter.


(...) Frog.] Thou art such another Brother, there is the fellow of thee; still
repining at the Prospe^^^ of thy own Family.


(...) Frog.] I don't desire my Family should flourish ^he Downfall of Honest
Men, especially Friends; (...) John Bull, once the opulent Clothier of the
^^rld, sought to, and courted by all the eminent ^^^yers of Westminster Hall,
can scarce get Money ^ee a young hearing Counsel of a Years standing: (...)
come, and he can do nothing, unless he mort^^e the small Pittance remaining to
him of a very ^^t Estate, and you are so unconscionable to grutch (...) the
keeping of That.


N. Frog.] Rot your Conscience! What Is Con^^^nce to a Tradesman? Had I stood
upon Con^^^nce, old Lewis had still enjoyed those glorious ^nnors, and
delicious Parks, which John spent his (...) Substance to get for me: I tell
thee, Boy, Bull (...) be brought lower yet, even with the Ground, ^^^fore the
Frogs can hope for flourishing Days.


R. Frog.] Well said, old Nic. In Faith; we must (...) hear of a Composition
till the Bubble be so en^ely fleeced, that he may give us no further Jealousy
of ever being able to interfere, either in (...) or Interest, with us.


T. Frog.] If that be all, you may even ag^^^ Morrow. Old Rowly, who has been
our Spy (...) twenty Years, and never gave us false Intellige^^^ says, He cannot
last another Term. What with (...) curing further time for, forfeited Bonds,
and ^^^gages; Procuration-money, paying Interest upo^^ ^^^terest, Fees to
Sergeants, Bailiffs, and Bum-Ba^^^ to ward off Writs, Executions, Decrees, and
(...) ^^wri^s, for the Debts already contracted; John (...) of all his great
Income, has not five Shillings in (...) Pound left to go to Blackwell-Hall
Market, (...) a Trade, and support his numerous Family.


N. Frog.] So much the better: We must not (...) him any Stock to Trade withal.
I have though^ a way to beggar him quite. He is very fond (...) his Wife and
Children; could never deny them (...) they asked: I know that conceited Minx
(who ^^^lues her self upon having taken him out of my (...) and the whole brood
of them, as well as John (...) self, love all (...) of good Cheer, even to a
deg^^^ of Gluttony: They cannot live without their (...) and Sirloins of Beef,
Chines of Mutton, and (...) not. Now, if we could but get in with old L -- he,
with his Ways and Means, might procure a ge^^^ral Excise to be laid upon all
Flesh, which w^^ quickly carry off the rest of John's Substance, (...) make the
fifteen Shillings, which you say he now (...) Twenty. Besides, raising the
price of Bullocks, wh^^^ will make well for the Frogs, having such num^^rous
Herds of Cattle to drive to Market; Jo^ will not think of Ruin 'till it comes upon
him; (...) and his Family will never make two Wants of (...) they must cramb
their Guts to Day, though they (...) sure to starve to Morrow.


T. Frog.] That Is undoing many for the sake of on^ Plague of your Conscience;
Have not we Taxes enou^^ (...) twenty Kingdoms? But you must be contri^^^ ^ew, and
inflicting a general Calamity, that ^ay gain a particular Benefit? Hides are
(...) already, as well as the Land on which they (...) What, would you outdo
the French Task^^? Even under his Government, the most Ty^^al that we know of*
Flesh is not Taxed, ex^^^g only in some few rich Cities; and, if you (...)
you will find, in that very Country, several things ^^empt from Taxing, which are
subject to them (...) Bull's way of Trade and Living.


^ Frog.] John must be Exhausted, that is Poz. (...) further Encumbrances can we
lay upon him? -- Let me see! -- All gone but his Manor ^^locks-Hatch; Why then
he must and shall Mort^^^ that.


(...) Frog.] A Mortgage will not do, Man: Here are (...) from those honest
Fellows you formerly re^^ended to be his Servants; they are diligent (...) for
us; John Harpy, John Pettifoger, and ^^he Jew, they advise, That if John Bull
can ^^ought immediately to sell his whole Patrimony (...), together with the
Equity of Redemption of (...) past Mortgages. why then, truly, he may (...)
able to Law it on one Year longer.


(...) Frog.] Ay, marry, this is talking to the Pur^^ this will do, and bring
John under, with ^^spiring Housewife Madam Bull (as she would ^^ave Esquire South
call her:) Ah, if his first Wife ^^ed! I say no more; but the Business had
(...) over, and John a Bankrupt some Terms ago.


(...) Frog.] But if he wont sell his Patrimony, how (...)


(...) Frog] Suppose we play booty, and by under^^^ consent with old Lewis's
Attorney, suffer him (...) a Verdict this Term, we'll order the Matter (...)
John Bull shall believe, all the Blame lies at ^afe's door, Sir, Roger, and the
new Attorneys. If he have but as much Gall as a Pigeon, (...) bring him to take
old Hocus again, and then, (...) Lads, the Day must be our own.


N. Frog.] I hear the Composition is in such (...) wardness, that there will be
nothing done this (...) The Lawyers may go whistle, or blow their ^^gers in the
cold Hall, for any more Money the^^ like to get of John, unless we can puzle
the (...) Yet I think he can scarce bring it to bear, (...) my consent: By
Virtue of that Deed he signed (...) he was Drunk, I have power to Look into
(...) Family-Affairs: I am made Executor to his last (...) and Testament, and
Guardian to his Children must find some way to keep him under, that he (...)
dare to take a Servant without my Recommend^.


R. Frog.] If we could but get the Flirt his (...) out of the way, and that
Miser Sir Roger, we (...) make John Drunk again; I Will raise the Devil, (...)
throw those two Imps of his out of John's (...) There are was abroad, of
ruining a Family Nights time; Cannot a man sell his Wife and (...) as they do in
China? We must ask Hocus. ^^^ther it will stand good in Law? In that Cou^^^ man
may Play away himself and his Progeny^ Game of Cards.


N. Frog.] We must find some Trick to (...) John Bull's Posterity from giving
us, the Frog^ molestation in our Trade and Possessions. (...) way for Hocus,
and Honest Counselor Double's we wa^^ (...) Advice; If we could but once John
sell his whole Patrimony, when the Mon^^^ gone, (...) should quickly bring his
Family Contribution.


R. Frog.] A good thought: Is there any Dif^^^^ between public and private
Power? Con^^^^ as well Enslave one Man to another, as it Subject to his Prince:
If a Person makes over (...), he has in himself to me by an irrevocable de^d
(...) way more binding, that the Law can devise, (...) after That, as much his
Sovereign, as if (...) born so; some such means must be thought on ^^bdue John.
He has done as preposterous things, as wonderful too: He has several Sons that
are (...) Fellows, and have got strong Hands to work (...), let every one of
them pay two Shillings a (...) out of his Labor: Have they not also Eyes (...)
Feet, and Heads? In a late Reign, all the (...) was taxed for their Heads;
we'll have John (...) Family Taxed to the utmost; they shall pay every Limb:
nay, if we once get the Power, (...) Tax them to their very Skin.


(...) Frog.] And then, Cousin Dick, you shall see (...) love to John himself;
Out of my abundant (...) (and which Tom here, will scarce believe, (...) sees
it) I mean to secure him a Convenience (...) Common-side of the Queen's Bench,
or the (...)-Prison; he shall take his Choice, and a share (...) Basket, which
in Charitable times have been (...) Sixteen or Twenty Pound per Man; where
^^est John, thanks to the care of his true loving (...), may live upon free
Cost, for the rest of Life.
