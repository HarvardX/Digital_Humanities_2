THE WIVES REVENGED; A COMIC OPERA, IN ONE ACT. As it is performed at the
THEATER ROYAL IN COVENT GARDEN.

LONDON: Printed for G. KEARSLY, No. 46, Fleet Street. M.DCC.LXXVIII.

ADVERTISEMENT.
THE following little Piece is an imitation of the French comic operas of one
act, which are generally characterized, either by their natural simplicity, or
some single striking incident, and little or nothing more is designed. -- It is
now first attempted to introduce this species of entertainment on the English
theater, as containing excellent situations for light airs. -- On the French
stage, notwithstanding all their merit, they tire in the length of time taken
for representation; and, were they spun out to the common length of our
afterpieces, it is conceived they would be found still more insufficient.

The subject matter therefore being wholly preserved, and the dialogue both
varied and compressed, they are, with every deference submitted to public
judgment.

THE WIVES REVENGED; A COMIC OPERA.
SCENE I.
A Painting-Room in Mr. VERMILION's House; on each Side a Door opens into a
separate Chamber; the Window of which is so situated, that the Audience are
Witnesses to all that passes within. Mrs. VERMILION is discovered. AIR.
COME here, all wives,
Who lead your lives
With Deary jarring,
Growling, sparring,
Bawling,
Squawling,
Swearing,
Tearing;
Who in the dumps are left to pine,
In spite of all your charms!
At the sound of my drum,
Come -- hither come!
While honor's rub-a-dub you're hearing,
To my standard quick repairing,
To fight alike your cause and mine,
Behold me under arms.
Rouse, rouse! and brave them to the field,
Your tongue the weapon that ye wield,
Laurels shall crown your brow,
But if they hold out against this force,
Talk, as a dernier resource,
Of Vengeance -- you know how.
SCENE II.
Mrs. VERMILION, Mrs. TOKAY, and Mrs. DIMITY. Mrs. Ver. Ah! ha! -- I have not
beat my drum in vain -- here come two volunteers already -- Mrs. Tokay, and
Mrs. Dimity, I am charmed to see you. -- You are punctual to a minute.


Mrs. Tok. No wonder, when the summons was of such a serious nature. -- You
must see us it seems on business, which concerns us as nearly as our lives.


Mrs. Ver. This business is to sup with me here this evening, -- where I mean
to give you a delicious repast.


Mrs. Dim. But, my dear, what necessity fo such a message?


Mrs. Ver. More than you are aware of. -- Are you disengaged?


Mrs. Tok. Yes, -- my husband is gone into the country, on some particular
business, 'till tomorrow.


Mrs. Dim. And I am also a widow 'till that time.


Mrs. Ver. They told you so, did they? -- O men, how many ways do you deceive
and cheat us!


Mrs. Tok. What do you mean?


Mrs. Ver. Why, I mean, that both your Husband, Alderman Tokay, the
Wine-merchant of Portsoken ward, and your Husband, Deputy Dimity the Tailor, of
Candlewick, expect the pleasure of supping this evening, in this house.


Mrs. Tok. Here!


Mrs. Dim. With you?


Mrs. Tok. Why your husband is out of town.


Mrs. Dim. How! Ma'am! -- And you all alone?


Mrs. Ver. Listen to me: -- They have both formally made me a declaration of
love, and I confess to you, I thought myself not a little flattered, at
attracting the attention of two men, whose wives are so universally admired. --
Says Mr. Alderman, you know his jocular way, Ma'am --

AIR.
That form, and all those charms, odds fish!
Are, I protest, a dainty dish;
And of your eyes, the very sight,
Really creates an appetite,
Grace, pr'ythee let me say.
I Am at a feast, and Ma'am would you
Digest a perfect man of Gout,
Who'd drink you as a toast each sup,
And who, for Love, could eat you up,
Take Alderman Tokay.
Now, Ma'am, for a specimen of your hussband's eloquence in love. -- Mr. Dimity.

AIR.
In me, you think to find, perhaps,
One of those linsey-woolsey chaps,
Who of despair and daggers puff,
And all such worn-out threadbare stuff;
No, no, Ma'am, not in me.
I Am of another cloth cut out,
Well wearing; durable, and stout,
And, would you, in a lover find
A fair out side, honestly lined,
Take Dicky Dimity.
Well, Ladies, to so much gallantry, I could not but make a most obliging
answer. -- You shall hear it.

AIR.
To cruelty a stranger,
How shall I 'scape this danger?
You woo with too much art;
While tender and obliging,
Thus slily you're besieging,
A poor defenseless heart.
The reason you may guess,
Why thus it flutters so;
It Is love says yes, yes, yes,
And virtue, no, no, no.
Why you seem thunderstruck.


Mrs. Tok. What a villain!


Mrs. Dim. The Traitor! But I Will give him his own.


Mrs. Tok. And for Mr. Tokay, I Will make him blush with shame -- you shall see
such a scene. --


Mrs. Dim. I Will expose his infidelity to the whole world.


Mrs. Tok. And my wrongs shall be known all over the town.


Mrs. Ver. And so expose yourselves. -- No, no, if you will be guided by me,
we'll be better revenged of them than all this.


Mrs. Tok. How? -- I Will do any thing.


Mrs. Dim. Speak, dear Mrs. Vermilion!


Mrs. Ver. Time presses, let me therefore tell you my scheme in as few words as
possible; I have acquainted Mr. Vermilion with every thing, who is not out of
town, but has only had it so reported to favor our design. -- Your husbands
are coming here. -- I shall receive them in this painting room, because nothing
can possibly pass in these two chambers adjoining, which cannot be overheard.
-- And thus -- but on my conscience, one of them knocks at the door now -- do
you slip down these back stairs, and slide out after I have conducted them up.
-- Then be ready for me at your house, which is but two steps off, -- where I
shall presently come and fetch you, and tell you every thing you have to do.


Mrs. Tok. Well, well, we'll be guided by you. -- Could I have believed it! --


Mrs. Dim. Adieu. We'll hold ourselves in readiness. -- Oh! I could tear his
eyes out.


(A knocking.) Mrs. Ver. You hear, they are impatient, Ma'am! -- Come, come,
decamp, quick! --


SCENE III.
Mrs. VERMILION, TOKAY, and DIMITY. Mr. Tokay. Ah! my charming neighbor!


Dim. My dear, Mrs. Vermilion!


Mrs. V. Gentlemen! to what do I owe the pleasure of seeing you? don't say any
thing before him that I asked you to supper: (to Tokay) he has a scandalous
tongue.


Tokay. Scandalous as a tea table, Ma'am! -- I don't know what put it in the
damned fellow's head to come here -- Well, neighbor Dimity, I Am glad to see
you. We happened to meet together, Madam, at your door, just as I was coming to
pay my respects to you.


Dim. Yes, I came according to instructions to take measure.


Mrs. V. Hush, hush! don't say I invited you here -- he would expose us --


Dim. O Lord! to the whole world. -- I say, Ma'am, the remnant of the evening
lay on my hands, and so I thought I could not piece it out better, than in
coming to ask you how you did.


Mrs. V. Well, Gentlemen, since it happens so, if you have no better
engagement, I shall be glad of your company to eat a bit of supper with me.


Tokay. You are infinitely kind. Could not you send him away?


Mrs. V. No, no, 'twould create suspicion.


Dim. Vastly kind, indeed -- Could not we get rid of him?


Mrs. V. It Is impossible -- Come, Gentlemen, I must use you without ceremony --
We have the house to ourselves -- I gave the maid leave to see her aunt, and
the man is gone with my husband -- I am a widow for a whole week.


Tokay. A week! zounds, I shall be elected without a scrutiny.


Dimity. A week! Damn me, I shall cut out a fine parcel of work here!


Mrs. V. Mr. Tokay, help me to fetch the table; and do you, Mr. Dimity, look in
that closet for the table cloth, and knives and forks -- Come, come, stir.


Tokay. Dispose of me as you please.


Mrs. Ver. (to Tokay, with whom she brings forward the table) Ah, my dear Mr.
Tokay, if that fool was not here --


Tokay. My turtle! let me kiss you for that thought.


Mrs. Ver. Hush! hush! he will see us! (to Dimity) that is right -- (to Tokay) now
do you search in that cupboard, and you will find a sallad ready for dressing --
(Tokay goes while she speaks to Dimity) 'Twas very kind of you to come, dear
Mr. Dimity. What a pity it is we are not alone!


Dim. I wish to Heaven he was in one of his buts of Madeira.


Mrs. Ver. Well, one journey more and all will be ready. You see I have nothing
but a cold supper, but such as it is --


Tokay. Oh! Madam! your company is green peace at Christmas.


Mrs. Ver. Oh! truce with compliments, and sit down without ceremony.


Tokay. How many jealous ones we should make now, if your husband, and our
wives, knew of this.


Dim. Come, Ma'am, sit.


GLEE.
Our wives at home, your husband gone,
To them leave care and thinking;
While gaily we the hours pass on
In laughing and in drinking.
The real joys of love are shared
By those who are discreetest;
And here is his health who first declared
Stolen pleasures are the sweetest.
(after the Glee a knnockig) Mrs. Ver. Hush!


Dim. What Is the matter?


Mrs. Ver. Surely some one knocks.


Tokay. Do you expect any body?


Mrs. Ver. Not a soul.


Tokay. Zounds! I hope it is not your husband.


Mrs. Ver. Oh! no.


Dim. But if by hazard --


Mrs. Ver. I hardly think it -- however, in that case, I can hide you in this
room -- but don't concern yourselves -- It cannot be him; and for any body else,
I Will soon send them away -- (She just looks, and returns) Heavens! it is my
husband sure enough; I would not have him see you for the world; get in, get in.


Dim. Stuff us in any where.


Mrs. Ver. If I can, I Will send him out -- Don't stir for you lives --

[They go into the room on the right hand, and by means of the window, are in
sight of the audience.
SCENE IV.
Mr. VERMILION. Mrs VERMILION. Ver. Ah! wife; you ought to have a thousand
obligations to me -- I did not find my man -- and though it was so late, I was
determined not to lose a moment -- But I think you receive me coldly.


Mrs. Ver. No love, I don't -- I only --


Ver. Hey! what the devil's this? -- you were going to have good cheer -- a
pate of partridges! Three covers! why, who the devil have you invited to supper?


Tokay. Zounds! she will never draw herself out of this scrape.


Dim. Hush! hush!


Mrs. Ver. Why, my dear -- I -- a -- I have -- asked some ladies to sup with me.


Ver. Ay! who?


Mrs. Ver. Why, Mrs. Tokay, and Mrs. Dimity.


Tokay. Our wives!


Ver. What, our two handsome neighbors?


Mrs. Ver. Yes, love; and I wonder they don't come -- I wish you would go and fetch
them.


Ver. My soul, there is nothing I would not do sooner for thee, than walk.


Mrs. Ver. Well, it is but a step, I Will go myself.


Ver. I would not trouble you, but I am so tired with my journey.


SCENE V.
Mr. VERMILION, (Tokay and Dim. hid) Good Heaven! how fortunate -- thou little
divinest, my sweet wife, what a service thou art going to do me -- I shall sup
with her I adore.


Dim. Do you hear him, Alderman? he says he shall sup with her he adores.


Ver. There is not her equal in the world, and my love is like here is, perfect
-- she is more majestic than Juno.


Tokay. Ay, that is your wife, for she is the most tallest.


Ver. More willing than Io.


Dim. That Is yours.


Ver. More lively than Sappho; but, to my misfortune, too virtuous.


Tokay. Yes, yes, I fancy he means my wife, indeed!


Ver. Heavens! what transport! what tender, delightful ecstasy, to press her
panting, yielding to my bosom -- What is there but love makes our lives
desirable?

AIR.
Love, to thee myself I give,
In thee I breathe, by thee I move,
My fleeting hours, while yet I live,
To thee shall be devoted, love.
Thou art the charm of every mind,
The young, the old, thy influence prove:
Tender, jealous, roving, kind,
We all are happy, so we love.
II.
In earliest youth how time did glide,
Cloe might well have tempted Jove,
And I, what bliss! was Cloe's pride;
Then how I sung thy praises, love!
A smile, a nothing from my fair,
I prized all blessings far above;
I knew not even the name of care,
Nor ought but thy sweet transports, love.
Omitted in the representation. III.
'When ardour dampt, youth shall be past,
'From fair to fair still will I rove;
'And from this m^ment to my last,
'Untir'd, I Will sing thy praises, love:
'Each friend in this some folly sees,
'Will then such transports thee behove?
'Love! when thou ca 'st no long^r please?
'What, is it nothing then to love?

SCENE VI.
Mr. VERMILION, Mrs. VERMILION, Mrs. TOKAY, and Mrs. DIMITY. (Tokay and Dimity
concealed) Ver. Ah! I am charmed -- How do you do, Ladies?


Mrs. Tokay. How do you do, Mr. Vermilion.


Mrs. Dim. How do you do, Mr. Vermilion.


Ver. Give me leave to embrace you, my dear neighbor, and you, Mrs. Dimity.


Mrs. Dim. Lord! how you kiss one, indeed!


Tokay. Why, what a devil of a fellow it is!


Ver. Come, wife, we must have another cover. Where Is the servant?


Mrs. Ver. I have given her leave to go out.


Ver. What exquisite pleasure to pass a few hours with you, my dear Mrs. Dimity.


Tokay. My dear Mrs. Dimity! do you hear him?


Ver. Come, wife, let us set at table. -- How I am transported to see my sweet
Mrs. Tokay!


Dim. Sweet Mrs. Tokay. -- Alderman, do you hear him?


Ver. (Sitting at table.) Never was happiness equal to mine, flattered and
caressed by three charming objects, equally amiable.


GLEE.
Young Paris was blessed, just as I am this hour,

Mrs. Ver. When proud Juno offered him riches and power;

Mrs. Tok. When stately Minerva of war talked and arms,

Mrs. Dim. When Venus to conquer him pleaded her charms.

All. These charms won the prize -- What an idiot was he!
The apple of gold I Would have parted in three,
And, contenting them all by this witty device.

Mrs. Ver. Given Juno,

Mrs. Tok. -- And Pallas,

Mrs. Dim. -- And Venus,

Ver. -- A slice.

All. Given Juno, and Pallas, and Venus, a slice.



Ver. An admirable thought. -- Part, then, my love, between you in the same
manner.


Mrs. Ver. Lord, Mr. Vermilion, how you do rattle.


Mrs. Tok. Oh! we forgive him.


Ver. Well, wife, what wine do you give us?


Mrs. Ver. I have forgot to fetch it.


Ver. Come, get it then, pray, my dear -- you seem uneasy -- Oh! I know what it
is -- she has to cross the garden in her way to the cellar, and she is afraid
of spirits.


Mrs. Ver. Well, Lord, every one is not so brave as you are. -- I confess I Am
foolish enough to have this absurd terror sometimes.


Mrs. Tok. Dear Ma'am! I Will go with you.


Tokay. Why does not he go himself?


Ver. I would go myself, if I was not so exceedingly tired.


Dim. What a devil of a reason!


Mrs. Tokay. Oh! we don't want you -- Come, Mrs. Vermilion --


[Mrs. Vermilion and Mrs. Tokay go into the chamber opposite to that in which
are Tokay and Dimity.] SCENE VII.
Mr. VERMILION, and Mrs. DIMITY on the stage, TOK. and DIM. concealed on one
hand, and Mrs. VER. and Mrs. TOK. on the other. Ver. Ah! my charming Mrs.
Dimity.


Mrs. Dim. Ah! Mr. Vermilion.


Ver. Don't you understand me?


Mrs. Dim. Alas!


Dim. What the devil are they going to say to one another?


Ver. We are alone.


Mrs. Dim. Well!


Ver. Permit me then, heavenly creature, to seize this opportunity,

(attempting to kiss her)
Tokay. This is pretty plain, I think, neighbor Dimity.


Mrs. Dim. Pray be quiet.


Ver. Cease then the fire of those bewitching eyes, those smiles, those lips
like roses, that voluptuous carnation in your cheeks, where comely health
resides; deprive yourself of these which feed the fire of my tender love.


Mrs. Dim. Flattering creature!


Tokay. Poor Master Dimity!


Ver. Heavens! how beautiful she looks! -- Come, charming creature, let us not
lose this favorable moment -- Believe me, never was love so ardent, or so
faithful as mine, -- you answer nothing, -- you must not deny me.


Mrs. Dim. Dear me you are so pressing -- I am all in a flurry -- I must take a
walk in the garden to recover myself.


Ver. Do, my Angel, -- I Will conduct you to a delicious retreat, where the soft
zephyr alone shall be witness to our love.


Mrs. Dim. You agreeable devil, you!


Tokay. What do you think of this? He is not tired now?


[Mr. Ver. and Mrs. Dim go into the chamber, where are Mrs. Ver. and Mrs.
Tokay. SCENE VIII.
TOKAY and DIMITY on the Stage. Dim. They are gone out, let me pass you.


Tokay. Poor neighbor Dimity!


Dim. I Will snip the scoundrel's nose off; (following them) they have locked the
door.


Tokay. Ha! ha! this brings to my mind an old song, that I sometimes give 'em
at a meeting of the livery, I Will sing it you, neighbor.

AIR.
Curtis was old Hodge's wife,
For vartue none was ever such;
She led so pure and chaste a life,
Hodge said 'twas vartue over much:
For, says sly old Hodge, says he,
Great talkers do the least, do you see.
Omitted in the representation. II.
'Curtis said if men were rude,
'She'd scratch their eyes out, tear their hair;
'Says Hodge, I b'lieve you are wondrous good,
'However let us nothing swear;
'For says fly old Hodge, says he,
'Great talkers do the least, do you see.
III.
One night she dreamt a druken fool,
Be rude, in spite of her, would fain,
She makes no more, but with joint stool,
Falls on her husband might and main;
Still says sly old Hodge, says he,
Great talkers do the least, do you see.
IV.
By that time she had broke his nose,
Hodge made a shift to 'wake his wife,
Oh! Hodge, says she, judge by these blows,
I prize my vartue as my life:
Still says sly old Hodge, says he,
Great talkers do the least, do you see.
V.
I dreamt a rude man on me fell,
However I his project marred;
Dear wife, says Hodge, it is mighty well,
But next time don't hit quite so hard:
For, says sly old Hodge, says he,
Great talkers do the least do you see.

Dim. I could not have believed it -- my wife, who I thought the pattern card
of virtue!


Tokay. Women are frail, neighbor! women are frail!


Dim. Mr. Alderman, you have the advantage, but if it had been yours --


Tokay. Mine! No, no, Mr. Dimity, Mrs. Tokay is perhaps the most discreet
matron in all the ward of Portsoken -- But, come, bear your disgrace like a man
-- let us see -- Zounds, I Will seize some of these cakes, if it is only to
fortify the stomach -- And -- stay -- there is nothing to drink -- If the wine
was but come, I Would drink the lady and gentleman in the garden.


Dim. It Is cruel in you, Alderman, to rip up the subject in this manner.


Tokay. Hush! I hear them, let us retire.


Dim. Well, I Will sew up my mouth for a little while -- However, I Will trim them
yet, before I put the work out of hand. --

[They go back to their hiding place.]
SCENE IX.
Mr. VERMILION, and Mrs. DIMITY, and afterward Mrs. VERMILION and Mrs. TOKAY.
Mrs. Dim. Dear me! what shall I do?


Ver. Don't cry; believe me, my respect and caution shall ever equal my love.


Mrs. Dim. If my husband should know it --


Ver. How can he know it? -- No, believe me, he will carry his honors as
contentedly as the best.


Dim. My honors! there is a scoundrel for you.


Mrs. Dim. And will you be always constant?


Ver. For ever, my angel -- Hush! here is my wife, and Mrs. Tokay.


Mrs. Ver. So, have you well employed your time since we have been gone?


Ver. If to be wise, is to profit of each moment, we have well employed our
time, I assure you.


Tokay. Yes, yes, that we can witness for them.


Mrs. Ver. Here Is the wine.


Ver. Come, ladies, take your places.


Tokay. I fancy we shall be here some time. Come, neighbor Dimity, eat some of
this cake.


Dim. No, I thank you, Mr. Alderman -- I have no appetite.


Ver. Come, Mrs. Tokay, take care of yourself -- my dear Mrs. Dimity, what
makes you so serious? -- Here Is Mr. Dimity's health; he is a man I like;
clever, sensible, well furnished, here. --

[Pointing to his forehead.]
Dim. Did you ever hear such a villain!


Ver. Ladies, let us drink round, and then suppose we sing a little catch to
put us in spirits.


Mrs. Tok. With all my heart; what shall it be?


Ver. The Wives Revenged.


Mrs. Tok. Ha! ha! ha!

CATCH.
When husbands from their duty stray,
Their wives should be revenged, some way:
Courage then, dames, nor moap at home,
What! sit and cry, and let them roam.
Your honor's wounded -- rouse -- defend it,
And, cuckold them -- or else pretend it.

Ver. Charming! -- ravishing! -- my dear Mrs. Dimity, and you, beautiful Mrs.
Tokay -- how you enchant me -- but how is this, wife? -- but one bottle? --
Heavens! you should have brought half a dozen at least; at such a delightful
feast ought any thing to be spared?


Tokay. Half a dozen! -- what the devil are we to stay all night here?


Ver. Come, come, one more journey -- I am sorry to trouble you, and I confess
it is not very polite, but I am dead, and cannot stir a step.


Dim. Oh! the impostor!


Mrs. Ver. Come, ladies, which of you will accompany me?


Mrs. Dim. Mrs. Tokay loves walking.


Dim. There, there, she wants to stay with him again -- the vixen!


Mrs. Tok. No, Ma'am! you shall have your turn as well as me.


Dim. Hang my buttons now if --


Mrs. Dim. With all my heart. -- Come, Mrs. Vermilion.


SCENE X.
VER. and Mrs. TOK. on the stage, TOK. and DIM. concealed on one side, and Mrs.
VER. and Mrs. TOK. on the other. Mrs. Tokay. Are you not ashamed, Sir, to look
me in the face?


Ver. Why, Madam?


Mrs. Tok. Why, Sir? -- Do you think if your wife was insensible to your
behavior, it would pass upon me? -- No, Sir, not one leer, nor whisper escaped
me.


Ver. Ha! ha! ha! jealous, by all that is charming.


Mrs. Tokay. Jealous! -- no, Sir, my love is not alarmed, it is my pride that is
hurt -- Mrs. Dimity, indeed! I Will Mrs. Dimity her; to leave me for such a
Gill-slirt,


Dim. Why, Alderman, how is this?


Tokay. Why, really, I don't know.


Mrs. Tokay. You know, the first time I was weak enough to listen to you, was
at my Lord Mayor's ball -- You danced, you enchanted me, and while my dear good
Mr. Tokay was getting himself into a state of intoxication, with his own
champaign, you looked, and persuaded, and swore yourself into my affections --
and now -- I could cry my eyes out.


Ver. Come, come, no more of this -- you are as dear to me as ever. Let us not
then lose the moments in frivolous conversation -- rather let me lead you where
silence and the night shall hide those raptures --


Mrs. Tokay. Heavens! you were born to persuade me -- And don't you love that
creature at all?


Ver. How can you do yourself the injustice to think so? I was piqued at your
late coolness, and so put on all this to try if your affection was as strong as
ever.


Mrs. Tokay. Is it possible?


Ver. You know it is -- Come, lose no time!


[They go off to Mrs. Ver. and Mrs. Tokay. SCENE XI.
TOKAY and DIMIT on the Stage. Tokay. Zounds! I Am struck as dumb as an oister.


Dim. Why, Alderman! I thought your wife was the most discreet matron of all
the ward of Portsoken.


Tokay. A dauber of canvas to make a cuckold of an Alderman!


Dim. Come, come, it is some comfort that you are not out of work any more than
me.


Tokay. A damned plaisterer of train oil, and yellow oker!


Dim. Stay, have I never a snip of a song now that will suit you?

AIR.
Master Jenkins smoked his pipe,
And swore he would never be married,
But against each husband threw some wipe,
Or dry-jest drolly carried.
Master Jenkins thought a wife
The greatest mortal evil,
And swore, to lead a husband's life,
Must be the very devil.
II.
Master Jenkins smoked his pipe,
At home, content, and married;
Regardless of cach sneer or wipe,
Or dry-jest drolly carried:
Master Jenkins swore, a wife
Was not so great an evil;
And any but a husband's life,
Was now the very devil.
III.
Master Jenkins smoked his pipe,
And had been some months married,
Severely now he felt each wipe,
For horns the poor man carried:
Master Jenkins cursed his wife,
And swore of such an evil
To get well quit, he would part with life,
Or send her to the devil.
But women are frail, neighbor! -- Women are frail! -- Come, Alderman, will
you eat any of this cake? -- (drinks) Here Is the Lady and Gentleman in in the
garden -- but, zounds, I hear them, let us retire --


(both retire) SCENE XII.
VERMILION and Mrs. TOKAY, and afterward Mrs. VERMILION and Mrs. DIMITY. Mrs.
Tok. Heavens! I am undone! -- ruined!


Ver. I tell you, my love, they did not see us.


Mrs. Tok. You are mistaken, and that malicious Mrs. Dimity --


Ver. Hush! they are here.


Mrs. Ver, Your servant, Madam, I must give up my place to you, I find.


Mrs. Dim. Yes, Madam, you did not slide out of the little summer house so
cunningly, but that we saw you.


Mrs. Tok. What do you mean, Ladies?


Ver. I cannot conceive what they would be at -- This Lady has never stirred
from hence, I assure you, all the time you have been gone.


Mrs. Ver. All this is mighty well, Sir, but we part tomorrow.


Mrs. Dim. Yes, indeed! I wonder how she has the impudence to look Mrs.
Vermilion in the face!


Ver. Well, Ladies, since you are determined upon quarrelling, you had better
wish one another good night. If you will give me leave, I Will see you home.


Mrs. Dim. No, I will not be seen in her Company.


Mr. Ver. Madam, whatever your delicacy may be injured at, as it is dark, you
had better, I think, take this opportunity of guarding yourself from danger.


Mrs. Dim. Well, for the matter of that, since no one will see us together --
good night to you, my dear Mrs. Vermilion -- I am sure I pity you.


[Mr. Vermilion, Mrs. Tokay, and Mrs. Dimity, retire to the chamber. SCENE XIII.
Mrs. VERMILION, TOKAY, and DIMITY on the Stage. Tokay. Dear Ma'am! revenge
yourself.

(on his knees)
Dim. Do, Ma'am, (on his knees) my devil of a wife, for all her demure looks,
has tore a hole in my coat, as large as that in the Alderman's.


Tokay. Upon my knees I entreat of you.


Dim. And so do I upon mine -- it is the only way to repair the rent in your
reputation.


SCENE THE LAST.
All the CHARACTERS. All except. Tok. and Dim. Ha! ha! ha!


Mrs. Dim. How! this my dearee?


Mrs. Tok. What do I see, the Alderman!


Tokay. Yes, Ma'am, but not so contented as you may imagine.


Dim. And for me, Ma'am, I shall not quietly wear my honors, whatever that
gentleman may think of the matter.


Mrs. Tok. I don't understand you.


Tokay. What, you know nothing of the summer house?


Dim. No, I warrant them, pretty creatures, nor of the garden, the jealousy,
the carnation in the cheeks, the intoxication, the zephyr, and the Lord Mayor's
ball.


Ver. Hark ye, Mr. Alderman Tokay, and Mr. Deputy Dimity, never go a poaching
again on other peoples grounds, for fear they, in your absence, should take it
in their heads to beat up the game about yours.


Mrs. Ver. Come, it is I who must explain all this -- You have both had the
arrogance to make love to me; and the summer house, your coming here to supper,
and, in short, all that has passed, was only a laugh at your expense, and you
may thank your stars you are no worse off.


Tokay. Neighbor Dimity, we cut a good figure here.


Dim. Yes, for if this is the case, all our work's returned upon our hands.


Mrs. Ver. Come, come, the best thing you can do, is to beg pardon of your
wives, to whom I Will be an advocate for you.


Mrs. Tok. To show you what good creatures we are, they have their pardon, even
before they ask it.


Ver. Generously done -- and now let us sit down, and forget all animosities
over a bottle of the Alderman's Tokay.


AIR.
Mrs. TOKAY. 'Twixt husband and wife, there is an end of all quarrels,
The battle is fought, and the victory is ours;
The wives have the day, and a forest of laurels,
Like Cap's alamode, on our temples now towers.
Yet though we return from the field so victorious,
Where courage resides -- always pity should live,
And warriors to still make their conquests more glorious,
The enemy vanquished, forget and give.

Mrs. DIMITY. Henceforth I return to my former obedience,
Which, alone, in a wife, real kindness secures;
I acknowledge, and take on it the oaths of allegiance,
You Will reign King of my heart, while I Am Queen of yours.
Many wives though had paid you in kind, thus induced to it.
Taking care, every hour, a fine life you should live;
With bick'ring and taunts -- but it is over, and a truce to it,
What ever is past, I Will forget and forgive.

Mrs. VERMILION. And now, if so far, you have heard us thus hector,
'Twas only, believe me, that each played her part*
For our fear, lest the critics should read us a lecture,
Is a certain conviction we are women at heart.
Though our husbands we have tamed, for the Piece we have our terrors,
Let what merits you find, in your memory live,
Nay, let kindness augment them -- but as for our errors*
We humbly entreat you, forget and forgive.



THE END.
