TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, LORD VISCOUNT NUNEHAM, THIS LITTLE POEM, AS AN
OFFERING OF FRIENDSHIP, IS INSCRIBED, BY HIS AFFECTIONATE SERVANT

EDWARD JERNINGHAM.

THE DESERTER.
I.
Concealed beneath illustrious deeds,
A simple tale I rear:
A tale that soft-ey'd Pity reads,
And honors with a tear.
II.
The Spaniard left the hostile plain,
To seek his native land,
Beneath the sails that swept the main,
CABEYSA joined the band:
III.
Who as he met his country's foes,
Within the field of Fame,
Above his rank obscure arose
And graced his humble name:
IV.
Yet not the early wreath of Fame
With haughtiness was twined:
Nor pride nor fickleness could claim
The empire of his mind:
V.
The lowly hut, beneath whose roof
He sighed a sad adieu,
Received him (time and distance-proof)
To love and MARY true:
VI.
This hamlet-fair, by Fortune scorned,
Seemed Nature's favorite child,
With hand profuse by her adorned
-- The flow'ret of the wild!
VII.
Her neat but homely garment pressed
The pure, the feeling heart,
Often sought in vain behind the vest
Of decorated art:
VIII.
"If sharing all thy cares (she said)
"Has paled my beauty's rose,
"Ah know! for thee the heart that bled,
"With all its passion glows:
IX.
"Blessed moment to my wish that gives
"The long long absent youth!
"He lives -- th'endear'd CABEYSA lives,
"And love confirms the truth.
X.
"When thy brave comrades fell around,
"What pow'r's benignant care,
"Secured thee from the fatal wound?
"And MARY from despair?
XI.
"Often in the troubling dream of night
"I saw the rushing spear,
"Nor did the morn's awak'ning light
"Dispel the lingering fear.
XII.
"Thy tender fears (the youth replied)
"Ah give them to the air!
"To happiness we are now allied,
"And pleasure be our care:
XIII.
"Let us pursue the joy begun,
"Nor lose by dull delay:
"Say, MARY, shall tomorrow's sun
"Illume our nuptial day?
XIV.
With look declined she blushed consent --
Reserve that takes alarm,
And Love and Joy their influence lent
To raise meek Beauty's charm.
XV.
The guests, to hail the wedded pair,
Beneath their roof repaired,
With them the little feast to share
Their scanty purse prepared:
XVI.
Though no delicious wines were poured,
Mirth took his destined place,
The handmaid Neatness spread the board,
And sage Content said grace.
XVII.
Scarce through one hasty week had Love
His grateful blessings shed,
When bliss (as flies the frighted dove)
Their humble mansion fled:
XVIII.
'Twas at BELLONA'S voice it flew,
That called to war's alarms;
Bad the youth rise to valor true,
And break from MARY'S arms:
XIX.
But she still strained him to her heart,
To lengthen the adieu:
"Ah what, (she said) should thou depart,
"Shall I and sorrow do?
XX.
"Say, valiant youth, when you are away
"Who Will raise my drooping head?
"How shall I chase the fears that say
"Thy loved CABEYSA'S dead?
XXI.
"With thine my fate I now involve,
"Intent thy course to steer,
"No words shall shake my firm resolve,
"Not even that trickling tear:
XXII.
"Framed for each scene of soft delight,
"(He said) thy gentle form,
"As shrinks the lily at the blight,
"Will droop beneath the storm:
XXIII.
"Blessed in thy presence! every pain
"(She added) brings its charm,
"And love, though falls the beating rain,
"Will keep this bosom warm.
XXIV.
Her zeal (the supplement of strength)
Upheld her many a day,
But Nature's powers subdued at length,
On Sickness' couch she lay:
XXV.
Three painful days unseen she lay
Of him she held so dear:
"Ah does he thus my love repay?
She said -- and dropped a tear:
XXVI.
"CABEYSA, at a league's remove,
"Dwells on the tent-spread hill:
"Ah wherefore did he vow true love,
"And not that vow fulfill?
XXVII.
Yet not deficiency of truth
Forbad to yield relief,
Stern power withheld the tender youth,
And duty to his chief:
XXVIII.
Who wisely-counsel'd drew a line,
To check the hand of Stealth,
That ravaged wide the encircling vine,
The humble peasant's wealth:
XXIX.
To pass the line, it was ordained,
Whoever should presume,
Should a Deserter be arraigned,
And meet the coward's doom:
XXX.
This law by equity approved,
And to the peasant dear,
Soon to the brave CABEYSA proved
Destructively severe:
XXXI.
Now MARY'S image haunts his soul,
In Woe's dark tints arrayed,
While to his breast compassion stole,
And all her claims displayed:
XXXII.
"For me her native home, (he said)
"For me each weeping friend,
"For me a father's arms she fled --
"And shall not love attend?
XXXIII.
"Say, for a chosen lover's sake,
"What more could woman do?
"And now that health and peace forsake,
"Shall I forsake her too?
XXXIV.
"Now stretched upon the naked ground,
"Oppressed with pain and fear
"She casts a languid eye around,
"Nor sees CABEYSA near:
XXXV.
"Now, now she weeps at my delay,
"And shall neglect be mine?
"Submit, ye fears, to Pity's sway!
He spoke -- and crossed the line.
XXXVI.
Soon at his sight the fair resumed
Each captivating grace:
On her pale cheek the rose rebloom'd,
And smiles illum'd her face.
XXXVII.
Yet to that cheek returned in vain
Bright Health's vermilion dye,
For bitter tears that cheek shall stain,
And dim her brilliant eye:
XXXVIII.
The youth returning through the gloom
At midnight's secret hour,
Was seized -- and to dishonour's tomb
Doomed by the martial power.
XXXIX.
To meet his fate at wake of day
(Love's victim) he was led,
No weakness did his cheek betray,
While to the chief he said:
XL.
"If in the battle death I Have dared,
"In all its horror dressed,
"Think not this scene, by thee prepared,
"Sheds terror on my breast:
XLI.
"Yet, at MARIA'S hapless fate,
"My fortitude impairs,
"Unmann'd I sink beneath the weight
"Of her oppressive cares:
XLII.
"Ah! when her grief-torn heart shall bleed,
"Some little solace grant,
"Oh guard her in the hour of need
"From the rude hand of want:
XLIII.
Now, kneeling on the fatal spot,
He twined the dark'ning band:
The twelve, who drew th'unwelcome lot,
Reluctant took their stand:
XLIV.
And now the murmuring throng grew dumb,
'Twas silence all -- save where,
At intervals, the mournful drum
Struck horror on the ear:
XLV.
Now, with their death-fraught tubes uprear'd,
The destined twelve were seen --
And now the explosion dire was heard
That closed CABEYSA'S scene.
XLVI.
Another scene remained behind
For MARY to supply --
She comes! mark how her tortured mind
Speaks through th'expressive eye:
XLVII.
"Forbear -- will ye in blood (she said)
"Your cruel hands imbrue?
"On me, on me your vengeance shed,
"To me alone it is due:
XLVIII.
"Relent -- and to these arms again
"The valiant youth restore.
"I rave -- already on the plain
"He welters in his gore.
XLIX.
Advancing now, she pierced the crowd,
And reached the fatal place,
Where, listing from the corse the shroud,
No semblance could she trace.
L.
"Is this -- oh blasting view! (she cried)
"The youth who loved too well!
"His love for me the law defied,
"And for that love he fell.
LI.
"When will the grave this form receive?
"The grave to which he is fled?
"There, only there I Will cease to grieve.
She spoke -- And joined the dead.
FINIS.
