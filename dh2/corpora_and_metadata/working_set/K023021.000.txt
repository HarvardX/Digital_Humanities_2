THE DISCOVERY: OR, The SQUIRE turned FERRET.
An Excellent New BALLAD.
To the TUNE of High Boys! up go we; Chevy Chase; Or what you please.
I.
MOST true it is, I dare to say,
Ever since the Days of Eve,
The weakest Woman sometimes may
The wisest Man deceive.
II.
For D^nt circumspect, sedate,
A Machiavel by Trade,
Arrived Express, with News of Weight,
And thus, at Court, he said.
III.
At Godliman, hard by the Bull,
A Woman, long thought barren,
Bears Rabbits, -- Gad! so plentiful,
You Would take her for a Warren.
IV.
These Eyes, quoth He, beheld them clear:
What, do ye doubt my View?
Behold this Narrative that is here;
Why, Zounds! and Blood! it is true.
V.
Some said that D^gl^s sent should be,
Some talked of W^lk^r's Merit,
But most held, in this Midwifery,
No Doctor like a FERRET.
VI.
But M^l^n^x, who heard this told,
(Right wary He and wise)
Cried sagely, It Is not safe, I hold,
To trust to D^nt's Eyes.
VII.
A Vow to God He then did make
He would himself go down,
St. A^d^re too, the Scale to take
Of that Phoenomenon.
VIII.
He ordered then his Coach and Four;
(The Coach was quickly got 'em)
Resolved this Secret to explore,
And search it to the Bottom.
IX.
At Godliman they now arrive,
For Haste they made exceeding;
As Courtiers should, whenever they strive
To be informed of Breeding.
X.
The good Wife to the Surgeon sent,
And said to him, Good Neighbor,
It Is pity that two Suqires so Gent --
should come and lose their Labor.
XI.
The Surgeon with a Rabbit came,
But first in Pieces cut it;
Then slyly thrust it up that same,
As far as Man could put it.
XII.
(Ye Guildford Innkeepers take heed
You dress not such a Rabbit,
Ye Poult'rers eke, destroy the Breed,
It Is so unsav'ry a-Bit.)
XIII.
But hold! says Molly, first let us try,
Now that her Legs are open,
If ought within we may descry
By Help of Telescope.
XIV.
The Instrument himself did make,
He raised and levelled right,
But all about was so opake,
It could not aid his Sight.
XV.
On Tiptoe then the Squire he stood,
(But first He gave Her Money)
Then reached as high as ever He could,
And cried, I feel a CONY.
XVI.
Is it alive? St. A^d^re cried;
It is; I feel it stir.
Is it full grown? the Squire replied;
It is; see here is the FUR.
XVII.
And now two Legs St. A^d^re got,
And then came two Legs more;
Now fell the Head to Molly's Lot,
And so the Work was over.
XVIII.
The Woman, thus being brought to Bed,
Said, to reward your Pains,
St. A^nd^re shall dissect the Head,
And thou shall have the Brains.
XIX.
He lap'd it in a Linen Rag,
Then thanked Her for Her Kindness;
And crammed it in the Velvet Bag
That serves his R^l H^
XX.
That Bag -- which Jenny, wanton Slut,
First brought to foul Disgrace;
Stealing the Papers thence she put
Veal-Cutlets in their Place.
XXI.
O! happy would it be, I ween,
Could they these Rabbits smother;
Molly had never a Midwife been,
Nor she a shameful Mother.
XXII.
Why has the Proverb falsely said
Better two Heads than one;
Could Molly hide this Rabbit's Head,
He still might show his own.
FINIS.
