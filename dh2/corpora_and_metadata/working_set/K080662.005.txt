That mind which is inclined to admire the wonders and beauties of creation,
will pause to examine with more than ordinary attention, a bird, in which
nature has displayed an elegance and variety of colors, sufficient to arrest
the admiration of ancient philosophers; and furnish them with the happiest
simile to abash human ostentation When Croesus, king of Lydia, was seated on
his throne, adorned with royal magnificence, and all the barbarous pomp of
eastern splendor, he asked Solon if he had ever beheld any thing so fine! The
Greek Philosopher, no way moved by the objects before him, or taking a pride in
his native simplicity, replied, that after having seen the beautiful plumage of
the Pheasant, he could be astonished at no other finery. BUFFON.
.

Perhaps, there are few tribes of birds in which nature has been more profuse
of her amplest coloring than that of the Pheasant. The common species as we
now consider it in this country, notwithstanding its beauty, is inferior in
that respect to two others that are also found at large in some of our woods.
The Ring and painted Pheasants are far more richly decorated, and these may
probably be as abundant in future generations as the Common Pheasant is at
present. The variegated Pheasant is beautiful, and the scarcely exampled
delicacy of the White kind renders it an interesting variety. The beauty of all
these varieties are, however, eclipsed by the Argus Pheasant; and probably,
were we better acquainted with the Phasianus superbus, and some other gigantic
Chinese species Colonel Davies has a drawing of the tail feather of one of the
Chinese species of Pheasants, which is six feet in length.
, we might place them among the most brilliant of the feathered race.

At what period of time the Pheasant was introduced into this Country, it is
impossible now to ascertain. They have, in all probability, been long
naturalized in this Country. Some of our domestic fowls, it is supposed, were
introduced more than two thousand years ago, Caesar noticing them. Whether this
circumstance may assist conjecture, concerning the introduction of the
Pheasant, we dare not presume to determine. Pheasants were first brought into
Europe from the banks of the Phasis, a river of ancient Colchis, in Asia Minor:
at present it is found throughout Europe, in a wild state. It has not hitherto
been discovered in America.

The female is smaller than the male; the general color, brown, variegated
with other obscure colors, the tail is shorter than in the male; and the space
round the eye, which is bare in that sex, is covered with feathers in the
female.

They breed like the Partridge, on the ground. Lay from twelve to fifteen eggs,
smaller than those of the hen, and of a paler color than those of the
Partridge. The young follow the females like Chickens.

Several authors have noticed a circumstance of this bird, which surprising as
it may appear, is by no means peculiar to the Pheasant only. After the hen has
done laying and setting, the plumage of the female becomes like that of the
male, and she is then entirely neglected by him. Salerne, Edwards, and others,
have mentioned this of the Pheasant, Guinea Hen, Rock Manakin, etc. and Mr. J.
Hunter had a paper in the Philosophical Transactions on that subject. Latham
observes, that it does not always require mature age to give the hen Pheasant
the appearance of the male.

The length of the White Fronted Goose exceeds two feet; the weight is about
five pounds. It has neither beauty of colors or elegance of form to render it
an interesting species. The white space on the forehead is the most striking
peculiarity of the bird, and its name is sufficiently characteristic of that
part, to distinguish it from every other British species of the Duck tribe. It
is found in the fens in small flocks, during winter, and migrates in March. In
England it is rather uncommon.

Linnaeus considered the White Fronted Goose as the female of the Bernacle
Goose, of which credulity has reported so much, and we may think naturalists
have said too little; for it seems yet, but doubtful with some Ornithologists
whether the opinion of Linnaeus be wholly unfounded in truth or not, though
they have ventured to separate them into distinct species.

As many kinds of the Duck tribe inhabit the lakes and forests of Lapland, and
other arctic regions, during the breeding season, it is difficult in some
instances, to distinguish the mere differences of sex or age from specific
distinctions. The bernacle of which the white fronted Goose has been supposed
the female, were believed about two hundred years to be bred on the coast of
Scotland; but those who asserted this, declared also, that they were generated
out of decayed wood, or were hatched in the shell of the Lepas Antifera, a
marine production very common in those parts. It has several membranous
branches or arms, and at the end of each, is situated a multivalve shell. The
feathered beard of the fish hanging out of the shell, were the supposed
feathers or limbs of the young Tree Geese, as they were called by the
projectors of this whimsical hypothesis.

Amongst the common birds that inhabit this Country, the Goldfinch claims a
decided preference to our attention. It would be superfluous to expatiate on
the beauty of a bird so well known, and difficult to add any information to its
general history, that has escaped the notice of ornithologists.

The Goldfinch is found throughout Europe, and in many parts of Africa and
Asia. The varieties of it are numerous. Latham mentions no less than eight
kinds. One of these is like the common sort, except the fore part of the head,
which is red, and about the eyes white. Another, supposed to be a mixed breed
with the Lark, has a flesh-coloured bill, irides yellowish; head, throat, and
neck black, spotted with red near the bill; breast, back, scapulars, and rump
yellowish brown; belly, sides, thighs, and under tail coverts, white.

Instances of Goldfinches wholly white sometimes occur; one specimen of that
kind is preserved in the Leverian Museum, and another, in which those parts
only, which are red in the common sort, have a glossy tinge of that color. A
third sort in the same collection, is white except the crown of the head, which
is mottled with red, and a crescent of the same color under the throat; the
wings are yellowish.

Goldfinches of the opposite extreme of color are not uncommon. Some are
entirely black with a slight trace of red about the head, in others even this
trace is obliterated. Birds that are fed on hemp seed, of which the Goldfinch
will eat freely, often become entirely black. Buffon mentions one, in which the
head only was of that color. Willughby and Ray describe a variety that had no
red on the head, but a saffron-coloured ring surrounded the bill. Brown has
another, with the head striped alternately with red and yellow. Buffon and
Brisson have a sort, in which the wings and tail are brownish ash color: and
that part dingy, which in the common sort is yellow. In young birds of the
common sort the head is gray.

The nest of the Goldfinch is curiously constructed of moss, liver-wort,
thistle-down, etc. and lined with wool, hair, and the down of the sallow. It
lays five eggs, of a whitish color, and marked with deep purple spots.

These birds breed twice in a year. In winter they assemble in flocks.
Generally frequent places where thistles grow in abundance, being particularly
fond of the seeds of those plants.

This is the only species of its genus we have in Britain. Brisson and Linnaeus
place it with the Land Rail or Crake; and Ray with the Water Hens. Pennant
observing the difference between the essential characters of the two latter
tribes, and that of the Water Rail, constitutes a new genus of our species. The
Water Rail is distinguished by its slender, compressed and incurvated bill. The
Crake (Gallinule) by the base of the upper mandible reaching far upon the
forehead, and being membranaceous: the bill is also thick at the base, and
sloping to the point.

The length of the Water Rail is twelve inches, breadth sixteen inches, weight
four ounces. It frequents the rushy and sheltered sides of rivulets and ponds,
among which it can conceal itself from danger. It is a very shy bird. Flies
indifferently, but walks with great celerity, and has been seen to run on the
surface of the water when there has been any weeds to bear it up Latham.
.

The Egg is more than an inch and an half in length; of a pale yellowish
color, marked with dusky spots.

This species is little inferior in size to the Golden Eagle. The length is
three feet six inches; it is a stout bird, and is armed with formidable talons:
it may be distinguished from the Golden Eagle by the legs, which are, for half
their length, bare of feathers in the Sea Eagle: the legs of the Golden Eagle,
on the contrary, are feathered to the toes.

It inhabits most parts of Europe. In these kingdoms it is found, in Scotland
and Ireland; and sometimes, though rarely, in England. Our specimen was shot in
the Hebrides. It is observed of this species, that it grows much larger in
North America than in Europe. In Russia and Siberia it is very common.

This Bird lives chiefly on Fish, which it takes in the same manner as the
Osprey. It is supposed that the Eagle mentioned by Kolben, is this species; he
says, at the Cape of Good Hope it feeds on the Land Tortoises, which it carries
into the air to a considerable height, and, by letting it fall on some rock,
dashes the shell in pieces, that it may more easily pick out the flesh.

These Birds are common in the summer throughout England, and are sometimes met
with in the winter: it frequents several northern countries, such as Sweden,
Norway, Russia, Siberia, Greenland, etc. It is also found in Jamaica, in
Carolina, and other parts of North America.

It frequents the borders of ponds and lakes, and makes its nest among the
reeds, grass, etc. The nest is large, and contains fourteen or fifteen, some
say twenty eggs, two inches and a quarter in length, of a pale brownish white,
sprinkled with minute chocolate-coloured spots, in a very regular manner.

The food consists of small Fish and water Insects, grain, roots of plants,
etc. which it takes partly by diving into the water. The adult birds are as
large as a small fowl. The color of the skin on the forehead, Brisson says, is
of a full red; Latham says it is white, except in the season of incubation,
when it is not of a full red, though it is tinged with that color.

It is the opinion of Pennant, that all the beautiful varieties of Pigeons, so
highly esteemed by Pigeon-fanciers, are descended originally from one species,
the Stock Dove. Latham has, with considerable industry, arranged these fancy
varieties under their Linnean specific names, which Pennant has omitted.
Brisson imagines that the Roman Pigeon, Columba Hispanica of Linneus, has given
birth to all these varieties.

That kind called the Carrier, is much celebrated for its particular attachment
to its native place. It was anciently used in many eastern countries to convey
letters with expedition; at present the custom is not so general. Joinville
speaks of them in the crusade of St. Louis to Palestine; and Tasso in the siege
of Jerusalem, etc. The custom of conveying letters by means of these Birds, may
be traced to a very early period. It is not only related of them, but of
Swallows, by Pliny and Aelian, that they were employed on such service; and the
earliest poets, who generally intermingled some truth with their allegory, made
the Dove the messenger of the lover, and emblem of innocence, "Gentle Dove,
"Whither fly'st thou from above?"
"From Anacreon, friend, I rove,
Bearing mandates to his love."
Anacreon, Ode 9, to Bathyllus.

All writers on Egypt mention the vast number of Pigeons that are bred in that
part of the world, where they proverbially constitute a great portion of the
poor husbandman's estate. In Persia also they are bred in immense numbers. They
are altogether a pleasing and useful species in whatever country they are
domesticated Their dung is used for tanning leather, is a valuable manure for
the land, and is employed in medicine: formerly saltpetre was collected from
it. It is used for many other purposes by distant nations. -- Vide Lath.
.

In a wild state these Birds have two broods in a year; in a state of
confinement, sometimes three. They usually lay two eggs at a time, and sit from
fourteen to seventeen days before the young are hatched. They migrate in vast
multitudes into the south of England at the approach of winter, and return
again in spring. They frequent woody places, and commonly build in the hollows
of decayed trees.

The Nightingale is very common in England, except in the northern parts, where
it is never seen. It comes in the beginning of April, and leaves us in August.
It is found in Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, China, and Japan. The
female makes her nest in a low coppice or quickset hedge, that is thickly
clothed with foliage. It is composed of hay, and reeds, intermingled with oak
leaves, etc. She lays four or five eggs of a greenish brown color. The male
scarcely differs from the female.

In the evening the Nightingale begins a song that continues till morning.
Concealed in some thicket, this charming songster pours forth those melodious
strains, whose harmony, sweetness and variety, combine to fill the mind with
soft emotions of sensibility, and endear solitude to the contemplative man. The
Nightingale is the favorite of every rural poet, and the loftiest genius has
constantly noticed it in his solemn descriptions of evening, or of night.

" -- The wakeful bird
Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid
Tunes her nocturnal note."
" -- The amorous bird of night
Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening star
On his hill-top to light the bridal lamp."
Milton's Paradise Lost. The Nightingale is sometimes kept in cages. Those
reared from the nest are better than such as are caught in a wild state,
because they sing throughout the year, except in the time of moulting. Those
which are caught begin to sing about six or eight days after. Mr. Latham says,
that neither this nor the Blackcap is found in Ireland. Mr. Pennant says it
does not inhabit Scotland, though Sibbald places it in his list of the Birds of
that country.

In compliance with preceding writers on the ornithology of Great Britain, we
have added the Peacock to our work: the propriety of placing that magnificent
Indian species, with the humble and simple-coloured birds of this country, we
presume not to defend. We may proudly claim it for a British domesticated
species, but other nations of Europe have the same privilege. Of the beauty of
a bird so well known, and which has excited admiration in all ages, we can say
little: language would but feebly express the variety and brilliance of colors
that profusely adorn the plumes of this majesty creature.

Peacocks were known three thousand years ago. In the days of Solomon, the
Tarshish fleet of that monarch brought them to Jerusalem. In Greece they were
also known very early: at Athens they were highly prized. It is supposed they
were carried hence to Samos, where they were preserved near the temple of Juno.
The epicures of Greece thought them a delicacy; and the young Pea-fowl is
esteemed among us. It is said, that when Alexander was in India he sound vast
numbers on the banks of the Hyarotis, and was so delighted with their beauty,
that he appointed a punishment for those who should kill any of them. -- It is
also found in Africa.

In our climate the Peacock does not come to its full plumage till the third
year. The female lays five or six greyish eggs, the size of those of a Turkey:
the time of sitting is from twenty-seven to thirty days. The young are fed on
barley-meal, chopped leeks, and curd; the old ones on wheat, barley, etc.

It is an Italian proverb, that the Peacock has the appearance of an angel, and
voice of the devil; for its cry is exceedingly inharmonious. In India, it is
related, that they are taken by carrying lights to the trees where they roost,
and having painted representations of the bird presented to them at the same
time: when they put out the neck to look at the figure, the sportsman slips the
noose over their heads and secures them. It is said also, that the inhabitants
of the mountains on both sides of the Ganges take them with a kind of
bird-lime, made from oils and the juices of certain trees.

As we believe a figure of that superb variety of the common Peacock, Le Paon
Panache^; of Buffon, would be more acceptable to the reader than the sort which
so frequently occurs, we have preferred it for this work. It is a most superb
and elegantly variegated specimen: and we only regret that the limits of our
plate, and imperfect state of that, imitative art, coloring, will not permit
us to do justice to its incomparable beauty. The original measures seven feet,
of which the train forms a considerable part. This appendage, which is usually
mistaken for the tail itself, rises from the back and descends to a vast
length. The tail is not more than one foot and an half in length, and consists
of eighteen brownish-grey feathers. The female has a very short train, and the
spurs are generally wanting.

Length of this species fourteen inches, breadth twenty-one, weight fifteen
ounces. It is a common bird in this country, frequents the sides of rivers and
ponds, and is supposed to feed on small fish, and on plants.

It has two or three broods in the summer; the nest is usually placed on a low
stump near the water, and contains seven eggs of a dirty white color,
sparingly speckled and spotted with rust color, and nearly two inches in
length. The female is smaller than the male, the colors are throughout much
paler, and the throat is sometimes white; in some birds it is gray, in others
the color of the rest of the neck.

This species varies exceedingly in the colors of the plumage. In some the
principal color is a kind of chocolate brown, in others deep black. It varies
no less also in the disposition of the white spaces on the head, neck, and body
in different birds. In the male, the fore part and sides of the head are of a
reddish gray, with an oval black spot on each side of the neck, a little below
the head; the remainder of the neck white. The female has only the sides of the
head white (except the belly), the neck being of a dusky black in general;
though specimens have been seen, that much resemble the adult male bird. The
color of the legs vary much in different specimens also.

Linnaeus divided the supposed male and female into two species; the first he
called ANAS GLACIALIS, the other ANAS HYEMALIS. Later authors, who have had
more opportunity of observing their manners of life, have supposed them only
the two sexes of one species.

Mr. Pennant, in his Arctic Zoology, uppen. describes the two Linnaean species
as the two sexes of ANAS GLACIALIS; and Mr. Latham since, in his Index
Ornithologious, places Anas Glacialis as the adult male; this is the bird which
Buffon calls, canard a longue queue; that which Ray terms Anas caudacuta,
Havelda' Mr. Latham describes as the young male. () The female had been
described by Mr. Pennant in the Arctic Zoology Vol. 11. p. 76.
: Mr. Latham makes it the (g.) of Anas Glacialis: -- the same author has added
further, the Querquedula ferroensis, of Brisson, or Sarcelle de Ferroe, of
Buffon, as the (d.) of the same species.

These Birds frequent the more northern parts of the world, such as Sweden,
Lapland, Greenland, etc. and only visit the English coasts in very rigorous
winters. In the orknies they are seen in flocks from October to April. These
Birds living chiefly on the water, dive and swim well, and subsist on small
shellfish. They build their nests among the grass, etc. on the sea shore. The
variety mentioned by Mr. Latham, which is called O'Edel by the inhabitants of
the Ferroe isles, has the black streak down the middle of the crown to the hind
head, as in our specimen, from which we have been led to consider our Bird a
variety also.

The length of our Bird is twenty-one inches.

The length of this Bird is twelve inches, its breadth twenty-one inches, and
its weight exceeds five ounces. In this country these birds are not uncommon,
except in the northem parts. They frequent fens and marshes in the breeding
season, but separate and conceal themselves in the winter.

Its noise is similar to that of the lapwing, whose manners it also imitates
when it is disturbed. It lays four eggs, of a whitish olive color, marked with
irregular black spots. In winter the colors of these Birds become paler.

The Redshank is found in most parts of Europe and America. Mr. Latham
describes a variety of this species from the drawings of the late Dr.
Fothergill, which inhabits the marshes of China.

Supplement, in which he says, that in such of the owl genus as he has seen, the
male was larger than the female, and therefore the owls differ in that respect
from all other birds of prey.

It need scarcely be said that the white owl is common in every part of
England, and is generally sound throughout the continent of Europe. It inhabits
North and South America, and is very frequent in some parts of Asia. Except in
the breeding season, it lives in barns and outhouses, where it is useful in
destroying the mice that infest such places. In the breeding season it retires
to holes in lofty buildings, or the hollows of trees.

Some species of owls see well in the daytime: the white owl has not that
faculty; it is only in the twilight in mornings and evenings, or in moonlight
nights, that it can see clearly to take its prey. While the young are in the
nest, the male and female go alternately in quest of food, make a circuit round
the fields, drop on their prey instantly, and return with it in their claws.

These birds cast up the fur or feather of the creatures they devour in the
form of small pellets, like those of the hawk tribe.

Redpole is known to breed in the mountains of Wales Barrington Miscel. p. 217.
. Mr. Pennant saw the nest of this species on an alder stump near a brook,
about two or three feet from the ground. The outside was composed of dried
stalks of grass, and other plants, intermixed with a little wool: it was lined
with hair and a few feathers. The eggs, four in number, were of a pale bluish
green, thickly sprinkled near the blunt end with small reddish spots.

In October and November these birds arrive near London in vast numbers. The
colors of the female are generally paler than those of the male: the spot on
the forehead is saffron color.

The male of this common but beautiful Bird is distinguished from the female by
the rich black color on the crown of the head, and the crimson on the cheeks,
breast, belly, and throat, those parts being of an obscure hue in the female.

In the winter and spring it frequents gardens, and does much injury to the
fruit trees. In summer it retires into the woods to breed. It forms a nest
chiefly of moss, about six feet from the ground, and deposits five or six
bluish eggs, marked with dark spots. The wild note of this Bird is not admired,
though they may be taught to whistle any tune in a tame state, and are then
much valued.

There are several varieties of this species, one of them in particular, is
entirely black. Instances are recorded of these birds, after being taken in
full feather, in the course of three or four years becoming jet black, and then
again recovering their former colors.

This Bird is common in many parts of Great Britain in summer, and departs
before winter, except in Ireland, where it is supposed they remain throughout
the year. Being constantly found in company with the Quails, the Crake has been
called in many countries, their king, or leader.

Independent of a striking generical difference, the manners of these birds are
altogether distinct from those of the Water Rail, with which it has been
sometimes confounded. It is found among corn, grass, broom, or furze on heaths,
and never in watery places. It lays ten or twelve eggs of a reddish white
color, marked with ferruginous blotches: feeds on all kinds of infects, and on
grain; and its flesh is much esteemed.

Length of this species is nine inches and a half; weight, from six to eight
ounces. Its note has been compared to the word Crek often repeated; and hence
its name, Crake.

The Hooded Crow is not uncommon during winter in many parts of England. With
us it is a bird of passage. In those countries where is breeds, it retreats to
the mountains for that time, and descends into the plains as the winter
approaches. In many parts of Scotland it is the only species of crow known, and
in the northern islands and mountains, it is said to remain the whole year.

Like the rook and crow, this Bird feeds on carrion and the offals of animals;
and also on shellfish, which they find on the banks of rivers; at other times,
on seeds and grain, and mountain-berries. They are more elegant and varied in
their plumage than the common crow, but not less mischievous to young birds, or
any wounded or defenseless animals. Their nests are built in trees, and
commonly contain six eggs. The length of this Bird is twenty-one inches.

The Glossy Ibis is extremely rare in this country. It is not noticed by Mr.
Pennant in the last editions of the British Zoology. Dr. Latham has placed it
in his list of British Birds, but mentions only one instance of its being found
in England. "In the Leverian Museum is one of these, which was shot in
Cornwall." Lath. Genesis Syn. v. 5.

Our specimen of this species, we are informed, was also shot in England, and
on diffection proved to be a male. Whether the specimen from which Dr. Latham's
description is taken, differed in sex from this, we are unable to determine.
The description does not exactly agree with our bird; and the specimen referred
to, is removed from the Leverian collection. In the description, the eyes are
placed in a white space: the eyes in our Bird are surrounded with black. The
legs are also described of an olive color in the dead bird, and green when
living; those parts appear reddish in our preserved specimen: we had no
opportunity of observing the true color in the living bird; but it must
certainly have been more of a red, or at least reddish brown, than olive.
Neither of these differences, however, affect the essential character of the
species; and we consider our bird, beyond dispute, the Glossy Ibis of Dr.
Latham. The length of this Bird exceeds twenty-two inches.

This is a very abundant species throughout Europe. In England, its manners of
life are so well known, that we avoid entering into a minute detail of them.
The colors of the female are dull; and it has scarcely any yellow about the
head. -- The male is a very pretty bird; liable, however, to variation in
different specimens. In some, the head is brown, in others yellow, marked with
brown; in birds of fine plumage it is of a beautiful yellow; the colors
throughout very full, with the yellow delicately blended into the olive, and

These Birds feed on grain and insects. They make a large nest of hay and
straw, mixed with moss, and dried leaves, and lined with hair and wool. The
nest is generally placed on the ground, or in a low bush. It lays five or six
eggs, veined irregularly with purplish or brown color, and sparingly blotched
with the same. There is more than one brood of this species in the year.

This is certainly the new species of Tern, which has been found on the
Sandwich coast, and described under the name Sandvicensis Catalogue of British
Birds. Vide Supplement of Synopsis. Altered to Sterna Eoyill in Idex Ora.
by Mr. Latham: Our specimen does not precisely agree with the description
given by that author; but the following considerations seem to justify our
conclusion.

The plumage of many Birds differ considerably in colors and markings in the
various stages of their growth; and even in the adult state, we frequently
observe varieties which it is difficult to refer to their true species. -- From
the general appearance of the Bird before us, it has been thought the young of
the common Tern, and it stands for such in the Leverian Museum: It cannot
however be the young Bird of that species; in the contour it is obviously
different, and the form of the beak, with other striking peculiarities, must
certainly remove it from that species.

Mr. Latham, in describing the Sandwich Tern, says, the back and wings are a
pale hoary lead color, and in the young Birds are much clouded with brown: he
says also the head is much dotted with white in some specimens; but observes,
that all Terns with black heads are liable to the same variation In the adult
common Tern, the black of the head extends to the base of the bill; in the
Sandwich Tern the forehead is white.
. Thus far our specimen may be considered as the Sandwich Tern; but the color
of the legs and claws of that Bird is uniformly said to be black, while in ours
they are orange: this is however accidental, and by no means a permanent
character; the orange-coloured legs and feet is striking, but not invariable in
the Common Tern, as is proved by the variety b with black feet, described by
Mr. Latham in the Index Ornithologicus Sterna Hirundo. b. var. pedibus nigris,
rectricibus extimis toto albis. Lath. Ind. O^n. 2. 808. 15. -- Phil. Trans.

; we also find a specimen of the Sandwich Tern in the British Museum, which has
the legs and feet of a dull yellowish or orange color, and differs from the
specimen we have figured only in the form of the tail, which is not forked as
in the adult Birds.

The Sterna Navia of Linnaeus, and La Guiffette of Buffon, is considered by Mr.
Latham as the young Bird of the Sandwich Tern. Our specimen differs very little
from the descriptions given by these authors.

Length of our Bird fourteen inches. It was shot in the Chelsea road.

This elegant species is scarce in Great Britain. It is of the migratory kind;
but is known to breed here. Mr. Latham says in Cumberland.

This is a solitary creature, living entirely among reeds in marshy places. The
nest is very singular, and is built on the water; it is composed of rushes
matted together in form of a boat, and is fastened by one end to a reed that it
may float in security on the water while the female sits on the eggs.

The length of this bird is nine inches.

The manners and economy of this little creature are familiar to every one. It
frequents inhabited places in the winter; in summer it retires into thickets or
decayed buildings to breed. The nest is composed of dried leaves mixed with
hair and moss, and lined with feathers: it contains from five to seven eggs of
a dusky white color, sprinkled with irregular reddish spots. The young birds
are very unlike the adults, being spotted with white.

The Robin has been chosen by our earliest poets to pourtray instinctive
affection toward man. An artless tale An ancient and simple ballad, Tit Bales
in the Wood.
: a pathetic appeal to the tenderest feelings, pleads its behalf to the infant
mind, and maturer age rather cherishes than discards its first impressions.
Hence the Robin, through successive ages, has become an object of fondness, and
superstitious respect; and, as if conscious of our pity and protection, it
boldly visits our dwellings in winter, and claims that subsistence the
inclement season denies.

-- "The RED-BREAST, sacred to the household gods,
Wisely regardful of the embroiling sky,
In joyless fields and thorny thickets leaves
His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man
His annual visit. Half afraid, he first
Against the windows beats: then brisk alights
On the warm hearth; then hopping over the floor,
Eyes all the family askance,
And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is,
Till more familiar grown, the table crumbs
Attract his slender feet."
THOMSON. Divested of the pleasing poetic similes that are interwoven with the
history of the Robin, it is a savage little animal, and in perpetual warfare
with its own species, and every other tribe of small birds. It feeds on insects
and seeds, or when pressed by hunger, on many other kinds of food. The note is
fine and soft.

This is the parent stock of our domesticated or common Duck, The varieties in
a tame state are endless, but they uniformly preserve one character by which we
can trace them to this wild origin; this is the short curled tail feathers of
the Drakes, which are constant in all its varieties of plumage, and the form of
the bill in both sexes, whether in a wild or domestic state.

These birds are so well known, that we bestow little attention on their
beauty; or we should consider the Mallard Drake the most beautiful of the
web-footed birds that inhabit this country. The plumage throughout is of
singular richness, and the various dotted streaks and lines on the plainer
colors are uncommonly elegant, The colors of the female, as in other
instances, are more simple.

Wild Ducks abound in this country, but are no where more plenty than in the
fens of Lincolnshire In only ten decoys, in the neighborhood of Wainfleet,
thirty-one thousand two hundred have been taken in one season. -- British
Zoology.
. The means of taking these birds are various, and have been described with
minuteness by many authors. The method in common use in England is to set large
decoy nets in the places they frequent, and by means of a trained bird entice
them into its labyrinths The decoy nets are generally placed on a piece of
water nearly surrounded with wood, that the birds may not be frightened or
disturbed. They are so contrived, that different pipes lead to it from several
directions; these pipes are so many avenues of network supported by hoops,
which become gradually narrower from the opening, and lead up a ditch, at the
end of which the funnel net is placed. Along these pipes, at proper intervals,
are screens of reeds, behind which the decoy man conceals himself from the
birds. The Ducks trained for decoys are fed on hemp seed, which being light,
floats on the surface of the water. When the evening sets in, the decoy man
throws some of the seeds from behind one of the screens to the trained bird;
this entices him into the pipe, and the wild fowl follow. When they arrive at a
certain part of the avenue, the decoy bird dives under the water, and the rest
pass on till they enter the purse net, where they are taken. -- Brit. Zool.
etc. etc.
. The inhabitants of other countries have also various and peculiar
contrivances to entrap these, and others of the water fowl. These birds breed
in marshy places, and lay from ten to sixteen eggs. Dr. Latham says they are
sometimes known to lay the eggs in a high tree, in a deserted Magpie, or Crow's
nest, and mentions an instance of one being sound at Etchingham in Sussex,
sitting upon nine eggs, in an Oak, twenty-five feet from the ground: the eggs
were supported by twigs laid crossways Lath. Genesis Syn.
