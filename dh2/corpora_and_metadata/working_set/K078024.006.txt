THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BRITISH INSECTS.
PLATE CLXXXI. PHALAENA SYRINGARIA. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

GEOMETRA. SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings angulated, indented, fine
light gray, with shades of flesh color and brown: a brown mark across the
Wings, which in an expanded Insect forms a festoon.

The English name has been given to this Moth by some collectors, on account of
its being found a local species, and most frequent in Richmond park.

The Larva of this Insect has a very singular appearance, to which the hook on
the back greatly contributes when it is nearly full fed and going into the pupa
state. It feeds on the Jasmine and Lilac, and does not thrive well on any other
plants. It is in the Caterpillar state in April, changes to chrysalis in May:
the Fly comes forth in June.


PLATE CLXXXII. MELOE MONOCEROS. HORNED MELOE. COLEOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae globular, last globule oval. Thorax roundish.
Elytra soft. Head gibbous.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax pointed like a horn over the head.
Shells brown, with a longitudinal streak and spot on each.

Monoceros. Lin. Fn. Sv. 638. Schaeff. Icon. tab. 188. fig. 3.

Linnaeus seems to have found much difficulty in determining the genus of this
insect; once placing it amongst the Attelabi of his system, and thence removing
it to the Meloe tribe. Geoffroy has another generical name, notoxus, and this
Fabricius has adopted in his last work.

This is certainly a most singular Insect, and altogether unlike any other we
know of in England. We cannot say whether it feeds on any particular food, or
what are its peculiarities, for we have only seen one specimen besides that
from which the annexed drawing is taken; and the only information we receive
from the authors above quoted is, that it is a native of Europe; and is found
on umbelliferous plants. It was taken in May.

PLATE CLXXXIII. PHALAENA CAMELINA. DARK PROMINENT MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

Bombyx. SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. First wings fine rust color, with
two oblique waves across: indented edges: posterior margin, with one large and
one small tuft prominent on the upper part of the Insect when at rest.

The Caterpillar of this Moth is found in August, on the leaves of the Oak,
Willow, Lime, etc. The Moth comes forth late in May, or early in June.


PLATE CLXXXIV. PAPILIO ARION. MAZARINE BLUE BUTTERFLY. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed. Wings when at rest, erect. Fly by day.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Above brown, disk of the wings fine blue,
with black spots. Beneath gray, with a number of small eyes.

Icon. tab. 98. fig. 5. 6. Esp. pap. 1. tab. 20. fig. 2.

Papilio Arion is a very scarce Insect in this country; and it does not appear
to be much more common in any other part of Europe. The authors quoted above
have given figures or descriptions of it, but are entirely ignorant of its
larva, or pupa; and Fabricius, who has selected the observations of all the
preceding authors who have described it, says only, Habitat in Europae Pratis.

Mr. Lemon, a collector of eminence some years since, met with it in England.
We have a specimen which was taken by him, as appears from a note with it.
Roesel's figure is of a finer blue than any we have seen; but we have no doubt
of its being a most brilliant Insect in a recent state.


PLATE CLXXXV.
FIG. I. CHRYSOMELA CALMARIENSIS. COLEOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae knotted, enlarging toward the ends. Corselet
margined.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Oblong: yellow: a longitudinal streak of
black down each shell.

Fabricius says, this Insect lives on the Willow and Alder. It is found in
every part of Europe, but is scarce in England.

It is a very pretty species. The underside has rather a bronze appearance:
above, in recent specimens, the light color is very fine yellow, but turns
brown afterward: the stripes down the elytra are not deep black, but have a
greenish tint. -- Taken in May. Length a quarter of an inch.

FIG. II. MYCETOPHAGUS QUADRIMACULATUS. FUNGUS BEETLE WITH FOUR SPOTS.
COLEOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Palpi four, unequal. Maxilla membranaceous, with a tooth or
spine. Lip round, entire. Antennae gradually enlarge toward the end. Fab. Genesis

SPECIFIC CHARACTER Entirely black, except one large yellow brown spot on the
base of the elytra, and another near their extremities.

Three specimens of this rare species were found together, concealed in the
porous part of the Honeycomb Boletus Boletus Cellulosus.
. According to Herbst. Archiv. it is usually found on plants of this genus. It
is not scarce in Germany.

The vast addition of new species of Insects that Fabricius has made in his
latter works, renders it difficult, and in some instances impossible, to refer
them to the system of Linnaeus; and though we would at all times more willingly
refer any new kind to that system, and quote the Fabrician account amongst the
synonyms, than adopt the new generic distinctions of Fabricius, or any other
author, we must not sacrifice propriety to predilection. If Linnaeus himself
had noticed many of the newly discovered kinds, he must have altered and
improved his system to admit them; which is a great excuse for Fabricius having
made so many genera.

The little Insect before us may be referred to the Silpha genus of Linnaeus;
but as his definition of the Silphae has been subjected to so many objections
and amendments of later authors, we forbear placing it amongst them. Linnaeus
has made no distinction between such species as have perfoliated antennae, and
those with antennae increasing in bulk from the base to the end Silpha Antennae
extrorsum crassiores. Elytra marginata. Caput prominens. Thorax planiusculus,
marginatus. Linn. Genesis Ins.
, thereby including S. Vespillo with S. thoracica and S. obscura, though in an
early edition of the Fauna Suecica, S. Vespillo was amongst the Scarabaei, and
the two last with the Cassidae.

Schoeffer divided the Silphae of Linnaeus into two genera, Silpha and Peltis.
Geoffroy arranged some of them amongst his Dermestides, and formed his genus
Peltis of such as have the thorax and elytra strongly margined, and perfoliated
antennae. Geoffroy described our present subject under the name Tritoma.
Fabricius afterward, in his Mantissa, arranged it under Ips, a new genus,
formed from part of the Silphae of Linnaeus and Dermestides of Geoffroy. In the
Entomologia Systematica, he has again separated the Ips, and made Mycetophagus
a new genus of fifteen species, in which he includes this Insect.

To those who have adopted the system of Fabricius, it is unnecessary to say,
that the fundamental part of his arrangement is taken from the mouth of the
Insect, which certainly is objectionable, because that part is dry, and very
frequently injured or destroyed in Insects that have been long in a cabinet,
and is very small in most kinds when allve; so that, though we have followed
his arrangement in the generic definition, we have been less prolix than a full
elucidation of it might require.

The figures in the annexed plate 2. 2. represent the natural size and
magnified appearance.


PLATE CLXXXVI. PAPILIO HERO. SCARCE MEADOW-BROWN BUTTERFLY. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed. Wings, when at rest, erect. Fly by day.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings entire: brown above. Beneath, a large
black eye near the anterior margin of the first wings: six smaller eyes on the
second Wings.

PAPILIO HERO: alis integerrimis fulvis: subtus anticis ocello, porticis senis.

This is a local species: it is very abundant in some marshy parts of
Lancashire; but we have not learnt that it has been taken in any other part of
the kingdom. Many of the curious in London are particularly indebted to Mr.
Phillips, of Manchester, for enriching their cabinets with Papilio Hero; for,
though it is a plain Insect, it is esteemed for its rarity, few Entomologists
having traveled into that part of the country to collect Insects.


PLATE CLXXXVII. PHALAENA EXOLETA. SWORD GRASS MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

Noctua. Antennae in both sexes, like a bristle.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Wings lance-shaped, varied
with gray and brown, a kidney-shaped spot in the middle: four white spots on
the anterior margin.

PHALAENA EXOLETA: cristata, alis lanceolatis convolutis fusco cinereoque
nebulosis, punctis quatuor marginalibus albis. Fab. Syst. Ent. 617. 116. --
Spec. Ins. 2. 239. 144.
The beautiful Caterpillar of this Moth is found on Sword Grass in August.
Though its trivial name implies that it is peculiar to this plant, several
others are mentioned by authors as proper food for it, amongst these are the
Bell flower Campanula.
, Orach Atriplex.
, and common Pea. The Moth appears in May: frequents marshy places.


PLATE CLXXXVIII. HEMEROBIUS CHRYSOPS. NEUROPTERA.
Wings four, transparent, reticulated. Tail without a sting.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Mouth armed with two teeth and four palpi. Wings deflected.
Antennae setaceous. Thorax unequal.

GENERIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Greenish. Wings transparent, reticulated, with
dark spots.

This Insect was formerly held in great esteem amongst the English collectors,
on account of its rarity; and has been purchased for their cabinets at a
considerable price Half a guinea was the usual price for a pair of them.
. The late Mr. Bentley, who had been more than twenty years endeavoring to
make his cabinet the most complete in England, never met with it.

About three years since, they were taken in great plenty near London, both at
Battersea and Highgate; and have been met with in other places since that time.
Like the Ephemerae, and other gause-wing Insects, it delights in moist places,
particularly among the reeds. The larva is unknown, but we suppose that it
lives in that state in the water; and which most likely it does not leave till
it becomes a winged creature. The larva of some species of this genus feed on
the smaller kinds of Insects.

The wings are the most pleasing objects for the microscope that can be
imagined: the reticulations and feathered edges are so transparent, that they
may be examined with the deepest magnifiers, which is an advantage few objects
of such a size possess. The magnified figure is given, with the natural size in
the annexed plate.

Fabricius has erroneously quoted the seventh and eighth figure of the fifth
plate of Schaeffer's Icones, which is certainly no other than the common kind,
Hemorobius perla, and which is so often found in gardens with a fine golden
eye. The figure quoted in Sulzer and Roesel agree with our specimen.


PLATE CLXXXIX. PHALAENA MENTHRASTIRI. SPOTTED WHITE MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

Bombyx. SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. White with black spots. Abdomen
orange, with black spots.

PHALAENA MENTHRASTRI: alis deflexis albis nigro subpunctatis, abdominis dorso
fulvo nigro punctato, femoribus anticis luteis. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 1.

Knoch. Beytr. 3. tab. 2. fig. 5. 13.
This Insect has been confounded with Phalaena lubricipeda by Linnaeus; he
makes it the variety b after De Geer. In this he has been followed by many
other authors; and though Roesel, by giving the larva and pupa of each, in two
distinct plates, evidently thought them different species, his observations had
no weight with other Naturalists; even Fabricius, in his Species Insectorum,
gives them under one specific name. In his last work, Entomologia Systematica,
he has divided them, leaving the P. lubricipeda under its former name, and
giving the specific name Menthrastri to the white sort, as had been done in
Wien. Verz. 54. 2. Fabricius mentions it as a native of Germany, but from the
figure of Roesel no doubt can be entertained of its being precisely the same as
our English species.

The Caterpillars of both sorts are very general feeders; they will eat, oak,
fruit trees, and wild plants of almost every kind. They are common in the
summer, change to chrysalis about August, and appear in the winged state in May
and June; but, there is more than one brood of them in the course of the year,
so that the time of their appearance is uncertain. The Caterpillars change
their skins often; and change their colors at the same time. Those of Phalaena
Menthrastri when small are a very light transparent brown: then brown with dark
stripes. It is not black till it is in the last skin; and then, in many, the
color inclines to brown.


PLATE CXC. SPHINX CELERIO. SILVER-STRIPE HAWK MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thickest in the middle. Wings, in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly slow. Morning and evening only.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. First wings brown, with a broad oblique band
of silver white extending from the posterior margin to the tip of the wing.
Lower wings black, with six large red spots on each.

Sphinx Celerio: alis integris griseis: striis albis, posticis fuscus: maculis

Roes. Ins. 3. tab. 8. Frisch. Ins. 13. tab. 1. fig. 2. Cram. Ins. 3. tab. 25. B.

The Sphinx Celerio stands pre-eminent in the list of the Insects of this
country, whether we consider its rarity, or uncommon beauty. Indeed, amongst
the Insects of this tribe that are brought from remote countries, even from
Asia, which boasts the most splendid species, the varieties of Sphinx Celerio
are often the most beautiful; it must however be owned, that, in countries
where the climate, and luxuriance of the soil contribute to enrich the juices
of the plants on which the Insects are nourished, they are larger and their
colors more vivid than any of the same kind produced in the northern countries
of Europe.

Several years since, Mr. Francillon, of Norfolk-street in the Strand, had a
living specimen of this Insect brought to him: it was taken in Bunhill-fields
burying-ground. It is still preserved in his cabinet.

We have heard of other specimens being taken in this country; but the only
instance we can quote with confidence is, that Mr. Latham, formerly of
Dartford, and well known for his scientific researches in natural history, has
a specimen which was taken at Eltham, in Kent. Few collections of consequence
are without this Insect, but they are in general natives of Germany.

Roesel has given a figure of this Sphinx, with its larva and pupa; and, as we
could never reasonably expect to meet with it in these states in England,
correct copies of his figures are given in Plate 191. The works of Roesel are
not in the hands of many; and, we are convinced that Plate will be acceptable
to most of our readers.

Sphinx Celerio is found on the vine.



PLATE CXCII. PHALAENA HEXAPTERATA. SERAPHIM MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. First, wings varied with brown and gray.
Second pair white, with an appendage at the base of each, resembling a small
wing.

of this extraordinary Insect; but he makes no reference to any work that
contains a figure of it. The nineteenth plate of Kleman's Continuation of
Roessel's Insecten-Belustigungen, entitled Insecten-Geschichte, certainly
escaped his notice; for in that plate we find both sexes, Figures a, b: from
this account we learn that Phalaena Hexapterata is a native of Germany. The
female has four wings: the male appears at first sight to have six, which is
more than any tribe of Insects are furnished with; a small appendage very much
resembling a wing, and of the same texture, arises from the base of the second
pair of wings next the abdomen. The nerves of the true wing ramify into this
appendage; which when the Insect is expanded, give it most singular appearance.
In the annexed plate this appendage is magnified, to enable us more accurately
to exhibit its true form and tendons.

Our specimen was taken on Epping Forest in 1795. It is very rare in England.
Fabricius says it feeds on the Beech Habitat in Fago Sylvatica.
.


PLATE CXCIII. PHALAENA PYRAMIDEA. COPPER-UNDERWING MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. First wings dark brown, with three waved
stripes of yellowish color across the upper wings. Second wings ferruginous
brown.

The singular pyramidal protuberance on the posterior part of the Caterpillar
has furnished an excellent specific name for the perfect Insect. It is found on
the Oak, Sallow, and Blackthorn in May; changes to the pupa state the first
week in June; the Moth comes forth in July. The Caterpillar spins a fine white
silken web between two or three leaves in the manner represented in the plate
at Fig. 1. Fig. 2. the chrysalis, which the web envelopes. Phalaena pyramidea
is not a common species in this country.


PLATE CXCIV. CHRYSOMELA FASTUOSA. COLEOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae like a necklace of beads, increasing in bulk
toward the ends. No margin round the elytra or thorax.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Oval, shining like gold, with three
longitudinal stripes of blue on the shells.

This beautiful Insect is rarely taken in England: we sometimes receive it from
Germany, where it is more common; a variety of it is also a native of North
America.

The natural size is shown at Fig. 1. In some specimens blue is the predominant
color, in others a fine bronze or golden hue; the sexes are distinguished by
the colors in many instances.


PLATE CXCV. SPHINX ZONATA. RED-BELTED SPHINX. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thickest in the middle. Wings when at rest
deflexed. Fly slow, morning and evening only.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings transparent, veined, margined with a band, or streak
of black. Abdomen bearded at the extremity, black; with one segment in the
middle, red.

This is clearly an undescribed Insect. It bears the strongest affinity to the
Sphinx Tipuliformis of Linnaeus; but as the zone or belt of red color is an
unerring distinction of our Insect, it cannot belong to that species. Fabricius
having separated the Linnaean sphinges into three new genera, Sphinx, Sesia,
and Zygaena, this Insect must be included under the genus Sesia of his system;
two of the species he has described under that head, S. culiciformis and
t^nthrediniformis bear some resemblance to our Sphinx Zonata, but are certainly
distinct species.

Sphinx Zonata is rare in England; the natural size is shown at Fig. 1. of the
annexed plate. The fine purple appearance of the body disappears in specimens
that have been kept long in a cabinet.


PLATE CXCVI. PHALAENA WAUARIA. L, or GOOSEBERRY MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings gray: four black, irregular stripes on
the interior part of the upper wings; one resembling letter L.

Except Phalaena Grossulariata Current Moth.
, figured in the early part of this work, few species are more common than
this, on the smaller kinds of fruit trees, but particularly the Gooseberry.
Harris calls it the L Moth from a supposed resemblance of that letter in some
of the dark marks on the upper wings.

The young Caterpillars appear almost as early as the leaves, and change to
chrysalis late in may; in this state they remain about twenty days before the
Moth is produced.


PLATE CXCVII. SIREX GIGAS. LARGEST TAILED WASP. HYMENOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Two strong jaws. Palpi two. Antennae filiform, of about
twenty-four joints. Sting projected, serrated like a saw. Abdomen terminate in
a spine. Wings lance-shaped.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Abdomen of nine segments; the 3, 4, 5, 6,
black; the others yellow. Thorax hairy.

The Sirex genus, as it stands in the Entomologia Systematica of Fabribius,
includes only twenty-six species; these are chiefly European Insects; but very
few are natives of this country. The Sirex Gigas is found in the north of
Europe; it has been taken in England, but very rarely: Yeats and Berkenhout
mention it as a British species, and we have been informed that it is sometimes
taken in Scotland. It is likely to be met with in Pine forests, as the female
seems to prefer that wood to deposit her eggs in. As no English Entomologist
has attempted to describe the peculiar habits of this tribe of Insects, and
especially of Sirex Gigas, the following particulars may be satisfactory to our
readers.

The extensive forests of Germany furnished the accurate Roesel with many
opportunities of finding and observing the metamorphosis of Insects that are
rarely to be found in other parts of Europe; and this enabled him to favor the
world with a particular description and series of figures of all the changes of
Sirex Gigas, in the Bombyliorum et Vesparum of his Insecten Belustigung. His
figure of the female Insect agrees with that we have given; the male is
considerably smaller, and has no sting This is a generical distinction.
. The sting of the female consists of three parts, a sheath which divides into
two parts or valves, and a fine instrument somewhat resembling a needle; it is
with this instrument it wounds its enemies, and the sting is said to cause an
excruciating pain. The microscope discovers this part to be beset with a number
of very minute teeth, like the edge of a saw: with this sting the creature can
pierce the wood of sound trees; for we suspect, it does not always deposit its
eggs in such as are decayed, but rather in such as will supply the larva with
nourishment when it is hatched. The eggs are laid in clusters of two or three
hundred together; they are of a pale yellow color, about the thirtieth part of
an inch in length, and shaped like a weaver's shuttle. The larva lives in the
body of the tree, enlarging its habitation as it increases in size, for it
never leaves the tree till it becomes a winged creature. The larva when full
grown is about an inch and a quarter in length, and as thick as a goose quill.
It is a heavy sluggish creature, almost cylindrical, the head very small, and
the whole of an uniform pellucid yellowish color. It has a small spine at the
end of the body like those by which the larva of some spinges are
distinguished: this spine is also a striking character in the perfect Sirex. In
the pupa the form of the winged creature is more visible than in the larva
state; it is of a browner color than the larva, and the rudiment of the sting
and legs are very visible.

In the early editions of the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus, the sirices are
arranged with the ichneumons in one genus; but later observations induced
Linnaeus to make two genera of them in his last works. Geoffroy and Schaeffer
have added some particulars to the Linnaean generic character; these
principally relate to the number of joints in the tarsi.


PLATE CXCVIII. SCOLOPENDRA FORFICATA. APTERA. WITHOUT WINGS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The same number of feet as segments of the body. Antennae
setaceous. Palpi two, jointed. Body depressed or flat.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Feet fifteen on each side.

This singular creature not only changes its skin several times; but, as it
advances in age the segments of which the body is composed increase in number:
the Insect when full grown has nine such segments. Linnaeus mentions it as a
native of America: in many parts of Europe it is not uncommon: in England it is
found under loose stones in damp places, and runs swiftly.

Fabricius has made a false quotation under this species to the Fundamenta
Entomologica of Schaeffer; as errors will occur in the most accurrate works, we
should not deem it necessary to notice this circumstance, if he had not
continued the same mistake from his Species Insectorum published in 1781 to his
last work Entomologia Systematica, emenda et aucta, etc. published in 1793. --
his reference is Schaeff. Elem. tab. 3. fig. 1. -- On examining that part of
Schaeffer's works, we find the figure he quotes is a spider! Scolopendra
forficata is given in the 46th plate of Vol. I. of that author's Icones
Insectorum circa Rastisbonam indigenorum, etc. as quoted amongst the synonyms
above.

The Scolopendra forficata is, we believe, the largest of the genus found in
this country. In many parts of the world, some kinds are found of a frightful
size and aspect; the Scolopendra Morsitans of the East Indies, is about five
inches in length, and as thick as a goose quill. Sir G. Staunton, in his
Historical Account of the Embassy to China, mentions the Scolopendras and
scorpions of that country: we have one species of the former from China that
exceeds in magnitude every one of the genus we have seen from other parts of
the world, and is perhaps the largest known; it is near one foot in length, and
is about one inch and an half round the girth of the body; the color is of a
fine shining chestnut brown, the legs inclining to yellow. The most singular
Insect of this kind in England is the Scolopendra electrica, which sometimes
omits a spark or flash of light in the dark.

PLATE CXCIX. PAPILIO C. album: COMMA BUTTERFLY. LEPIDOPTERA.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings deeply scalloped, angulated, reddish
brown, with black spots. Beneath, a white spot resembling letter C on the under
wings.

In colors and markings the Comma Butterfly seems at first sight allied to
Papilio Urticae (Tortoiseshell Butterfly), but the elegant scallops of the
margins of the wings sufficiently distinguishes it from every other British
species: indeed wings indentated in this remarkable manner are rarely seen in
any Insects, those from foreign countries not excepted. Papilio Gaureum, a
native of Asia according to Fabricius, and figured amongst the Insects found in
North America, by Abbot, approaches nearer to it than any distinct species we
are acquainted with. The larva is known by a broad white space on the back that
extends from the posterior extremity to the eighth joint of the body: it has
one peculiarity that must not be omitted; when it is suspended by the tail from
a small twig or leaf, the head is bent upwards, and the whole creature
perfectly resembles hook.

There is more than one brood of this species in a year: the Butterflies are
generally found in June, the second brood late in August. The Caterpillars are
sometimes found in February, but oftener in July; they remain about a fortnight
in chrysalis.


PLATE CC. PAPILIO DAPLIDICE. BATH-WHITE BUTTERFLY. LEPIDOPTERA.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings round, white. Margin brown, underside
marked with yellow, green, and white spots.

In a former description we have noticed the locality of one species of the
Butterfly tribe (Pap. Hero) in this country; of the Pap. Daplidice we have also
to observe, that it is only found in the environs of Bath. We have been
informed that it is found in some part of Scotland, but our information does
not fully authorize us to give it as a native of that part of the British
empire. If it is any where common, it is in Germany and in Hungary. It is found
in Africa, and we have also a variety of it from North America. Fabricius does
not mention it as a native of England; and it is so scarce with us that few
English cabinets have a specimen of it. The trivial appellation Bath-White
Butterfly has been given to it by some English Entomologists. The small number
of foreign authors who have figured this species sufficiently notes its
scarcity in Europe, and we are not acquainted with the works of any English
author that has a figure of it.


PLATE CCI. PANORPA COMMUNIS. NEUROPTERA.

The Panorpa communis is very common in fields in the summer. Its metamorphosis
is entirely unknown.

The tail of the male is armed with a weapon, somewhat resembling the sting of
a scorpion. The tail of the female has an appendage, but very different in its
structure. Those parts of both sexes are represented in our plate, of the
natural size, and magnified.


PLATE CCII.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae feathered. Wings green, with brown
spots near the margins.

This appears to be a local species. It has been found for many years past in
the month of June, near the Oak of Honor, by Peckham. We have never heard that
it has been taken in any other place in England.

Fabricius refers only to one author for this species. He says it feeds on the
oak. We are uncertain whether it has ever been figured in any work before.

FIG. II. PHALAENA ALBICILLATA. CLIFDEN BEAUTY. LEPIDOPTERA. PHALAENA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae setaceous. Wings whitish in the
disk, with a broad margin of pale black. A large dark spot on the interior part
of the upper wings.

The trivial appellation, Clifden Beauty, has been given to this Insect by some
early English entomologists, who had not met with it in any other part of the
country. It has since been taken in several other parts of the kingdom; but in
Kent particularly. Clerk deemed it worthy of a place among his rarities; and it
is still considered an exceeding scarce and fine species. Our specimen was
taken in June, 1797, in Darent Wood, Dartford.

FIG. III. PHALAENA PORCELLATA. CLIFDEN BEAUTY LIKENESS. LEPIDOPTERA. PHALAENA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae setaceous. First wings white, with
three brown bands, a white spot on the exterior one. Second wings white, with a
brown margin.

The similarity of this to the foregoing species, induced us to figure both on
the same Plate. Phalaena Porcellata is very common in summer. It appears in the
winged state about the latter end of May. Linnaeus has not described this
Insect. Fabricius has given its specific character, above quoted. We suspect
that it has not been figured by any author.


PLATE CCIII. FULGORA EUROPAEA. EUROPEAN LANTERN CARRIER. HEMIPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Forehead elongated. Antennae below the eyes, consist of two
articulations. Beak or rostrum bent inwards under the body.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Fore part of the head conic, body green.
Wings transparent, reticulated.

9. fig. 5. Stoll. Cicad. 1. tab. 11. fig. 51.

Simple as this little creature may appear to the general reader, the
Entomologists of this country esteem it a rarity; for it was not imagined that
England produced any species of its singular genus till lately.

Mr. Yeats, in his Institutions of Entomology, mentions two species of it that
have been caught in this country; one by Mr. Hudson, author of the Flora
Anglica, the other by Mr. Gray. It is to be lamented, that he does not inform
us precisely what were the species. We learn that Fulgora Europaea was the
Insect taken by Mr. Hudson; the other seems undetermined.

The Fulgora Europaea very much resembles some of the Cicadae in form and size,
and have, therefore, been probably overlooked by English collectors of Insects.
Fabricius describes it as a native of France and Germany; but it is very scarce
in cabinets of foreign Insects also. Perhaps it is not common in any country.

This species does not exhibit any prominent features of its singular genus; it
has only a small conic hollow projection, or lantern, on the forepart of the
head, instead of the large projection that characterise most of the exotic
Fulgorae. It is not unlikely, however, that it may possess, though in a small
degree, the astonishing property of diffusing a radiance of light, which
particularly distinguish F. Lanternarid of South America, F. Candelaria of
China, and several other species. The light of some of these Insects, according
to the reports of Naturalists, and travelers in foreign countries, is
sufficiently vivid and constant to answer many purposes. Some of the Catholic
missionaries assert, that they could see distinctly to read and write by the
light of one of them; and that several of them being fastened together, serve
to light the Indians when they travel in the night.

The rostrum, or beak, through which the Fulgorae Europaea (like others of the
same genus) sucks its nutriment, seems to form a part of the hollow projection
in the front of the head; the tube lays close to the belly, between the six
legs. To explain the singular structure of this tube or rostrum, we have given
a front and a profile view of it as it appeared under the lens of a microscope.

Our specimen is altogether green, except the wings; the recticulations of
which are also of the same color; and as in Sulzer's figure, the clear parts
of the wings were strongly tinged with green also.


PLATE CCIV.
FIG. I. SPHINX LINEATA. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thickest in the middle. Fly slow morning and
evening only.

This fine Insect is a native of Europe and America. It has a place in every
cabinet of English Insects; but on what authority it will be difficult now to
determine. It is highly probable, that the testimony of its discovery in
England is now forgotten, like that of Papilio Podalirius, figured in another
part of this work.

The following description of its Caterpillar, which we have seen preserved,
and in foreign drawings, will enable the curious in Insects to search after it
with, at least, a distant chance of success. The general color of the
Caterpillar is green, varied with yellow; and some streaks and spots of red
down the back; it has also a large black spot on each side every segment; the
head is black; and it has a spine, or tail. This is the appearance of it in one
skin; it casts its skin several times, and will therefore vary in some degree
from this account. -- The pupa is yellowish brown, speckled with black. It
feeds on Ladies Bed-straw, Madder, Goose-grass, etc.

Fabricius has omitted this species in his works, though Geoffroy and Villers
have both described it. It is found on plants of the scrophularia genus
(figwort.)

This minute Insect seems to form an intermediate species between Salicis and
C. Caprea. It is an undescribed Insect. In the MS. of T. Marsham, esquire it stands
under the specific name Avellanae. -- Was found on the Willow in June.

We have not a more beautiful Insect in this country than the Peacock
Butterfly. It is, indeed, too common to claim the particular notice of
Entomologists; but to those who admire most the splendid species of this
beautiful tribe of creatures, it will probably prove acceptable. The underside
is entirely of a shining dark color, with innumerable waved streaks of black.
The upperside is represented in the annexed plate.

The Caterpillars, which are black, beset with spines, and elegantly marked
with rows of white spots, are frequently found feeding on the nettles, and
other low herbage by the sides of ditches. They change to the chrysalis state
the first week in July, and appear in the winged state twenty-one days after.

This singular creature is found of a vast magnitude in foreign countries. We
possess one of that kind between four and five inches in length. In Europe, or
at least in England, they are seldom considerably larger than the annexed
figure.

It has two pair of feet to every segment of the body. These are very minute,
but give a remarkable appearance to the Insect. It is found in damp places,
generally under stones.

This rare Insect is distinguished from two very common species that are allied
to it, by the broad border of black on the under wings, as its trivial name
implies. In the larva state, it is one of that kind collectors denominate
underground feeders: subsisting chiefly on the roots of grass, and never
coming out of the ground till the evening, for which reason it is very rarely
taken.

The Moth is very delicate in its appearance; the Caterpillar quite plain. Our
specimen changed to crysalis early in May, and produced the moth in the middle
of June.

Fabricius was not informed that it was a native of this country, as appears by
his last work, in which he describes it only as a native of Germany.


PLATE CCIX. CERAMBYX LINEATOCOLLIS. COLEOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae articulated, diminishing in size toward the end.
Thorax gibbous, or spined on the sides. Elytra narrow, and of equal breadth.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Entirely covered with hair, greenish. Thorax unarmed with
spines, cylindrical, marked with yellow lines, shells without spots, brown.

CERAMBYX LINEATOCOLLIS: villosus viridescens, thorace mutico cylindrico
flavo-lineato, elytris immaculatis fuscis. -- Marsham's MS.
We must consider this as a new British species of Cerambyx, neither Linnaeus
nor Fabricius having given any description of it. It is described only in the
manuscripts of T. Marsham, Esquire. whose accurate definition of its characters we
have adopted.

It appears to be a local species. The only two specimens that have occurred to
our notice, having been taken in the Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire. Our specimen
was found on the bark of the willow.

The Caterpillars of the little Egger Moth, feed on black and white thorn,
willow, lime-tree, etc. The female deposits a large cluster of eggs in a tuft
of hair collected from her body. When are hatched, the young begin to spin a
strong white web, which they enlarge as their society increases; they remain
together till they have devoured all the leaves of the plant on which they are
hatched, or till they are arrived at full size to change into the chrysalis
state.

These Caterpillars are not very uncommon in some parts of the country,
especially in Kent. They are ready to change to chrysalis state late in June.
The Moth is not produced till April following.

The trivial English name, Egger Moth, is given to this, and two or three other
Moths, from the similitude of the case in which the chrysalis is enclosed to
the shape of egg.

Papilio Machaon and Papilio Podalirius are the only two species of
Swallow-tail Butterflies that have been found in England. Both are very scarce,
but Papilio Machaon less so than Papilio Podalirius, of which a figure has been
given in another part of this work.

Entomologists mention several parts of the country in which it has been taken,
both in the larva and winged state. Harris says it feeds on wild fennel and
carrots; that one he found remained in the chrysalis state from the 23d of
September to May the 15th following, and another, that changed July the 15th,
produced a butterfly the 10th of August. He adds, that the species was found in
the meadows of Bristol and Westram.

From the number of foreign authors who have given figures of the Butterfly, we
may imagine that it is very common on the Continent. Those preserved in
cabinets of English Insects are generally brought from Germany, from whence
also we sometimes receive preserved specimens of the Caterpillars.

The Mutillae seems less clearly defined than most of the Linnaean genera. That
author described only a small number of the species, and was even doubtful
whether several that were placed under that division of his system did not more
properly belong to some other, especially to the ichneumons, among which
several apterous insects are included.

The cause of this uncertainty may be partly attributed to our entire ignorance
of their manner of life or transformations. Some of the Mutillae have wings,
and others are without. Authors have considered the apterous Insects as the
females, and the winged kind as the males, which opinion is countenanced by
numberless instances in almost every class of Insects. Others have however
maintained that both males and females were winged, and that the apterous
Insects were neuters, presuming in support of such opinion, that the Mutillae
lived in societies like the Wasps, Ants, and Bees. -- From observations on a
number of exotic species of this tribe, we have no doubt that the winged
Insects are males, and the apterous kind females.

Yeats alludes to three species of Mutillae that have been found in England,
but names only the Mutillae Europaea; and this is the only kind we have ever
found. We have taken it on a sandy pathway, near the entrance of Coombe Wood,
Surry.


PLATE CCXIII. PHALAENA PRAECOX. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. NOCTUA. Thorax crested. Wings deflexed. First

When the late Duchess of Portland honored the scientific as well as practical
part of Entomology with her patronage, her Grace discovered, and reared from
the caterpillars several species of Phalaena, of which collectors were ignorant
before. Phalaena Praecox is among the number of those her Grace found in one of
the Portland isles; and the specimen we have figured is one which formed part
of her collection.

Fabricius says the larva feeds on the thistle. The rarity of this creature
induced us to depart from our usual method, and copy the larva and pupa from
the plate in the works of Roesel, apprehending it would be particularly
interesting to English naturalists in general, as that author alone has
represented it in those states; and no collector that we are informed has met
with it within the last fifteen years.


PLATE CCXIV. PHALAENA RUSSULA. CLOUDED BUFF MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings deflexed, bright yellow. Margin and
antennae blood red. A lunar-shaped spot on the middle of the wings.

As the Phalaenae are not remarkable for a variety of gay colors, like those
of the Papilio genus, an exception to a general rule in the beautiful species
before us, more strongly demands our notice. The male Phalaena Russula, which
is known by the pectinated antennae, is of a fine golden yellow, with a rich,
though narrow marginal band of sanguineous red round the wings. The female is a
pretty Insect, but is more inclined to brown throughout than the male.

This species has been supposed to feed on grass in the larva state, but as
collectors have very rarely reared it from that state, it has been difficult to
determine its proper food. Fabricius mentions lettuce and scabious or
devil's-bit. The larva is hairy, and in many respects very much resembles that
of the Garden Tiger Moth, from which we may perhaps infer that it is a general
feeder.

We found the larva in May; shortly after it spun a web and passed into the
pupa state, from which the moth was produced the 11th of June following.


PLATE CCXV. PHALANGIUM CRANCROIDES. APTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Eight feet. Four eyes, two on the summit of the head, and
two others on the sides. Antennae resemble feet, and are placed at the
forepart of the head. Abdomen round.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Body of an oblong ovated form, flat. Claws
smooth, hairy at at the ends.

The synonyms sufficiently denote the unsettled opinion of eminent naturalists
in respect of the proper genus to which our Insect should be referred. We have
followed the definition of Linnaeus, because it appears to us more
characteristic of the creature, which should have a lengthened articulated
tail, terminated in a sharp crooked sting, to warrant us in placing it among
the Scorpions. In the system of Fabricius this forms no part of his generical
character, but those who are accustomed to depend only on the writings of
Linnaeus, would be perplexed to reconcile the apparent difference between the
Phalangia of that author, and the Scorpio of Fabricius.

The general appearance of this creature, except the want of tail, is precisely
that of a Scorpion in miniature.

Mr. Adams, in his Essay on the Microscope, has figured and described a new
species of this genus; it is smaller, and differs in form from our present
species: he calls it the Lobster Insect. We believe Phalangium Cancroides is
the largest Insect of the genus found in England that resembles a Scorpion.

This Insect is sometimes found in the covers of old books, in rotten wood, and
other damp and decayed substances. We once found it fastened on the body of the
Musca Vomitoria, Common Flesh Fly, from which it could not be extricated
without killing and tearing the fly into pieces.

Roesel has given a figure of it, and represented a parcel of its eggs. They
are of an oblong form, color greenish, and appear to be deposited in roundish
clusters of about thirty or forty eggs in each.

The natural size of our Insect is represented at Fig 1.


PLATE CCXVI. PHALAENA LIBATRIX. HERALD MOTH. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Wings deflexed, varied with
red and gray; two white spots on the anterior wings; edges deeply serrated or
indented.

The Caterpillar of this Insect is generally found under the bark of the willow
and sallow, or on the rose. It is probable there are two broods of it in the
year, being sometimes taken in the winged state early in the summer, but more
commonly in the month of October; this is the more likely, as the English
Aurelians first called it the Herald, from an idea that its appearance warned
them of approaching winter.

This Insect remains about twenty-eight days in the pupa state, the Caterpillar
not being found till the beginning of September.
