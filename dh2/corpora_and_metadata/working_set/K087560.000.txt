for preserving Liberty and Property, AGAINST Republicans and Levellers, THIS
PASQUINADE IS DEDICATED, In hope (that, like the Widow's Mite) it may, in some

THE LEVELLERS.
CANTO I.
THE ARGUMENT:
Satan, hearing of the happiness of B^, is resolved, on a second attempt, to
provoke Celestial Anger, by disturbing its tranquillity -- Sets out -- Arrives
at Rennardos -- His welcome there -- Conversation and determination to try
their powers, 'ere they attempt Commotion -- Introduced to Absteemia --
Rennardos Mistress -- Evening concludes the Canto.

THE Prince of Darkness -- being told,
That Paradise, renowned of old,
Was far inferior to that Land,
Where (...) bears sovereign command,
Swore -- " by the Styx," -- hell's power to move,
Offensive, to Celestial Love,
Bound by the oath -- He winged his flight,
Through all the regions of Old Night,
Nor rested, or in Moon, or Star,
(Intent to wage infernal War,)
'Till He had made, such was his skill,
That tainted summit, -- S^A^s H^
Rennardo's Bower, he instant sought,
Who hailed him, as a Brother ought,
" Welcome, Congenial to my heart?
"Expected long, no more we'll part,
"My dreams thy coming did presage,
"Oh help me -- to disturb the Age.
"Teach to complete, what I Have begun,
"Then shall thy will, on Earth be done."
" For that, I came," (The Demon said),
"So lead me, to those Friends, whose aid,
"Is well directed to the Cause,
"Subversive of all K^s, all L^s."
Rennardo paused -- "Dispersed, they roam,
"For scarcely One can boast a Home."
"The Demon sighed -- "But soon each shall,
"And revel, in his force-gain'd Hall,
"However, I Will exert my power,
"And summon them within an hour,
"At least, their Spiritual Parts,
"For well we know they have not hearts,
"We'll search, what crimes Their minds will bear,
"Which, -- Ravage, -- Massacre, -- Forswear,
"Instructions add -- if such required,
"(Though Who can want -- by Thee inspired,)
"Then Each direct to 's several station,
"To fan Sedition through the (...)."
He raised his arm -- the thunder rolled,
Rennardo, begged him -- "To withold,
"And try the softer power of gold,
"For such a noise and sulfurous vapor,
"Would make all St^nes, and Eg^m caper,
"And he must know, that Savage Wy^tt,
"Would not leave Rogue, or Rebel quiet, --
"That many of their Friends, -- too true,
At present fled the Sheriffs view,
"Therefore, with leave, he would send a servant,
"Of whose known beck they would be observant.
"Adding, to All (...) in need, a Note,
"With Cash enclosed to unpawn Their Coat,
"That Coat which showed their tenets true,
"With facings B^ and body B^."
"So be it" -- said the Cloven Sprite,
(Satan was always held polite),
"Meanwhile to pass the hours away,
"Since I must wait, Your garish day,
"I Will teach You tricks on cards and dice
"By which, to beggar in a trice,
"The foolish-furnish'd Sons of Vice.
"Such tricks! -- as You, with all Your Crooks,
"Never thought of -- or played off at (...)."
" And I -- " returned Earth's grateful weight,
"Will show my noble Guest a sight
"Such as he never saw before,
"A non-descript, though ancient (...),
" Who palid, as the chastest Star
"Is shagged, as the Russian Bear,
" Who -- though grey-grown in vicious courses,
"Has vigor suff^ for twenty h^ses,
" Who having danced and sung her day,
"And seemed to throw her youth away,
"Near lost by foolish whim her prey,
"But Jointures -- Bonds -- and Gifts -- and Gold,
"Whatever came was sure to hold,
"Her shall you see, that Leman-mine,
"Dear Mate of -- B^'s Cataline -- "
"Lead then, to Jollity and Jests,
"I Will learn how Mortals treat their Guests,
"Yet, -- As my Friendship you would retain,
"Let me not waste my Hours, in vain,
"Be! every Soul of Anarchy,
"Soon as the Morning gilds the Sky,
"Roof'd in thy Hall" -- "They shall" -- "Away,"
"So prosperous seems Confusions sway, --
"Even Hell shall have a Holiday --
END OF THE FIRST CANTO.
THE LEVELLERS.
CANTO II.
THE ARGUMENT:
Rennardo and Satan, sit to receive their Friends -- The first that arrives is
-- Volunterus Mitredos -- His reception and pretensions told -- Then, A Man of
War -- The next A Politician -- An Editor -- An Apostate -- The Man of Words,
or, Great Allsides -- and Pleaderus -- The Herald's Advice concludes this Canto.

IN its due time -- the Morning came,
Uprose the Guest -- the Host -- and Dame,
Worthys of equal rank and fame --
A messenger proclaimed the approach
Of Horse and Foot, and Cart, and Coach --
"Announce their names" (old Satan cried)
"And be their merits singly tried,
"To save Us trouble -- And that all
"May know, why, We have made this call,
" Make Them, before they enter, read,
" This Scrowl, which We pronounce, our Creed."
"THE CREED.
" Kings, Lords, and Commons We abhor,
"And against all moral ties -- Wage War --
" Religion useless is -- Equality,
" Of Vice We'll seek -- and thus -- be free."
The Messenger, was scarce withdrawn,
When lo! -- A Reverend Rogue in Lawn,
Burst in, and thus attention won, --
"An E^h Priest, in days of yore,
"Translated to a neighboring (...)
" All that I could, from youth I Have done,
"To prove myself -- Rebellion's Son,
"The Church I value not a Straw,
" My Will, has ever been my Law;
"When Drums beat loud -- and Tumults rose.
"I doff'd my Sacerdotal Clothes,
" Dashed down my Crozier, seized the Spear,
"And with my railings filled the air;
"I Have persever'd from earliest age,
"'Against Order, in its every stage;
" Thus qualified -- I Have hasted Here,
" Your p^rless Mit^d Volunteer."
He ceased -- The Two 'rose up to embrace,
And near Rennardo -- gave him place.
" A Man of War" -- The Herald said,
Strait in he rushed -- with broken head,
Got -- as He from the Bailiffs fled.
"What -- Ho! my Hearties, shall we do it?
"What, shall we make the noodles rue it?
"Shall (...) go Out and -- And (...) come in,
"A placeman I, with Cash to sin,
"Damme I Am yours -- By this long Nose,
"This fierce cocked Hat -- and tight drawn Hose --
"Old Beelzebub -- I Am ever thine,
"Give me but Women, Dice and Wine."
A nod of Approbation did;
And He, behind Mitredos slid.
"A Politician's next, dread Sir,
"And seems to make a woundy stir,"
( The Herald said) -- " Let him approach."
So said -- so done --
"And take up time so precious now,
"But barely make my duteous vow --
" Time -- Its impossible to rate
"Such various subjects on debate,
"And I, conspicuous in each Storm --
"On Prisons -- Taxes -- Poor -- Reform,
"Trust me will stir the blessed pother,
"And act as Brother, should by Brother,
Sessions my first -- Yet as we have cast,
"I Will strive my best to make it the last,
"But I must hence wild Bills to draw,
"Which reason cannot pass as Law,
"They Will be objected to, no doubt,
"At which I Will make accustomed rout,
"Rave for my Country seem its Friend,
"To serve our Equalizing end,
"Farewell? -- depend -- though Young -- I Am --
"In Wisdom's self-providing way."
He passed -- The Herald -- named aloud,
An Editor -- Who entering -- bowed --
Then, Thus --
"Sworn Foe, to Morals, spurning Laws,
"I Have fallen Your sacrifice, but trust,
"You Will raise Your Vot'rist from the dust
"Oh! -- If you mean to dip in Ink --
" Wealths -- Worths -- and Virtues, cause to sink --
" Let me be Utt'rer of the Filth,
"I Will force from purest soil such Tilth,
"As shall surprise Your wondering eyes,
" Another Argus -- shall arise,
"To blast the Innocent -- The Great confound,
"And every generous feeling wound."
" Such Services deserve no less,
"Whenever We print We'll use thy Press."
" A Wretch without a Coat is here,"
(The Herald uttered with a Sneer,)
With forced Assurance in his Gait,
And seeming half-sham'd, fallen State,
The Traitor stepped -- Then low-voic'd, said --
" I Am Noble born -- And Soldier bred --
"But from my Standard basely fled,
"For which I hope reward from you,
"I own 'twas Simple -- Having Grace,
"Not only to have kept my Place
"But should have risen to Command,
"Then Treach'ry would have wrapped the Land;
"But now it is past -- Enrol me Here,
"None Else will trust -- You Have naught to fear."
"Dear to Our Loves" -- (The Old Angel said)
"Look Up -- Nor longer be dismayed;
"Worthy to be Chief Engineer,
" For Soldiers seldom reach Our Ear,
"No! -- There Is not one, now pent in Hell,
"Who for Our Cause, so greatly fell,
"What? -- give up Honor -- Rank -- and Birth,
"The All -- which Man esteems on Earth,
"To Class with Us -- Oh Nobly done!
"And Nobly I Will reward my Son.
"Promote Thee -- As such Merit should --
" Command our Corpse -- Ingratitude."
He blushed -- Retired -- The Crier now,
THE MAN OF WORDS -- proclaimed in view --
" My Lud -- And Gemmen of this Jury,
"I come for Freemen -- Freedom's fury,
"I Am yours confessed -- Bold S^land's Son,
" All trades have tried -- at last have won:
"The (...) did not suit my mind,
"To Sword and Musket disinclin'd:
"The N^ was a poor regard,
" There Merit only -- meets reward,
"Lastly the (...) I tried -- and now --
"(As nastiest food -- makes fat, the Sow,)
" My Gab, my Go, my Silver Tongue,
"Has Traitors saved -- And Guiltless, hung --
" Black I Have made White -- White turned to Black,
"In truth, my Conscience is a Hack,
" No Vice, but I can Virtue prove,
"Say, If I Am worthy of your Love?
"If God should offer Me a Brief,
"And if a larger Fee -- a Thief --
"Even God might plead, or lose his Cause,
"With Me -- The Fee supports the Laws --
"Raised thus by Chance, I aimed to show,
"What I, in higher Life could do,
"But There -- Our Friend's, (Rennardo's) Tool,
"Alas! -- I proved myself a Fool!
"That There I failed, was not my fault,
"I hoped the C^s would be caught,
"Like Those -- where I was wont to bawl,
"To You -- I need not name the (...),
"If more there needs, to show my zeal
"As fav'rer of a Common --,
" My last Essay -- must All convince,
"Though (...) to The (...)."
"Next to Our loved Rennardo stand,"
"Satan exclaimed -- and seized his hand.
Another Man of Words drew near,
Who whispering in the Old Fiends Ear,
Was lowly heard -- to articulate --
" I Have -- 'Nuities -- and Stocks -- and Plate --
"To part with them -- should sadly hate --
" Rennardos Else in every joint,
"In all, except this Money point --
" Now do but show -- how, I can serve,
"And yet my precious Land preserve,
"Which by Half Guineas, I have gained,
"And Interest, a little strained --
"Let but my wealth continue mine,
"With You -- I ever will opine."
" It shall, Our worthy good compeer,"
"( Rennardo cried) -- "You know it is clear,
"From others sacks -- We mean to steal,
"A Place We have will suit Your zeal,
"Be Treas'rer of Our Common Weal."
And now -- The Herald -- notice gave --
Their Lordships ought, some respite have,
To eat a bit -- and dress -- and shave,
For such a Cavalcade drew nigh,
As would their passions gratify.
Ladies -- and Lords -- and Squires -- and Dukes --
(At least they seemed so by their looks)
Excepting -- One sad, ragged Wretch --
Who'd neither Hat -- nor Coat -- nor Breech --
Such numbers!! -- That the whole day 'd not do!
Though each spoke but a word or two --
Therefore, They Would best take his advice,
And have refreshment, in a trice,
Then go -- to business again, --
Such good advice -- was not in vain --
They 'rose -- withdrew -- to breakfast went,
Precedence sans -- Sans Compliment
END OF THE SECOND CANTO.
THE LEVELLERS.
CANTO III.
THE ARGUMENT:
Noon -- Council continued -- Arrival of Volunterus Maximus -- His Merits and
Reception -- Of Catolicus -- Of the Shade of Vigginus Primus -- Of Dramaticus
-- Of the Nobilissimi Ruinati -- Of Nequissimus, whose Explanation produces a
Storm, raised by Heaven in defense of injured B^ -- Satan sinks to Hell again,
leaving his proselytes in the lurch -- They separately disperse -- And Order
proclaim the Death of REBELLION.

AND now, refreshed, and nicely quipp'd,
Again, into the Hall, They tripp'd --
The Devil had on, the very Suit,
In which Rennardo looked so 'cute --
The day he made his famous M^
TO acknowledge Authors of Commotion,
And nicely hid his Cloven Foot,
Just as Rennardo used to do it,
Seated once more -- Largess was cny'd --
In stalked, with stiff mock-martial pride,
A self-conceited Veteran --
Who scoul'd around -- Then thus began --
" My State -- (not lessening) -- I report
"The happy meeting of this Court,
"I Have long desired -- Done, All I could,
"Done every thing -- But what was good --
"To Effect Reform -- Alas! in vain --
"We could not virtually complain;
"Loudly I railed against Absentees,
"And Pensioners of all Degrees --
" Then, Arms I seized -- a sole pretense,
"And Tailors taught, to Fire and Fence;
"Made Haberdashers, Muskets use,
"And furnished Col'nels, from the Stews,
" Made myself General -- Then swagger'd --
"A foaming Pseudo-Patriot Braggard,
"It would not do -- I must be candid,
"The useless Lumber was dis^.
"But Hope assures this brilliant day,
"May, somehow, work a lasting fray,
"If so -- Behold -- To help the fuss --
Great Volunterus Maximus --
"If" -- said the D^l -- " We could aspire,
" Such Talents -- and such Worth to Hire,
"Though foolish V^r^ys, did o'erlook,
"Which You (expecting) could not brook,
"Yet We -- if not below Your care,
"Would name You -- Secretar' at War" --
A courtly bow, the acceptance showed,
He joined the gathering chosen Crowd.
" Largess" -- again, was echoed round,
" Largess" -- " Largess" -- the walls resound --
"The annunciation caused belief,
The coming personage some Chief,
And so it proved, (by lines foretold
Of him -- whose lines are sterling gold)
"A K^e ennobled -- S^t -- and C^d."
Base representation of (...)
"Sir, (though not first) -- Thus spoke the (...)
"I trust You Will mitigate rebuke,
"I Have ever tried to win Your favor,
"Witness my uniform behavior!
"For You I fled my Father's C^!
"And left connections in the lurch,
"Mixed with the dregs, and scum of earth,
"To show the vanity of Birth,
"That Title -- Pedigree -- and Crest,
"And Trophied Halls -- are but a Jest!
" A Farce -- not worth the wise Man's care,
"Who knows, the Goods of life to share,
"With Was -- Buffoons -- and Parasites,
"Devote to Priapaean Rites --
"In short, I strive to make it clear,
"That Nature forming me a (...)
"Became Confusions, and Debauch'ries Friend,
"And thus acknowledged, Orders end,
"Yours thus -- unalterably Yours --
"A Smile -- my future aid secures!
"Example from so great a name," --
"( Rennardo said) "will raise Our fame,
"Will show, The yet outstanding few,
"How little to descent is due,
"In token, how, We 'steem Your (...)
"Deign to accept this proffered place!
"The Rights of Man -- approves Your call
" Equality's High Marichal."
Pleased with the gift, a glove he tore,
Knighthoods proud Vaunt, in days of Yore. --
His long-borne Banner, then defaced,
And Anarchy's black Standard, raised --
A Noble Shade -- Now passed in view,
Which halted -- Sighed -- And quick withdrew,
Just as its Form was lost in Air,
These Murmurs seemed to breathe despair!
" Why! Why Rennardo! -- Would you force
"My generous Spirit from its Course,
" I worship God, and love my King,
"I will not be, that Rascal thing,
"Thy Politics compel -- Forbear!
"Or by Heaven's sacred truth I swear,
"I Will be, what Nature meant I should,
" Protector only, of the Good --
"'It Is past -- We can no more agree --
"Who parts from Virtue -- Parts from Me!" --
The Assembly on each other gaze,
Rennardo stood in fixed amaze,
Downcast his eye -- Now first ('it is said)
A blush his Sable Cheek overspread,
Confused -- He could not raise his head!
The Arch-Fiend observed -- 'Twas Conscience-struck,
Which to divert -- He gently took
His Hand -- Then slyly, smoothly spoke,
" Why should that Silly Shadow, make
"This change my Friend, -- Wherefore, this Gloom?
" Such Checks -- We must expect to come --
" And ( 'ere complete, our Grand Attempt),
"Unnumber'd phantoms of Contempt,
"Virtue's cold Vot'rists) will arise,
"Obtrusive on our Ears, our Eyes --
" Thou! -- Heed them not! -- Though they appear!
"They are but unembodied Air,
"Know! -- Substance could not enter here,
" Inimical to our Career,
" The noxious Vapors round Us spread,
" Would strike Corporeal Virtue dead."
Rennardo -- (willingly beguiled)
Shook Friendship off -- and Blacker smiled --
Substance -- again arrived -- A Form,
(That seemed the leavings of a Storm,)
With deep-sunk eye, and rubied face,
(A Badge, to Temperance, disgrace,)
Drew near, and to the Sable Chief,
Thus gave his phrenzied mind relief,
" Before this Court -- I humbly bend --
" Disorder's staunchest, loudest Friend --
" Rennardo, Thou! Thou know full well,
"My wily Match, is not in Hell;
"Ignobly born -- I Have dared to soar,
"Where Knaves like me never sailed before --
"No Height -- I Have not aspired to climb,
"By aid of Prose, or aid of Rhyme,
"My Eloquential Powers framed,
"'Against whatsoever is Virtue named --
"Myself Confusion's eldest born,
"True to my Sire have ever worn
"These maxims graven on my mind --
"With naught thine own, be Aye inclined,
"To raise Rebellion's blustering Wind.
"And think! Another's loss may give,
"Thy shattered Frame wherewith to live,
"Beyond the reach of Justice power,
"Who blasts as yet -- Thine every hour,
"Be Grave -- be Gay -- all Sins partake,
" Be (...) St^sm^n^pl^r^ Rake"
"That hitherto, I so have striv'n,
"Behold! Who comes -- The fallen, from Heaven!
"Behold! -- And own -- conjunct with Thine,
" My Acts -- illustrious Cataline"
The Portals opening wide, displayed --
Two noble Forms -- in black arrayed --
Conviction, sat in either eye,
And either bosom, heaved a sigh,
Each would have spoke, when Satan, thus --
Ladies -- precedence, claim with Us,"
A word sufficed, she curtsied low,
His (...) retiring, made his bow --
" High born -- and bred, with all the care,
"That fondness could invent -- to rear
"A mind might suit, this once fair frame,
"No art was left untried -- The flame
"Of Conquest struggling, I represt,
"But all in vain! It fired my breast!
"This my wise Sire perceived -- and dread,
"Lest Shame should wrap his ancient head,
" He chose a mate and bade me wed --
" Rank -- Splendour -- Wealth -- I now enjoyed,
"Of Splendour -- Rank -- and Wealth, was cloyed
"Insensible of honor grew,
"And dissipation only knew,
"Which to support, I played, was crossed,
"And Pin-money -- and Jewels lost,
" Nor Them alone -- Rennardo saw
"My Spirit spurned, at Wedded Law,
"He introduced a blooming (...)
"And Modesty has fled me since,
" Their Cause was mine -- as such receive --
"And view in me another eve."
She ceased -- Her mate approached -- And said,
" Confusion's Cause -- has turned my head,
"Of (...) Thousand Pounds a Year,
"I have not now a Guinea clear,
"My Wife, the fairest of the fair,
"Is lost to every social care,
"Trammell'd by You, has past the goal,
" You Have had Her Body -- take Her Soul!"
" Too spiritless! -- And mean, to sin!
"Hence" -- (Satan said) rejoin your Kin,
"Who in days past my power defied,
"And J-mes expelled -- and me belied."
Backward He trod, his dreary way,
To Widow'rd -- Ruined -- Chearless day.
NOW -- Cursings -- Ravings, Noise and Gabble --
Exceeding all We Have heard of Babel,
Reached the High Bench -- Now, louder grew,
In rushed the Crowd -- And first, to view,
Head of the Democratic Mob,
And panting for a Sanguine Job,
The Wretch, Nequissimus, was seen,
A Book-uplifting -- ( Rights of Men)
"Primaeval Rights -- I claim" -- (He cried)
"Each passion shall be gratified --
" What Claim has any to withold,
" From me -- His Lands, or hoarded Gold?
" What Claim has any to refuse,
" That I, His Wife, or Daughter use?
" What Claim has any to a Home
"Where I, and mine, may not freely come,
" What Claim has any King or Judge
"To hang a murderer -- thief make budge?
" None, I proclaim. -- This Pamphlet read --
"You there will find it is decreed,
"The World from fett'ring Law is free,
"And man controuls his destiny --
"Earth thus disburthen'd of its load.
"We'll storm the skies, and unthrone G^"
Instant -- A Total Darkness grew,
Hail, Thunders, Lightning -- Scared the Crew,
Satan before, had felt it is Force,
Arrest his cursed Blasphemous Course,
So sunk to Hell from King and Church,
And left his Pros'lytes in the lurch,
Fallen on their Faces, fearing day --
They knew not, Wrath was passed away,
Until they heard -- A Loyal Choir,
With Voice -- and Harp, and Stringed Lyre,
The Praise of Albion celebrate,
(Whose THREE, like HEAVENS, compose the State)
By That, they found, Her Genius 'rose,
Triumphant, over Malignant Foes:
Ashamed -- Afraid -- They separate fled --
And Order sang -- " Rebellion dead!
FINIS.
