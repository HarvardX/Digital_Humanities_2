ROSAMOND.
ACT I. SCENE I.
A Prospect of Woodstock-Park, terminating in the Bower. Enter Queen and Page.
Queen. WHAT Place is here!
What Scenes appear!
Wherever I turn my Eyes,
All around
Enchanted Ground
And soft Elysiums rise:
Flowery Mountains,
Mossie Fountains,
Shady Woods,
Crystal Floods
With wild Variety surprise.
As over the hollow Vaults we walk,
A hundred Eccho's round us talk:
From Hill to Hill our Words are tossed,
Rocks rebounding,
Caves resounding, Alluding to the famous Echo.
Not a single Voice is lost.

Page. There gentle Rosamond immured
Lives from the World and you secured.

Queen. Curse on the Name! I faint, I die,
With secret Pangs of Jealousy. -- [Aside.

Page. There does the pensive Beauty mourn,
And languish for her Lord's Return.

Queen. Death and Confusion! I Am too slow -- [Aside.
Show me the happy Mansion, show. --

Page. Great Henry there --

Queen. Trifler, no more! --

Page. -- Great Henry there
Will soon forget the Toils of War.

Queen. No more! the happy Mansion show
That holds this lovely, guilty Foe.
My Wrath, like that of Heaven, shall rise,
And blast her in her Paradise.

Page. Behold on yonder rising Ground
The Bower that wanders
In Meanders,
Ever bending,
Never ending,
Glades on Glades,
Shades in Shades,
Running an Eternal Round.

Queen. In such an endless Maze I rove,
Lost in Labyrinths of Love,
My Breast with hoarded Vengeance burns,
While Fear and Rage
With Hope engage,
And rule my wavering Soul by turns.

Page. The Path you verdant Field divides
Which to the soft Confinement guides.

Queen. Eleonora, think betimes,
What are thy hated Rival's Crimes!
Whither, ah whither do thou go!
What has she done to move thee so!
-- Does she not warm with guilty Fires
The faithless Lord of my Desires?
Have not her fatal Arts removed
My Henry from my Arms?
It Is her Crime to be loved,
It Is her Crime to have Charms.
Let us fly, let us fly,
She shall die, she shall die.
I feel, I feel my Heart relent,
How could the Fair be innocent!
To a Monarch like mine,
Who would not resign!
One so great and so brave
All Hearts must enslave.

Page. Hark, hark! what Sound invades my Ear?
The Conqueror's Approach I hear.
He comes, Victorious Henry comes!
Hautboys, Trumpets, Fifes and Drums,
In dreadful Consort joined,
Send from afar
A Sound of War,
And fill with Horror every Wind.

Queen. Henry returns, from Danger free,
Henry returns! -- But not to me.
He comes his Rosamond to greet,
And lay his Laurels at her Feet,
His Vows impatient to renew;
His Vows to Eleonora due.
Here shall the happy Nymph detain,
(While of his Absence I complain)
Hid in her mazy wanton Bower,
My Lord, my Life, my Conqueror.
No, no, it is decreed
The Traitress shall bleed;
No Fear shall alarm,
No Pity disarm;
In my Rage shall be seen
The Revenge of a Queen.

SCENE II.
The Entry of the Bower. Sir Trusty, Knight of the Bower, solus. How unhappy is
he,
That is tied to a she,
And famed for his Wit and his Beauty!
For of us pretty Fellows
Our Wives are so Jealous,
They never have enough of our Duty.
But hah! my Limbs begin to quiver,
I glow, I burn, I freeze, I shiver;
Whence rises this convulsive Strife?
I smell a Shrew!
My Fears are true,
I see my Wife.

Enter Grideline, Wife to Sir Trusty. Grid. Faithless Varlet, art thou there?

Sir Tr. My Love, my Dove, my Charming Fair!

Grid. Monster, thy wheedling Tricks I know.

Sir Tr. Why will thou call thy Turtle so?

Grid. Cheat not me with false Caresses.

Sir Tr. Let me stop thy Mouth with Kisses.

Grid. Those to Fair Rosamond are due.

Sir Tr. She is not half so Fair as you.

Grid. She views thee with a Lover's Eye.

Sir Tr. I Will still be thine, and let her die.

Grid. No, no, it is plain. Thy Frauds I see,
Traitor to thy King and me!

Sir Tr. O Grideline! consult thy Glass,
Behold that sweet bewitching Face,
Those blooming Cheeks, that lovely Hue!
Every Feature
(Charming Creature)
Will convince you I am true.

Grid. O how blessed were Grideline,
Could I call Sir Trusty mine!
Did he not cover amorous Wiles
With soft, but ah! deceiving Smiles:
How should I Revel in Delight,
The Spouse of such a Peerless Knight!

Sir Tr. At length the Storm begins to cease,
I Have soothed and flattered her to Peace.
It Is now my Turn to Tyranize, [Aside.
I feel, I feel my Fury rise!
Tigress, be gone.

Grid. -- I love thee so
I cannot go.

Sir Tr. Fly from my Passion, Beldame, fly!

Grid. Why so unkind, Sir Trusty, why?

Sir Tr. You Are the Plague of my Life.

Grid. I Am a foolish, fond Wife.

Sir Tr. Let us part,
Let us part.

Grid. Will you break my poor Heart?
Will you break my poor Heart?

Sir Tr. I will if I can.

Grid. O barbarous Man!
From whence does all this Passion flow?

Sir Tr. Thou art ugly and old,
And a villainous Scold.

Grid. Thou art a Rustic to call me so.
I Am not ugly nor old,
Nor a villainous Scold,
But thou art a Rustic to call me so.
Thou, Traitor, adieu!

Sir Tr. Farewell, thou Shrew!

Grid. Thou Traitor,

Sir Tr. Thou Shrew,

Both. Adieu! adieu!
[Exit Grid.
Sir Trusty solus. How hard is our Fate
Who serve in the State,
And should lay out our Cares
On Public Affairs;
When conjugal Toils
And Family Broils
Make all our great Labors miscarry!
Yet this is the Lot
Of him that has got
Fair Rosamond's Bower,
With the Clew in his Power,
And is Courted by all,
Both the great and the small,
As principal Pimp to the mighty King Harry.
But see, the pensive Fair draws near!
I Will at a Distance stand and hear.

Enter Rosamond. From Walk to Walk, from Shade to Shade,
From Stream to purling Stream conveyed,
Through all the Mazes of the Grove,
Through all the mingling Tracks I rove,
Turning,
Burning,
Changing,
Ranging,
Full of Grief and full of Love.
Impatient for my Lord's Return
I sigh, I pine, I rave, I mourn.
Was ever Passion crossed like mine?
To rend my Breast,
And break my Rest,
A thousand thousand Ills combine.
Absence wounds me,
Fear surrounds me,
Guilt confounds me,
Was ever Passion crossed like mine?

Sir Tr. What Heart of Stone
Can hear her moan,
And not in Dumps so doleful join! [Apart.

Ros. How does my constant Grief deface
The Pleasures of this happy Place!
In vain the Spring my Senses greets
In all her Colors, all her Sweets;
To me the Rose
No longer glows,
Every Plant
Has lost its Scent:
The vernal Blooms of various Hue,
The Blossoms fresh with Morning Dew,
The Breeze, that sweeps these fragrant Bowers,
Filled with the Breath of Opening Flowers,
Purple Scenes,
Winding Greens,
Glooms inviting,
Birds delighting,
(Nature's softest, sweetest Store)
Charm my tortured Soul no more.
Ye Powers I rave, I faint, I die;
Why so slow! great Henry, why!
From Death and Alarms
Fly, fly to my Arms,
Fly to my Arms, my Monarch, fly!

Sir Tr. How much more blessed would Lovers be,
Did all the whining Fools agree
To live like Grideline and me!

Ros. O Rosamond, behold too late
And tremble at thy future Fate!
Curse this unhappy, guilty Face,
Every Charm, and every Grace,
That to thy Ruin made their way,
And led thine Innocence astray:
At home thou see thy Queen enraged,
Abroad thy absent Lord engaged
In Wars, that may our Loves disjoin,
And end at once his Life and mine.

Sir Tr. Such cold Complaints befit a Nun:
If she turns honest I Am undone!

Ros. Beneath some hoary Mountain
I Will lay me down and weep,
Or near some warbling Fountain
Bewail my self asleep,
Where feathered Quires combining
With gentle murmuring Streams,
And Winds in Consort joining,
Raise sadly-pleasing Dreams.
[Exit Ros.
Sir Trusty solus. What savage Tiger would not pity
A Damsel so distressed and pretty!
But hah! a Sound my Bower invades, Trumpets flourish.
And eccho's through the winding Shades;
It Is Henry's March! the Tune I know:
A Messenger! It must be so.

Enter a Messenger. Mess. Great Henry comes! with Love oppressed;
Prepare to lodge the Royal Guest.
From purple Fields with Slaughter spread,
From Rivers choked with Heaps of Dead,
From glorious and immortal Toils,
Laden with Honor, rich with Spoils,
Great Henry comes! Prepare thy Bower
To lodge the mighty Conqueror.

Sir Tr. The Bower and Lady both are dressed,
And ready to receive their Guest.

Mess. Hither the Victor flies (his Queen
And Royal Progeny unseen)
Soon as the British Shores he reached,
Hither his foaming Courser strech'd:
And see! his eager Steps prevent
The Message that himself has sent!

Sir Tr. Here will I stand
With Hat in Hand
Obsequiously to meet him,
And must endeavor
At Behavior
That Is suitable to greet him.

Enter King Henry after a Flourish of Trumpets. King. Where is my Love! my
Rosamond!

Sir Tr. First, as in strictest Duty bound,
I kiss your Royal Hand,

King. Where is my Life! my Rosamond!

Sir Tr. Next with Submission most profound,
I welcome you to Land.

King. Where is the Tender, Charming Fair!

Sir Tr. Let me appear, Great Sir, I pray
Methodical in what I say.

King. Where is my Love! O tell me where!

Sir Tr. For when we have a Prince's Ear,
We should have Wit
To know what is fit
For us to speak, and him to hear.

King. These dull Delays I cannot bear,
Where is my Love, O tell me where!

Sir Tr. I speak, Great Sir, with weeping Eyes,
She raves, alas! she faints, she dies.

King. What do thou say? my Heart's alarmed!

Sir Tr. Be not, my Liege, too quickly warmed:
She raves, and faints, and dies, it is true;
But raves, and faints, and dies for you.

King. Was ever Nymph like Rosamond,
So fair, so faithful, and so fond,
Adorned with every Charm and Grace!
My Heart's on Fire
With strong Desire,
And leaps and springs to her Embrace.

Sir Tr. At the Sight of her Lover
She Will quickly recover.
What Place will you choose
For first Interviews?

King. Full in the Center of the Grove
In you Pavilion made for Love,
Where Woodbines, Roses, Jessamines,
Amaranths, and Eglantines,
With intermingling Sweets have wove
The part colored gay Alcove.

Sir Tr. Your Highness, Sir, as I presume,
Has chose the most convenient Gloom;
There Is not a Place in all the Park
Has Trees so thick, and Shades so dark.

King. Mean while with due Attention wait
To guard the Bower, and watch the Gate;
Let neither Envy, Grief, nor Fear,
Nor Lovesick Jealousy appear,
Nor senseless Pomp nor Noise intrude
On this Delicious Solitude,
But Pleasure reign through all the Grove,
And all be Peace, and all be Love.
O the pleasing, pleasing Anguish
When we Love, and when we Languish!
Wishes rising!
Thought surprising!
Pleasure courting!
Charms transporting!
Fancy viewing
Joys ensuing!
O the pleasing, pleasing Anguish!
[Exeunt.
End of the First ACT.
ACT II. SCENE I.
A Pavilion in the Middle of the Bower. King and Rosamond. King. THus let my
weary Soul forget
Restless Glory, Martial Strife,
Anxious Pleasures of the Great,
And gilded Cares of Life.

Ros. Thus let me lose, in rising Joys,
Fierce Impatience, fond Desires,
Painful Absence that destroys,
And Life-consuming Fires.

King. Not the loud British Shout that warms
The Warrior's Heart, nor clashing Arms,
Nor Fields with hostile Banners strow'd,
Nor Life on prostrate Gauls bestowed,
Give half the Joys that fill my Breast,
While with my Rosamond I Am blessed.

Ros. My Henry is my Soul's Delight,
My Wish by Day, my Dream by Night.
It Is not in Language to impart
The secret Meltings of my Heart,
While I my Conqueror survey,
And look my very Soul away.

King. O may the present Bliss endure
From Fortune, Time, and Death secure!

Both. O may the present Bliss endure!

King. My Eye could ever gaze, my Ear
Those gentle Sounds could ever hear.
But oh! with Noonday Heats oppressed,
My aching Temples call for Rest!
In yon cool Grotto's artful Night
Refreshing Slumbers I Will invite,
Then seek again my absent Fair,
With all the Love a Heart can bear.
[Exit King.
Rosamond sola. From whence this sad presaging Fear,
This sudden Sigh, this falling Tear?
Often in my silent Dreams by Night
With such a Look I Have seen him fly,
Wafted by Angels to the Sky,
And lost in endless Tracks of Light;
While I abandoned and forlorn,
To dark and dismal Deserts born,
Through lonely Wilds have seemed to stray,
A long, uncomfortable Way.
They Are Fantoms all, I Will think no more;
My Life has endless Joys in store.
Farewell Sorrow, farewell Fear,
They Are Fantoms all! my Henry 's here.

SCENE A Postern Gate of the Bower. Grideline and Page. Grid. My Stomach swells
with secret Spite,
To see my fickle, faithless Knight,
With upright Gesture, goodly Mein,
Face of Olive, Coat of Green,
That charmed the Ladies long ago,
So little his own Worth to know,
On a mere Girl his Thoughts to place,
With dimpl'd Cheeks and baby Face,
A Child! a Chit! that was not born,
When I did Town and Court adorn.

Page. Can any Man prefer Fifteen
To Venerable Grideline?

Grid. He does, my Child; or tell me why
With weeping Eyes so often I spy
His Whiskers curled, and Shoo-strings tied,
A new Toledo by his Side,
In Shoulder-belt so trimly placed,
With Band so nicely smoothed and laced.

Page. If Rosamond his Garb has viewed
The Knight is false, the Nymph subdued.

Grid. My anxious boding Heart divines
His Falsehood by a thousand Signs:
Often over the lonely Rocks he walks,
And to the foolish Echo talks;
Often in the Glass he rolls his Eye,
But turns and frowns if I am by;
Then my fond easy Heart beguiles,
And thinks of Rosamond, and smiles.

Page. Well may you feel these soft Alarms.
She has a Heart --

Grid. -- And He has Charms.

Page. Your fears are too just --

Grid. -- Too plainly I Have proved

Both. He loves and is loved.

Grid. O Merciless Fate!

Page. Deplorable State!

Grid. To die --

Page. -- To be slain

Grid. By a Barbarous Swain,

Both. That Laughs at your Pain.

Grid. How should I act? Can thou advise?

Page. Open the Gate, if you are wise;
I, in an unsuspected Hour,
May catch 'em dallying in the Bower,
Perhaps their loose Amors prevent,
And keep Sir Trusty Innocent.

Grid. Thou art in Truth
A forward Youth,
Of Wit and Parts above thy Age;
Thou know our Sex. Thou art a Page.

Page. I Will do what I can
To surprise the false Man.

Grid. An opening Scene discovers another View of the Bower. Of such a faithful
Spy I Have need:
Go in, and if thy Plots succeed
Fair Youth thou may depend on this,
I Will pay thy Service with a Kiss.
[Exit Page.
Grideline sola. Prithee Cupid no more
Hurl thy Darts at Threescore,
To thy Girls and thy Boys
Give thy Pains and thy Joys,
Let Sir Trusty and me
From thy Frolicks be free.
[Exit Grid.
Re-enter Page, solus. O the soft delicious View,
Ever Charming, ever New!
Greens of various Shades arise,
Decked with Flowers of various Dies:
Paths by meeting Paths are crossed,
Alleys in winding Alleys lost;
Fountains playing through the Trees,
Give Coolness to the passing Breeze.
A thousand fairy Scenes appear,
Here a Grove, a Grotto here,
Here a Rock, and here a Stream,
Sweet Delusion,
Gay Confusion,
All a Vision, all a Dream!

Enter Queen. Queen. At length the bow'ry Vaults appear!
My Bosom heaves, and pants with Fear:
A thousand Checks my Heart control,
A thousand Terrors shake my Soul.

Page. Behold the brazen Gate unbarr'd!
-- She Is fixed in Thought, I am not heard -- [Apart.

Queen. I see, I see my Hands embru'd
In purple Streams of reeking Blood:
I see the Victim gasp for Breath,
And start in Agonies of Death:
I see my raging dying Lord,
And O, I see my self abhorred!

Page. My Eyes overflow, my Heart is rent
To hear Britannia's Queen lament. [Aside.

Queen. What shall my trembling Soul pursue?

Page. Behold, Great Queen, the Place in View!

Queen. Ye Powers instruct me what to do!
Page. That Bower will show
The guilty Foe.

Queen. -- It is decreed -- It shall be so; [After a Pause.
I cannot see my Lord repine
(Oh that I could call him mine!)
Why have not they most Charms to move,
Whose Bosoms burn with purest Love!

Page. Her Heart with Rage and Fondness glows.
O Jealousy! thou Hell of Woes! [Aside.
That conscious Scene of Love contains
The fatal Cause of all your Pains:
In yonder flowery Vale she lies,
Where those fair-blossom'd Arbours rise.

Queen. Let us haste to destroy
Her Guilt and her Joy.
Wild and frantic is my Grief!
Fury driving,
Mercy striving,
Heaven in pity send Relief?
The Pangs of Love
Ye Powers remove,
Or dart your Thunder at my Head:
Love and Despair
What Heart can bear?
Ease my Soul, or strike me Dead!
[Exeunt.
SCENE changes to the Pavilion as before. Rosamond sola. Transporting Pleasure!
who can tell it!
When our longing Eyes discover
The kind, the dear approaching Lover,
Who can hide, or who reveal it!
A sudden Motion shakes the Grove:
I hear the Steps of him I Love;
Prepare, my Soul, to meet thy Bliss!
-- Death to my Eyes! what Sight is this!
The Queen, the offended Queen I see!
-- Open, O Earth! and swallow me!

Enter the Queen with a Bowl in one Hand, and a Dagger in the other. Queen.
Thus armed with double Death I come:
Behold, vain Wretch, behold thy Doom!
Thy Crimes to their full Period tend,
And soon by This or This shall end.

Ros. What shall I say, or how reply
To Threats of injured Majesty?

Queen. It Is Guilt that does thy Tongue control.
Or quickly drain the fatal Bowl,
Or this right Hand performs its part,
And plants a Dagger in thy Heart.

Ros. Can Britain's Queen give such Commands,
Or dip in Blood those sacred Hands?
In Her shall such Revenge be seen?
Far be that from Britain's Queen!

Queen. How black does my Design appear?
Was ever Mercy so severe! [Aside.

Ros. When Tides of youthful Blood run high,
And Scenes of promised Joys are nigh,
Health presuming,
Beauty blooming,
Oh how dreadful it is to die!

Queen. To those whom foul Dishonours stain,
Life it self should be a Pain.

Ros. Who could resist great Henry's Charms,
And drive the Hero from her Arms?
Think on the soft, the tender Fires,
Melting Thoughts and gay Desires,
That in your own warm Bosom rise,
When languishing with Lovesick Eyes
That great, that charming Man you see:
Think on your self, and pity me!

Queen. And do thou thus thy Guilt deplore! [Offering the Dagger to her
Breast.
Presumptuous Woman! plead no more!

Ros. O Queen your lifted Arm restrain!
Behold these Tears! --

Queen. -- They flow in vain.

Ros. Look with Compassion on my Fate!
O hear my Sighs! --

Queen. -- They rise too late:
Hope not a Day's, an Hour's Repreive.

Ros. Though I live wretched, let me live.
In some deep Dungeon let me lie,
Covered from every human Eye,
Banished the Day, debarred the Light;
Where Shades of everlasting Night
May this unhappy Face disarm,
And cast a Veil over every Charm:
Offended Heaven I Will there adore,
Nor see the Sun, nor Henry more.

Queen. Moving Language, shining Tears,
Glowing Guilt, and graceful Fears,
Kindling Pity, kindling Rage,
At once provoke me, and assuage. [Aside

Ros. What shall I do to pacify
Your kindled Vengeance?

Queen. -- Thou shall die. [Offering the Dagger.

Ros. Give me but one short Moment's stay.
-- O Henry why so far away? [Aside.

Queen. Prepare to welter in a Flood
Of streaming Gore. [Offering the Dagger.

Ros. -- O spare my Blood,
And let me grasp the deadly Bowl.
[Takes the Bowl in her Hand.
Queen. Ye Powers how Pity rends my Soul! [Aside.

Ros. Thus prostrate at your Feet I fall.
O let me still for Mercy call. [Falling on her Knees.
Accept, Great Queen, like injured Heaven,
The Soul that Begs to be Forgiven:
If in the latest Gasp of Breath,
If in the dreadful Pains of Death,
When the cold Damp bedews your Brow,
You hope for Mercy, show it now.

Queen. Mercy to lighter Crimes is due,
Horrors and Death shall thine pursue. [Offering the Dagger.

Ros. Thus I prevent the fatal Blow. [Drinks.
-- Whither, ah! whither shall I go!

Queen. Where thy past Life thou shall lament,
And wish thou had been Innocent.

Ros. Tyrant! to aggravate the Stroke,
And wound a Heart already broke.
My dying Soul with Fury burns,
And slighted Grief to Madness turns,
Think not, thou Author of my Woe,
That Rosamond will leave thee so:
At dead of Night
Aglaring Spright
With hideous Screams
I Will haunt thy Dreams,
And when the painful Night withdraws,
My Henry shall Revenge my Cause.
O whither does my Frenzy drive!
Forgive my Rage, your Wrongs forgive.
My Veins are froze, my Blood grows chill,
The weary Springs of Life stand still,
The Sleep of Death benums all over
My fainting Limbs, and I Am no more. [Falls on the Couch.

Queen. [To her Attendants. Hear, you who wait on my Commands!
Beneath those Hills a Convent stands,
Where the famed Streams of Isis stray;
Thither the breathless Coarse convey,
And bid the Cloistered Maids with care
The due Solemnities prepare. [Exeunt with the Body.
When vanquished Foes beneath us lie
How great it is to bid them die!
But how much greater to forgive,
And bid a vanquished Foe to love!

Enter Sir Trusty in a Fright. A breathless Corpse! what have I seen!
And followed by the Jealous Queen!
It must be she! my Fears are true:
The Bowl of poisonous Juice I view.
How can the famed Sir Trusty live
To hear his Master chide and grieve?
No! though I hate such bitter Beer,
Fair Rosamond I Will pledge thee here. [Drinks.
The King this doleful News shall read
In Lines of my Inditing:
Great Sir, [Writes.
Your Rosamond is dead
As I am at this present writing.
The Bower turns round, my Brain's abused,
The Labyrinth grows more confused,
The Thickets Dance -- I stretch, I yawn,
Death has tripp'd up my Heels -- I Am gone. [Staggers and falls.

Re-enter Queen, sola. The Conflict of my Mind is over,
And Rosamond shall Charm no more.
Hence ye secret Damps of Care,
Fierce Disdain, and cold Despair,
Hence ye Fears and Doubts remove;
Hence Grief and Hate!
Ye Pains that wait
On Jealousy, the Rage of Love.
My Henry shall be mine Alone,
The Hero shall be All my own;
Nobler Joys possess my Heart
Than Crowns and Scepters can impart.

ACT III. SCENE I.
Scene a Grotto, Henry asleep, a Cloud descends, in it two Angels supposed to
be the Guardian Spirits of the British Kings in War and in Peace. 1 Ang. BEhold
the unhappy Monarch there,
That claims our Tutelary Care!

2 Ang. In Fields of Death around his Head
A Shield of Adamant I spread.

1 Ang. In Hours of Peace unseen, unknown,
I hover over the British Throne.

2 Ang. When Hosts of Foes with Foes engage
And round the anointed Hero rage,
The cleaving Fauchion I misguide
And turn the feathered Shaft aside.

1 Ang. When dark fermenting Factions swell,
And prompt the Ambitious to rebel,
A thousand Terrors I impart,
And damp the furious Traitor's Heart.

Both. But O what Influence can remove
The Pangs of Grief, and Rage of Love!

2. Ang. I Will fire his Soul with mighty Themes
'Till Love before Ambition fly.

1 Ang. I Will sooth his Cares in pleasing Dreams
'Till Grief in joyful Raptures die.

2 Ang. Whatever glorious and renowned
In British Annals can be found;
Whatever Actions shall adorn
Britannia 's Heroes yet unborn
In dreadful Visions shall succeed;
On fancied Fields the Gaul shall bleed,
Cressy shall stand before his Eyes,
And Agincourt and Blenheim rise.

1 Ang. See, see, he smiles amidst his Trance,
And shakes a visionary Lance,
His Brain is filled with loud Alarms,
Shouting Armies, clashing Arms,
The softer Prints of Love deface;
And Trumpets sound in every Trace.

Both. Glory strives,
The Field is won,
Fame revives
And Love is gone.

1 Ang. To calm thy Grief and lull thy Cares,
Look up and see
What, after long revolving Years,
Thy Bower shall be!
When Time its Beauties shall deface,
And only with its Ruins grace
The future Prospect of the Place.
Scene changes to the Plan of Blenheim Castle. Behold the glorious Pile
ascending!
Columns swelling, Arches bending,
Domes in awful Pomp arising,
Art in curious Strokes surprising,
Foes in figured Fights contending,
Behold the glorious Pile ascending!

2 Ang. He sees, he sees the great Reward
For Anna's mighty Chief prepared:
His growing Joys no Measure keep,
Too vehement and fierce for Sleep.

1 Ang. Let Grief and Love at once engage,
His Heart is Proof to all their Pain;
Love may plead --

2 Ang. -- And Grief may rage --

Both. But both shall plead and rage in vain.
[The Angels ascend, and the Vision disappears.
Henry starting from the Couch. Where have my ravished Senses been!
What Joys, what Wonders have I seen!
The Scene yet stands before my Eye:
A thousand glorious Deeds that lie
In deep Futurity obscure,
Fights and Triumphs Immature,
Heroes immersed in Time's dark Womb,
Ripening for mighty Years to come,
Break forth, and to the Day displayed,
My soft inglorious Hours upbraid.
Transported with so bright a Scheme
My Waking Life appears a Dream.
Adieu, ye wanton Shades and Bowers,
Wreaths of Myrtle, Beds of Flowers,
Rosy Brakes,
Silver Lakes,
To Love and you
A long Adieu!
O Rosamond! O rising Woe!
Why do my weeping Eyes overflow?
O Rosamond! O fair distressed!
How shall my Heart, with Grief oppressed,
Its unrelenting Purpose tell;
And take the long, the last Farewell!
Rise, Glory, rise in all thy Charms,
Thy waving Crest, and burnished Arms,
Spread thy gilded Banners round,
Make thy thundering Courser Bound,
Bid the Drum and Trumpet join,
Warm my Soul with Rage Divine;
All thy Pomps around thee call:
To Conquer Love will ask 'em all. [Exit.

SCENE changes to that Part of the Bower where Sir Trusty lies upon the Ground,
with the Bowl and Dagger on the Table. Enter Queen Every Star, and every Power,
Look down on this important Hour:
Lend your Protection and Defense
Every Guard of Innocence!
Help me my Henry to assuage,
To gain his Love, or bear his Rage.
Misterious Love, uncertain Treasure,
Have thou more of Pain or Pleasure!
Chilled with Tears,
Killed with Fears,
Endless Torments dwell about thee:
Yet who would live, and live without thee!
But oh the Sight my Soul alarms:
My Lord appears, I Am all on Fire!
Why am I banished from his Arms?
My Heart's too full, I must retire. [Retires to the End of the Stage.

Enter King. Some dreadful Birth of Fate is near:
Or why, my Soul, unused to fear
With secret Horror do thou shake?
Can Dreams such dire Impressions make!
What means this solemn silent Show?
This Pomp of Death, this Scene of Woe!
Support me, Heaven! What Is this I read?
O Horror! Rosamond is dead.
What shall I say, or whither turn?
With Grief, and Rage, and Love, I burn:
From Thought to Thought my Soul is tossed,
And in the Whirle of Passion lost.
Why did I not in Battle fall,
Crushed with the Thunder of the Gaul?
Why did the Spear my Bosom miss?
Ye Powers, was I reserved for this!
Dictracted with Woe
I Will rush on the Foe
To seek my Relief:
The Sword or the Dart
Shall pierce my sad Heart,
And finish my Grief!

Queen. Fain would my Tongue his Heart appease,
And give his raging Tortures Ease. [Aside.

King. But see! the Cause of all my Fears,
The Source of all my Grief appears!
No unexpected Guest is here;
The fatal Bowl
Informed my Soul
Eleonora was too near.

Queen. Why do I here my Lord receive?

King. Is this the Welcome that you give?

Queen. Thus should divided Lovers meet?

Both. And is it thus, ah! thus we greet!

Queen. What in these guilty Shades could you,
Inglorious Conqueror, pursue?

King. Cruel Woman, what could you?

Queen. Degenerate Thoughts have fired your Breast.

King. The Thirst of Blood has yours possessed,

Queen. A Heart so unrepenting,

King. A Rage so unrelenting,

Both. Will for ever
Love dissever,
Will for ever break our Rest.

King. Floods of Sorrow will I shed
To mourn the Lovely Shade!
My Rosamond, alas, is dead,
And where, O where conveyed!
So bright a Bloom, so soft an Air,
Did ever Nymph disclose!
The Lilly was not half so fair,
Nor half so sweet the Rose.

Queen. How is his Heart with Anguish torn! [Aside
My Lord, I cannot see you Mourn,
The Living you lament: While I
To be lamented so could Die.

King. The Living! speak, oh speak again!
Why will you dally with my Pain?

Queen. Were your loved Rosamond alive
Would not my former Wrongs revive?

King. Oh no, by Visions from above,
Prepared for Grief, and freed from Love,
I came to take my last Adieu,

Queen. How am I blessed if this be true! -- [Aside.

King. And leave the unhappy Nymph for you.
But O! --

Queen. -- Forbear, my Lord, to grieye,
And know your Rosamond does Live.
If it is Joy to wound a Lover,
How much more to give him Ease?
When his Passion we discover,
Oh how pleasing it is to please!
The Bliss returns, and we receive
Transports greater than we give.

King. O quickly relate
This Riddle of Fate!
My Impatience forgive,
Does Rosamond live?

Queen. The Bowl, with drowsy Juices filled,
From cold Egyptian Drugs distilled,
In borrowed Death has closed her Eyes:
But soon the waking Nymph shall rise,
And, in a Convent placed, admire
The Cloistered Walls, and Virgin Quire,
With them in Songs and Hymns divine
The beauteous Penitent shall join,
And bid the guilty World Adieu,

King. How am I blessed if this be true! -- [Aside.

Queen. Atoning for her self and you.

King. I ask no more! Secure the Fair
In Life and Bliss: I ask not where:
For ever from my Fancy fled
May the whole World believe her dead,
That no foul Minister of Vice
Again my sinking Soul entice
Its broken Passion to renew,
But let me live and die with you.

Queen. How does my Heart for such a Prize
The vain censorious World despise!
Though distant Ages, yet unborn,
For Rosamond shall falsely mourn;
And with the present Times agree,
To brand my Name with Cruelty;
How does my Heart for such a Prize
The vain censorious World despise!
But see your Slave, while yet I speak,
From his dull Trance unfettered break!
As he the Potion shall survive
Believe your Rosamond alive.

King. O happy Day! O pleasing View!
My Queen forgives --

Queen. -- My Lord is true.

King. No more I Will change,

Queen. No more I Will grieve,

Both. But ever thus united live.

Sir Trusty awaking. In which World am I! all I see,
Every Thicket, Bush and Tree,
So like the Place from whence I came,
That one would swear it were the same.
My former Legs too, by their Pace!
And by the Whiskers, it is my Face!
The self-same Habit, Garb and Mien!
They never would bury me in Green.

Enter Grideline. Grid. Have I then lived to see this Hour,
And took thee in the very Bower?

Sir Tr. Widow Trusty, why so fine?
Why do thou thus in Colors shine?
Thou should thy Husband's Death bewail
In sable Vesture, Peak and Veil.

Grid. Forbear these foolish Freaks, and see
How our good King and Queen agree.
Why should not we their Steps pursue
And do as our Superiors do?

Sir Tr. Am I bewitched, or do I dream?
I know not who, or where I am,
Or what I hear, or what I see,
But this I Am sure, however it be,
It suits a Person in my Station
TO observe the Mode, and be in Fashion.
Then let not Grideline the Chaste
Offended be for what is past,
And hence anew my Vows I plight
To be a faithful courteous Knight.

Grid. I Will too my plighted Vows renew,
Since it is so courtly to be true.
Since conjugal Passion
Is come into Fashion,
And Marriage so blessed on the Throne is,
Like a Venus I Will shine,
Be fond and be fine,
And Sir Trusty shall be my Adonis.

Sir Tr. And Sir Trusty shall be thy Adonis.

The King and Queen advancing. King. Who to forbidden Joys would rove,
That knows the Sweets of virtuous Love?
Hymen, thou Source of chaste Delights,
Cheerful Days, and blissful Nights,
Thou do untainted Joys dispense,
And Pleasure join with Innocence,
Thy Raptures last, and are sincere
From future Grief and present Fear.

Both. Who to forbidden Joys would rove,
That knows the Sweets of virtuous Love.

FINIS.
