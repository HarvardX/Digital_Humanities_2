LOVE finds the WAY.
ACT I.
AIR.
BRUMPTON. I.
MY Heart, I presume, is my own, Sir,
And will not to Bondage submit;
It Is Passion for Passion alone, Sir,
My Wish and my Humor can hit.
II.
If I smack of an obstinate Temper,
The Failing from you I derive;
While you try my Affections to hamper,
Against Weather and Current you strive.
III.
I know it is a Maxim with you, Sir,
That Money all Faults will remove,
But each Guinea with me is as two, Sir,
When Wealth is ennobled by Love.

AIR.
OLDCASTLE. I.
It Is the commonest Instance in Nature,
The pleasantest Subject of Satire,
No Object of Ridicule greater,
In the Records of Whim can be shown;
To find others Faults how we labor,
And our Tongue, like a two-edged Sabre,
Hacks and hews the Defects of a Neighbor,
But never adverts to our own.
II.
Lord help us, what is come to your Reason,
That thus, out of Measure and Season,
Your Betters you issue Decrees on,
Setting up Judge and Jury in one;
Brother Lovibond, lay by your Jeering,
Your Carping, your Mocking, and Sneering,
At the Hump of another leave peering,
And, pr'ythee, look back at your own.

AIR.
BRUMPTON. I.
Though his Modes and Forms are slighted,
Venus' Son beholds delighted,
Ardent Hearts at View united,
And adopts the Pair his own.
II.
Not by dint of tedious Sighing,
Pining, Whining, Crying, Dying,
Daily Oaths, and daily Lying,
Did I make my Passion known;
III.
But by Love's more artless Fancies,
Silent, soothing* soft Advances,
Ogling Looks, alluring Glances,
I was caught, and she was won.
Though his Modes, etc.

AIR.
HARRIET. As mourns the soft Songster confined from the Spray,
And changes to Notes of Lamenting his Lay;
So I, with my Freedom, my Spirits forego,
And my Ditties, alas! all are Ditties of Woe;
Oh! come then, my Belford, my well-belov'd Swain,
Restore me to Mirth, and to Freedom again;
Or still, if a Captive I Am fated to be,
Alone make me Captive to Love and to thee.

AIR.
OLDCASTLE. Zooks! that an old Man cannot keep a Chicken,
A snug Tit-bit for his own private picking,
And Means of Redress no Statute allows:
But a Rake, like a sly Beast of Prey, will be watching,
New Mischiefs inventing, new Artifice hatching,
O^ his White-legged Dainty the Owner to chouse.
Are there no Means in his Art to out-trick him?
Traps and Guns shall be planted to nick him,
On every Floor and each Stair of my House.

AIR.
LOVIBOND. I.
My Joy, my Pride,
While thee beside,
My Heart is light and gay;
Those Charms, so rare,
Old Age r^^air,
And Winter turns to May; Toll, loll, etc.
Those Charms, etc.
II.
No Time destroys
Our Hopes and Joys,
While Health and Mirth remain;
The honest Mind,
From Spleen confined,
Defies Old Age and Pain; Toll, loll, etc.
Those Charms, etc.
III.
In Hymen's Bands
Adieu Commands,
My Harriet then shall sway;
In his blessed Reign,
Let her ordain,
While I with Pride obey; Toll, loll, etc.
Those Charms, etc.

AIR.
HARRIET. I.
Fancy my Thought inspiring,
Courage my Bosom firing,
To Pleasure's Realms aspiring,
On Love's gay Wings I rise;
II.
D ubt and Despair defying,
O Belford's Truth relying,
Fond Hope, her Aid supplying,
Shall waft me to my Joys.

AIR.
MARY ANN. I.
At ruddy Eve, and rosy Dawn,
I roved the Fields at Leisure,
I danced at Freedom on the Lawn,
And took my Fill of Pleasure;
I rambled through the bushy Wood,
Where Rills were gently flowing;
Admired the Rose within the Bud,
And Violets sweetly blowing.
II.
How sweet to see, along the Meads,
The Lads and Lasses playing;
When Spring enticed them from their Beds,
And called them forth a-Maying!
Some new Vagary and Delight,
With every Day returning;
And Mirth and Pastime closed the Night,
And welcomed in the Morning.

DUET.
OLDCASTLE and MARY ANNE. Old. His Words, his Looks, his wanton Smiles,
Were only sly alluring Wiles,
Your Pride should take Alarm;

Mar. So soft, so soothing was his Look,
So gentle every Word he spoke,
He could not mean to harm.

Oldc. Vows like his are ever harming.

Mar. Vows like his are ever charming.

Oldc. Then away to your Chamber, and mind what I say;
What your Guardian advises, be sure to obey;
His Presents and Words you must learn to disdain,
And do all you can to forget him again.

Mar. I Will away to my Chamber, nor mind what you say;
What my Guardian advises, I cannot obey;
His Presents and Words I can never disdain;
And I Will do all I can to behold him again.

END OF THE FIRST ACT.
ACT II.
AIR.
HARRIET. WHEN a Point's in Agitation,
Whereon some future Bliss depends,
What alarming Palpitation,
The anxious Bosom rends!
Now glowing Hope, now chilling Fear,
Now sullen Doubt, now dark Despair;
Then again comes Hope with ardent Fires,
Gives new Ambition, new Desires;
And sure Success inspires,

DUET.
LOVIBOND and HARRIET. Beauty is the Prize of Merit;
Boys and Fools appeal in vain;
Manly Sense and manly Spirit,
They alone the Fair obtain.

AIR.
BELFORD. I.
Sweet Peace, restore my wonted Rest,
No longer let me prove
The Pangs that rend the hapless Breast,
Of unrequited Love;
By thee protected, let me lie,
And shun the Scorn of Beauty's Eye.
II.
But should, ye Powers, the sweet, sweet Maid,
My Pains with Pity view;
And though my Sighs too weakly plead,
Lament a Swain so true:
Far greater Torments bid me prove;
I Will die adoring, die for Love.

AIR.
BELFORD. Oh, Love! thou Delight and Tormentor of Hearts;
How balmy thy Comforts! how piercing thy Smarts:
When distressed by the Frowns of the Nymph we adore,
The Pinions of Time move with Rapture no more.
But when Beauty relents, and no longer we mourn;
When Sighs of fond Passion are paid with Return;
Our Years and our Days, Oh, how sweetly they fly!
Each Moment of Life is a Moment of Joy.

AIR.
BELFORD. I.
How sweetly fits the simplest Phrase,
Unfeigned Passion to discover!
Too weak, alas! my fondest Lays,
To show how well, how true I love her;
As soon could I the glittering Stars,
That Midnight's sable Bosom cover,
In order number, as declare,
How well, how true, how dear I love her.
II.
Professions tricked in Language high
The Force of Eloquence discover;
But Nature's Accents best imply,
The Meaning of a faithful Lover.
As soon could I, etc.
III.
Fierce Vows, too often sprung from Art,
Unfair Designs may serve to cover;
But Deeds of Kindness speak the Heart;
And they shall show how well I love her.
As soon could I, etc.

AIR.
MARY ANN. I.
Come, Oh, come, my own dear Swain,
Be but true to Love and me;
Come, Oh, come, thy Faith maintain,
And my Guardian ever be!
II.
Chase away these rude Alarms,
And beneath thy tender Care,
Take a Lass, that from thy Arms,
No Wealth nor Power shall tear.

TRIO.
OLDCASTLE, PETER, BRIDGET. Oldc. Villain! thus your Faith do you hold?
'Twas but by Way of Trial.

Peter. If you had not shown the Gold,
I still had made Denial.

Oldc. All my good Advice to fail;
The Devil sure is in ye.

Brid. What will good Advice avail,
When balanced with a Guinea?

Oldc. From your Duty and Virtue so quickly to fall!

Peter. It Is the Sight of this Gold that bewitches us all.
If our Betters resist not the Force of a Fee,
Say, how should such poor silly Creatures as we?

Brid.

Oldc. From your Duty and Virtue so quickly to fall!

Pet. From our Duty and Virtue how could we but fall!

Brid. It Is the Sight of this Gold that bewitches us all.

Oldc. It Is the Sight of that Gold that be-devil's you all.

END OF THE SECOND ACT.
ACT III.
AIR,
LOVIBOND. I.
I often have thought, and I often have said,
It Is Matter of greatest Surprise,
Such old ones as he still pursue their own Head,
And will not with wiser advise.
II.
An obstinate Grey-beard, by Dotage misled,
Returns to his Childhood again;
Good Counsel's the Go-cart wherein he should tread,
Or Woe to his poor shattered Brain!
III.
If these he provide not, all Mischief and Moan
Deservedly fall on the Elf;
For none should presume to proceed all alone,
Unless they are as wise as myself.

AIR.
BRUMPTON. I.
Lovers, when they meet Return,
Soft Return to amorous Wishes,
Feel no more their Bosoms burn,
But dissolve in melting Blisses*
But debarred the fair-one's Sight,
All is Torment, all is Anguish;
Far they stray from cheering Light,
Doomed alone to pine and languish.
II.
Yet, before I bid adieu*
Oh, forgive each rude Vexation!
Which from fond Endeavors grew
To reveal a faithful Passion.
Thus debarred my Fair-one's Sight,
Left alone to pine and languish;
Robbed of thee, my Star of Light,
All is Darkness, all is Anguish.

AIR.
MARY-ANN. I.
Two before me that adore me;
How, how shall I speak my mind!
One is pleasing, the other teazing;
Where I ought to be, I Will be kind:
Then* Ah-well-a-day, what I covet, Oh!
Guess, and my Meaning find.
II.
One to cheer me, ever near me,
Sweet smiling I wish to obtain;
The Other Creature, sour in Feature,
Never may I behold again.
Then, Ah-well-a-day, what I covet, Oh!
Guess, and my Meaning find.
III.
One to wed me if decreed me,
Blessed, blessed would be all my Hours!
But with the other horrid Lover,
Marriage Misery at once insures.
Then, Ah-well-a-day, what I covet, Oh!
Guess. and my Heart is yours.

TRIO.
BRUMPTON, MARY-ANN, OLDCASTLE. Brump. At length the false Dream of Delusion is
over;
I wander in Doubt and in Darkness no more.

Mar. At length the false Dream of Delusion is over;
I wander in Doubt and in Darkness no more.

Oldc. At length the sad Hours of Suspicion are over;
I wander in Doubt and Vexation no more.

Mar. To your Honor be just, to your Promise be true:
Thus, firmly relying, I bid you adieu.

Brum. Mar. Endless Blessings Fortune send you.

Oldc. With your Leave, Sir, I Will attend you.

Brum. Mar. All your fairest Wishes crown.

Oldc. With your Leave, I Will see you down.
To Honor be just -- etc.
To my Honor --

AIR.
BELFORD. I.
Cupid, befriends us,
His Sanction he lends us,
Rebuking our idle Delay*
He points to the Glade,
Where his Honors are paid,
And he cries, Come away, come away!
II.
Away with denying,
The Moments are flying,
And fleet is the Season of Love;
The God will repent
Of the Grace he has lent,
If the Favors we will not improve.
III.
On those who obey,
And are fond of his Sway,
Profusely his Blessings he showers:
Then seize we the Time,
That if lost by our Crime,
Ah! never again may be ours.

DUETT.
HARRIET and BELLFORD. Love and Freedom now uniting,
Speak the happy Moments nigh;
Now to Hymen's Fane inviting,
Glad, their golden Course they ply,
And, in his Behest delighting,
Scatter Blessings as they fly.

AIR.
MARY-ANN. Tell me, Love, tell me, Love,
Tell the Fate I Am doomed to prove;
Hope now shines with cheerful Ray,
Smiling Joys around me play.
Cupid, say, Cupid, say,
Will the flattering Vision stay?
Let no mournful Change appear,
Gloomy Sorrow, boding Fear.
Tell me, Love, etc.

AIR.
HARRIET. I.
Submission's the Lover's best Grace;
Loud Accents, and Menaces rude,
Each other Perfection efface;
By Softness the Fair is subdued.
II.
The Glances that partly reveal,
And partly suppress the soft Pain*
Mute Sighs, to the Soul that appeal,
These only the Fair can obtain.

AIR.
HARRIET. Come, my good Guardian, and compare
The Bloom of Youth with aged Care;
As you to Time, to you I bow;
But here have pledged my faithful Vow.
Believe me, Youth has many Charms,
Which long ago has left thy Arms.
Be patient, Sir; this Flight will prove
A School for Guardians, kept by Love.

FINALE*
BRUMPTON. Affection, born of wild Desires,
Uncertain, transient Joys inspires;
But built on firm and fair Esteem*
It then affords a Bliss supreme.

Chor. It then affords, etc.

MARY-ANN. Affection often is truer seen,
When sporting round the rural Green,
Than there, where Wealth and Power reside,
Though decked in all the Pomp of Pride.

Chor. Though decked, etc.

HARRIET. By Nature Love was first designed
A general Good to all Mankind;
"And Love, like Air, was widely given,
The purest, noblest Gift of Heaven."

Chor. The purest, noblest, etc.

BELFOLD. Love himself will find the Way
His faithful Vot'ries to repay;
And decent Hymen most reveres
Consenting Hearts, and equal Years.

Chor. Consenting Hearts, etc.

OLDCASTLE and LOVIBOND together. Though foolish once, grown wiser now,
Let us this honest Truth allow,
That decent Hymen most reveres
Consenting Hearts, and equal Years.

GENERAL CHORUS. Affection, born of wild Desires, etc.

FINIS.
