THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BRITISH INSECTS.
PLATE CCLXXXIX. SPHINX ATROPOS. DEATH HEAD, or BE TIGER MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thickest in the middle. Wings deflexed, the outer
margin declining toward the sides.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings entire; posterior pair yellow, barred
across with brown. Abdomen yellow, with black rings.

The Sphinx Atropos is a magnificent creature, and the largest of the European
Lepidopterous Insects. The characteristic marks of this species are very
singular; on the thorax in particular the figure of a human skull is strongly
depicted. These Insects have been deemed a presage of some approaching
calamity, by the peasantry in countries where they have appeared by chance; and
Linnaeus has himself named it after one of the three Fates, of the Heathen
Mythology.

This species seems no where common. In this country it is rare. We have an
English Specimen in the winged state, and once met with its larva, of a full
size, but it died before it became a pupa.


PLATE CCXC. THE LARVA OF SPHINX ATROPOS. DEATH HEAD, or BE TIGER MOTH.
This Specimen was found on the Jasmine, the latter end of August. It is said
to feed also on Potatoes and Green Elder. It appears in the Fly state in July.


PLATE CCXCI. PEDICULI COLUMBAE. PIGEON'S LOUSE. APTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Six Feet. Eyes two. Mouth contains a sting. Antennae length
of the Thorax.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Body slender, thickest toward the end,
whitish, a ferruginous line along each side.

utrinque ferrugineis. Geoff. Ins. 2. 599. 7. Pulex Columbae Majoris. Redi de
Insectis tab. 2. fig. 1.
This is the kind of Louse found on the common Pigeon. It differs specifically
from those of other Birds and Animals, as may be conjectured from its
significant name, P. Columbae.

It is supposed that almost every creature has its peculiar species of
Pediculi, but not more than fifty distinct species have been hitherto
ascertained; and nearly the whole of these belong to the feathered tribe. Redi,
Linnaeus, Fabricius, and other Authors distinguish many of these Insects by the
names of those creatures they infest, as P. Vulturis, Orioli, Cuculi, Cygni,
Pavonis, Phasiani, etc. etc.

PLATE CCXCII. PAPILIO CARDUI. PAINTED LADY BUTTERFLY.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed. Wings erect when at rest. Fly by day.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings indented, above orange variegated with
black and white; beneath, four eyes on the posterior pair.

PAPILIO CARDUI: alis dentatis fulvis albo nigroque variegatis: posticis subtus

The Painted Lady Butterfly is a local species, and therefore not very common.
In some seasons, these Insects appear in considerable numbers, and then again
are not seen for several years. They were taken in abundance in the summer of
1795, in many parts of the kingdom, and particularly in Manchester; but since
that time, few, if any, have been met with.

In point of beauty, this species has an immediate claim to the notice of
English Entomologists. Its larva feeds on nettles, thistles, docks, and other
herbage by the sides of ditches, and changes to the pupa state about the middle
or latter end of July; the winged Insect appears twelve days after.


PLATE CCXCIII.
FIG. I. PHALAENA ULMATA. SCARCE ELM MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae setaceous. Wings white, with a
double row of pale black spots across the middle: a ferruginous brown spot at
the base, and another at the posterior margin of the first pair: a similar spot
in the interior margin of the second pair also.

pectinicornis alis albis: fascia maculari flavicante, abdomine luteo nigro
punctato. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 863. 218.
This species bears some affinity to the Phalena Grossulariata, or Current
Moth. It is very rare, and has been hitherto found only in Yorkshire. It
appears the third week in June. The larva feeds on the elm: it is green,
streaked with black, and has a black head; the pupa blueish.

FIG. II. PHALAENA MARGINATA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae setaceous. Wings white, with a deep
irregular brown margin of interrupted spots.

Phalaena Geometra Marginata As the specific name Marginata occur, in the
description of a Moth in Plate CL. it may be proper to observe, that the Insect
there figured, is Noctua Marginata of Fabricius. -- The sectional divisions of
the Phalaenae must be particularly attended to, when the same specific name
occurs more than once.
is rather common. It lives on the nut, and is found in the winged state in May.

FIG. III. PHALAENA PRUNARIA, Var. FEMALE ORANGE. MOTH.
Male, Plate 23. Br. Ins.

The male of Phalaena Prunaria is represented and described in the early part
of our British Insects; but it differs so considerably from the singular
variety of the same species now before us, that we presume to introduce it in
the annexed plate of Geometrae.


PLATE CCXCIV. MUSCA SOLSTITIALIS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The mouth formed by a soft fleshy proboscis, with two
lateral lips. No palpi.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Antennae furnished with a lateral hair. Wings
white, with four somewhat connected black bars across. Scutellum yellow.

MUSCA SOLSTITIALIS: antennis setariis, alis albis: fasciis quatuor connexis

PLATE CCXCV. PAPILIO COMMA. PEARL SKIPPER BUTTERFLY.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed at the ends. Wings erect when at rest. Fly
by day.

Plebeii Urbicolae.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings entire, divaricated, brown, having a black streak
along the middle of the anterior pair. Beneath, spotted with white.

1. p. 325. 233. PAPILIO COMMA: Wien. Verz. 159. 4.
In the beginning of August, 1772, a brood of these Insects were taken near
Jews in Sussex, by the late Mr. Green; and we believe no other specimens have
been taken since that period.

It is not very unlike the Papilio Sylvanus of Fabricius, but may be readily
distinguished from it by the square spots on the under-side being perfectly
white.


PLATE CCXCVI. SPHINX PINASTRI. PINE HAWK MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thickest in the middle. Wings deflexed when at
rest. Fly slow, morning and evening.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings entire. Greyish white: three contiguous
black lines in the middle of the anterior pair. Abdomen brownish, with bands of
white.

SPHINX PINASTRI: alis integris canis: anticis lineolis tribus confertis

We have only a traditionary report that Sphinx Pinastri has been sometimes
found in Scotland; but as it is generally admitted, on that authority, to a
place in the cabinets of English Insects, we cannot refrain inserting it in the
present work.

It is an European Insect, and in particular is found in the Pine forests of
Germany. Roesel has figured it with the larva and pupa, in the plate above
quoted; and as we may, perhaps, never meet with it in that state, we conceived
the copies of them in the annexed plate, would at least be satisfactory to such
subscribers as have not the works of that German author.


PLATE CCXCVII. CIMEX BICOLOR. BLACK AND WHITE FIELD BUG.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Rostrum inflected. Antennae longer than the thorax. One
wing-case folded over the other. Feet formed for running.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Black. Wing-cases variegated with black and
white; a semi-circular white space in the middle. Wings transparent and whitish.

PLATE CCXCVIII. PHALAENA TRIPLACIA. SPECTACLE MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

* * Noctua.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Wings deflexed; first pair
greyish, with a double ferruginous arch; at the base, and another in an
opposite direction near the apex.

21. Merian. Europ. tab. 97.
This Insect is remarkable for a fanciful kind of marking that encircles the
eyes, and seems to resemble a pair of spectacles. It is found in the winged
state the fourth week in June.


PLATE CCXCIX. PHALAENA ROBORIS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

* * Noctua.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings deflexed, greyish: two undulated white
waves across the anterior pair: a white space in the middle, having a lunar
black mark in its center.

PHALAENA ROBORIS: laevis alis deflexis cinereis: strigis duabus undatis albis,
macula centrali nivea: lunula nigra. Fab. Ent. Syst. 3. p. 2. p. 35. sp. 90.
A scarce species; it is found on the nut-tree.


PLATE CCC. TIPULA POMONAE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Head lengthened out. Upper jaw arched. Palpi two, curved,
longer than the head. Proboscis short, and bent inwards.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shining black. Wings whitish, with a central
dark spot in the anterior margin. Thighs ferruginous.

TIPULA POMONAE: glabra nigra alis lacteis: puncto nigro, femoribus
ferrugineis. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 4. p. 249. sp. 74.
We met with both sexes of this uncommon Insect in Coombe Wood, Surry, in the
beginning of June, 1798. -- The specimen Fabricius described was taken in this
country also, May 13, on a fruit-tree.


PLATE CCCI. CICINDELA RIPARIA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae setaceous. Jaws advanced and armed with teeth.
Eyes prominent. Thorax roundish and margined.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Greenish, bronzed, with many excavated round
spots on the wing-cases.

We found this beautiful species in some plenty in a little marshy spot behind
the town of Newton, on the sea shore of Glamorganshire. Gmelin says it is found
in wet places, and observes that its color often varies.

It is a minute insect, and is represented magnified in the annexed plate.


PLATE CCCII. PAPILIO AGLAJA. SILVER SPOT FRITTILARY BUTTERFLY.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed at the ends. Wings erect when at rest. Fly
by day.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings dentated, fulvous, with black spots.
Twenty silver spots on the under side of the posterior wings.

PAPILIO AGLAJA: alis dentatis fulvis nigro maculatis: subtus 21. maculis

A very beautiful and not uncommon British species; the Larva feeds on the
Violet, etc.; it is of a dirty black color, spotted with brown, and armed with
long spines, as in P. Antiopa. This Larva is found in May, changes to the pupa
state the latter end of the same month, and appears twenty-one days after a
winged insect.


PLATE CCCIII. DYTISCUS 2 PUNCTATUS. TWO SPOT BOAT BEETLE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae either setaceous, or furnished at the end with a
perfoliated capitulum. Hind feet formed for swimming, and hairy.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Black brown. Thorax yellow with two black
points: wing-cases variegated with yellow and brown.

DYTISCUS 2 PUNCTATUS: ater thorace flavo: punctis duobus nigris, elytris flavo
fuscoque variis. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 1. p. 192. sp. 22.
Fabricius describes this as a German insect. It has not been figured by any
author, and is uncommon in Great Britain. Lives in the water.


PLATE CCCIV. PHALAENA ABISINTHII. WORMWOOD MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

* Noctua.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Wings deflexed: white,
fasciated and spotted with black in a somewhat quadrangular manner.

PHALAENA ABISINTHII: crista alis deflexis canis: faciis punctisque in
tetragonum positis nigris. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 845. 133. -- Fn. Sv. 1182. Fab.
Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 2. p. 88. sp. 261.
Phalaena Abisinthii is certainly an elegant species, and particularly
interesting as a native of this country. A few years since it was very highly
esteemed by collectors of English natural history, and at present it holds a
distinguished rank amongst the more valuable insects of our cabinets. Has been
found on some wormwood in Bunhillfields, about twenty years ago.

The larva is beautifully variegated with red, and tender shades of green and
yellow on a whitish ground: it feeds on the wormwood, and becomes a pupa within
a case, or spinning. Found in the winged state in July.


PLATE CCCV. CERAMBYX OCULATUS.
* * Saperda.

GENERIC CHARCTER. Antennae articulated, tapering toward the ends. Thorax
either armed with spines, or gibbous. Wing-cases throughout of equal breadth.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Cylindrical: Thorax without spines, yellow,
with two black spots. Wing-cases gray with linear streaks of excavated black
points.

CERAMBYX OCULATUS: thorace mutico cylindrico luteo: punctis duobus nigris,
elytris fastigiatis linearibus nigris. SAPERDA. Linn. Faun. Suec. 664. --

OCULATA. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 1. p. 2. p. 308. Schaeff. Icon. tab. 128. fig. 4.
This insect is described and figured, by some of the continental writers on
entomology, as a native of France, Italy, and Germany, but has not, we believe,
been hitherto noticed as a British species. Like other local insects it is said
to be extremely common in the Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, and perhaps is not
found in any other part of the country.


PLATE CCCVI. PHALAENA QUADRA. SPOTTED FOOTMAN MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax smooth. Wings depressed, yellow, with
two dark blue spots on the anterior pair.

PHALAENA QUADRA: laevis alis depressis luteis: anticis punctis duobus cyaneis.

Schaeff. Elem. tab. 98. fig. 5. Roes. Ins. 1. phal. 2. tab. 17.
The larva of this species rarely occurs, and the winged Insect is not common.
Linnaeus has taken his specific character of this Moth from the four blue spots
on the anterior wings: it is therefore necessary to observe, that the other sex
has no such spots, and has erroneously been made a distinct species by the same
author, because it was destitute of them. -- Found in the winged state in May
and June.


PLATE CCCVII. PHALAENA POPULI. DECEMBER MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Brown: an irregular pale streak across the
anterior pair, and a smaller one near the base. A single pale streak across the
posterior pair.

PHALAENA POPULI: fusca antice pallida, alis reversis fuscescentibus: striga
sesquialtera repanda albida. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 818. 34. -- Fn. Sv. 1101. --
Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 2. p. 429. sp. 70. Wien. Verz. 58. 9. Roes. Ins. 1.
phal. 2. tab. 60.
We seldom meet with this interesting species, for it is found both in the
larva and perfect state in the season, when few collectors are disposed to seek
for it. It feeds on the white-thorn, becomes a pupa in November, and the Moth
appears in December as its trivial English name implies.


PLATE CCCVIII. STAPHYLINUS ERYTHROPTERUS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae moniliform. Elytra not half the length of the
abdomen. Wings folded, and concealed under the elytra.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Black. Wing-cases, antennae, and legs red.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings deflexed greyish: a broad ferruginous space across
the anterior wings, marked in the middle with two black points encircled with
white.

A specimen of this Insect in the winged state was found in Hyde Park this
summer; it is one of the scarcest of the British Sphinges, and was found by
Harris many years since in meadows -- Osterly Wood, near Brentford, May 27th.

The larva is of an uniform dull brown, with three eye-shaped spots on each
side, and is furnished with a tail; it feeds on the epilobium, and changes to
Chrysalis about the end of July.


PLATE CCCXV. RAPHIDIA OPHIOPSIS. NEUROPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Head depressed or flat. Mouth armed with two teeth, and
furnished with four palpi. Three stemmata. Wings deflected. Antennae long as
the thorax, anterior part of which is lengthened out and cylindrical. Tail of
the female terminated by a flexible crooked bristle.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Thorax cylindrical; a brown marginal spot on each wing.

We can scarcely conceive what motive induced Fabricius to confound the
Raphidia Ophiopsis and notata as one species in his last work, after having
described both with accuracy in his former publication: it appears indeed, that
his names were erroneous, and his synonyms misapplied; but it was needless to
correct one error by committing another.

The first species of Raphidiae known, was figured in the works of Roesel, Die
Fleine Landhaelsige. Lanlibelle fig. 6. 7. pl. 21, it was described in the
Fauna Suecica, by Linnaeus, under the specific name Ophiopsis; and again in the
Systema Natura of the same author, with a reference to the only figure of it
then extant, that of Roesel. Hence it appears that the true Raphidia Ophiopsis
of Linnaeus, is that figured by this author. In later editions, the works of
Sulzer, Schaeffer, Geoffroy and Scopoli, were added to the synonyms, but the
figures thus quoted, evidently include two species, one with wings perfectly
clear, the other having a marginal black spot on each. Linnaeus seems to have
considered the two as varieties of the same species, but he is evidently
mistaken, for the two sexes of both kinds are now clearly ascertained.

Fabricius has followed Linnaeus in his Species Insectorum, has
indiscriminately adopted all the synonyms, and thereby confounded all the
figures of the two Raphidae that have been noticed by authors on European
Insects, under the name of Ophiopsis: and after this he describes that very
species which has spots on the wings as a new and unfigured kind, under the
name of notata. Thorace cylindrico alis macula marginali fusca. Habitat in
anglia. Had he referred to the volumes of Roesel, he must have known that his
notata was the Linnaean Ophiopsis, and if either Insect was new, it must
certainly be that destitute of spots.

Gmelin in his Systema Natura perpetuates the same error; he follows the
Species Insectorum of Fabricius, and gives the characters thus: "R. Ophiopsis
alis immaculatis. Fab." and R. notata, alis macula marginali fusca. Fab. but
whilst the works of Gmelin are preparing for publication, Fabricius alters his
opinion; and in the last work. Syst. Ent. emendet et aucta, abolishes his
specific characters, and merely says there is no difference between his former
species "Raphidia notata, nullo modo distincta." Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 2. p. 99.

As we have all the species described by those authors before us, we shall
endeavor to restore them to order, and that by retaining the former
descriptions of Fabricius, changing the names, and dividing the synonyms, for
both are sufficiently characteristic; that with marginal spots is figured by
Roesel, Schaeffer and Scopoli, and the immaculated or clear-winged kind by
Geoffroy and Sulzer. The first we deem the true R. Ophiopsis, and the latter as
a distinct insect, which may be called the Raphidia Immaculata with propriety.

Both species of this singular creature are extremely rare. Geoffroy, speaking
of the unspotted kind, says he never found it but twice, and then in woods
Geoffroy Histoire des Insectes.
. The larva is unknown; in the pupa state it is furnished with legs, and runs
fast.


PLATE CCCXVI. PHALAENA GONONSTIGMA. SCARCE VAPOURER MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings incumbent, brown. Two white spots on
the first wings; one placed on the anterior, and the other nearly opposite, on
the posterior margin. Female without wings.

PHALAENA GONONSTIGMA: acis incumbentibus fuscis: maculis duabus albis
oppositis, foemina aptera. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 826. 57. -- Fab. Ent. Syst. T.
3. p. 1. p. 477. sp. 217. Roes. Ins. 1. phal. 2. tab. 40. Albin. Ins. tab. 90.
The Phalaena Gononstigma, and Phalaena Antiqua are very similar both in the
larva and winged state, as well as in the extraordinary appearance of the
apterous female. Hence former collectors of English insects denominated them
trivially the Scarce and Common Vapourer Moths. It is evident from those
allusive names, that the latter was more frequently taken than the other; at
this time Phalaena Antiqua is found very common, but the latter so rarely, that
we never met with it, in the winged state, till this summer.

Once found the larva on an oak in Coombe Wood, Surry, but it died soon after.


PLATE CCCXVII. PHALAENA PERSICARIAE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested, wings deflexed, dark and
clouded. A white kidney-shaped spot, with a yellow lunar pupil in the middle on
each.

PHALAENA PERSICARIAE: crista alis deflexis fusco nebulosis: stigmate reniformi

Geoff. Ins. 2. 157. 94. Ammir. Ins. tab. 157. Roes. Ins. I. phal. 2. tab. 30.
A very common insect; and is often observed near fruit trees.


PLATE CCCXVIII. PHALAENA DIDACTYLUS. BIFID-WING PLUME MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae taper from the base. Wings in general deflexed
when at rest. Fly by night.

* Alucita. Linn.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings divided into plumes, brown, barred with
white. Anterior wings consists of two feathers, posterior pair of three.

PHALAENA DIDACTYLUS: alis fissis fuscus: strigis albis anticis bifidis,
posticis tripartitis. Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 899. 454. -- Fn. Sv. 1453.

The larva of this very singular creature is said to feed on the convolvulus
and Geo rivali. We have considered it as one of the scarcest species of the
Plume-Moths found in this country: our specimen was taken in Epping Forest, in
June It is a most beautiful object for the microscope.


PLATE CCCXIX. SPHINX LOTI. FIVE SPOT BURNET SPHINX.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae thickest in the middle. Wings deflected when at
rest. Fly slow, morning and evening.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Anterior wings greenish, with five red spots.
Posterior wings red, bordered with fine blue.

ZYGAENA LOTI: alis anticis viridibus: punctis quinque rubris, posticis
sanguineis: limbo cyaneo. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 2. p. 387. sp. 5. SPHINX
LOTI. Wien. Verz. 45. 3. Schaeff. Icon. tab. 16. fig. 6. 7. Sphinx Lonicerae.
Esp. Ins. 2. tab. 24. fig. 1.
This beautiful little species may be easily confounded with the Sphinx
Filipendula, figured in the sixth plate of this work; its general resemblance
is striking, and it differs chiefly in the number of red spots that adorn the
superior wings. Sphinx Filipendula has invariably six spots on each wing, and
the latter as constantly only five.

Some readers may be inclined to deem it a mere variety of the sort, from its
general appearance, but it will be perceived by the synonyms quoted above, that
all the continental writers on the subject admit it as a distinct species; nor
can we for a moment hesitate to agree in the same opinion.

It is rare in this country, and the larva unknown, or at least is undescribed.


PLATE CCCXX. PAPILIO JANIRA. MEADOW BROWN BUTTERFLY.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed at the end. Wings erect when at rest. Fly
by day.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Wings dentated above, brown beneath, first
pair yellowish, with a black eye-shaped mark, second pair brownish, with two
smaller eye-spots.

-- Fn. Sv. 152. Roess. Ins. 3. tab. 34. fig. 7. 8.
Linnaeus described the two sexes of this Butterfly as distinct Species under
the names of Janira and Jurtina. The first is the male and the latter the
female insect.

The larva is hairy, green, with a lateral white line and bifid tail, and feeds
on grass. It is very common in the winged state, frequenting meadows, etc.
whence it is called the Meadow Brown Butterfly.


PLATE CCCXXI.
FIG. I. I. CHRYSOMELA CORYLI. COLEOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae composed of globular articulations which become
larger toward the ends.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Black. Thorax and wing-cases testaceous
brown, without spots.

We have frequently observed this species amongst the Insects of Germany, where
it is probably not uncommon. In England it is very rare, having been found only
by the Rev. John Buriel of Letherinset, near Holt, Norfolk. In one sex the
thorax is red, in the other black.

FIG. II. II. CHRYSOMELA SERICEA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Bluish green. Antennae black.

FIG. I. I. PAPILIO ALSUS. LEPIDOPTERA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae clubbed at the end. Wings in general erect when at
rest. Fly by day.

Plebeii rurules.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings entire brown, without spots; beneath gray, with a
row of eye-shaped spots.

HESPERIA ALSUS: alis integerrimis fuscis immaculatis subtus cinereis, striga
punctorum ocellatorum. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 3. p. 1. p. 295. 125. Schaeff. Icon.
2. tab. 165. fig. 1. 2.
This pretty Insect is found late in June. Its larva is unknown.

FIG. II. II. PAPILIO IDAS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Wings entire brown. An equal marginal row of red spots
both on the upper and underside. A black spot in the middle of the anterior
wings.

PAPILIO IDAS: alis integris fuscis, fascia marginali utrinque rubromaculata,
anticis macula media nigra.
This insect must not be confounded with the Papilio Idas of Linnaeus. The
Linnaean P. Idas is evidently the female of P. Argus, a circumstance unknown to
that author, who considers them as a distinct species from their very
dissimilar appearance. In one sex the upper surface is brown, and in the other
a fine blue; this is not, however, peculiar to the P. Argus, for several of the
Papilio tribe known amongst English collectors by the trivial name Blues differ
in the same manner.

We suspect that our Insect has not been described by any author; it is
certainly unnoticed by Fabricius in his last System of Entomology, and the
specific name Idas omitted. This name is therefore preferred for our Insect,
which seems to approach nearer to the female Argus described by Linnaeus as
Idas, than to any other. Found in May.


PLATE CCCXXIII. SCARABAEUS LURIDUS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae terminate in a club, which is divided
longitudinally into laminae or plates.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Scutellum, thorax and head black. Wing-cases
pale brown, striated, and somewhat tessellated with linear black marks.

SCARABAEUS LURIDUS: scutellatus capite tuberculato ater, elytris griseis nigro
striatis. Fab. Ent. Syst. T. 1. p. 29. Sp. 91. SCARABAEUS LURIDUS. Oliv. Ins.
1. 3. 90. 100. tab. 18. fig. 68. and tab. 26. fig. 168. Scarabaeus tessellatus.
Myll. Zool. Dan. Jabl. Coleopt. 2. tab. 18. fig. 3.
Fabricius describes this species from a specimen in the cabinet of Sir J.
Banks, and notes its habitat England. From this circumstance we may infer that
it is not common in other countries, though we are certain it is a native of
Denmark and Germany.


PLATE CCCXXIV. PHALAENA SPONSA. CRIMSON UNDERWING MOTH.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Antennae setaceous. Wing deflexed when at rest. Fly by
night.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Thorax crested. Anterior wings greyish,
undulated, spotted with brown. Posterior pair crimson, with two black bars
across. Abdomen gray.

PHALAENA SPONSA: crista, alis planis cinerascentibus fusco undulatis: posticis
rubris; fasciis duabus nigris, abdomine undique cinereo. Linn. Syst. Not. 2.
841. 118. Roes. Ins. 4. tab. 19.
In the description of Phalaena Nupta, we have offered some remarks on the
Sponsa, Nupta, and Pacta of Linnaeus and Fabricius; and have only to add in
this place, that an accurate figure of P. Pacta is given in Fuesl. Archiv. tab.
15. fig. 3. This figure is smaller than the species found in Great Britain, and
in particular has the upper surface of the abdomen crimson, as authors have
described it.

The Synonyms of the three species, as they stand in the works of Linnaeus and
Fabricius, are very incorrect. We venture to retain that to Roesel's plate,
vol. 4. t. 19. in which the larva we have figured is given.

The Caterpillars feed on the tops of the highest Oaks, change to the pupa
state in June, and appears a winged Insect early in the month following.
