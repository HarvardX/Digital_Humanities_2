ACCOMMODATION, etc.
CONDESCENSION in the muse
Severest critics will excuse;
Condescension in the man
Is the skilful, winning, plan:
By condescension, here, I mean
Accommodation in the scene
Of life. -- Will A -- -y condescend
To view the trifler in the friend;
That friend who ever has, and will
Protect his character from ill;
Give up life, -- all fancy's power,
To cheer his every anxious hour?
Then surely A -- -y cannot refuse
The whimseys of a flighty muse.
A bland, goodnatur'd, muse that must
Protect the good, -- the great, -- the just;
Protect the wise, -- protect the brave, --
All, -- All, -- but coward, fool, and knave:
And cowards, fools, and knaves shall be
The objects of her charity.
Then A -- -y surely will excuse
An idle, truant, laughing muse;
A muse that ever will incline
To favor A -- -y with a line; --
-- His gentleness can never refuse
The fondly, -- overweening muse;
That often in person will attend him,
And counsel quaint will freely lend him:
Then A -- -y never can refuse
The gambols of this frolic muse.
How! -- says, Sir critic; -- not to brand
With infamy the murdering hand;
And every character that can
Sink to the brute from reasoning man!
-- Avaunt rash criticism! -- Learn ye!
He served his time to vile attorney;
And vile attorneys never can be
Fit subjects for a lash from thee:
-- We then should too much condescend. --
What! -- Give our satire for no end!
No! -- Let him canter over the hill
Of wild Parnassus with his quill;
And stumble on without a note
From us, who think and write by rote.
The conscious muse, in native charms,
Laughs, -- 'till she bursts, -- at such alarms;
Dares every critic to defiance,
-- She never wishes such alliance;
Dares every critic with a frown, --
To laud her, -- up; to blast her, -- down.
With indignation now she burns,
And gladly to that friend returns; --
Who gave her, with a gentle hand,
And feeling heart, each sweet command: --
What to embrace, -- and what to fly
During her term of slavery.
Kind, -- gentle spirit! -- yet even he
Can scarce escape severity;
Whose noble mind, -- and swelling heart,
Their virtues cheerfully impart
TO MAN AT LARGE: -- without a dream
Of self's attractive, -- darling theme;
That luscious, -- dear, -- engaging thing,
Which sways alike the clown, -- the king; --
At every place, -- at every hour, --
Gives strange exemplars of it is power.
The cheerful reader too 'll excuse
The queer digressions of the muse;
And give her credit for awhile
For every laugh, -- for every smile; --
Which she engages to exert, --
Neither too timorous, -- nor pert;
As opportunity permits, --
And she can strike some lucky hits.
Her first essay; -- and all her own.
-- Sir critic, fie! -- suppress that frown! --
-- Solicits favor, from --
-- A FRIEND: --
And, if she meet with his applause,
Will lengthen out her little cause: --
-- By daring, in some future plan,
Analysis of the human character; -- begun by the author of this little
performance; -- showing POPE's Essay on man unintelligible, as a finished, --
philosophical, piece; but largely subscribing to the inimitable beauties of it,
as a merely poetical one.
To analyze that creature man;
Whether in poetry, or prose,
Is insignificant to those,
Who think, -- who act, -- from nature's school,
And never idly play the fool: --
-- As whilom THOMAS often did,
Without his ever being chid; --
Except by such, -- as never knew,
Skilful to give the finespun clew
To mild conversion's calm retreat; --
-- Where all the muses, -- graces meet; --
And every ghost, -- and every shade,
Of GODLIKE MAN, -- that GOD has made:
Midst scenes of wildest dissipation lost; --
His sensibility too often crossed; --
Through the kindliest warmth of blood,
Deserting every social good:
This, and that, perverse vexation
Springing all from circulation
Of boiling blood, -- through every vein
Quick-trembling to it is source again, --
The heart; -- whence every rapture flows
For every good, which it bestows
On kindred man: -- without a thought
Of being asked for, -- being sought.
Spite of all the rage of fashion, --
Spite of every wayward passion, --
Spite of nature's opposition; --
He means to make a strange transition
From bad to good; -- offhand reclaim
Each immoral, youthful aim;
And stranger still! -- for quirking seats
Barter the muse's green retreats.
Hold! -- cries, dame prudence; -- hold your hand
And listen to this sage command. --
Beware, young man! -- with caution rove
Over legal bank, -- through quibbling grove; --
Let law, and reason, -- PRUDENCE join; --
Then, then! you strike a good design.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Curse on your tame, -- your frigid notions
And all such quack, -- cathartic potions.
The GOD OF NATURE gave us passions, --
To grace us with on all occasions;
And gave us reason to control
The frantic sallies of the soul.
Past follies! -- Nature ought to bear,
And think him highly worth her care.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
With all his faults, -- and all his folly,
He Is freed at length from MELANCHOLY;
And her attendant, -- APATHY. --
-- Dull, -- cynic apathy! -- whose boast,
And blunted praise is always lost, --
By seldom thinking, -- never acting; --
And yet it ever seems transacting.
A mere machine, -- we use at will,
And keep it going on, -- or still,
As fancy leads: -- a moping jade; --
A piece of clockwork, -- only made
For keenest cuts of comic wit, --
Just when my lady's in the fit
To flourish over wild nature's page,
And stamp the wretch of every age.
The cruel critics still abuse
The whimsical, -- meandrous muse; --
Without one social feeling dare
To blast my first, -- my only care;
And dully criticizing say; --
The pillars, when they artless lay,
The superstructure must betray: --
Quickly the castle's undermined
And by a trifling gale of wind.
So fare the laurel and the bays
Of such a rhymester's jingling lays; --
-- His canting, -- puling, -- lukewarm, --
The brawling brats of coldest climes, --
The laurel claim and blooming bays,
Without the least pretense to praise: --
-- Let gentlest breezes gently come,
They shake his high-aspiring plume, --
Which trembling drops, -- without a tear
From us who give him, -- every fear.
And now, AERIAL GENIUS! -- now
Stoop to my muse, -- she will teach you, how
To sweep the skilful, -- winning bow.
Bend genius, -- bend! -- accept this new, --
This grand, -- accommodating clew;
-- Nobly defend the muse's claim
A mirthful muse's honest aim. --
-- And when dull apathists perceive
That you the mystic muse can believe; --
They Will crawl it on, -- in faith with you,
And own themselves high-honoured too. --
-- Let but the lower ranks comply, --
You Will have the muse's leave to fly, --
And soar it to your native sky.
First let the towering genius dare
To make high worth his constant care; --
Next let the towering genius bend
To make each honest heart, -- his friend.
And never think it worth his part
To court the head without the heart: --
-- We grant, -- that where they kindly meet,
The union forms an higher treat: --
But a good heart, -- the deity will own, --
Far, -- far excels, -- the merely laureled crown.
