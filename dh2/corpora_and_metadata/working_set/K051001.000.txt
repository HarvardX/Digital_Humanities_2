THE DRAGON of WANTLEY.
ACT I.
SCENE I. A Rural Prospect.
CHORUS. FLY, Neighbors, fly,
The Dragon's nigh,
Save your Lives and fly;
Away, away,
For if you stay,
Sure as a Gun you die. Fly, etc.

[Exeunt. [The Dragon crosses the Stage. SCENE, A Hall.
GUBBINS, MARGERY, and CHORUS. Gub. What wretched Havoc does this Dragon make!
He sticks at nothing for his Belly's Sake:
Feeding but makes his Appetite the stronger,
He Will eat us all, if he 'bides here much longer!

CHORUS. Houses and Churches,
To Him are Geese and Turkies.

Marg. O Father! Father! as our noble 'Squire
Was sat at Breakfast by his Parlour Fire,
With Wife and Children, all in pleasant Tattle,
The Table shook, the Cups began to rattle;
A dismal Noise was heard within the Hall,
Away they flew, the Dragon scared them all:
He drank up all their Coffee at a Sup,
And next devoured their Toast and Butter up.

AIR.
But to hear the Children mutter,
When they would lost their Toast and Butter,
And to see my Lady moan,
Oh! 'twould melt a Heart of Stone.
Here the 'Squire with Servants wrangling;
There the Maids and Mistress jangling,
And the pretty hungry Dears
All together by the Ears,
Scrambling for a Barley-Cake:
Oh! 'twould make one's Heart to ache. But to hear, etc.
Gub This Dragon very modish, sure, and nice is:
What shall we do in this diast'rous Crisis?

Marg. A Thought, to quell him, comes into my Head;
No way more proper than to kill him dead.

Gub. O Miracle of Wisdom! rare Suggestion!
But how, or who to do it, that is the Question.

Marg. Not far from hence there lives a valiant Knight,
A Man of Prowess great, and mickle Might:
He has done Deeds St. George himself might brag on;

Marg. This very Man is he shall kill the Dragon.

AIR.
He Is a Man every Inch, I assure you,
Stout, vigorous, active and tall;
There Is none can from Danger secure you,
Like brave gallant Moore of Moore-Hall.
No Giant or Knight ever quelled him,
He fills all their Hearts with Alarms;
No Virgin yet ever beheld him,
But wished herself clasped in his Arms.
CHORUS. Let Us go to his Dwelling,
With Yelping and Yelling;
We'll move him to Pity,
And tell him, and tell him a sorrowful Ditty.

[Exeunt. SCENE, Moore-Hall.
Symphony.
MOORE and his Companions. Moore. Come, Friends, let us circulate the cheerful
Glass;
Let each true Toper toast his favorite Lass.
Sound all your Instruments of Joy, and play:
Let Us drink and sing, and pass the Time away.

AIR.
Zeno, Plato, Aristotle,
All were Lovers of the Bottle;
Poets, Painters and Musicians,
Churchmen, Lawyers and Physicians,
All admire a pretty Lass,
All require a cheerful Glass.
Every Pleasure has its Season,
Love and Drinking are no Treason.
[Zeno, etc.
Enter GUBBINS, MAUXALINDA, MARGERY, and others. CHORUS. O save us all!
Moore of Moore-Hall!
Or else this cursed Dragon
Will plunder our Houses,
Our Daughters and Spouses,
And leave us the Devil a Rag on.
[O save, etc.

Marg. AIR.
Gentle Knight! all Knights exceeding,
Pink of Prowess, and good Breeding,
Let a Virgin's Tears inspire thee;
Let a Maiden's Blushes fire thee.

Moore. (aside) Her Looks shoot through my Soul, her Eyes strike Fire;
I Am all a Conflagration of Desire.
(To her) Fair Maid, I grant whatever you can ask,
The Deed is done, when once you name the Task.

Marg. The Dragon, Sir, the Dragon!

Moore. Say no more,
You soon shall see him weltring in his Gore.

Marg. Most mighty Moore! do but this Dragon kill,
All that we have is wholly at your Will.

Moore. The only Bounty I require, is this,
That thou may fire me with an ardent Kiss;
That thy soft Hands may 'noint me over Night,
And dress me in the Morning ever I fight.

Marg. AIR.
If that is all you ask,
My Sweetest,
My Featest,
Compleatest,
And Neatest,
I Am proud of the Task.

Maux. (overhearing.) A forward Lady! she grows fond apace,
But I shall catch her in a proper Place.

Moore. Leave her with me; conclude the Dragon dead:
If I don't maul the Dog, I Will lose my Head.

[All go off but Moore and Margery. DUETTO.
Moore. Let my Dearest be near me;

Marg. I Will ever be near thee.

Moore. To warm me, to cheer me;

Marg. To warm thee, to cheer thee.

Moore. To fire me, inspire me;

Marg. To fire thee, inspire thee

Both. With Kisses and Ale.

Moore. Your Fears I Will abolish;

Marg. This Dragon demolish.

Moore. I Will work him;

Marg. Ay, work him.

Moore. I Will jerk him;

Marg. Ay, jerk him

Both. From Nostril to Tail.
[Let my, etc.

MOORE leads off MARGERY; MAUXALINDA enters, and pulls him back by the Sleeve.
Maux. O Villain! Monster! Devil! Basely base!
How can you dare to look me in the Face?
Did you not swear last Christmas we should marry?
Oh, it is enough to make a Maid miscarry!
Witness this Piece of Sixpence, certain Token
Of my true Heart, and your false Promise broken.

Moore. The Devil's in the Woman! What Is the Matter?

Maux. Now you insult me; Time was, you could flatter.

Moore. Upon my Soul, I don't know what you mean!

Maux. Don't you know Margery of Roth'ram-Green?

Moore. Not I, upon my Honor.

Maux. That Is a Lie.
What do you think I Have neither Ear nor Eye.
Villain! I will believe my Eyes and Ears!
She whom you kissed, and called ten thousand Dears.
(Sings mocking) Let my Dearest be near me, etc.

Moore. (aside.) By Jove! I Am blown. Zounds! how came this about?
However, I Am resolved to stand it out.

To Maux. I only out of Policy was civil;
But, 'faith, I hate her as I hate the Devil.
You're all I value, witness this close Hug,
I Am yours, and only yours.

Maux. Ah Coaxing Pug!

Moore. My pretty Mauxy, prithee don't be jealous.

Maux. Dear me! you Men are such bewitching Fellows;
You steal into our Hearts by sly Degrees,
Then make poor Girls believe just what you please.

Moore. AIR.
By the Beer, as brown as Berry;
By the Cider and the Perry,
Which so often has made us merry,
With a Hy-down, Ho-down-derry,
Mauxalinda's I Will remain,
True Blue will never stain.

Maux. But do you really love me?

Moore. By this Kiss,
By Raptures past, and Hopes of future Bliss.

DUETTO.
Pigs shall not be
So fond as we;
We will out-cooe the Turtle Dove.
Fondly toying,
Still enjoying,
Sporting Sparrows we'll out-love.

End of the First ACT.
ACT II. SCENE I.
A Garden. MARGERY sola. SURE my Stays will burst with sobbing,
And my Heart quite crack with throbbing.
My poor Eyes are red as Ferrets,
And I have not a Grain of Spirits.

[To her Moore. Moore. My Madge! my Honey-suckle, in the Dumps!

Marg. Put your Hand here, and feel my Heart how't thumps.

Moore. Good lack a day! how great a Palpitation!
Tell me, my Dear! the Cause of this Vexation.

Marg. An ugly Dream has put me in a Fright;
I dreamt the Dragon slew my gentle Knight:
If such a thing should happen unto thee,
O miserable, miserable, Margery!

Moore. Don't fright thy self with Dreams, my Girl, never fear him,
I Will work his Buff, if ever I come near him.
I Have such a Suit of spiked Armor bought,
Bears, Lions, Dragons, it will set at naught:
In which, when I Am equipped, my Madge shall see,
I Will scare the Dragon, not the Dragon me.
But Time grows short, I must a while away.

Marg. Make haste, my Dear!

Moore. My Duck! I will not stay.

[Exit. Enter MAUXALINDA to MARGERY. Maux. So Madam! have I found you out at
last?
You now shall pay full dear for all that is past.
Were you as fine as ever wore Silk or Satin,
I Would beat your Harlot's Brains out with my Pattin,
Before you shall delude a Man of mine.

Marg. Who in the Name of Wonder made him thine?

Maux. Do You laugh, you Minx! I Will make you change your Note,
Or drive your grinning Grinders down your Throat.

DUETTO.
Insulting Gipsey,
Your surely tipsy,
Or non se ipse,
To chatter so.
Your too much feeding
All Rules exceeding,
Has spoiled your Breeding,
Go, Trollop, go.
Insulting, etc.

Marg. Lauk, what a monstrous Tail our Cat has got!

Maux. Nay, if you brave me, then you go to pot.
Come, Bodkin, come! take Mauxalinda's Part,
And stab her hated Rival to the Heart.

[Goes to kill Margery, she swoons. Enter MOORE, takes away the Bodkin. Moore.
Why, what the Devil is the Woman doing!

Maux. To put an End to all your Worship's Wooing.

Moore. It Is well I came, before the Whim went further;
Had I stayed longer, here had sure been Murder.
This cursed Jade has thrown the Girl in Fits.
How do, my Dear?

[Margery Recovers. Marg. Frighted out of my Wits.

Moore. But fear her not, for by her own Confession,
I Will bind her over to the Quarter-Session.

Maux. AIR.
O give me not up to the Law,
I Would much rather beg upon Crutches;
Once in a Sollicitor's Paw,
You never get out of his Clutches.

Marg. Come, come, forgive her.

Moore. Here my Anger ends.

Maux. And so does mine.

Moore. Why then let us buss and Friends.

[Kiss round. TRIO.
Maux. Oh how easy is a Woman,
How deluding are you Men!
Oh how rare, to find a true Man,
Not so often as one in ten.

Moore. Oh how charming is a Woman,
Formed to captivate us Men;
Yet so eager to subdue Man,
That for one she covets ten.

Marg. Let Us reward them as they treat us,
Women prove sincere as Men;
But if they deceive and cheat us,
Let us even cheat them again.

Omnes. Let Us reward them as they treat us, etc.

Enter GUBBINS. Gub. Now, now, or never save us, valiant Moore!
The Dragon's coming, don't you hear him roar?

Moore. Why let him roar his Heart out, it is no matter:
Stand clear, my Friends, this is no Time to chatter.

Gub. Here take your Spear.

Moore. -- I scorn Sword, Spear, or Dart;
I Am armed completely in a valiant Heart.
But first I Will drink, to make me strong and mighty,
Six Quarts of Ale, and one of Aqua Vitae.

CHORUS. Fill, fill, fill a mighty Flagon,
Kill, kill, kill this monstrous Dragon.

[Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE I.
A rural Prospect near the Dragon's Den. Enter MOORE in Armor, and MARGERY.
Moore. ONe Buss, dear Margery, and then away.

Marg. I cannot go, my Love!

Moore. You must not stay.
Get up, sweet Wench, get up in yonder Tree,
And there securely you may hear and see.
[Margery gets up into the Tree. Come, Mr. Dragon, or by Jove I Will fetch you;
I Will trim your Rascals Jacket, if I catch you.

Moore. AIR.
Dragon! Dragon! thus I dare thee:
Soon to Atoms thus I Will tear thee;
Thus thy Insolence subdue.
But regarding where my Dear is,
Then, alas! I feel what Fear is,
Sweetest Margery for you.
Dragon! etc.

Dragon roars. Moore. It is not Strength that always wins;
Good Wit does Strength excel.
Confound the Rascal, how he grins, --
I Will creep into this Well.
[Gets into the Well. [Enter Dragon, and goes to the Well, as to drink.
Dragon. What nasty Dog has got into the Well,
Disturbs my Drink, and makes the Water smell.
[Moore within, cries Boh!
Dragon. AIR.
Oho, Mr. Moore,
You Son of a Whore,
I wish I Would known your Tricks before.

[Moore gets out of the Well, and encounters the Dragon. Drag. Oh! oh! oh!
The Devil take your Toe.

[Dies. CHORUS. HVZZA!


To him MARGERY. Marg. Oh, my Conqu'ror! how do you do?

Moore. Oh, my Charmer! how are you?

Marg. Very well, thank you;

Moore. I Am so too.
Your Eyes were livid, and your Cheeks were pale;
But now you look as brisk as bottled Ale.
Give me a Buss.

Marg. Ah, twenty if you please.

Moore. With all my heart, and twenty after these.

DUETT.
My sweet Honey suckle, my Joy and Delight,
I Will kiss thee all Day, and I Will hug thee all Night.
My Dearest is made of such excellent Stuff,
I think I shall never have Kissing enough.

Moore. Now nimbly dance, ye Nymphs and Swains be gay,
The Dragon's dead, and you may safely play.

A DANCE. Gub. Most mighty Moore, what Wonders have thou done,
Destroyed the Dragon, and my Margery won,
The Loves of this brave Knight, and my fair Daughter,
In Roratorios shall be sung hereafter.
Begin your Songs of Joy; begin, begin,
And rend the Welkin with harmonious Din.

CHORUS. Sing, sing, and rorio,
An Oratorio
To gallant Morio,
Of Moore-Hall.
To Margereenia
Of Roth'ram-Greenia,
Beauty's bright Queenia,
Bellow and bawl.

Chorus of HVZZA! repeated. FINIS.
