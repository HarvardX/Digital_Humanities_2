LOVE'S VICTIMS: THE HERMIT's STORY.
PART THE FIRST.
CANTO I.
"LEAVE, Hermit, leave these wilds forlorn;
Cast off this garb of woe;
With earliest gleam of opening morn
Thy guests prepare to go:
With earliest gleam of opening morn,
We'll spread the parting sail,
Far hence over rolling surges born,
Our native land to hail.
For, though in sore distress we came,
To beg relief from thee,
Yet not unknown to goodly fame,
We plough the dangerous sea;
Beneath yon cliff's impending side,
Within a secret bay,
Our vessel proudly stems the tide,
Our streamers lightly play:
Then, Hermit kind, with us return;
For this thy sheltering care,
Thy former dwelling let us learn,
We'll place thee safely there.
"THIS lonely strand I Will never forsake,
Never cast these weeds away;
My thanks for offered service take,
But leave me here to stay!
Here, till in death my limbs are cold,
A sacred vow I Will keep,
Full often, over yonder swelling mould,
To pray, to fast, and weep.
But, though my vow forbid return,
My native land to hail,
Would you my former dwelling learn,
I Will not refuse the tale:
A tale of grief and blushing shame
My lips must then disclose,
Yet so shall memory keep my name,
And pity mourn my woes.
A sire of noble birth I own,
On Rosay's fertile plain:
No care his tranquil life had known,
Unvex'd by grief or pain;
Till Heaven, alas! my sins ordained
To wake his virtuous rage,
And shame, unfelt before, distained
The silvered cheek of age.
With him in social union bound
Earl Hubert long had been;
Their youth the palm of friendship crowned,
And age beheld it green.
"Now straight prepare your horsemen all,"
Said the Earl, "to go with me;
"I have a feast in bower and hall,
"Where you must shortly be."
"Set forth, set forth," my sire replied,
"Set forth without delay;
"However fleetly you shall ride,
"We'll pass you on the way.
With me I Will bring my son along,
"To grace your bower and hall,
"And if he fail in dance or song,
"On me the blame shall fall."
The minstrels played; the hall was bright,
The bower was fair to see;
And there came many a noble knight,
And maid of high degree.
But 'midst those maidens all so fair,
More fair than all was one;
In peerless boast of beauty rare
The gentle Emma shone.
Of humble birth, she early mourned
A parent's shortened date;
But heaven to joy her grief had turned,
And given a kinder fate:
The partner of Earl Hubert's breast
The helpless babe surveyed,
And pity soft in tears confessed,
Bestowed its bounteous aid.
In ripening charms the nursling grew,
And youth its luster shed;
Less fair the rose's blushing hue,
When first its leaves are spread:
Her eyes were as the diamond bright,
But shone with tempered ray,
Like northern meteors, that by night
Over heaven's pale azure play.
Forgive these tears, that still must flow, Ancor men' duol, purch'io mean
rimembri. DANTE, INF.

Whenever the tale is told;
For learn, the beauteous maid lies low,
Beneath yon swelling mould.
CANTO II.
WHEN youth beats high in every vein,
And passion fires the mind,
What can the wandering thought restrain,
The lawless spirit bind?
Too strong by reason to be swayed,
Desire my torment grew,
For fair as Dian was the maid,
But chaste as Dian too.
How shall your virtuous ears endure,
My guilty tongue repeat,
What arts I used, her love to lure,
And watchful honor cheat!
Too well I strove; the maiden loved;
Her devious steps I led;
To duty lost, we secret roved,
And banished virtue fled.
Ill-omen'd deed! the hope how vain,
Each social tie foregone,
That constancy should yet remain,
And faith, intent on one!
Who first pollutes the tender mind,
And leads from truth astray,
Never let him hope again to find
The gem he casts away.
The fatal change, thus subtly wrought,
I justly learnt to rue;
Pleased with the freedom I had taught,
To other loves she flew:
Five lonely months my anxious fears
Her flight in vain explored;
And often my fondly-falling tears
Her fancied death deplored.
Oh, Vanity, that Man beguiles,
Who boasts the stronger mind!
In Woman's charms and native wiles,
Defeat still doomed to find!
If happily here some listening guest
Have known like pains to prove,
Let his consenting heart attest
How stoops our sex to Love.
Before my gate, in winter's cold,
A trembling mourner stood;
A tale of piteous want she told,
And, plaintive, begged for food:
Beneath that garb of friendless woe
My Emma stood confessed;
I clasped, ere words had power to flow,
The wanderer to my breast:
I strove to chide, but faintly blamed;
Then met her ardent kiss;
Desire again my soul inflamed,
And hope renewed my bliss.
Fond, pleasing dream! too quickly over!
The false one fled again:
Amazed I grieved, but vowed no more
To prize a heart so vain.
Our angry vows Love turns to jest;
While yet her loss I mourned,
Again repentance touched her breast,
Again the fair returned:
And, while I viewed those fatal charms,
Upon my neck she hung;
To earth I shook her from my arms,
Around my knees she clung.
"Forgive the wretch," she suppliant cried,
"The wretch thy flatt'ries made! Verbis capta Puella tuis. Ov.Ep.

"By Pleasure's voice, Ah, faithless guide!
"Too easily betrayed!"
"With thee, who taught'st me first to sin, Mentis prima ruina meae. Ov.Ep.

"Let me my sins atone!
"This let repentant anguish win,
"To live with thee alone!"
Thus over a bosom fondly soft
She triumphed unrestrained;
Often from my arms she fled, and often
Those sheltering arms regained.
So flitting on the summer's breeze,
Delighted far to roam,
The swallow, born over smiling seas,
Awhile forgets her home:
But scared at sight of wintry gloom,
When chilling blasts arise,
With trembling wing and ruffled plume,
Returns to friendlier skies.
At length the destined hour was near,
That rose to fix our fate;
For still on folly's wild career
Chastising sorrows wait.
Once when, by lengthened absence tried,
Love poured the weary tear,
And hope her wonted aid denied
My fruitless search to cheer,
It chanced, at morn I bent my way
From Harfleur's lonely towers,
To where its tides in Havre's bay
The western ocean pours.
There as I wandered, lost in thought,
Faint notes of female cry (...)Hom. Od.

My ear with frequent wonder caught,
And drew my curious eye.
Far off, advancing where I stood,
A convict group I spied;
Behind, the fiends of power pursued,
Each lingering step to chide:
By force compelled, the guilty band
Reluctant sought the shore,
Whence doomed to leave a forfeit land,
And to return no more.
Pitying, I marked their hopeless lot,
And heard their clanking chains;
Their errors in their griefs forgot,
Their vices in their pains;
Nor thought, while flowed the ready tear
For sorrows not my own,
My doom to share those griefs how near,
And mingle groan with groan!
As when dire phantoms of the night
Sleep's soft infoldment break,
Up leaps the wretch in wild affright,
And doubts if yet he wake;
So roused, at once, with startling dread,
Amid the guilty train
I saw my Emma captive led,
And partner of their pain.
The distant sight perhaps deceived,
With eager step I flew --
Too soon I came -- nor yet believed
The horrid vision true. Nec tantum scelus esse putabam. Ov. Ep.

To heaven her eyes intent were cast,
And poured a crystal flood;
The flinty pavement, as she passed,
Was marked with streaks of blood.
I stood distracted and appalled;
Then faintly breathed her name;
Each wandering sense my voice recalled,
And shook her feeble frame:
Her feeble frame no more sustains;
Her eyes flash wildly round;
She shrieks -- and, sinking on her chains,
Falls senseless to the ground.
CANTO III.
NEED I relate what cares I used,
'Till sluggard life returned,
Or number all my prayers refused,
Or tell her ransom spurned?
Whether by daring guilt betrayed,
Or fate severe oppressed,
I shunned to ask, of truth afraid --
Her anguish filled my breast;
Doomed to her cheerful native land
To bid a long adieu,
And on a rude unpitying strand
Declining life pursue:
"Unhappy fair, whose fatal power.
"Enslaves my constant thought,
"Behold in this disastrous hour
"The ruin thou have wrought!
"These tears, this anguish is thine own,
"That rends thy Albert's breast;
"But tears with thee are pleasing grown,
"And anguish lulls to rest.
"Together on the appointed plain
"We'll count the painful years,
"Together drag the galling chain,
"And mingle bitter tears."
"Forbear, forbear!" the suff'rer cried,
And raised her languid head,
"Thy hate, thy vengeance I Will abide --
"Thy constancy I dread.
"Let mercy grieved at length forsake
"A wretch to sorrow born;
"Leave that obdurate heart to break,
"Which could deserve thy scorn!"
The tender prayer I heard unmoved,
Or heard with softened heart;
From her, whom still alone I loved,
Resolved no more to part.
The swelling sails forbad delay;
We left our native shore;
Over the blue waves the streamers play,
And land is seen no more.
Ah! shade beloved! what wondrous grief
Did then thy bosom know,
While the fraught heart denied relief,
And tears forbore to flow!
Pale, drooping over the billow's foam,
I see thy form recline;
Thine eyes over ocean wildly roam,
Or deeply fix in mine!
That speechless woe can language paint,
Or tell the thrilling look,
When sighs at length, and accents faint
The fearful silence broke?
"For thee -- for thee -- much injured youth,
"'Midst all my sins abhorred
"(So witness for me, heavenly truth!)
"My bosom's only Lord,
"For thee alone, these pangs, these sights --
"My chains no longer wound -- "
She said, when sobs convulsive rise,
And choke the imperfect sound.
"Well pleased in death these eyes should close,
"So thou might feel," I cried,
"No greater pain than Albert knows,
"With Emma by his side.
"Secure we brave the changing sky,
"By hope forbid to weep;
"Love bears his lighted torch on high,
"And guides us over the deep:
"And see the destined land appear!
That land our faith shall prove;
"Alike shall either hemisphere
"Propitious smile on love."
PART THE SECOND.
CANTO I.
PAST was each gay, each joyous hour;
No more we festive played
In Pleasure's brightly-sparkling bower,
Or Wealth's luxurious shade!
But who on Truth's unerring beam
Shall earthyy blessings weigh,
Will learn how often the world's esteem
On wealth is thrown away.
The source of human bliss, or woe,
Where shall enquiry find?
Alas! the wretched only know --
It Is lodged within the mind.
'Midst toils severe, and labor rude,
Far from our native shore,
In long and hopeless servitude
The pains of life we bore.
Yet Emma here, by sorrow taught,
Preserved love's constant flame;
And Emma's love was all I sought,
"It Was ease, 'twas wealth, 'twas fame!
Happily one Master's stern command
Our equal lot received;
And fond to aid, my stronger hand
Her fainting toil relieved.
Custom unchanged contentment gave;
We viewed our dangers past;
And, 'scap'd from Fortune's troubled wave,
Here found repose at last.
Our chasten'd thoughts the wish inspire
Religion's bonds to prove,
And turn the wand'rings of desire
To pure, connubial love.
What though no white-rob'd priest was near,
Our hands no altar joined,
Yet angels stooped our vows to hear,
And Heaven the record signed.
Fain would I pause, and over the rest
Of my distressful tale,
Could memory die within my breast,
For ever cast a veil:
But conscious duty prompts me here
My sorrows to renew;
My trembling lips, with words of fear,
Their painful task pursue.
To him, whose power our toils confessed,
On Gallia's fairer shore
One only son, in hour unblest,
A long-lost consort bore.
The father watched the pleasing care
Through childhood's tender stage,
Of all his treasured wealth the heir,
And comfort of his age.
Now bold in manhood, fierce and strong,
In wealth and power elate,
Proudly he viewed the subject throng,
And held tyrannic state.
By love subdued, his ardent eye
He fixed on Emma's charms,
And doomed, in heedless luxury,
The victim to his arms.
His subtle arts assailed her truth;
Those arts my Emma spurned;
Stung by her scorn, the haughty youth
In wild resentment burned.
The guilt his lawless soul desired,
Insulting force essayed:
I saw, with rage indignant fired,
And rushed to Emma's aid.
Perish, presumptuous slave! he cried,
And aimed a deadly wound;
My bosom owned its injured pride --
I felled him to the ground.
The hunter meets no swifter blow,
Who venurous points the chase,
Where lurks the tiger lowering low,
And guards his infant race.
Awhile the spirit's quivering flame
Upon life's confines played;
The fled, and veiled the wretch's shame
In death's eternal shade.
Horrid the deed! but greater dread
Our future hours display;
Stern vengeance, hovering over my head,
Must mark its helpless prey.
Alternate ill alone remained;
To stay -- 'twas death; to fly --
From every good that life contained!
'Twas with more pain to die.
What voice my lingering doubts reproved,
And bade for flight prepare?
"Thy Emma, ah! too dearly loved,
"Thy dangerous flight shall share:
"With thee I Will range the desert wide,
"While life shall strength supply;
"Content to suffer at thy side,
"Blessed in thy arms to die."
"Cease, Emma, cease! too fondly true!
"Thou tempt'st a certain doom;
Despair must still our flight pursue,
"And Horror's endless gloom.
"Where should, alas! our footsteps stray?
"We wander hence in vain;
"Famine, or ruthless beasts of prey
"Await us on the plain."
The ardor of that dauntless breast
Nor words, nor prayers allay;
With eager look, my hand she pressed,
And daring, led the way.
CANTO II.
OVER wilds, unmarked by human tread, -- do nunca pie humano Estampo su pisada.
GARCILASO.

We took our venurous flight;
Yet was not Hope's last ember dead,
Though pal'd its fainting light.
If aught, amid those desert plains,
By Nature's hand bestowed,
Might temper thirst's unceasing pains,
Or yield sustaining food,
Perchance the safe and friendly coast,
Our toiling steps might gain,
Where Britain's sons, with envied boast,
In British freedom reign.
Far swelled the gale with murmuring sound,
And filled our hearts with dread;
We cast a fearful look around,
And, trembling, swifter fled.
Now over the earth the closing night
Her sable veil had thrown;
Nor yet had our disastrous flight
Or rest or solace known.
Sudden, my Emma's bursting tears
In copious torrents fell;
"Sweet Love!" I cried," these gloomy fears
"Let brighter hope dispel!"
"No fears," her falt'ring voice replied,
"My constant soul invade;
"Wherever we wander, by thy side
"I wander undismayed.
"Yet, 'midst the shades of night secure,
"Escaped from every eye,
"(No more these feeble limbs endure --)
"Ah! cease awhile to fly!"
Fainting she spoke; with eager haste
My hands her couch prepare:
But what, amid that dreary waste,
Availed a lover's care!
Yet on the ground my garments laid,
Her tender form enclose;
"And mine the welcome task," I said,
"To watch over thy repose!
"Parent of mercy, from thy hand
"The streams of comfort pour!
"Let balmy sleep, at thy command,
"Her wasted strength restore!"
Great God, who hear'st the suppliant's cry,
And calm'st the wretch's pain,
Why, in that hour of agony,
Were breathed my prayers in vain!
CANTO III.
SOFT as the sleep, which, tired at eve,
The harmless infant knows,
So soft, ah, soft but to deceive!
Appeared my love's repose.
With silent joy each breath I heard,
That gently heaved her breast,
And many a prayer anew preferred,
To bless the wholesome rest:
Hope charmed awhile my troubled thought,
When, starting from the ground,
My neck the trembling Emma caught,
And wildly clasped me round;
"Hold! hold! they drag him hence away!
"But we'll together die!
"Ah, say, my only safety, say,
"My Albert, art thou nigh?"
"Behold thy Albert ever near!
"Whence spring thy fears anew?
"No dangerous rival threatens here,
"No vengeful foes pursue.
"To balmy slumber yield again
"Thy limbs, that fev'rous burn;
"Tomorrow's dawn shall banish pain,
"And peace with light return."
Now, with tumultuous haste, the blood
Cours'd ardent through her veins,
And scarce the fiercely-frantic mood.
Her Albert's voice restrains.
"Oh, scorching fires, that inward rage,
"And ravage life's retreat!
"Oh, parching thirst, thy force assuage!
"Allay thy deadly heat!
"Farewell, my Albert! yet in death
"Let not remembrance die!
"Thine is this last, this fleeting breath,
"And thine this parting sigh!"
With accents, such as Love inspires,
I strove to calm her woe;
"If aught to cool those raging fires
"Within the desert flow,
"My search the precious draught shall find,
"And bring thee quick relief;
"Suspend this anguish of the mind,
"Endure awhile thy grief!"
Then forth my doubtful course I took,
Attentive bent to hear,
If, 'mid the gloom, or murmuring brook
Or bubbling spring were near.
While swift I trod, the yielding soil
My passing feet bedewed;
O'erjoy'd, I blessed the prosperous toil,
That every hope renewed:
Eager I stooped, with anxious care,
Each scanty drop to drain;
Then flew, the gathered prize to bear,
And sooth my Emma's pain.
Perplexed, I trace with fearful choice
The scarce-remember'd ground;
Aloud I call -- my Emma's voice
Returns a grateful sound.
As joys the mother over her child,
If found, where chance he strays,
While yet her bosom heaving wild
The past alarm betrays;
So gladden'd, I that sound pursue;
Again I call more nigh --
Her languid accents scarce renew
The feebly formed reply!
With panting speed more swift I fly,
And trembling over her bend;
"My Emma, taste! thou shall not die;
"Heaven deigns this aid to send."
Her lifted arms my bosom pressed,
And folding, strove to close;
But sunk unconscious from my breast,
And death's chill damps arose.
"Emma!" I cried, "most loved! most dear!
"Thou all that I adore!" --
No sound responsive met my ear --
The conflict was no more!
CANTO IV.
SILENT, in horror and dismay,
Through the drear hours of night,
I watched afar the doubtful ray
Of slow-returning light.
With pangs more keen my soul to fill,
Arose that cheerless ray;
Appalled I viewed the mighty ill,
And cursed the coming day.
What more ensued -- how robbed of sense,
How prostrate on the plain,
Or how awaked -- remembrance thence
Attempts to trace in vain.
High Heaven, to mercy still inclined,
Beheld my abject plight,
And deigned upon my darkened mind
To shed redeeming light.
As breathe the plains, and smile anew
Amid serener day,
Where late the furious whirlwind flew,
And scattered wild dismay;
Such calm my soul perceived, when first
Renewed by Faith's pure beam,
While every passion fled, dispersed
Before the bright'ning gleam.
At once each impious thought repressed,
That madden'd in despair,
Devotion taught my altered breast
The will supreme to bear.
With firm resolve, but fainting strength,
The lifeless corse I bore,
Nor void of hope to reach at length
The distant, friendly shore.
Not long my toil; this close retreat,
With grateful wonder viewed,
(For holy purpose refuge meet)
Heaven's pitying guidance showed.
'Mid'st parching plains of barren sand,
Severely spread around,
This vale by Nature's bounteous hand
With springs and woods is crowned.
Beneath yon plane-tree's branchy shade
The lightest turf I chose,
And there her grave, with anguish made,
My hands were doomed to close:
There, while my tears fast-trickling fell,
To Heaven I raised my prayer,
And slowly bade a last farewell
To all my earthly care!
Now daily, over that precious mound,
HIS goodness I implore,
Who knows my suff'ring's latest bound,
And will my peace restore!
Mine was the guilt, by passion led,
The virtuous heart to stain,
For which Heaven loads this weary head
With years of lingering pain:
But may my penitence atone
For innocence betrayed;
Just vengeance punish me alone,
And spare her injured shade!
Nine times the sun's revolving ray,
Amid these wilds, I Have viewed
Illume with vainly-lavish'd day
The dreary solitude:
Meanwhile of man the cheerful face,
Or voice, 'till you appeared,
My longing eye has ceased to trace,
Mine ear has never heard!
And, 'till in death these limbs are cold,
My sacred vow I Will keep,
Full often, over yonder swelling mould,
To pray, to fast, and weep.
