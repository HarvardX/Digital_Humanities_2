TO His SERENE HIGHNESS the PRINCE of ORANGE, This POEM is humbly Inscribed, by
His

Most Dutiful Servant, S. DUCK.

ON THE MARRIAGE Of His SERENE HIGHNESS the PRINCE of ORANGE.
ILLustrious Prince, forgive the feeble Lay,
That now aspires to hail your Nuptial-day;
Nor (...) a Muse, the meanest of the Nine,
Who brings her humble Offering to your Shrine.
And You Imperial Nymph, whose lovely Face
Invites the Hero to your chaste Embrace,
Vouchsafe a Spark of your Celestial Fire,
Harmonious Words, and pleasing Thoughts inspire,
Soft as your Love, and tuneful as your Lyre;
So shall my Numbers charm the listening Ear,
And even the glad NASSAU delighted hear.
NASSAU has long enriched the Book of Fame.
And ANNA now adorns the Noble Name.
Nations who saw the Light of ORANGE rise,
With awful Splendour, in the Belgian Skies;
Shall soon behold it with new Luster shine,
Joined to a glorious Star of BRUNSWICK's Line.
So where the flowing Sambre gently glides,
The Swain delights to view the beauteous Tides;
But when his more-extended Eye surveys
The shining Torrent join the spacious Maese,
Both Rivers thus, with friendly Union flow,
And to the Sight superior Beauty show.
Whenever the Gods a noble Race intend,
They suit the Causes to their destined End:
Nor yoke unequal Hearts in Nuptial Love,
Jove's valiant Bird disdains the fearful Dove.
Great Minds by native Sympathy combine,
As golden Particles the closest join;
Paternal Virtues in their Bosom roll,
Allied in Love by Nobleness of Soul;
Hence, Thrones and Scepters shine neglected Things,
Hence Royal ANN prefers NASSAU to Kings;
While Britons with united Hearts rejoice,
And willing Senators applaud the Choice,
To see their King (to Honor ever true)
Discharge the Debt to sacred WILLIAM due.
Immortal WILLIAM! by whose prudent Cares,
We yet enjoy the Fruits of all our Wars;
Our Laws, Religion, Liberty, and Peace,
And even the Blessings of the BRUNSWICK Race.
Nor Thou, Illustrious ORANGE, blush to own
Thy Honor, thus allied to Albion's Crown;
Blessed with a Princess, in whose Form we trace
Her Fathers Majesty, and Mother's Grace:
Bright Orbs of Power, that with propitious Ray,
Dispel our Clouds, and beautify our Day.
Not as the Comet, raging through the Air,
Infects the World with Pestilence and War:
But like the Sun, their Beams of Goodness glow,
Inspiring Life, and chearing All below.
Such are the glorious SIRE, and gracious DAME,
From whence the beauteous Bride of ORANGE came.
And shall unerring Nature change her Kind?
What Lion ever produced a timorous Hind?
The Royal Eagles, Royal Eagles breed,
And Heroes from Heroic Sires proceed;
Rome's Founder thus, confessed his Race Divine;
Thus NASSAU copies the NASSOVIAN Line;
Thus, ANNA's noble Stream of Virtue flows,
High as the Regal Spring from whence it rose.
Thrice happy Nymph, with every grace supplied,
Thrice happy Prince, with such a heavenly Bride;
In whom superior Sense, with Judgment joins,
Her Beauty much, but more her Merit shines.
How glorious! when such Worth adorns the Great,
We hear, we see, admire and imitate,
Virtue in Them, attracts remotest Eyes,
But in the Vulgar Soul unheeded lies.
As radiant Phoebus darts superior Light,
While smaller Planets shun the watchful Sight.
Accomplished thus, let her Example fire
The drooping Muse, and wake the sounding Lyre;
To aid Religion be her chiefest Care,
(Heaven justly claims the Soul it made so fair)
To stem the Torrent of licentious Rage,
And prop the Virtues of a sinking Age;
Exalting Science to her ancient Height,
To raise declining Arts, and make the rude Polite.
While Great NASSAU, whom native Glory warms,
Whenever his Country calls him forth to Arms,
May fire the Belgians in the Field of Mars,
Consult their Peace, or animate their Wars;
Paint his Forefathers to their wondering Eye,
And teach 'em how to conquer, or to die;
Like him, who bravely dared to break their Chain,
Though held by all the Force and Fraud' of Spain;
For injured Liberty the Sword he draws,
Resolved to gain, or perish in the Cause;
And having long the doubtful Combat tried,
Like Caesar vanquished, and like Caesar King William's Great Grandfather, the
first Great Assertor of the Belgian Liberties, Assassinated at Delph.
died.
Though different far the Motives of their Mind,
That, fought to Conquer, This to Save Mankind;
Till praised, lamented, envied, and admired,
The Hero, Patriot, and the Prince expired.
Oh! where did then the guardian Angels hide?
Nor watched to turn the guilty Ball aside;
When he, whom armed Hosts could not withstand,
Now falls a Victim to one Villain's hand!
But rise ye Muses, quit the pensive Lay,
Nor damp the Joys of this auspicious Day,
Since yet the glorious Name of ORANGE stands,
Since Royal ANNA seals the Nuptial-bands,
Soon may Imperial ADOLPHS rise again,
Again new FREDERICKS thunder on the Main,
Rousing the Martial Youth to War's alarms,
(If proud Ierians shine again in Arms)
To guard their Country from tyrannic Power,
And be what glorious WILLIAM was before.
Nor shall the ^states invading Forces fear,
'Ere pregnant Time the promised Heroes bear;
Nor want Allies their Freedom to defend,
Since BRUNSWICK reigns, and ALBION is their Friend.
As branching Oaks protect the rural Swain,
Secure from Summer-heat, and Winter-rain;
So shall our Monarch, with Paternal Aid,
His Regal Shelter over Batavia spread,
Long as the Scepter fills his Royal Hand,
A true Palladium shall Insure the Land.
And if the praescient Muses guide my Lay,
Or, future Secrets, Phoebus can display,
The Day shall shine distinguished from the rest,
That ANNA dignified, and Hymen blessed;
In which AUGUSTUS fortifies his Throne,
And plans a Scheme of Union for his Son;
Bespeaks Allies for Princes yet to come,
New Friends to Britain, and new Foes to Rome.
Proceed Great MONARCH, new Allies to gain,
And with new Nuptial-leagues our Peace maintain;
So shall thy beauteous Nymphs secure with Charms
That safety, other Kings defend with Arms;
They, Venus like, could Mars himself surprise,
And awe stern Tyrants with their conquering Eyes.
VERSES to the Author, In Imitation of HORACE's ODE on PINDAR.
By a DIVINE.
Applied to the Marriage of his Highness the Prince of Orange with ANN Princess
Royal of Great Britain.
WHO hopes to rival MILTON's Flame,
With waxen Pinions fondly flies;
His Fall will give the Sea a Name,
While he attempts to reach the Skies.
MILTON is like a Flood, whose Tide,
Swelled with tempestous Deluge, roars,
Which from some lofty Mountain's Side
Resistless foams, and knows no Shores.
With sacred Laurels justly crowned,
Whether in bold unfettered Strains
His towering Muse the common Bound,
Superior to all Rhyme, disdains.
Whether the Realms of endless Day
He fill with Wars and rude Alarms,
Or set in terrible Array
Seraphic Legions clad in Arms.
Aloft with all their Forests thrown
See Hills, from their Foundations razed!
See Angels hurled with Vengeance down,
When the MESSIAH's Standard blazed!
Or leads he to conubial Bowers
The new-form'd Pair? The teeming Ground
Smiles with a Wilderness of Flowers
Diffusing Gales of Fragrance round.
Lo! ADAM with Majestic Mein
For Empire and Command designed!
Consumate Beauty crowns his Queen,
With Dignity and Sweetness joined.
While he the charming Scene displays,
Where Innocence and Pleasure reigned,
Delighted with his sacred Lays,
We hear it lost, and feel it gained.
His Lays, inimitably fine,
With Ecstasy each Passion move,
When loud they trumpet War divine,
Or softly warble human Love.
O STEPHEN, this Britannic Swan
Surmounts the Clouds with noble Flight,
While I at distance only can
Admire him lessening to the Sight.
As the poor Be, with endless Toil,
To suck the Thyme and blooming Rose,
Skims over RICHMOND's fragrant Soil,
Thus I with pleasing Pain compose.
You with a happy Genius blessed,
In bolder Strains shall NASSAU sing,
When ANNA by the Graces dressed,
He to the Nuptial Dome shall bring.
ANNA enriched with various Charms
By the indulgent Care of Heaven,
Than whom into his longing Arms
No greater Treasure can be given.
Not, though with Riches of the East
At his Command the Ganges flow,
Though with full Empire he possessed
Whatever Ambition wished below.
Ye Nereids, with propitious Gales,
The gilded Vessel kindly aid,
Let CUPIDS fan the swelling Sails,
And waft him to the Royal Maid.
This was written in October last, when the Prince was expected.
When Thames, with floating Forests crowned,
LEANDER safe arrived proclaims,
And of tumultuous Joy the Sound
Shall bid AUGUSTA rise in Flames.
Loud Thunder bursting from her Towers,
Shall signalize the sacred Day;
And transport to the Belgic Shores,
For Blessings which they lent, convey.
Around while Hymenaeals ring,
My Voice to highest Pitch I Will raise,
Thrice happy, if I can but sing
An humble Ode to NASSAU's Praise.
You, soaring in Heroic Verse,
By native Strength of Wing upborn,
His Godlike Virtues shall rehearse,
And Beauties, which the Bride adorn.
He in your Lays shall finished rise,
For Council, or the embattled Field:
Immortals the contested Prize
To her superior Charms shall yield.
Then ravished with prophetic Views
Succeeding Glories shall presage;
And from the Genial Bed the Muse,
Raise Princes to improve the Age:
Who, bravely prodigal of Blood,
Shall prove, that to set free Mankind,
And conquer for the Public Good,
The Race of NASSAU was designed.
Thus Great ALCIDES (Poets feign)
By Labors gained the Seats above;
Countries preserved, and Monsters slain,
Assert the Genuine Son of Jove.
The Answer.
WHEN I, in feeble Verse, essayed
NASSAU and ANNA's Praise,
A Lyrick Muse flew over my Head,
And dropped a Branch of Bays.
I would have fixed it on my Brow,
But PHOEBUS said, forbear;
It Is Vanity to touch the Bough,
And Sacrilege to wear.
Give it the Bard, who boldly dares
Attempt the Roman Lyre,
Who wisely checks, but not impairs
The towering PINDAR's Fire.
Thus, Sir, to you, in PHOEBUS' Name,
The Laurel Wreath I send;
And since the God denies me Fame,
Am glad it crowns my Friend.
FINIS.
