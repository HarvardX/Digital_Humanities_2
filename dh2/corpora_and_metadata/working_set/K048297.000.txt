SCENE in the West of Ireland. Time -- A Night and Morning.

THE PRISONER AT LARGE: A COMEDY.
ACT I.
SCENE I. A Garden to Lord ESMOND 's House, a Gate in the Back leading to the
Road. Enter FRILL and MUNS, quarrelling; MARY interposing. Muns. CONCEITED fop!


Frill. Impertinent savage!


Mary. Gentlemen --


Frill. 'Pon my honor I shall pink you.


Muns. And by my fist I Will thump you.


Mary. But, my dear rival lovers, my town fop, and my country beau; silly to
quarrel about me; for when one gets thump'd, and the other pink'd as you call it,
probably I may have neither of you.


Frill. Didn't you confess, my little Spanish guitar tickled your heart?


(Showing it.) Muns. And, my sweet, didn't you own that my great French horn
roused your soul?


(Showing his horn hung.) Mary. Yes; but 'pon my reputation, gents, I have not
yet determined whether I ever was roused or tickled.


RACHEL (calls without.) Mary!


Mary. My mistress! Coming, madam.


COUNT (calls without.) Frill!


Frill. My master! Yes, Sir.


Old DOWDLE, without. You Muns! Why Muns!


Muns. My Master! zounds! Sir -- I Am here -- I Am there. -- Mary, don't stay
with that fellow. -- Coming, Sir.


(All run confused.) Frill. I cannot bear to leave 'em together. -- Coming, Sir.


Enter RACHEL. Rachel. Mary, see where is Miss Adelaide.


Mary. Yes, Ma'am.


(Runs off.) Enter Count FRIPON. Count Frip. My riding hat and switch cane.


Exit Frill. Enter Old DOWDLE. Dowd. Here, Muns! you loitering cursed vagabond
-- what are you at? Call, call, call! -- Desire Yemon to get the horses ready.
(Exit Muns.) Ay, Count, since my master, the lord of this house, has been so
unlucky as to lose his estate, and you and your friends in Paris have been
lucky enough to win it, now I am your steward; and as they sent you over here
to Ireland, to collect the rents, to pay his Lordship's bonds to them, I Will go
now about and make the tenants pay them into your hands, on condition you marry
my daughter Rachel here.


Count Frip. I will.


Rachel. You will not. (aside.)


Count Frip. But all de clown of tenant, when I did go to gather in de
l'argent, did throw de mud and stone at my head, spoil my curl, knock of my
hair out of my buckle; ma foi, call me Jack Frog. Now, Mademoiselle, am I like
dat Jacky de Frog?


Rachel. Ha, ha, ha!


Dowd. Fools! They never saw their landlord, Lord Esmond, since he was a boy.
No, he spent his time and money flying over Italy and Germany, like a wild
goose, till he is got himself now cooped up in a prison at Paris! Ha, ha, ha!
Come, Count, I hope to bring all the tenants to reason -- but that sneering
rascal Jack Connor -- Daughter, I insist you will never speak to him.


Rachel. Not I, Sir -- till you go out. (aside.)


Dowd. Here, you Muns! (calling.)


Count Frip. Frill.


Enter FRILL, who whispers the Count. Frill. A servant without from one Mr.
Nugent, from Paris.


Count Frip. Nugent! One of our club -- I come. Monsieur, excuse moi pour un
moment.


Exit with Frill. Enter MUNS. Muns. Sir, the horses are ready.


Dowd. Rachel, as it is late, we sha'n't be home to night -- the Count and I Will
take a bed where we can -- some of the tenants --


Rachel. This is charming! (aside.) Dear papa, sure you will not sleep out all
night!


Dowd. Business. -- You Muns. (apart.)


Muns. Sir.


Dowd. You Will let me know if Jack Connor meets my daughter, whilst I am away.
There Is a retaining fee, you dog.


Muns. (looking at it.) I will, Sir. (apart.)


Rachel. (apart.) Muns, run and tell Jack Connor to come here to me as soon as
my father's out of sight. There Is something to drink our health by the way.
(Gives him money.)


Muns. (looking at it.) I will, Miss.


Dowd. Now you will be on the watch; I may depend on you. Apar


Muns. You may, Sir. (apart.)


Rachel. You will not fail?


Muns. I will not.


Dowd. Mind, don't stir out. (To Muns apart, and exit.)


Muns. (looking at the money.) Not a leg.


Rachel. You Will run now to Jack Connor?


(Apart to Muns.) Muns. (looks at her money.) Every foot.


Exit. Rachel. My dear Jack Connor, I love him more than ever for his fidelity
to my Lord; and surely the man of honor and integrity can never prove a
faithless lover. ( Enter Adelaide.) Ah, you sly one! you come down here to the
country on a visit to me, yet prefer birds and groves to all we can invent to
amuse you. -- Now is n't it love?


Adelaide. My dear Rachel, I Would make you my confidante, but you're such a giddy
creature.


Rachel. I! Me? Ha, ha, ha! What would I give that you had a lover!


Adelaide. I had.


Rachel. O precious! Who is he?


Adelaide. Let these tears tell you my lover is no more.


Rachel. Dear me!


Adelaide. It Is now ten years since I saw my Nugent at Montpellier.


Rachel. Ten years! You constant soul!


Adelaide. I was scarce fifteen: his fortune was doubtful; my father forbid our
intercourse -- my Nugent was seized by ruffians (I could never find the cause),
and carried up to Paris; but have since been assured, by my father, of his
death.


Rachel. Lord! had I known, I should not have revived a painful idea. -- Come,
I must keep up your spirits. My father will not be home all night, and I Have sent
for my dear Jack Connor, to sup with us. Come, now, I wish I dare be angry with
my father, for joining this sharping Count against his own master, Lord Esmond:
no wonder, for his mother, the old lady, not to rest in her grave. Adelaide, as
sure as I live, I heard the ghost sing last night in the Belvedere room -- the
sweetest voice!


Adelaide. Very strange! I Have now sat up purposely three nights, but I Have
neither seen nor heard this wonder.


Rachel. Oh, but my dear, the poor dead lady is certainly disturbed by the
misfortunes of her son, Lord Esmond: -- it must be she, for the apparition is
dressed exactly like her picture that hangs in the room where it walks.


Adelaide. All fancy. -- Ah! if the dead were suffered to revisit us, I should
be comforted by my Nugent.


Rachel. Come, we must have no more thoughts of dead lovers: -- you shall hear
my living lover rattle, court, and sing at our little party; we'll be so jolly.
-- Come along.


Exeunt. SCENE, a fine Country. Sun going down. Lord ESMOND 's House at a
Distance; at the Side JACK CONNOR 's House. Enter Lord ESMOND (plainly
dressed), TRAP and SERVANT. Lord Esm. Then the Count will meet me?


Serve. Yes, my Lord.


Lord Esm. You called me Nugent?


Serve. I did, my Lord.


Lord Esm. Very well; take the horses back to the inn. Well, Trap, I Have been
your prisoner ten years, and your suffering me to come here from Paris is a
stretch of good nature. -- Yonder Is my house: here am I in the center of my own
estate, and, thanks to fortune, not master of one foot of land.


Trap. Night's coming on, and not a roof here will shelter us. In view of your
house I cannot get a mug of beer. (Music and laughing without.) Country people
leaving off work: I Will see if I cannot get a drop amongst 'em. -- But, my Lord,
don't run away, for if I hav'n't you to bring back with me to jail, I shall get
hanged. -- Hollo! neighbors.


Exit. Lord Esm. Somewhere here stood (looking) the cottage of poor old Connor
-- a good house; he thrives; I Am glad on it. His son Jack was my little
play-fellow,


(Laughing and music without.) Enter JACK CONNOR. Jack Connor. Ah, merry be
your hearts. -- Goodnight, neighbors. -- All going to their comfortable
homes; whilst I -- this bachelor's life is plaguey stupid -- I will marry my
little Rachel.


(Going to his own house.) Lord Esm. Hollo! Friend, do you know where I can get a
bed?


Jack Connor. I Have two or three spare beds in my house here.


Lord Esm. One will do for me.


Jack Connor. Then one you shall have, on one condition though -- that you drink
one jug of ale with me after supper.


Lord Esm. Supper, and a jug of ale! Your terms are rather severe to a hungry,
thirsty, weary, traveller.


Jack Connor. Thirsty! Oh! (aside.) Phelim.


(Calls at his door.) Enter PHELIM, to whom Jack Connor whispers. Jack Connor.
You shall have a traveller's welcome to the house of Jack Connor.

(To Lord Esmond.) Exit Phelim.
Lord Esm. It Is he! the companion of my youth.


(Re-enter Phelim with a jug of ale and drinking horn.) Jack Connor. I Will fill
for you, Sir -- Come --


Lord Esm. The good-natured boy ripened into the benevolent man.


(aside.) Jack Connor. My first toast, always a bumper: Here Is freedom to my
landlord, Lord Esmond.


Lord Esm. Pray where is my Lord now?


Jack Connor. In prison, near ten years; and I fear for life.


(Wipes his eyes.) Lord Esm. What Is the matter?


Jack Connor. I beg your pardon, Sir; but when I toast my friend in distress, I
mix my drink with water.


Lord Esm. Affectionate fellow! (aside.) But I Have heard say, my Lord is rather
a dissipated worthless sort of character.


Jack Connor. What Is that? (fiercely.) You're welcome to what my house affords;
but sup by yourself, for I Will never sit at one board with him who could slander
the man I esteem and honor.


Enter MUNS, and whispers Jack Connor. Jack Connor. Her father out? and sent
for me? My kind Rachel! If I'had but Father Frank, now -- he might -- Muns, how
go on the Count's affairs?


(apart.) Muns. A mystery there. -- But (takes a horn of ale) I Will get to the
bottom on it. (drinks.) Now I Am prim'd for love or war: if Frill dare but look
crooked, or Mary but frown -- oh! how I Will bang him, and touzle her.


Exit. Lord Esm. As I find all here have lost every remembrance of my person,
I Will venture up to the castle, and see the Count, in my character of Nugent.


(aside.) Jack Connor. Phelim, let this gentleman want for nothing till I come
home. Your hand, Sir; I was angry, but you're a stranger; perhaps in necessity
-- and my doors shall never be shut against the weary traveller.


Exit. Lord Esm. You are an honest fellow, that I Will be sworn for.


Exit. SCENE, an Apartment in Lord ESMOND 's House. Enter FRILL. Frill. I
suspect here is something going forward against my master. -- Here comes Muns
and Mary. -- See -- kiss -- oh the traitress!


(retires) Enter MUNS and MARY. Muns. True. Ha, ha, ha! But, Mary my dear, how
could you listen to such a cur as Frill?


Frill. (aside) I Am a cur! Oh you puppy.


Mary. Frill is a creature -- but really since this ghost has appeared, the
house is so frightful that any company is acceptable.


Muns. That for the ghost! To night we are to have a jolly little party --
Hush, my dear, (with joy) -- Jack Connor's coming to Miss Rachel, I Am with you,
and cook is preparing a nice bit of supper for us all, tol, lol!


Mary. A supper! delightful!


Muns. Old master don't come home to night, and we'll be so merry, tol, lol.


Mary. Charming! then I Will go superintend supper.


Muns. And I Will make Tooten the black, my pupil, prepare his horn. -- Oh, how
sweetly we played on the water yesterday! -- They may talk of fine views, and
vistos, and beauties of nature; but it is to hear the divine echos of my horn,
that brings the gentlefolks all the way from Cork, and even Dublin, down here
to the lake of Killarney. But now for supper.


Exit. SCENE, a Hall. MUNS and MARY placing tables and a screen between. Muns.
There! the lovers sha'n't be overlooked by us, ha! ha! ha! Here Tooten and I Will
sit and take our pleasure -- while they mingle lips, we'll jingle glasses. --
Oh how I love to see good cheer going forward!


Exeunt. FRILL advances. Frill. So, here is rare doings in the old gentleman's
absence; master and I bubbled by such clowns as Muns and Jack Connor -- oh
revenge!


Old DOWDLE, without. Who is here?

Frill. Oh choice luck! Here comes the old codger home unexpectedly. -- Such a
hobble as I Will bring 'em into. Ha! ha! ha!


Enter Old DOWDLE. Dowd. Oh my bones! Who Is that I see there? What, are they
all gone to bed? Well I Will go too, and not disturb any body.


Frill. What, Sir, go to bed without your supper? the nice supper that Miss
Rachel has prepared for you?


Dowd. (seeing the table laid) Hey! what is all this?


Frill. The table laid for your supper, Sir.


Dowd. Why who knew I was coming home?


Frill. Miss Rachel, Sir.


Dowd. Eh! then she knows I had a fall from my horse?


Frill. The devil a word of it. (aside) Oh yes, Sir, Mary told her that.


Dowd. Mary! who told Mary?


Frill. Oh, Sir -- she saw you, Sir, as she was taking a walk.


Dowd. She took a devil of a long walk then; for I fell six miles off.


Frill. That was a great fall indeed, Sir.


Dowd. Eh?


Frill. Walk -- yes, Sir -- ride -- Sir -- Mary was riding too -- the evening
being fine, Miss Rachel gave her leave to go see her brother.


Dowd. Mary?


Frill. Yes, Sir; Muns rode before her.


Dowd. After my orders to stay at home on the watch! Before Mary? Then I
suppose the rascal took my chestnut pad?


Frill. Don't say I told you -- but I fancy he did -- they would not wish you
to know it, Sir -- they will all deny it to you.


Dowd. Mary! -- he -- indeed I heard a woman squall.


Frill. Yes, Sir, she said she squall'd.


Dowd. Then perhaps 'twas she sent the 'pothecary to me.


Frill. It was, Sir. -- One lie has drawn me into a dozen.


(aside) Dowd. A busy slut! He was a farrier -- called himself a surgeon, though
he was a farrier; for the fellow out with a steam, up with my leg, and swore
he would bleed me in the fetlock. -- Where Is your master?


Frill. Lord, Sir, didn't he come home with you?


Dowd. No, he said somebody from France was to meet him at an inn three miles
off, he, he! -- But I Am glad my daughter had so much thought as to provide a
morsel for me. -- Oh what happiness, after all one's crosses abroad, to come to
one's own home, when one's children and servants are so attentive to render it
agreedable! -- Muns! (calls) Where Is this cursed fellow, with his galloping my
horses about the country? Frill, shall I trouble you to help me on with my
gown, and then I can come and sit down to my supper in comfort.


Exit. Frill. Yes, Sir. -- Oh what a rare hobble I shall bring them into, ha,
ha, ha!


Exit. Enter RACHEL, ADELAIDE, and JACK CONNOR. All. Ha, ha, ha!


Rachel. And there now is my old papa, trotting from cottage to barn, like a
cunning little exciseman, with his green book under his arm, and his pen stuck
in his wig.


All. Ha, ha, ha!


Jack Connor. But why will not Miss Adelaide give us her company?


Rachel. You must.


Adelaide. My dear, suffer me to go to rest, if I can rest. -- The death of nay
Nugent, the misfortunes of Lord Esmond -- though I never saw him -- It may seem
an affectation of sensibility -- I cannot account for it, but I feel something
inexpressibly horrid hanging over me, ever since you showed me the old lady's
clothes.


Rachel. Sure!


Adelaide. Not a night I don't dream I Am rummaging her clothes-press in the
haunted room, as you call it.


Rachel. Well, my dear, if you will retire, suffer Jack to see you across the
gallery.


Jack Connor. Ay, Miss, under my guard, show me the ghost that dare affront you.


Exit with Adelaide. Enter MARY with supper, which she puts on the table. Mary.
There, Miss. -- Let Us see, I must bring another bottle; for your lover is a
good fellow, and a good fellow deserves a good bottle.


Exit. Rachel. (sits down) I wish Jack Connor would make haste. (begins to
carve) Ha, ha, ha! My little dad, if he knew what we were at here now.


Enter DOWDLE, in an undress. Rachel carves with her back to him as he enters.
Rachel. Yes, my poor father's fast asleep by this, in some peaceful cottage.
Ha, ha, ha! I did not care if he had a taste of this turkey; I know the old lad
likes a bit of the merry-thought. -- How long my dearee stays! -- Is that you?
-- (Speaks without looking round) Eh! you have been giving her a kiss, I suppose
-- come, whilst its hot; sit down, you foolish fellow.


Dowdle comes round, and sits down opposite to her. Rachel. Ah!


(screams.) Dowdle. What Is the matter with you?


Rachel. Sir, I -- I -- I thought it was the ghost.


Dowd. Why, did you invite the ghost to supper?


Rachel. If Jack returns we are undone. (aside) Lord, Sir, who expected you?


Dowd. Indeed I should not have been home to night, but for the tumble.


Rachel. What tumble, Sir?


Dowd. Sure you -- oh true, I wa'n't to know she let Muns gallop my horses
about the road. (aside) Well, ha, ha! I forgive you and him, since it has
procured me so good a supper. Ha, ha!


Rachel. Forgive us! Then, Sir, you know all?


Dowd. Yes, yes, I Am not angry -- call the fellow.


Rachel. O precious! Then, Sir, you will let him sup with us?


Dowd. Sup! what your servant?


Rachel. True, Sir, I am his mistress, and he loves me dearly.


Dowd. Who, Muns?


Rachel. Muns!


Dowd. If your Muns dare to sit down at a table with me, I Will knock the
scoundrel to the devil.


Enter MUNS and BLACK, who sit at the other table. Muns. Now, Tooten, don't
look toward the lovers -- here we'll sit, play, and take our glasses. (They
drink) Now up with Black Sloven.


(Tooten and Muns play the horns) Dowd. Hey!


(Lays down his fork.) Muns. How do you like that, my lad of wax?


Dowd. What Is that?


Muns. Eh!


(Surprised, softly rises and peeps over the screen, which he had placed
between the two tables; at the same time Dowdle turns up his face.) Enter MARY
with wine. Rachel. If I could prevent Jack Connor from coming in.


Exit. Mary. Here Is two bottles for the jolly dog.


(Sets them on the table, where Muns sits.) Muns. (in a smothered laugh) Ha,
ha, ha! Go give it to the jolly dog yourself.


Mary. (goes round the screen, and seeing Dowdle, screams) Ah!


Dowd. Curse your squalling! I believe it was you that frightened my horse.


Mary. Me!


Dowd. Where the devil did you pick up such an apothecary?


Mary. I pick up an apothecary! Sir, I Would have you to know --


Dowd. He was a farrier (enraged); and, Sirrah, the next time you take the road
--


Muns. I take the road!


Dowd. So you must go on the pad!


Muns. I go on the pad! Oh Lord!


Dowd. You scoundrel! cantering about. -- Where Is the pillion?


Muns. Mary, fetch my master the pillow.


Dowd. So, Sirrah, she is in love with you?


Muns. Yes, Sir -- eh Mary? ha, ha, ha!


Dowd. And you must sit down and sup with me?


Muns. Eh! well -- thank ye, Sir.


(Sits down) Dowd. Fine! Had Not you better ask the black-a-moor? (Ironically)


Muns. Tooten, sit down, boy.


(Black sits down.) Dowd. Get along, you infernal impudent son of a --


Beats him Muns. Oh Lord, he is mad!


Dowd. Where Is my saddle, you villain?


Muns. His saddle! Going to ride this tim night -- yes, the devil's got into
him.


Dowd. I Will beat him out of you, you damned rogue.


Muns. The ghost has bit him -- Oh.


(Muns and Mary run off.) Dowd. A knave!


Enter JACK CONNOR. Jack Connor. This old mansion has so many windings, I
thought I should never have found my way back again. -- Come, sit down, my
dear. -- Zounds!


(seeing old Dawdle, runs off.) Dowd. Stop the fellow -- thieves --


(runs out after him.) SCENE, another Apartment. Enter MARY. Mary. I wonder if
Miss Rachel's gone to bed. -- Jack Connor must have slipped out when he heard
master scolding us -- Yes, I hear him locking the great gate. -- Near one
o'clock -- I wish I was in my own room -- I dread crossing that dismal gallery:
if I meet any thing I should die, I Am so frightened. O Lord, what is that?


Enter MUNS. Muns. It Is I, my dear. -- Do You think master saw Jack Connor?


Mary. I hope not; but I cannot conceive how he got off.


Muns. No matter, as he wa'n't seen we are safe. -- But here is a strange
gentleman, I saw him just now at Jack Connor's -- knocked at the postern, and
asked for a bed, as he is benighted, and --


Mary. The deuce! Were you mad, to let a stranger in at this time of night? He
may be a white boy.


Muns. Look, Mary, I let him in out of good nature -- let those that are ill
natured turn him out.


Mary. Why 'twould be cruel indeed; only master's so cross. -- Stop -- I Have a
thought -- the finest opportunity! -- Let Us put him to sleep in the haunted
room; as he don't know on it he will not be afraid, and if the ghost walks he will
certainly speak to it, and then --


Muns. Why yes, if it is our dead lady, she may tell him what disturbs her,
then may be she will vanish, and trouble the house no more -- I like it hugely.


Mary. Where have you left the gentleman?


Muns. In the lodge. Come --


(going) Mary. You need n't run away from a body.


(takes him under her arm) Muns. Ah! how loving these women are, when they
stand in need of our protection. Hem! (swaggers) Eh! bless me! tol, lol, lol.


Exeunt. SCENE, an antique Apartment. A Lady's Picture hanging over the
Chimney. Enter MUNS and MARY, with lights, introducing Lord Esmond. Mary. This
is the room, Sir.


Muns. (in terror, yet trying to conceal it) Yes, Sir, this is the room, Sir.


Lord Esm. I Am very much obliged to you.


Mary. The bed's in the alcove, Sir.


(points to it) Muns. Well, Mary, put on the sheets, and air it well for the
gentleman.


Mary. Cannot you?


Muns. Psha!


(apart -- each urging the other to go in.) Mary. Sir, the bed is very well
air'd.


Muns. Yes, Sir, it has been laid in, not above -- eight years ago. (aside) Go
-- ( to Mary, who with much hesitation and terror goes into the alcove)


Lord Esm. The gentleman of the house is gone to rest?


Muns. Yes, Sir, the gentleman of the house rested in prison these ten years --


Lord Esm. Indeed! Poor gentleman.


Muns. Ay, Sir, he is a lord; the cards and dice have left him a very poor
gentleman -- but my master, his steward, is now quietly snoring.


Lord Esm. Then I shall return him thanks in the morning.


Muns. Oh, Sir, you may as well not thank him, Sir.


Lord Esm. Oh then it is entirely to you I Am obliged?


Muns. Yes, Sir.


Lord Esm. As I was left by the man of the house, when you saw me, but for your
humanity, I must have lain in the fields all night -- Here.


(offers money) Muns. As I did'n't buy my humanity, I never will sell it.


(refuses the money) Re-enter MARY. Mary. There, Sir, the bed's ready -- Lord!
-- so frightened! -- thought I should never get done.


(apart to Muns) Muns. Hush! hush! (apart) Sir, we'll leave you a light, Sir,
and you may leave it burning -- that he may see the ghost.


(apart) Mary. Wish you a good night, Sir.


Muns. A good night's rest, Sir. -- Oh what a clawing will be here by and by.


Exeunt Muns and Mary. Lord Esm. For the first time indeed, since my infancy, I
shall sleep under my own roof. -- Since I find this Count not here, I shall, if
possible, get out early and meet him at the inn where I appointed. The dead of
night seems very awful in these antique mansions. -- This room was, I think, my
dear mother's -- yes, there is her picture -- my fond parent --


(clock strikes one) Enter ADELAIDE, from a door which opens in the wainscot --
walks as in her sleep. Who Is here? a lady! -- Heavens, she is asleep!

( He stands fixed with wonder, Adelaide crosses, opens a clothes-press, takes
from her head a hood scarf, and night-rail, somewhat resembling the picture in
the room, and puts them into the press, then, to return to the door where she
entered, walks with her face toward Lord Esmond.) Lord Esm. Is it possible? --
it is my Adelaide! -- Hold! to wake her -- the sudden fright may -- yes, this
ring, her last pledge of affection when we parted -- (puts a ring upon her
finger, which he had taken from his own). This ring may afford her comfort,
without discovering that it is I that have been here.

Exit Adelaide. This seems a private door -- and that lobby -- yes -- it leads
to her chamber -- she still only knows me for Nugent, and thinks me dead -- the
cause perhaps of her disordered mind. -- To meet her here, my greatest blessing
-- so strange and unexpected! May it lead to some greater happipess!


Exit Lord Esmond to the recess. END OF ACT I
ACT II.
SCENE, Open Country, before a public Inn, sign of the Shoulder of Mutton.
Enter MUNS, his horn round his neck, and box under his arm. Muns. OH that
wicked old master, to turn me off for only letting in that strange man! -- a
strange man he was, for none could tell how he got out this morning. -- Master
swears he was a thief, and threatens to prosecute me for an accomplice, if I
even ask for my wages -- and then I Have left my sweet Mary-gold all to Frill. --
Here have I tramp'd two miles, as hungry -- and not a shilling in my pocket. --
Now here is a house of entertainment -- yet I Am afraid even to sit down on the
bench, lest I should be asked to pay for it. -- I Am so hungry -- House! (calls
faintly) Oh! what an effect an empty pocket has upon a man's voice at the door
of a public house!


Enter LANDLORD. Landlord. What would you be pleased to have?


Muns. Any thing, Sir.


Enter LANDLADY. Landlady. What do you want?


Muns. Every thing, Ma'am.


Landlord. Who are you?


Muns. A poor servant out of place.


Landlady. We want a waiter, husband.


Landlord. Did your master give you a character?


Muns. No, Sir, he had none for himself.


Landlord. What can you do?


Muns. Sir, I don't know what to do.


Landlord. What are you capable of?


Muns. Oh, Sir -- I can play a duet upon the horn.


Landlord. I want no horn.


Landlady. No, that you don't, husband.


Landlord. You understand horses?


Muns. Yes, Sir, and cookery.


Landlord. I want one in my stable.


Muns. A horse?


Landlord. Psha! my stable.


Muns. Yes, Sir, but I Am best in the kitchen -- Ma'am, I Will do any thing for
bread -- only employ me -- I Will be humble as a spaniel -- secret as a fish --
watchful as a cat -- I Will sleep like a cock upon one leg, with the other ready
to pop down to run on a message.


Landlord. Come in, my lad, you're the very man for the Shoulder of Mutton.


Muns. That I am, Sir, either baked or roasted.


Exeunt. SCENE, a Room in the Inn. Enter Lord ESMOND and LANDLORD. Lord Esm.
Only if Count Fripon inquires for Mr. Nugent, show him in.


Landlord, Yes, Sir.


Exit. Lord Esm. Luckily, in the time of my distress at Montpelier, I took the
name of one of their confederates, who, from being stationed in a distant
quarter, probably the Count has never seen. They, supposing me one of their
rascally club, I may get at their secret schemes, and so be prepared to
counteract them.


Enter COUNT. Count. Fall, lal, lal! Ha, Monsieur Nugent, I never ave de honeur
of seeing you, but know you are of our club in Paris; Sir, I am rejoice at your
coming.


Lord Esm. Thank ye, Count -- I Am sent -- deputed by our friends, to see how
you go on with my Lord's affairs.


Count. Ah, malheureux! very bad -- no money -- been out now all last night,
and got but abuse -- no -- dey will pay none but my Lord himself -- One Jack
Connor will not let 'em.


Lord Esm. Rascal! -- my friendly school-fellow.


(aside) Count. Monsieur Nugent -- eh -- I have de thought -- has Monsieur
Dowdle, de steward, ever see you?


Lord Esm. I think not.


Count. Bon! It vil do -- since de tenant vil pay none but my Lor himself, I will pass you on them for Lor Esmond, and I warrant in tumble de money, ma foi,
ha, ha!


Lord Esm. Excellent! You Will say I Am his lordship, ha, ha! they pay me, and we
return to Paris, and share it with our club, ha, ha! admirable!


Count. Dat is it, ha, ha, ha! But hold -- if dey even believe you are he, how
will dey tink how you got out of prison in Paris? -- Ah! ah! dat is to be
consider.


Lord Esm. What do you think of my making my valet pass for my jailor, whom
I Will say I prevailed upon for a bribe to accompany me on this ramble, to see my
estate?


Trap. (without.) Ay, I Will have him.


Lord Esm. Ha, ha, ha! do you hear him?


Count. Diable! dat is he!


Lord Esm. Why, to tell you the truth, I had adopted this very scheme of yours,
and already tutored my valet to play his part of my jailor. -- Now Trap will
help me without knowing.


(aside) Count. Oh den dis is your valet? -- ha, ha, ha! admirable! ha, ha, ha!


Lord Esm. Now only observe how he will keep up his character.


Enter TRAP, looking surly. Trap. Oh you're there -- I Am glad I Have found you.


Lord Esm. Well, Trap -- I call him Trap --


(apart to Count) Trap. I thought you would run away from me; but you frighten me
so no more, as back you come to prison directly.


Count. Ha, ha, ha! bravo! Oh he does it capitally!


Lord Esm. Now I Will give you a specimen how I can act the lord. (apart to
Count) But my honest jailor, indulge me in this little frolic -- I paid you
well for it.


Count. Bravo, my Lor; now jailor.


Trap. Yes, but what is your pay if I get hanged for letting you out?


Count. Ah, ah, ah! dat is capital. Ha, ha!


Lord Esm. But I am now going to my castle.


Trap. But first, my Lord, you will come back to my castle!


Count. Oh charmante! ha, ha, ha! to my castle -- Oh dat is admirable -- ha, ha!


Trap. Yes, damme, what do you laugh at? If I had you peeping through the bars
of my castle, then you might grin like a baboon.


Count. Yes, but as dear is nobody by, you may now as well drop the jailor.


Trap. But I will not drop the jailor. -- Nobody by? -- Damme, do you want to
rescue my prisoner, eh?


Count. Begar, if I vas not told you was valet, you almost make me tremble.


Trap. Valet! what do you mean?


Count. Oh I warrant he is de careful diligent; I wish such to ave de care of
my clothes.


Trap. Your clothes! ha, ha, ha! I Would desire only one suit and your body in it,
I warrant I Would take care of it.


Count. You will drink my health?


(gives him money) Trap. Why, as for your health that is no business of mine,
but I Will drink your wine. -- My Lord, I Will have an eye upon you -- can he drop
from this window? -- No, no.


Exit. Count. Ha, ha, ha!


Lord Esm. Well, don't you think we are safe in our jailor? Ha, ha!


Count. Ay, I hope you will play de Lor half so vel, and we touch de cash. Ha, ha!


Enter MUNS as a waiter. Muns. Do you call, Gentlemen?


Count. Ventre bleu! more acting! diable! You Muns, vat bring you here!


Muns. Master turned me off for letting in, and giving a bed in the haunted
room, to a half-starv'd poor devil, that -- (sees Lord Esmond) Oh! how do you do,
Sir? La, Sir, did you see master, coming away?


Count. Den you were at de house, eh?


Lord Esm. Last night, to look for you.


(apart) Count. Oh! -- vel, my Lor Esmond, ven you return to your castle as
yourself --


Lord Esm. Immediately.


Muns. This my Lord Esmond! huzza! my fortune's made!


Enter LANDLORD. Landlord. Hey! What have you got lazy already, sirrah?


(to Muns) Muns. Eh! fellow! who do you talk to? My Lord, had'n't we best quit?
No accommodation for your lordship in these paltry inns.


Count. Hey, fellow, you must dispatch all your servants and horses round the
country, dat all my Lord's vassals and domestics may show their duty and
respect in his welcome home.


Muns. And since you did entertain me, to show my gratitude, I open your house.


Lord Esm. Well said, honest Muns; and for your disinterested generosity in
receiving me last night, you may change places with your old master.


Muns. Make me steward! Oh, my Lord, I shall grow mad with joy! -- Clear the
way there for his lordship.


Exeunt. SCENE, JACK CONNER'S House. Enter JACK CONNER and PHELIM. Jack Connor.
The stranger one! I should have stayed to entertain him but for his reflections
on my Lord -- and the call of love.


Phelim. Yes, and here has been old Tough, the grazier, making such a riot
about a lamb, he insists has been taken out of his field.


Jack Connor. Psha! the fool! never mind him -- if my darling will but come,
and Father Frank will but marry us -- Oh! here comes his reverence.


Enter Father FRANK. F. Frank. Well, Jack Connor, what is this business?


Jack Connor. The first is, that your reverence will breakfast with me.


F. Frank. Well, that is a business of no harm, if it be a good breakfast.


Jack Connor. The next, that you marry me to my dear Rachel, who designs to
slip out to me this morning.


Tough. (without.) I will have it.


Jack Connor. Now here is that litigious blockhead, old Tough, the grazier, come
wrangling about --


Enter TOUGH. Tough. So, Jack Connor, now that Father Frank is here, I Will make
my complaint, if you don't restore my lamb.


Jack Connor. She Is not yours -- you know my shepherd saw you the other night
sneak into my field, and brand two of my sheep with your own name.


F. Frank. Oh! that was a grievous sin, neighbor Tough.


Tough. Ah, Father Frank, I see which way your opinion goes where good eating
is to be had; but I Will lay my case before my Lord's steward, that I will.


Exit. Enter RACHEL hastily. Jack Connor. My love!


Rachel. Well, here I Have run to you. Oh! I Am so frightened. -- Now if you have
not brought Father Frank here to marry us.


Jack Connor. Ha, ha, ha! guessed it. -- Ah, slyone!


F. Frank. But have you her father's consent?


Jack Connor. I Have her own, which is worth fifty fathers -- eh, Rachel?


Rachel. You have,


(gives her hand) F. Frank. I will not marry you without her father's consent.


Enter PHELIM. Phelim. Here Is the steward.


Rachel. Lud, my father!


Phelim. And yonder comes old Tough again, swearing he will complain to him.


Jack Connor. Will he? 'Gad I Have a thought -- Ha! (aside) Father Frank, only
step in; Rachel will make breakfast for you -- suffer me to say a few words to
her father, and I promise you he consents to our marriage. -- Hush! step in.


F. Frank. Your hot cakes and your eggs are good, and that that is good is the
delight of a churchman.


Exit with Rachel. Enter DOWDLE. Dowd. Jack, I am come again to demand your
rent, to pay off my Lord's debts to the Count.


Jack Connor. Well, you shall have it, if you will oblige me.


Dowd. Oblige you, that is doing all manner of rogueries to the wart and perplex
me!


Jack Connor. Well, my frolicks are all over -- for as I lost every hope of
your giving me Rachel --


Dowd. You Have no hope indeed -- this evening I give her to the Count.


J. Connor. Well, I knew you would; so I struck up to the daughter of old Tough
the grazier; unknown to him she has scamper'd off here to me, and is this
moment in that room.


Dowd. No! Well you're a devil of a --


J. Connor. I am -- and how can I help it?


Dowd. You cannot.


J. Connor. We Have Father Frank here ready to marry us, but he is afraid of your
anger.


Dowd. My anger! What is it to me who he marries?


Jack Connor. Why yes, as 'twas all about my courting your daughter, he will
not marry me to this girl without you are willing.


Dowd. What! you knave, do you think I Will connive at your running away with any
man's daughter! 'Gad, I might be served so myself.


Jack Connor. And you shall -- for by all the beard on your chin, if you don't
call to Father Frank, to marry me to the girl within, -- there, (points to the
room) as I lose her through you, I Will again tack about, and run away with
Rachel in spite of your teeth. I tell you, you will never be able to hold your
daughter till I Am tied up.


Dowd. Then I wish you were tied up. -- Damn the fellow, he is as dangerous in
the village as a fox. -- Well, I consent; so call Father Frank.


Jack Connor. Call a priest from his breakfast! are you mad?


Dowd. Call the wench hither.


Jack Connor. I will, thank ye -- (going, returns.) But I think you would as good
not be present.


Dowd. No?


Jack Connor. No. -- Old Tough will owe you a sad spite.


Dowd. Well, I Am obliged to you. -- Indeed her father is a wicked old rogue.


Jack Connor. So he is, Sir; he is a wicked old rogue: why I told him so just
now.


Dowd. Did you? What! to his face?


Jack Connor. To his face, as I talk to you this moment. -- Says I, you old
knave, I Will marry your daughter.


Dowd. Do, -- go in and do it; ha, ha, ha!


Jack Connor. I will -- I Will do it.


Dowd. Ha, ha, ha! I like to see a crabbed old numskull bamboozled, ha, ha, ha!


Jack Connor. So do I, ha, ha, ha!


Tough. (within.) I Will have her.


Dowd. Eh! here he is.


Jack Connor. Yes, he has missed her. Now only mind the fordid fellow's manner
of talking of his family -- all in the grazier's style. -- Why, Sir, his wife
he calls his ewe.


Dowd. Then I suppose he will call his daughter here within, his lamb, ha, ha!


Jack Connor. Eh! why no; I think he will scarce do that.


Dowd. I Will bet you half-a-crown he does.


Jack Connor. Done! He will not.


Dowd. He will. Zounds, don't I know the fellow's mode of phrase? A mere savage!


Jack Connor. Well, but do you call to the friar.


Dowd. I will. -- Here, Father Frank, marry the couple directly; go in and do
it. (pushing him in.) Oh! this will make a rare laugh against the old fellow,
ha, ha, ha! Here he comes. -- Father Frank, make haste and marry them.


Enter TOUGH. Tough. He shall restore her. -- Mr. Dowdle, do you authorize
these doings?


Dowd. What doings? ha, ha, ha!


(smothering a laugh.) Tough. What doings! Jack Connor to take away my lamb?


Dowd. His lamb! ha, ha, ha! by the Lord I have won my half crown -- I knew the
grazier would come out, ha, ha! She Is Jack Connor's lamb by this, ha, ha, ha!


Tough. His! For ten guineas she carries my name.


Dowd. Ha, ha, ha! For twenty guineas, by this she carries Jack Connor's, ha,
ha, ha!


Tough. Why, zounds! he is not tarring her over again!


Dowd. Tarr'd, yes; and she will be soon feathered.


Tough. Feathered!


Dowd. Yes, when she is dressed; it is all the fashion, you know.


Tough. Zounds! then he intends her for his own table.


Dowd. Yes, certainly, she will head his table, ha, ha, ha!


Tough. He Is plaguey dainty.


Dowd. Yes, he is a dainty fellow.


Tough. He Is a thief. -- I thought to have sent her to market tomorrow.


Dowd. Father Frank, if the job's over, let the lamb come out here, and ask the
old ram's blessing.


(calls out.) Enter RACHEL, handed in by JACK CONNER and Father FRANK. Rachel.
(kneels to Dowdle.) Father, your blessing.


Dowd. Eh! zounds! if this should be the lamb!


Tough. Egad, and I believe you are the old ram, ha, ha, ha!


Dowd. Father Frank, what the Devil's this you have been doing?


F. Frank. Fie, fie! this is unseemly. -- I Have been joining this pair in holy
wedlock, as you desired me.


Tough. As you desired him, ha, ha, ha! Egad, it is my turn to laugh now.


Jack Connor. Father-in-law, to keep the laugh from yourself, you would best join
in it.


Rachel. Father, don't be angry, for upon the word of a bride, I had no notion
of marriage, -- but as you desired it, I complied, to show my obedience.


Dowd. Oh, plague of your obedience.


(Going in a rage.) Jack Connor. Sir, father-in-law, here is the half-crown you
won.


( Old Dowdle breaks from him, and exits in a fury.) Tough. Ha, ha, ha! I Am so
pleased. Jack, if you even have my lamb, keep it, and let your lamb carve it
for the wedding day supper.


Exeunt. SCENE, Lord ESMOND's House. Enter MARY, and taps at the door. Mary.
Ha, ha, ha! Yes, by this my young lady's a bride, and if poor Muns had not been
turned away, I might have been a bride. -- Miss Adelaide! ( taps at the door)
Bless me! will she sleep all day?


Enter ADELAIDE. Adel. It Is very late. ( Looks at her watch.)


Mary. I ate! ha, ha, ha! now, Miss, hav'n't you been dreaming of your
sweetheart?


Adel. Oh! Mary, the sweetest dream!


Mary. La, Miss, that is a vastly pretty ring: I never saw you wear it before.


Adel. (looking at her finger) Ring! Oh Heavens! is it possible?


Mary. I must put your room to rights.


Exit. Adel. This is the very ring I gave my Nugent at our last parting! If he
should be still alive! Oh transport!


Re-enter MARY. Mary. La, Miss, as sure as I live, there is a door none of us
ever saw from your chamber to the haunted room. I went through a long passage
that goes all the way; and there is my old lady's clothes-press opened, and all
in such a confusion!


Adel. Do you know of any stranger here last night?


Mary. None, Miss, but he I put to sleep in the haunted room.


Adel. Where is he?


(quick) Mary. Gone, Ma'am, but Lord knows where.


Adel. It must have been my Nugent; every circumstance confirms it; and this
ghost must have been I that walked in my sleep. I shudder to think of the
dangers I Have escaped; but my Nugent lives, and danger vanishes.


aside. Enter DOWDLE. Dowd. Ah, jade! Pray, Miss, did you know of my daughter's
elopement?


Adel. Dear Sir, did you see the gentleman?


Dowd. The Devil's in the women! I ask about my daughter, and a gentleman is
slap'd in my teeth! Hussy, were you her confidant? ( to Mary.)


Mary. Pray, Sir, can you think where Muns is gone?


Dowd. Get along, you jade, you and your Muns; the rascal, I suppose, is
starving in a ditch by this -- ( a loud knocking.) Hey! what great man is this?


Enter MUNS, in a rich livery. Muns. Hey! nobody to throw open the gates -- for
us! -- Hey!


( swaggering) Dowd. You! you scoundrel, how dare you show your saucy face here?


Muns. (without attending to Dowdle) Come, we must have the rooms now in some
order. This table -- chairs -- sopha -- ( with great haste, and very
consequentially he moves the furniture) We must have a total change here --
by'r leave --


Dowd. Hey! Turn out.


Muns. Stop -- we shall soon see which of us is to turn out.


( shouting without) Enter Lord ESMOND ( richly dressed), and the COUNT. Ld.
Esm. My beloved Adelaide!


( embracing) Muns. My darling Mary!


( embracing) Adel. It Is my Nugent!


Count. Nugent! Oh! she vil spoil all. ( aside) De lady is mistake; -- dis, Mr.
Dowdle, is your master.


Dowd. Eh!


Count. (apart to Adelaide) Miss, say with us, and you shall ave de much money.


Adel. And does Mr. Nugent come here an impostor? Lord Esmond has been already
too much wronged -- deprived of liberty and fortune: and, though I never saw
him, and once dearly loved you ( to Ld. Esmond), could I suppose you one of his
unprincipled oppressors, I Would banish you for ever from my heart.


Ld. Esm. My Adelaide! what joy to prove your probity unshaken, as your
innocence is spotless! I should scarce wish to recover my fortune, but to
render myself more worthy of your love.


Count. He does act de Lord charmant; I must help him on. ( aside) Monsieur
Dowdle, I have received lettres from my friends in Paris; to show dear
generosite, dey desire me to deliver him up his bonds -- Dear, my Lor. ( gives
Lord Esmond papers.) Now as we have no claim on his Lordship, I hope de tenants
will now pay dear rents.


Ld. Esm. I am sure, Count, I am vastly obliged to you for this,


( noise without) Enter JACK CONNER and RACHEL; he with a large stick stands
before Lord Esmond. Jack Connor. I Will die before they take my Lord again to a
gaol.


Enter TRAP, and Officers. Ld. Esm. So, Connor, you will die for me, and not
return to sup with me? ha, ha!


Jack Connor. (looking at Ld. Esmond) And was it you, my Lord, I affronted at
my house?


Ld. Esm. My old friend, neither time nor dignity has erased the affection of
our boyish days. -- As for my steward --


Jack Connor. My Lord, my first request is, pardon for my father-in-law.


Dowd. Ah, Jack! you know how freely I gave you my daughter.


Count. And I have lost ma chere Rachel -- Ah! malheureux!


Trap. But now, my Lord you would as good think of coming back to my house.


Ld. Esm. I thank you, Trap, but I prefer my own. -- Restored to my estate, I
will satisfy all my creditors; and, be assured, I will take care to indemnify
you.


Count. Diable! Are you really my Lord Esmond? Oh, I am ruined!


Ld. Esm. My ruin, I hope, will teach our nobility, instead of traveling to
become the dupes of foreign sharpers, to stay at home and spend their fortunes
amongst their honest tenants, who support their splendor -- Trap, you have
been long my jailer, now I Will be yours; -- but liberty shall be your punishment
-- hospitality the lock of my prison -- and honest Muns my turnkey, to give a
welcome to the kind friend, social neighbor, and, above all, the stranger in
distress.


FINIS.
