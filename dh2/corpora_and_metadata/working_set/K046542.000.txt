Village Courtship.
YOUNG Roger came tapping at Dolly's window,
Thumpaty, thumpaty, thump;
He begged for admittance, she answered him, No,
Glumpaty, glumpaty, glump;
My DOLLY, my dear, your true Love is here,
Dumpaty, dumpaty, dump;
No, no, ROGER, no -- as you came, you may go,
Slumpaty, slumpaty, slump.
Oh! then she recalled, and recalled him again,
Humpaty, humpaty, hump;
Whilst he, like a madman, ran over the plain,
Slumpaty, slumpaty, slump;
Oh! what is the reason, dear DOLLY, he cried,
Humpaty, humpaty, hump,
That thus I Am cast off, and unkindly denied,
Trumpaty, trumpaty, trump.
Some rival more dear, I guess has been here,
Crumpaty, crumpaty, crump;
Suppose there is been two, Sir, what is that to you, Sir,
Numpaty, Numpaty, nump.
Oh! then with a sigh his sad farewell he took,
Humpaty, humpaty, hump;
And quite in despair he leaped into the brook,
Plumpaty, plumpaty, plump.
His courage he cooled, he found himself fooled,
Mumpaty, mumpaty, mump;
He swam to the shore, and saw DOLLY no more,
Rumpaty, rumpaty, rump.
Determined to find a damsel more kind,
Plumpaty, plumpaty, plump;
While DOLLY's afraid she must die an old maid,
Mumpaty, mumpaty, mump.
FOWLER, PRINTER, SALISBURY.
