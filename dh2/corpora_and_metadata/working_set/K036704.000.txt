PROLOGUE,
WRITTEN BY T. W. FITZGERALD, Esquire. Spoken by Mr. Macready.
WHEN invalids possess both faith and wealth,
They Will find a nostrum to restore their health;
A panacea advertised to cure
Each ill the human body can endure.
But our bold Author claims a nobler art,
And advertises to relieve -- the heart.
So many patients he expects to see,
That I Am appointed as his deputy.
Now, then, your mental maladies explain,
And I Will remove or mitigate the pain.
Does love or jealousy your peace molest,
Revenge inflame, ambition gnaw your breast?
For jealousy, a sovereign balm behold, --
The husband's certain cure, a pill of gold;
This dose, administered with prudent care,
Dispels at once the frailties of the fair;
Deprives the proctor of his crim. con. fee,
And tunes the chord that jar'd to harmony.
Should love torment some Romeo's heated brain,
Or agonize a Juliet's breast with pain,
Let them my potent remedy apply, --
The maid shall cease to pine, the youth to sigh;
Gold shall restore each drooping lover's health,
And passion sind a substitute in wealth.
But let not ill-timed ridicule degrade
What Heaven, when well applied, a blessing made.
To foster merit, wheresoever found,
And with improvement cheer a country round;
To feed the hungry, and to clothe the poor,
And send the beggar happy from the door;
To mitigate the horrors of despair,
And make the family of want our care;
To succor genius, drooping in distress,
Making the business of our lives to bless.
When the rich man can such employment find,
We wish his purse as ample as his mind.
For one poor patient I Have an anxious fear;
And you must be his kind physician here.
Our Author has to night so much at stake,
He finds his throbbing heart inclined to ache!
But should his play a liberal audience please,
Your warm applause will set his heart at ease.

A CURE FOR THE HEART-ACHE, A COMEDY.
ACT I.
SCENE I. A Farm Yard. House on one Side, a neat Flower-Garden on the other.
The Bells of a Team jingling.
FRANK (without.) WOYH! Whoh! Smiler! (Enters.) So Feyther be not come home
from the Nabob's house yet. Eh! bean't that sister Jessy, in her garden, busy
among the poseys? -- Sister Jessy!


Enter JESSY from the Garden, a watering-pot in her hand. Jessy. Ah, Frank! so
soon returned from Gloucester? have you sold the corn?


Frank. Ees.


Jessy. And how did you like the town? you were never there before?


Frank. Loike it! I don't know how I loiked it, not I; L zomehow could not zee
the town for the housen: desperate zight of 'em, to be sure. -- But Jessy, you
who went to Lunnun Town to take in your larning, can tell me, be there as many
houses in Lunnun?


Jessy. A hundred times the number.


Frank. And do your 'squires there, like Sir Hubert Stanley, and the Nabob
here, keep fine coaches?


Jessy. Yes, Frank; there are some thousands round St. James's Gate.


Frank. St. James's Geat! Dong it; it would be worth a poor man's while to
stand and open that geat. -- Pray you, where do that geat lead to?


Jessy. The road to preferment, Frank.


Frank. Ecod, if your road to preferment be so crammed wi' your coaches and
great folk, no wonder a poor man be run down when he tries to get a bit.


Jessy. Ha, ha!


Frank. You seem to be in terrible good spirits, Jessy.


Jessy. I have reason, Frank. I have just received a letter from my dear
Edward, who has left London on business with his father, Mr. Rapid, and will be
here to day.


Frank. I suppose it to be a desperate long letter, and cruel sweet. Full of
kisses and voluntines. -- Nine sheets, I warrant.


Jessy. Hardly nine words. The truth is, that Edward, though handsome, generous,
and I hope since^^ is impatient and hasty to a degree that --


Frank. Hasty! What then? when a man be on the road to do good, he cannot go too
fast, I say. -- Bean't that Feyther coming through Wheat Ash? he have been
drinking and gamestring all good Sunday night wi' Nabob's servants, -- how
whitish and deadly bad he do look. He used to be as comely and handsome as
either of us, was not he now? Do you know, Jessy, at church yesterday, Sir
Hubert, looking round, as he always do to see if his tenants be there, missed
Feyther, and gave me such a desperate look, that I dropped prayer book out of my
hand; and truly when Feyther do go to church I be always shamed he never knows
where to fin the collect -- never -- I Am sure it be not my fault, he be so full
of prodigality -- never son set Feyther better example than I does mine; what
can I do more for 'un? it would not be becoming in me to leather Feather, would
it, Jessy.


Jessy. Here he comes, I Will return to my garden -- to converse with him is to
me dreadful; for, while my breast rises with indignation at his conduct as a
man, it sinks again in pity for the misfortunes of a parent.


Frank. Now that is just like I -- I feels as if I should like to lick 'un, and
cry all the time -- But what will be the end on it, Jessy?


Jessy. Ruin, inevitable ruin!

(despondingly).
Frank. Well don't thee be cast down -- thee knows I be cruel kind to thee; at
meals I always gis thee the desperate nice bits, and if thy lover prove false
hearted, or Feyther should come to decay, I be a terrible strong lad, I Will work
for thee fra sunrise to down, and if any one offer to harm thee, I Will fight for
thee till I die.


Jessy. Thanks, my good lad! thanks, dear brother.


Kisses him, and exit. Frank. As nice a bit of a sister that, as in all country
round.


Enter FARMER OATLAND (dressed in a compound of rusticity and fashion. Oatld.
(singing.) Ba viamo tutti tra. -- Dom it, this be what I call loife! Have you
sold the wheat?


Frank. Ees.


Oatld. How much?


Frank. Two load -- Six and twenty pound.


Oatld. (yawning.) Exactly the trifle I lost last night.


Frank. What?


Oatld. Take it to the Nabob's gentleman.


Frank. I were going Feyther, to the castle, to ge it to Sir Hubart's steward
for rent.


Oatld. Rent, you bore! That for Sir Hubert. (snapping his fingers). Ah,
Nabob's servants be the tippy. -- Every thing be done by them so genteelly.


Frank. Ecod you be done by them genteelly enough; I be sure that house have
brought the country round to ruination. Before this Nabob came here wi' all his
money and be domn'd to 'un, every thing were as peaceable and deceant as never
was; -- not a lawyer within ten miles; now there be three practicing in
village; and what is ameast as bad, there be three doctors; and the farmers so
consated, drive about in their chay carts, eat lump sugar every day, and
gi'balls.


Oatld. To be sure.


Frank. And what is the upshot? why that they jig it away to country jail.


Oatld. Tezez vous! Let me see -- Great cassino be ten o diamonds. Well then, I
play --


Frank. Play! ecod, if you go on so, you mun work though.


Oatld. Next, I must take care of the speads.


Frank. No, Feyther, a spade mun take care of you; By gol, here be Mr. Heartly,
Sir Hubert's steward, now don't you be saucy to un, Feyther; -- now do behave
thyzelf -- now that is a man, Feyther, do.


Clapping him on the back. Enter HEARTLY. Heartly. Good day, Farmer Oatland;
how do do, honest Frank?


Frank. Desperate pure, thank ye, sur.


Heartly. Well, farmer, once more I have called respecting your arrear of rent
-- Three hundred pound is a long sum.


Frank. Three hundred pound.


Heartly. And unless it be immediately discharged, Sir Hubert is resolved to --


Oatld. That for Sir Hubert -- He shall have his rent -- Frank, send your
sister Jessy to the Nabob's, he will let me have the money.


Frank. No! I will not -- What business have sister at such a desperate prodigal
place. Na, na, I Will go myzelf.


Heartly. You are in the right, honest Frank.


Frank. Yes, sur, I always am.


Oatld. Ugh! you vulgar mongrel -- Well, desire the Nabob's gentleman to desire
the Nabob to let me have three hundred pounds.


Frank. He will not gi' thee a brass farthing.


Oatld. Sir Hubert shall have his money -- Ha! ha! ha! my notion is, he wants
it sad enough, ha! ha!


Heartly. Sirrah!


Frank. Don't you mind 'un, sur, don't ye, he be's intosticated. Dong thee
behave thyself.


(with sorrow and vexation. Oatld. Silence, you hound! and obey! -- Bon jour,
Mr. Steward, -- I Will to bed -- 'Pon honor, I must cut champagne, it makes me so
narvous -- Sir Hubert shall have his money, let that satisfy, -- Follow me, cur.


Exit into the house. Heartly. Sad doings, Frank.


Exit. (FRANK shakes his head and follows OATLAND SCENE II -- A Room in the
Nabob's house
Enter ELLEN VORTEX, meeting BRONZE. Ellen. Good Mr. Bronze, have you been at
Sir Hubert Stanley's?


Bronze. Yes, ma'am.


Ellen. Is Charles Stanley arrived?


Bronze. No, ma'am; but he is hourly expected.


Ellen. Do they say he is well -- quite recovered?


Bronze. I don't know, ma'am -- upon my soul -- I beg pardon, but really the
Baronet's house is horrid vulgar, compared to your uncle's, the Nabob's here; I
peeped through my glass into an old hall, and beheld fifty paupers at dinner,
such wretches! and the Baronet himself walking round the table to see them
properly fed. -- How damned low! -- Ugh! I would bett a rump and dozen our
second table is more genteelerer than Sir Hubert's own -- but I must away, for
we expect the rich Miss Vortex -- I beg pardon; but your name and the Nabob's
daughter being the same, we call her the rich, to distinguish --


Ellen. And you do wisely -- no term of distinction could possibly be more
significant or better understood by the world, than that you have adopted.


Bronze. Hope no offense, ma'am.


Ellen. None, Bronze, go in. --


Bronze. The last man on earth to offend a fine woman.


Exit. Ellen. The rich Miss Vortex -- most true. -- But now my dear Charles
Stanley is returned, I claim the superior title of the Happy. Oh! Charles, when
we parted last at Spa; how great the contrast; thy animated form was imprisoned
in the icy fetters of disease; thy pale and quivering lip refused a last adieu;
-- But ah! a smile that seemed borrowed from a seraph who waited to bear thee
up to Heaven, swore for thee everlasting love. That smile supported me in
solitude, -- but to solitude I have now bade adieu, and to be near the lord of
my heart, have again entered this house, the palace of ruinous luxury and
licentious madness; but here comes its whimsical proprietor.


Enter Mr. VORTEX with a paper in his hand, attended by black and white
servants. Vortex. Sublime! -- oh, the fame of this speech will spread to
Indostan. Eh! -- don't I smell the pure air in this room? Oh! you villains!
would you destroy me, throw about the perfumes for legislative profundity; for
fancy and decoration, -- it is a speech. --


Ellen. What speech is it, Sir?


Vortex Ah! Ellen -- why my maiden speech in Parliament -- it will alarm all
Europe -- I Will speak it to you. --


Ellen. No, my dear uncle, not just now -- I hear you have been ill.


Vortex. Oh! very -- a strange agitation at my heart, and such a whizzing and
spinning in my head --


Ellen. I hope you have had advice? --


Vortex. Oh, yes, I Have had them all. -- One physician told me it was caused by
too brilliant and effervescent a genius; -- the next said, it was the scurvy;
-- a third, it proceeded from not eating pepper to a melon; -- another had the
impudence to hint it was only little qualms that agitated some gentlemen who
had made fortunes in India; -- one recommended a sea voyage, -- another a
flannel nightcap; -- one prescribed water, -- the other brandy; but, however
they all agreed in this essential point, that I Am not to be contradicted, but
have my way in every thing.


Ellen. An extremely pleasant prescription, certainly. But under these
circumstances do you hold it prudent, uncle, to become a parliamentary Orator?
I believe a little gentle contradiction is usual in that House.


Vortex. I know it -- but if you will hear my speech, you will see how I manage
-- I begin -- Sir --


Enter Servant. Serve. Your daughter, sir, is arrived from Town.


Ellen. Thank you cousin for this relief. --


Aside. Vortex. Zounds! I Am not to be interrupted.


Serve. She is here, sir.


Enter Miss VORTEX. Miss Vor. My dear Nabob, uncommon glad to see you. Ah!
Ellen; what, tired of seclusion and a cottage?


Ellen. I hope, cousin, I am welcome to you.


Miss Vor. Certainly; you know we are uncommon glad to see any body in the
country -- but, my dear Nabob, you don't inquire about the opening of our
townhouse.


Vortex. I was thinking of my speech.


Miss Vor. The most brilliant house-warming -- uncommon full, above a thousand
people -- every body there.


Ellen. Pray, cousin, do you then visit every body?


Miss Vor. Certainly, they must ask me.


Ellen. Must! I should imagine that would depend on inclination.


Miss Vor. Inclination! psha! I beg your pardon; but you are really uncommon
ignorant my dear. They must ask me, I tell you. -- Now suppose a Duchess rash
enough to shut me from her parties; -- very well. -- She names a night. -- I
name the same, and give an entertainment greatly surpassing here is in splendor
and profusion. -- What is the consequence? -- why, that her rooms are as
deserted as an Ex-minister's levee, and mine crammed to suffocation with her
Grace's most puissant and noble friends. -- Ha! ha! my dear Ellen, the court of
St. James's run after a good supper as eagerly as the court of Aldermen. -- Ha!
ha! your being in this country, Nabob, was thought quite charming. -- A host
not being at home to receive his guests is uncommon new and elegant, is not. --
Here we improve, my dear, on ancient hospitality -- those little memorandums,
Nabob, will give you an idea of the sort of thing.


Vortex. (Reads.) "March." -- Oh! that is a delightful month, when Nature
produces nothing, and every thing is forced. -- Let me see -- " 50 quarts of
green peace at five guineas a quart," -- that was pretty well: -- "500 peaches"
-- at what? -- " a guinea each." -- Oh! too cheap.


Miss Vor. It Is very true; but I assure you I tried every where to get them
dearer, but could not.


Vortex. And I suppose the new white satin furniture was all spoiled.


Miss Vor. Oh! entirely -- and the pier glasses shivered to pieces so
delightfully.


Vortex. Well, I hope you had the whole account put in the papers?


Miss Vor. Certainly, else what would have been the use of giving the fete.
Then the company; such charming eccentricity, such characters out of character.
-- We had a noble Peer bowing for custom to his shop, and an Alderman turning
over the music leaves for the celebrated Soprano; an Orator's lady detailing
her hnsband's three hours speech in Parliament, and the Orator himself
describing how puppets are managed at the Fantoccini; we had grandmothers
making assignations with boys, and the children of Israel joining the host of
Pharaoh. -- Oh! my dear Miss Vortex, why don't you partake in these charming
scenes?


Ellen. My dear Miss Vortex, six suppers would annihilate my fortune.


Miss Vor. Oh true, I forgot your uncommon small fortune. But I don't think it
much signifies. I swear, people of fashion in town seem to do as well without
money, as with it. You might be successful at play. There are points to be
learnt, which certainly do not give you the worst of the game. Come, will you
be my protegee?


Ellen. Excuse me, coussn, I dare say I ought to be covered with blushes, when
I own a vulgar detestation of the character of a female gamester, and I must
decline the honor of your introduction to the haut ton till at least they have
justice on their side.


Miss Vor. An uncommon odd girl, Nabob.


Ellen. Heavens! to what state of abject degradation must fashionable society
be reduced, when officers of police are as much dreaded by ladies in the
purlieus of St. James's, as they are by cut purses in the wretched haunts of
St. Giles.


Miss Vor. For shame, Ellen, to censure your own sex.


Ellen. No, madam, I am its advocate, and in that sex's name protest an
abhorrence of those women, who do not consider any thing shameful but to be
ashamed of any thing; whose resemblance to nature and innocence exists but in
their nakedness, and to whom honor is only known as a pledge at a gaming table.


Exit. Miss Vor. Did you ever hear, Nabob?


Vortex. I did not hear a word she said; I was thinking of my speech.


Miss Vor. A pert, Gothic, low-bred creature! But her contemptible fortune
suits uncommon well with her grovelling ideas.


Vortex. Don't talk of her fortune, it always makes my poor head worse. You
know at the time I gave her five thousand pounds in lieu of what I called her
expectations, I had in my hands an enormous sum of here is. O dear! I Am afraid
the doctor was right -- ah! mine are certainly East India qualms -- I wonder if
giving her fifty thousand back again would do my heart any good.


Miss Vor. What! my dear Nabob? I declare you quite shock me.


Vortex. Oh conscience!


Miss Vor. Conscience! he! he! a thing so uncommon vulgar, a thing so
completely chausseed; besides, yon know very well it is absolutely impossible
to exist under 20,000l. a year.


Vortex. That Is very true.


Miss Vor. Some people certainly do contrive to grub on with ten thousand, but
how they do it is to me miraculous; then think of your intention of marrying me
to the son of your great rival the baronet; think of his borough.


Vortex. Ah! very true. -- Conscience avaunt; I have made a motion on matrimony
to Sir Hubert.


Miss Vor. And young Stanley's arrival; Oh! what a sweet youth!


Vortex. Oh! what a sweet borough interest! But I am glad your heart is
interested.


Miss Vor. Heart interested! Lud, how can you suspect me of so uncommon vulgar
a sensation. I trust my joy is occasioned by ideas more becoming a woman of
fashion. -- I am charmed because his fortune is large, his family ancient; and
because my marriage will render all my female friends so uncommon miserable;
and because I suspect that Ellen met young Stanley at Spa, and that she dares
aspire to --


Vortex. I wish she were out of the house.


Miss Vor. No -- she shall stay to witness my triumph.


Vortex. Shall stay. -- I Am not to be contradicted, you know -- my physicians
--


Miss Vor. Certainly not, my dear Nabob; but I may recommend; I Am sure no
physician would object to your taking advice. Ah! does Ellen love you as I do?
-- will she listen to your speech as I intend to do? -- would she throw away
thousands for you in a night, as I do?


Vortex. Very true! very true!


Exeunt. SCENE III. -- A Pleasure Ground, and View of an ancient Castle.
Enter four Servants dressed in old fashioned liveries, then Sir HUBERT STANLEY
and HEARTLY. Sir Hub. Good Heartly, is all prepared for my boy's reception, his
favorite study on the southern battlement? -- Are his dogs trained -- his
hunters well conditioned?


Heart. To say truth, Sir Hubert, the castle has been all day in quarrel, each
servant claiming the right of exclusive attendance on his dear young master.


Sir Hub. I thank their honest loves. He writes me he is well, good Heartly;
quite well. -- Ha! the village bells proclaim my boy's arrival. -- Do thou
hear the people's shouts?


Heart. Aye, and it revives my old heart.


Sir Hub. These welcomes are the genuine effusions of love and gratitude. --
Spite of this Nabob's arts, you see how my loving neighbors respect me.


Enter Servant. Where is my boy?

Serve. Not yet arrived, sir.


Sir Hub. No!


Serve. These rejoicings are for the Nabob's daughter, who is just come from
London.


Sir Hub. Indeed! (pecvishly) Well, well.


Serve. My young master will alight privately at Oatland farm, and walk through
the park.


Exit. Sir Hub. The Nabob's daughter? -- Well, let it pass. -- Heartley, what
said farmer Oatland?


Heart. Nothing but what profligacy and insolence dictated -- he desied your
power, and sent to the Nabob.


Sir Hub. Ungrateful man! let a distres be issued. -- Hold; no, no.


Heart. Indeed, Sir Hubert, he is undeserving your lenity. -- Besides, sir,
your mortgagee, Mr. Rapid, the wealthy tailor, will be here today -- the
interest on the mortgage must be paid -- some of your election bills remain
unliquidated, and I fear without a surther mortgage --


Sir Hub. Don't torture. Pardon me, good old man.


Heart. Truly, Sir Hubert, what might have been effected with 5000 l, some
years ago, will now require ten -- you must retrench your hospitable
benevolence.


Sir Hub. My worthy steward, my head has long acknowledged the truth of your
arithmetic -- but my head could never teach it to my heart.


Heart. And, sir, you may raise your rents.


Sir Hub. Never, Heartley. -- never. -- What! shall the many suffer that I may
be at ease! -- But away with care -- this is a moment devoted to ecstasy -- this
is the hour a doting father is to clasp an only child, who, after combating
with disease and death, returns triumphant to his arms in lusty health and
manhood. -- Ah! he approaches; it is my boy -- Do thou not see him in the
beechen avenue. -- Dull old man, advance thine hand thus, -- (putting his hand
over his forehead) -- See how his eyes wander with delight, and renovate the
pictures of his youth. -- Ah! now he sees his father, and sties like lightning.


Enter CHARLES STANLEY -- (kneels). Charles. My honored -- my loved father!


Sir Hub. Rise to my heart. -- Stand off, and let my eyes gloat upon thee --
thou art well -- Thy arm, good Heartley. -- Nay, do not weep, old Honesty,
'twill infect me.


Charles. Ah! my excellent old friend -- in health I hope?


Heart. Aye, good master, and this day will make me young again.


Charles. Dear father, already must I become a suitor to you. -- Passing
Oatland farm, I found his lovely daughter Jessy in tears, occasioned by her
father's inability to pay his rent. I dried them with a promise -- (Heartley
shakes his head, and Sir Hubert averts his face). -- Ha! your brow is clouded
with unhappiness; -- pray, sir --


Sir Hub. Good Heartley, leave us -- (Exeunt HEARTLEY and Servants.) --
Charles, so mixed is the cup of life, that this day, the happiest thy old
father can ever hope to see, is dashed with bitterness and sorrow, boy. I Have
been a very unthrift to thee.


Charles. Oh, sir.


Sir Hub. Listen to me. -- You have heard how my father kept alive the
benevolent hospitality that once distinguished old England, and I not finding
in modern ethics aught likely to improve either the morals or happiness of
mankind, determined to persevere in the ways of my fathers. Soon after you went
abroad the adjoining estate was purchased by an East Indian, groaning under
wealth produced by groans. Like the viper, after collecting in the warm
sunshine his bag of venom, he came to the abode of peace and innocence, and
disseminated his poison. But mark me -- think me not so unjust, boy, as with
random slander to censure any body of men. No, thank heaven; there are numbers
whom Providence, in addition to the power, has added the will, to render wealth
a blessing to all around them.


Charles. You are ever just and liberal.


Sir Hub. But for this vile exception, this Mr. Vortex, I tell thee, riot,
contention, indolence, and vice succeeded. I struggled against this mischies,
which spurred him on to oppose me in my election. This contest (I trust,
Charlea, you think the dignity of your family demanded it) -- this contest, I
say, obliged me to mortgage my estate to a considerable amount; and I fear,
boy, even that will not suffice. -- Do thou not blame thy father?


Charles. Blame, sir? my fortune, nay, my life is held but to promote your
happiness.


Sir Hub. Glorious boy! then all will be well again -- thy estate restored, thy
wealth enlarged


Charles. How?


Sir Hub. By marriage, Charles. --

(Charles averts his face with dejection.)
Charles. Marriage, sir! -- To conceal the passion that triumphs here were but
to deceive a father, and injure the bright excellence I love. When I was ill at
Spa, the votaries of pleasure avoided me as the harbinger of melancholy, and I
was despised as a thing passing into oblivion by all but one fair creature. I
obtained an opportunity to thank her for the charitable pity her eye had beamed
on me. Love soon kindled his torch at Pity's altar, for I found in Miss Vortex
such excellence --


Sir Hub. Who?


Charles. Miss Vortex, sir.


Sir Hub. From India?


Charles. The same.


Sir Hub. She that is now proposed for your alliance.


Charles. Is it possible?


Sir Hub. And waits your arrival in the neighborhood.


Charles. Oh! let me haste to her. -- Yet hold! Frank Oatland attends to hear
your determination.


Sir Hub. At present, Charles, I cannot grant your suit. -- (CHARLES beckons in
FRANK) -- Young man, tell your father the law must take its course. When I see
in him symptoms of contrition and amendmert, I may restore him.


Frank. Thank ye, -- thank ye, sur.


Charles. How came this distress to fall on him?


Frank. Why, sur, he went on farmering pretty tightish, didn't he, sur? till he
keep't company wi' Nabob's sarvants; then all of a sudden, he took to the
gentlemen line. I conceats, sur, he did not much understand the trim on it, for
the gentleman line didn't answer at all. I hope your honor bean't angry wi' I
for speaking to young 'Squire; your worship do know I were a bit of a
playfellow wi' un, and we followed our studies together.


Sir Hub. Indeed!


Frank. Ect, sur, we went through our letters -- and a-b, ab -- c-b, eb --
there somehow I stuck, and 'Squire went clean away into abreviation and
abcmination; and then I never could take much to your pens, they be so cruel
small; now a pitchfork do fit my hand so desperate kindly as never was.


Sir Hub. Ha! ha! Come my boy, you will want refreshment.


Exit. FRANK bows, and is going. Charles. What honest Frank, will you not walk
with me to the castle?


Frank. If your honor be so gracious.


Charles. Nay, wear your hat.


Frank. O dear! O dear! what a pity nobody do see I.


Charles. Come, brother student, your hand.


Frank. My hand! Lord dong it, only think o'I.


Exeunt hand in hand. END OF THE FIRST ACT.
ACT II.
SCENE I. A Room in an Inn.
Enter two Waiters with Luggage, meeting Bronze. Is It Wait. Coming Sir.


Y. Rap. (without.) Zounds why don't you come? why don't all of you come, eh!


Brenze. Waiter, who are these people?


Is It. Wait. I don't know, Mr. Bronze. -- The young one seems a queer one -- he
jumped out of the mail, ran into the kitchen, whipped the turnspit into a
gallop, and bade him keep moving; and though not a minute in the house, he had
been in every room, from the garret to the cellar.


2d. Wait. Father and son I understand. -- The name on the luggage, I see, is
Rapid.


Bronza. Rapid! (aside). Perhaps it is my old master, the great tailor, and his
harum-scarum son -- I Will observe.


Is It. Wait. Here he comes, full dash, and the old man trotting after him like a
terrier.


Exeunt. Enter old and young Rapid. Y. Rap. Come along dad -- push on my dear
dad. -- Well, here we are -- keep moving.


O. Rap. Moving! zounds, haven't I been moving all night in the mail coach, to
please you?


Y. Rap. Mail! famous thing, is not it? Je up! whip over counties in a hop, step
and jump -- dash along.


O. Rap. Od rot such hurry scurry doings, I say. Here have I ground my old
bones all night in the mail, to be eight hours before my appointment with Sir
Hubert Stanley, and now I must sit biting my fingers --


Y. Rap. Biting your singers! no, no -- I Will sind you something to do. -- Come,
we'll-keep moving.


Takes his father by the arm, who resisits. Enter LANDLORD. Land. Gentlemen, I
beg leave --


Y. Rap. No prosing -- To the point --


O. Rap. For shame -- don't interrupt the gentleman.


Y. Rap. Gently, dad -- dash away, sir.


Land. A servant of Sir Hubert Stanley has been enquiring for. Mr. Rapid.


Y. Rap. Push on!


Land. And expects him at the castle.


Y. Rap. That will do -- push off -- brush -- run!


Exit Landlord (running). That Is the thing -- keep moving -- I say, dad!

O. Rap. What do you say, Neddy?


Y. Rap. Neddy! dam it, don't call me Neddy. I hate to be called Neddy.


O. Rap. Well, I will not.


Y. Rap. That Is settled -- I say -- what is your business with Sir Hubert? --
Some secret, eh?


O. Rap. (aside.) I will not tell you. Oh no -- a bill he owes me for making his
clothes and liveries.


Y. Rap. Pugh! he is a ready-money man. I never made a bill out for him in my
life -- It will not do.


O. Rap. Well then, sit down, and I Will tell you (they sit). Can you sit still a
moment?


Y. Rap. (jumping up.) To be sure I can -- now tell me briefly -- briefly.


Sits again. O. Rap. (aside.) Indeed I will not -- You must know --


Y. Rap. Aye --


O. Rap. You must know --


Y. Rap. Zounds! you have said that twice -- now don't say it again.


O. Rap. Well, I will not. -- You must know -- it is a very long story.


Y. Rap. (rising.) Then I Will not trouble you.


O. Rap. (aside.) I thought so. And pray what might induce you to come with me?


Y. Rap. (aside.) Will Not tell him of Jessy. -- Oh, as we had given up trade,
left off stitching -- you know my way -- I like to push on -- change the scene,
that is all -- keep moving.


O. Rap. Moving! (yawns). Oh, my poor old bones! Waiter, bring me a nightgown.

(Waiter helps him on with a nightgown -- he lays his coat on a chair).
Y. Rap. What are yon at, dad?


O. Rap. Going to take a nap on that sofa.


Y. Rap. A nap -- pugh!


O. Rap. Zounds! I Have no comfort of my life with you.


Y. Rap. Say no more.


O. Rap. But I will, though -- hurry, hurry -- od rabbit it, I never get a dinner
that is half dressed; and as for a comfortable sleep, I Am sure --


Y. Rap. You sleep so slow.


O. Rap. Sleep slow! I Will sleep as slow as I please; so at your peril disturb
me. Sleep slow indeed!

(yawning).
Exit. Y. Rap. Now to visit Jessy. Waiter!


Waiter. Sar!

(with great quickness).
Y. Rap. That Is right -- sir -- short -- you're a fine fellow.


Waiter. Yes, sar.


Y. Rap. Does Farmer Oatland live hereabouts?


Waiter. Yes, sar.


Y. Rap. How far?


Waiter. Three miles.


Y. Rap. Which way?


Waiter. West.


Y. Rap. That will do -- get me a buggy.


Waiter. Yes, sar.


Y. Rap. Oh, if my old dad had left off business as some of your flashy tailors
to, I might have kept a curricle, and lived like a man. Is the buggy ready?


Waiter. No, sar.


Y. Rap. But to cut the shop with paltry five thousand. -- Is the buggy ready?


Waiter. No, sar.


Y. Rap. Or to have dashed to Jessy in a curricle. -- Is the buggy ready?


Exit. Y. Rap. To have flanked along a pair of blood things at sixteen miles an
hour. (Puts himself in the act of driving, and sits on the chair where OLD
RAPID left his coat -- springs from it again) What the devil's that? Zounds!
something has run into my back. I Will bet a hundred it is a needle in Father's
pocket. Confound it! what does he carry needles now sor? (Searches the pocket.)
Sure enough, here it is -- one end stuck into a letter, and the other into my
back, I believe. Curse it! Eh! what is this? (Reads) "To Mr. Rapid -- Free --
Hubert Stanley." Ha, ha, ha, here is dad's secret -- Now for it! (Reads very
quick). "Sir Hubert Stanley will expect to see Mr. Rapid at the Castle, and
would be glad to extend the mortgage, which is now 50,000l." What Is this?
(Reads again) -- "Extend the mortgage, "which is now 50,000l to seventy." Fifty
thousand! huzza! it is so -- my old dad worth fifty thousand -- perhaps seventy
-- perhaps -- I Will -- no -- I Will --


Enter Waiter. Waiter. The buggy's ready, sir.


Y. Rap. Dare to talk to me of a buggy, and I Will --


Waiter. Perhaps you would prefer a chaise and pair?


Y. Rap. No, I Will have a chaise and twelve. Abscond! ( Exit Waiter.) I must --
I must keep moving. -- I must travel for improvement. First I Will see the whole
of my native country, its agriculture and manufactories. That, I think, will
take me full four days and a half. Next I Will make the tour of Europe; which, to
do properly, will I dare say, employ three weeks or a month. Then, returning as
completely versed in foreign manners and languages as the best of them, I Will
make a push at high life. In the first circles I Will keep moving. Fifty
thousand! perhaps more -- perhaps -- ho!


Waiter. (without.) You cannot come in.


Bronze. (without.) I tell you I will come in.


Y. Rap. Will come in! -- that is right -- push on, whoever you are.


Enter BRONZE. Bronze. I thought so. How do you do, Mr. Rapid? Don't you
remember Bronze, your father's foreman, when you were a boy?


Y. Rap. Ah, Bronze! how do you do, Bronze? Any thing to say, Bronze? Keep
moving. Do you know, Bronze, by this letter I have discovered that my father is
worth -- how much, think you?


Bronze. Perhaps ten thousand.


Y. Rap. Push on.


Bronze. Twenty.


Y. Rap. Push on.


Bronze. Thirty.


Y. Rap. Keep moving.


Bronze. Forty.


Y. Rap. Fifty -- perhaps -- sixty -- seventy -- oh! I;ll tell you. He has lent
50,000l. on mortgage to an old Baronet.


Bronze. Sir Hubert St. --


Y. Rap. (stopping him.) I know his name as well as you do.


Bronze. (aside.) Here Is news for my master! Well, Sir, what do you mean to do?


Y. Rap. Do! Push on -- become a man of fashion, to be sure.


Bronze. What would you say, if I were to get you introduced to a Nabob?


Y. Rap. A Nabob! Oh! some flash-in-the-pan chap.


Bronze. Oh, no!


Y. Rap. What, one of your real, genuine, neat as imported, Nabobs?


Bronze. Yes; Mr. Vortex. -- Did you never hear of him.


Y. Rap. To be sure I have. But will you?


Bronze. Yes.


Y. Rap. Ah! but will you do it directly?


Bronze. I will.


Y. Rap. Then push off -- Stop -- stop -- I beg your pardon -- it cuts me to
the heart to stop any man, because I wish every body to keep moving. But will not
dad's being a tailor, make an objection?


Bronze. No; as you never went out with the pattern-books.


Y. Rap. (sighing.) Oh yes, I did.


Bronze. That Is awkward. -- But you never operated?


Y. Rap. (with melancholy.) What do you say?


Bronze. I say you never --

(describes in action the act of sewing.)
Y. Rap. (sighing deeper.) Oh! yes, I did.


Bronze. That Is unlucky.


Y. Rap. Very melancholy indeed!


Bronze. I have it. Suppose I say you are merchants.


Y. Rap. My dear fellow, sink the tailor, and I Will give you a hundred.


Bronze. Will you? Thank you.


Y. Rap. Now push off.


Bronze. But don't be out of the way.


Y. Rap. Me! Bless you, I Am always in the way.


Bronze. Don't move.


Y. Rap. Yes, I must move a little -- away you go -- (pushes Bronze off).
Huzza! now to awake old dad. (Exit, and returns with OLD RAPID.) Come along,
dad.


O. Rap. (half asleep.) Yes, sir -- yes, sir -- I Will measure you directly --
I Will measure you directly.


R. Rap. He Is asleep. -- Awake!


O. Rap. What Is the matter, eh? What Is the matter?


Y. Rap. What Is the matter! I Have found fifty thousand in that letter?


O. Rap. Indeed! (opens the letter eagerly). Ah! Neddy, have you found out --


Y. Rap. I have -- that you are worth -- how much?


O. Rap. Why, since what is past --


Y. Rap. Never mind what is past.


O. Rap. I Have been a fortunate man. My old partner used to say, Ah! you are
lucky, Rapid. Your needle always sticks in the right place.


Y. Rap. No, not always (shrugging). But how much?


O. Rap. Why as it must out, there are fifty thousand lent on mortgage. --
Item, fifteen thousand in the Consols -- Item --


Y. Rap. Never mind the Items. -- The total, my dear dad -- the total.


O. Rap. What do you think of a plum?


Y. Rap. A plum! Oh, sweet, agreeable, little, short word!


O. Rap. Besides seven hundred and ninety --


Y. Rap. Never mind the odd money -- that will do. But how came you so rich,
dad? Dam'me, you must have kept moving.


O. Rap. Why, my father, forty years ago, left me five thousand pounds; which,
at compound interest, if you multiply --


Y. Rap. No; you have multiplied it famously. It Is my business to reduce it
(aside). Now, my dear dad, in the first place never call me Neddy.


O. Rap. Why, what must I call you?


Y. Rap. Ned -- short -- Ned.


Y. Rap. Ned -- short -- Ned.


O. Rap. Ned! O Ned!


Y. Rap. That will do. And, in the next place, sink the tailor. Whatever you
do, sink the tailor.


O. Rap. Sink the tailor! What do you mean?


Y. Rap. I Have news for you. We are going to be introduced to Mr. Vortex, the
rich Nabob.


O. Rap. You don't say so! Huzza; it will be the making of us.


Y. Rap. To be sure. Such fashion! such style!


O. Rap. Aye, and such a quantity of liveries, and -- Oh dear me!

(with great dejection).
Y. Rap. What Is the matter?


O. Rap. (sighing.) I forgot I had left off business.


Y. Rap. Business! Confound it! Now, pray keep the tailor under, will you? I Will
-- I Will send an express to London (runs to the table).


O. Rap. An express for what?


Y. Rap. I don't know. --


Enter Waiter. Waiter. The bill of fare, gentlemen.


Y. Rap. Bring it here (reads). Turbots -- Salmon -- Soles -- Haddock -- Beef
-- Mutton -- Veal -- Lamb -- Pork -- Chickens -- Ducks -- Turkeys -- Puddings
-- Pyes. -- Dress it all -- that is the short way.


Waiter. All!


Y. Rap. Every bit.


O. Rap. No, no, nonsense. -- The short way indeed! Come here, sir. -- Let me
see -- (reads). "Um -- Um -- Ribs of beef." -- That Is a good thing; -- I Will
have that.


Y. Rap. What?


Waiter. Ribs of beef, sir.


Y. Rap. Are they the short ribs?


Waiter Yes, sir.


Y. Rap. That Is right.


Waiter. What liquor would your honor like?


Y. Rap. (jumping up.) Spruce beer.


Waiter. Very well, sir.


Y. Rap. I must have some clothes.


O. Rap. I Am sure that is a very good coat*


Y. Rap. Waiter! -- I must have a dashing coat for the Nabob. Is there a
rascally tailor any where near you?


Waiter. Yes, sir; -- there are two close by

(Father and Son look at each other)
Y. Rap. Umph! Then tell one of them to send me some clothes.


Waiter. Sir, he must take your measure.


O. Rap. To be sure he must.


Y. Rap. Oh true! I remember the fellows do measure you somehow with long bits
of -- Well -- send for the scoundrel.


Exit Waiter. O. Rap. Oh, for shame of yourself! I Have no patience.


Y. Rap. Like you the better. -- Hate patience as much as you do, ha! ha! --
Must swagger a little.


O. Rap. Ah! I am too fond of you, I am, Ned. Take my fortune; but only
remember this -- By the faith of a man I came by it honestly -- and all I ask
is, that it may go as it came.


Y. Rap. Certainly. But we must keep moving, you know.


O. Rap. Well, I don't care if I do take a bit of a walk with you.


Y. Rap. Bit of a walk! Dam'me, we'll have a gallop together. Come along dad.
-- Push on dad.


Exeunt. SCENE II. -- A Room in Mr.VORTEX'S House.
Enter Mr. VORTEX, ELLEN, and Miss VORTEX. Ellen. Married to Charles Stanley!
You, Madam?


Miss Vor. Yes, I.


Ellen. I Will not believe it.


Miss Vor. Well, I vow that is uncommon comic. And why not, my forsaken cousin?


Ellen. First, madam, I know Charles Stanley would only form so sacred an
alliance where his affections pointed out the object. Secondly, I feel those
affections to be mine.


Vortex. Thirdly, an inconstant swain was a thing never heard of; and, to
conclude, pray peruse that letter --


Ellen. (reads.) Sir Hubert Stanley informs Mr. Vortex that his son embraces
with eager joy the proposals for his marriage with Mr. Vortex's daughter.
(Drops the letter). Then every thing is possible. Oh love!


Vortex. Nay, Don't you abuse poor Cupid -- his conduct has been perfectly
parliamentary. Self interest has made the little gentleman move over to the
other side, that is all

(Knocking at the door.)
Ellen. Heavens! should this be --


Enter a Servant. Serve. Young Mr. Stanley, sir.


Serve. Young Mr. Stanley, sir.


Ellen. My soul sinks within me.


Miss Vor. (with affected tenderness) Upon my honor, my dear, you had better
retire. -- Your agitation. --


Ellen. I thank you, madam (going.) Hold. -- No; -- with your permission I Will
remain

(returns).
Miss Vor. Just as you please. What a triumph! Oh, how uncommon delicious!


Ellen. Now heart be firm!

(Retires from the front of the stage).
Enter CHARLES STANLEY with eagerness, -- starts. Miss Vor. How he is struck!


Vortex. Exceedingly.


Charles What can this mean? (aside). Ma -- mad -- madam -- the confusion that
-- that -- that --


Miss Vor. I must cheer him with a smile.

(During this ELLEN advances to the front of the stage, so as to leave Miss
VORTEX between her and STANLEY.)
Charles. (seeing ELLEN.) Ah! what heaven of brightness breaks in upon me!
Lovely Miss Vortex, can I believe my happiness? Will those arms receive me?
(Miss VORTEX, thinking this a addressed to her, opens her arms; STANLEY rushes
past her to ELLEN.) My Ellen!


Ellen. Oh, Charles, the sufferings my heart underwent this moment, and the joy
it now feels is such, I cannot speak.

( They retire.)
Miss Vor. Nabob! Nabob!


Vortex. What Is the matter?


Miss Vor. The matter! will not you resent this?


Vortex. Oh dear! not I.


Miss Vor. Will you bear an insult?


Vortex. My physicians order me not to mind being insulted at all: nothing is
to provoke me.


Miss Vor. Provoke you! -- If I were a man, I would -- Oh!


Vortex. I don't like his looks, -- he seems a desperate --


Miss Vor. What do you mean to do?


Vortex. Why, as this is a very extraordinary case --


Miss Vor. Certainly.


Vortex. I think it best to -- adjourn

( goes up the stage, Miss VORTEX follows).
STANLEY and ELLEN come forward. Charles. I perceive the mistake; but my heart
confessed but one Miss Vortex -- I thought the name, like the superior virtues
you adorn it with, attached alone to Ellen. The embarrassments of my paternal
estate demanded a marriage with a woman of fortune.


Ellen. What do I hear?


Charles. Why this alarm?


Ellen. Alarm! Must not those words terrify which separate me from you for ever?


Charles. What means my Ellen?


Ellen. Oh, Stanley, hear me. On my return to England, Mr. Vortex, to whom the
care of my property was entrusted, was ever pressing on my mind the difficulty
of recovering my father's India possessions. Each messenger that arrived from
you, confirmed the melancholy tale, that my Stanley was sinking into an early
grave. Oh! what then was fortune or the world to me? I sought out solitude, and
willingly assigned to Mr. Vortex what he called my expectations, for five
thousand pounds.


Charles. Yet you shall be mine.


Ellen. No, Charles, I will not bring you poverty. I Will return to solitude, and
endeavor to teach this lesson to my heart, "That it will be joy enough to know
that Stanley is well and happy."

(Going).
Charles. Stay, Ellen -- think deeply before you consign the man that loves you
to certain misery.


Ellen. True -- in a few hours let me see you again. The opposing agitations my
mind has suffered unfit me for further conversation.


Charles. In a few hours, then, you will allow me to see you?


Ellen. Allow you to see me! -- Oh! Stanley, farewell!


Exit. Mr. and Miss VORTEX come forward. Miss Vor. Now speak.


Vortex. We had better pair off.


Miss Vor. No -- speak with spirit.


Vortex. I will. -- Sir, I cannot help saying, that every man, that is, every
man of honor --


Miss Vor. That Is right! -- say that again.


Vortex. That every man of honor --

(raising his voice).
Charles. Well, sir?


Vortex. It -- is -- the -- the -- best judge of his own actions.


Charles. I perfectly agree with you -- and wish you a good morning.


Exit. Miss Vor. So, then, I Am to be insulted, despised and laughed at, and no
duel is to take place -- nobody is to be killed -- my tender heart is to feel
no satisfaction --

(weeps).
Vortex. I fight! -- Do you consider the preciousness of a legislator's life?


"A county suffers when a Member bleeds."

Enter BRONZE. Bronze Oh, sir, such news!


Vortex. What, is Parliament convened?


Bronze. No, sir; but I have found out that the Baronet is --


Vortex. What of him?


Bronze. Ruined!


Miss Vor. (drying her eyes.) Well! that is some satisfaction.


Bronze I met at the inn the Mr. Rapid's, merchants I formerly lived with, who
have a large mortgage on his estate, and he wants to borrow more -- So, sir, I
told them I was sure my master would be proud to fee them at Bangalore-Hall,
because I thought, sir. --


Vortex. I know -- I have it. I Will show them every attention; and if I can but
get hold of the mortgage, I Will --


Miss Vor. Oh! uncommon charming!


Vortex. ( to Miss VORTEX.) Now do you go and write a note, and say we will
wait on them. -- Ah! use policy instead of pistols, and I would fight any man
-- for, as I say in my speech, "Policy, Mr. Speaker, is -- "


Miss Vor. Exactly, Nabob -- but I must write the letter, you know. Is the
young merchant handsome?


Bronze. Yes, madam.


Miss Vor. So much the better.


Exit. Vortex. You see, Bronze, the turn I give it is this -- "Policy, Mr.
Speaker, says I -- "


Bronze. Very true, sir; but I believe my mistress calls -- I attend you, madam.


Exit. Vortex. Confound it! Will nobody hear my speech? then I Will speak it to
myself. -- "Policy, Mr. Speaker -- "


Enter FRANK. Frank. How do you do, sur?


Vortex. What! interrupted again! -- Approach, don't be afraid.


Frank. Lord, sur, I bean't afeard; Why should I; -- I defies the devil and all
his works.


Vortex. If this be what is called rough honesty, give me a little
smooth-tongu'd roguery. I don't know you, fellow!


Frank. Ees, sur, you do -- I be's Frank Oatland.


Vortex. Begone! I know notning of you.


Frank. Ees, sur, you do -- I Have a bit of a sister crll'd Jessy.


Vortex. Eh! ah!


Frank. (aside.) Dom um, he knaws me well enough now.


Vortex. Oh! very true -- Frank Oatland, aye! Well, good Frank, how is Jessy?


Frank. Charming, sur! charming!


Vortex. Aye, that she is, lovely and charming, indeed! (aside) -- And how are
you, Frank?


Frank. I be's charming too, sur!


Vortex. But why don't Jessy visit my people here? I should be always happy to
see her.


Frank. Should you, sur? Why, if I may be so bold as to ax, why, sur?


Vortex. Because -- because -- she is -- a -- farmer Oatland's child.


Frank. So be I, sur. How comes it, then, that you never axes I to your balls
and ostentations? I can dance twice as long as sister can.


Vortex. Cunning fellow this! -- I must buy him. Well, Frank, what are your
commands?


Frank. Why, sur, Feyther do command you to lend him three hundred pounds --
no, sur, I mean he supplicates.


Vortex. Three hundred pounds?


Frank. I Will tell you, sur, all about it. -- You know, sur, Feyther have been
knuckled out of a most cruel sight of money by you at weagering and cards.


Vortex. By me, fellow! Do you think I associate with such reptiles?


Frank. Ecod, it was either you or the other gentleman.


Vortex. The Other gentleman!


Frank. I dan't know which be which, not I. -- There be two of you.


Vortex. Two of us!


Frank. Ees; there be you -- that be one; -- and there be your gentleman -- he
do make the pair.


Vortex. The pair! -- And have I been buying a hundred thousand pounds worth of
respect for this? Have I become a Member to pair off with my valet?


Frank. Ecod, and a comical pair you be! -- The Other gentleman be a tightish,
conceated sort of a chap enough; but you be a little -- he! he!

(smothering a laugh).
Vortex. Upon my soul, this is very pleasant -- You are quite free and easy.


Frank. Quite, sur; quite. Feyther do tell I it be all the fashion.


Vortex. He does! -- Then you may tell Feyther, that if he has lost his money
at play, the winners will not give him sixpence to save him from starving, that be
all the fashion. -- By their distress the pretty Jessy will be more in my
power, and then I can reinstate them in a farm upon terms (aside). Go, fellow!
I shall not send your Father sixpence.


Frank. The words I told um -- the very words I told um. -- Says I -- "Feyther,
he bean't the man will gi' thee a brass farthing. Dong it, he hasn't it here,
says I"

(laying his hand upon his heart).
Vortex. You said so, did you?


Frank. Ees -- so you see, sur, what a desperate cute laid I be.


Vortex. (aside.) I Will set a trap for you, you dog -- I Will have you in my
power, however; I Will drop my purse -- he will take it -- and then -- (drops his
purse) -- A pair of us! I Will lay you by the heels, desperate cute as you are.


Exit. Frank. Poor Feyther, poor Sister, and poor I! Feyther will go
brokenhearted, for sartain; -- and then sister Jessy's coming to labor. -- I
cannot bear the thought on it. Od dom thee! if I could but get hold of some of
thy money, I Would teak care thee should not get it again. -- Eh! (sees the purse,
walks round it). Well, now, I declare that do look for all the world like a
purse. How happy it would make poor Feyther and Sister! I conceats there would
be no harm just to touch it; -- (takes it up 0 with caution;) -- it be cruel
tempting. Nobody do see I. -- I wonder how it would feel in my pocket (puts it
with fear into his pocket). Wouns! how hot I be! Cruel warm to be sure. Who Is
that? Nobody. -- Oh! I -- I -- l-u-d, lud! and I have gotten such a desperate
ague all of a sudden, -- and my heart do keep j -- jump -- jumping. -- I
believe I be going to die (falls into a chair). Eh! -- Eh! -- Mayhap it be this
terrible purse. Dom thee, come out (throws it down. -- After a pause) Ees, now
I is better. -- Dear me, quite an alteration. -- My head doant spin about soa,
and my heart do feel as light, and do so keep tittuping, tittuping, I cannot
help crying.


Enter VORTEX. Vortex. Now I have him. -- (Sees the purse). What, he has not
stole it, though his own Father's in want! -- Here Is a precious rascal for you!


Frank. Mr. Nabob, you have left your purse behind you (sobbing); and you ought
to be asheamed of yourself, so you ought, to leave a purse in a poor lad's way,
who has a Feyther and a Sister coming to starving.


Vortex. My purse! True; reach it me.


Frank. Noa, thank you for nothing. -- I Have had it in my hand once. -- Ecod, if
having other people's money do make a man so hot, how desperate warm some folks
mun be!


Vortex. Warm, -- foolish fellow! (wiping his forehead, and fanning himself
with his hat). Fugh! quite a Bengal day, I declare.


Frank. Od dang it! how their wicked heads mun spin round!


Vortex. Spin round! I never heard such a simpleton. -- Spin, indeed! ha! ha!
God bless my soul, I Am quite giddy! Oh Lord! Oh dear me! Help! help!


Enter BRONZE. Bronze. What Is the matter, sir.


Vortex. Only a little touch of my old complaint. -- Send that fellow away.

(BRONZE goes up to FRANK.)
Frank. Oh, this be the other gentleman. Sur, I have gotten twenty-six pound that
Feyther lost to you at gamestering.


Bronze. Where is it?


Frank. In my pocket.


Bronze. That Is lucky! give it me.


Frank. Gi' it thee! Ees, dom thee, come out, and I Will gi' it thee

( clenching his fist).
Vortex. Begone!


Frank. Gentlemen, I wish you both a good morning.


Exit. Vortex. (getting up.) What a dunderhead that is! To suppose that a
little tenderness of conscience would make a man's head turn round. -- Pugh!
it is impossible; -- or how the devil would the Lawyers sind their way from
Westminster Hall? Giddy, indeed! Ha! ha! -- Bronze, take care I don't fall.


Exit leaning on BRONZE. END OF THE SECOND ACT.
ACT III.
SCENE I. -- A Room in an Inn.
Enter OLD RAPID with a Letter, and a Servant following. O. Rap. What! a real
letter from the real Nabob! -- Dear me! where is Neddy? -- Make my humble duty
to your master; proud to serve him -- no -- very proud to see him; -- grateful
for the honor of his custom -- no -- no -- for his company. -- I wish you a
pleasant walk home, sir. -- The Nabob coming here directly! Oh, dear me!
where is Neddy -- waiter! --


Exit Servant. Enter WAITER. Do you know where my boy is?

Waiter. Not a minute ago I saw him fighting in a field behind the house.


Enter Y. RAPID -- his coat torn. O. Rap. Fighting! -- Oh, dear! where is he?


Y. Rap. Here am I, dad. --


O. Rap. What has been the matter?


Y. Rap. Only a small rumpus; -- went to peep at the castle, -- pushing home,
-- the road had a bit of a circumbendibus, -- hate corners, -- so I jumped the
hedge, -- cut right across, -- you know my way, -- kept moving, -- up came a
farmer, -- wanted to turn me back, -- would not do, -- tussled a bit, --
carried my point, -- came strait as an arrow.


O. Rap. Fie, fie! -- But read that letter.


Y. Rap. What, the Nabob coming here directly, and I in this pickle. -- Waiter,
are my clothes come home?


Waiter. No, sir.


Y. Rap. Why, the fellow gave his word --


Waiter. Yes, sir; -- but what can you expect from a tailor?


Exit. Y. Rap. That Is very true.


O. Rap. Impudent rascal!


Y. Rap. What the devil shall I do? -- the most important moment of my life. --


O. Rap. It Is unlucky.


Y. Rap. Unlucky! -- it is perdition -- annihilation -- a misfortune that --


O. Rap. I can mend.


Y. Rap. How?


O. Rap. By mending the coat.


Y. Rap. An excellent thought. -- Come, help me off; -- quick. -- quick!


O. Rap. I always have a needle in my pocket.


Y. Rap. (rubbing his back) I know you have.


O. Rap. Now give it me.


Y. Rap. What suffer my father to mend my coat? -- No, -- no; -- not so bad as
that neither. -- As the coat must be mended, -- damn it, I Will mend it.


O. Rap. Will you though? -- Ecod, I should like to see you; -- here is a needle
ready threaded -- and a thimble; -- you cannot think how I shall like to see
you; -- now don't hurry, that is a dear boy.

(YOUNG RAPID sits down, gathers his legs under him -- OLD RAPID puts his
spectacles on, and sits close to him, looking on.)
Y. Rap. Now mind, dad, when -- Damn the needle!

( wrunds his fingers).
O. Rap. That Is because you are in such a hurry.


Y. Rap. When the Nabob comes, -- sink the tailor. --


O. Rap. I will; but that is a long stitch.


Y. Rap. Be sure you siak the tailor; -- a great deal depends on the first
impression; -- you shall be reading a grave book with a melancholy air.


O. Rap. Then I wish I had brought down my book of bad debts; -- that would
have made me melancholy enough.


Enter Isr. and Miss VORTEX, who advance slowly, the Nabob the side where YOUNG
RAPID is, Miss VORTEX to the other side. Y. Rap. I, -- ha! ha! I say, dad, if
the Nabob was to see us now, -- ha! ha!


O. Rap. Ha! ha! True; -- but mind what you're about.


Y. Rap. I Will be discovered in a situation that will surprise -- a striking
situation, and in some damned elegant attitude

(looks up and sees the Nabob).
O Rap. Why don't you sinish the job? -- why don't you?

(sees the Nabob.) -- ( They look round the other way, and see Miss VORTEX;
they both appear ashamed and dejected; YOUNG RAPID draws his legs from under
him.).
Vortex. Gentlemen, -- I and my daughter, Miss Vortex, have done ourselves the
honor of waiting upon you, to --


Miss Vor. But I beg we may not interrupt your amusement; -- it is uncommon
whimsical!


Y. Rup. (recovering himself.) Yes, ma'm, very whimsical, -- I must keep moving
( laughs). Ha! ha! You see, dad, I Have won, -- I Have won, -- ha! ha!


Miss Vor. He says he has won --


O. Rap. (with amazement.) Oh! he has won, has he?


Y. Rap. Yes, you know I Have won; he! he! why don't you laugh?

( aside to OLD RAPID.)
O. Rap. (with difficulty.) Ha! he!


Y. Rap. You see, ma'm, the fact is, -- I had torn my coat; so says I to my
father, I Will bet my bays against your opera box that I mend it; and so -- ha!
ha! ( to OLD RAPID) Laugh again.


O. Rap. I cannot, -- indeed I cannot.


Y. Rap. And so I -- I won -- upon my soul I was doing it very well.


O. Rap. No, you were not, -- you were doing it a shame to be seen.


Y. Rap. (apart.) Hush! -- Ah, father, you don't like to lose.


Vortex. Well, gentlemen, now this very extraordinary frolic is over --


Y. Rap. Yes, sir, -- it is quite over, -- ( aside) thank Heaven!


Vortex. Suppose we adjourn to Bangalore-Hall?


Y. Rap. Sir, I Will go with you directly with all the pleasure in life

( running).
Miss Vor. I believe my curriele is the first carriage.


O. Rap. Dear me!

( looking at Miss VORTEX.)
Vortex. My daughter seems to please you, sir.


O. Rap. What a shape!


Miss Vor. Oh, sir, you're uncommon polite!


Y. Rap. He Is remarkably gallant, ma'am.


O. Rap. What elegance! -- what fashion! -- upon the whole, it is the best made
little spencer I Have seen for some time.

(VORTEX and Daughter in amazement.)
Y. Rap. Oh, the devil! -- The fact is, ma'am, my father is the most particular
man on earth about dress -- the beau of his time -- Beau Rapid -- You know,
father, they always called you Bean Rapid. -- I dare say he is had more suits of
clothes in his house than any man in England.


Miss Vor. An uncommon expensive whim!


Y. Rap. I don't think his fortune has suffered by it.


Miss Vor. ( to OLD RAPID.) Shall I have the honor of driving you?


O. Rap. Oh, madam, I cannot think of giving you so much trouble as to drive me.


Miss Vor. My dear sir, -- I shall be uncommon happy!


O. Rap. Oh, madam!

( simpers and titters to his son, then takes Miss VORTEX'S hand, and trots
off.)
Vortex. We'll follow.


Y. Rap. If you please; -- not that I particularly like to follow.


Vortex. I suppose, sir, now summer approaches, London begins to fill for the
winter.


Y. Rap. Yes, sir.


Vortex. Any thing new in high life? -- what is the present rage with ladies of
fashion?


Y. Rap. Why, sir, as to the ladies; -- ( aside) What shall I say? -- Oh, the
ladies, sir -- why, heaven bless them, sir! they -- they keep moving; -- but,
to confess the truth sir, -- my fashionable education has been very much
neglected.


Vortex. That Is a pity.


Y. Rap. Very great pity, sir.


Vortex. Suppose I become your preceptor.


Y. Rap. If you would be so kind -- I would treasure any little short rule.


Vortex. Why there is a short rule necessary for every man of fashion to attend
to.


Y. Rap. What is it?


Vortex. Never to reflect.


Y. Rap. Never reflect! -- what push on -- keep moving? -- My dear sir --
that is my way -- suits me exactly.


Vortex. Then you must be known.


Y. Rap. To be sure; -- I Will give away thousands in charities.


Vortex. Charities! -- you would be forgot in a week. -- To be known, you must
be mischievous; -- malice has a much better memory than gratitude; -- and then
you must be gallant. -- Are there no pretty gills you should like to be well
with, eh?


Y. Rap. A very extensive assortment, sir.


Vortex. And perhaps there may be a married woman you would like to intrigue
with.


Y. Rap. A very large quantity. -- Oh, how I long to begin! -- Are you married,
sir?


Vortex. Why, no!


Enter Servant. Servant. The carriage is ready.


Y. Rap. So am I; come, sir, -- four horses, I hope.


Vortex. No, sir.


Y. Rap. That Is a great pity. Pray, sir, will you have the goodness to tell
your coachman to drive like the devil?


Vortex. Sir, to oblige you.


Y. Rap. Sir, I Will be very much obliged to you.


Enter Waiter. Waiter. Your clothes are come, sir.


Y. Rap. That Is lucky.


Vortex. Then I Will wait for you.


Y. Rap. Wait for me! nobody needs wait for me -- I Will be with you in a crack
-- Do you push on -- I Will keep moving -- I Will take care nobody waits for me.


Exeunt severally. SCENE II. -- A Room in the Nabob's House.
Enter OATLAND dejected, FRANK and JESSY leading him. Jessy. Be comforted,
Father,


Oat. To see thee brought to service! (sighs) -- I Have done this: -- I that
should have --


Frank. Never mind -- we be young and healthy, and don't heed it -- do us,
Jessy?


Oat. To be ashamed to look my own children in the face! -- I, who ought to
have been the fore-horse of the team, to be pulled along through life by this
young tender thing!


Jessy. Don't despond, Father -- Sir Hubert will see your contrition, and
restore you to his favor.


Oat. When the hen sees the hawk ready to pounce, she gathers her young ones
under her wing -- when misfortune hovers over my sweet chicken here, I leave
her to shift for herself.


Jessy. Come, no more of this.


Oat. Even the savage hawk takes care of its nestlings -- what then am I? --
Children, do you hate me?


Frank. Hate thee! pugh, Feyther, dan't thee talk so -- good bye to thee --
cheer up -- Thee has long been a Feyther to me, now its my turn, and I Will be a
Feyther to thee.


Oat. I cannot speak -- take care of my girl, Frank.


Exit. Frank. Care of her! though she be a sarvant, let me catch any body
striking her, that is all. -- Well, Jessy, we mun not be sheam'd -- I know
poverty be no sin, because parson said so last Sunday. -- Talk of that -- I do
hear that your sweetheart, Mr. Rapid, be worth such a desperate sight of money
as never was!


Jessy (sighs.) If his fortunes are so prosperous, brother, he is exalted above
my hopes -- if his heart be mercenary, he is sunk below my wishes -- Heigh ho!
yet he might have sent to know if I were well, he might -- no matter!


Frank. He be coming to Neabob's here, on a visitation.


Jessy. Ah! coming here!


Frank. Ees -- and Mr. Bronze do say while he be here I am to be his sarving
man.


Jessy. You his servant!

(weeps).
Frank. Don't thee cry, Jessy!


Jessy (recovering herself) I will not; it was weak, it was wrong. -- Frank, be
sure you conceal from Mr. Rapid who you are -- I have reasons for it. -- Edward
here! -- when we meet it will be a hard trial. Yet why should I dread it? --
let perfidy and pride shrink abashed, virtuous integrity will support me.


Frank. That Is right, Jessy, show a proper spirit -- Ecod, if he were to pull
out his purse and to offer to make thee a present of five guineas, dan't thee
take it. -- (JESSY smiles dejectedly.) -- Here be thy new mistress.


Jessy. Leave me.


Frank. Do thou hear? Dom it, dan't thee take it!


Exit. Enter Miss VORTEX. Miss Vor. Oh! my new attendant, I suppose! -- What Is
your name, child?


Jessy. Jessy Oatland, Madam.


Miss Vor. Well, Oatland, (taking out her gloss,) look at me. -- Umph -- not at
all contemptible. -- That Is a charming nosegay -- (JESSY presents it) -- all
exotics, I declare.


Jessy. No, madam, neglected wild flowers -- I took them from their bed of
weeds, bestowed care on their culture, and, by transplanting them to a more
genial soil, they have flourished with luxuriant strength and beauty.


Miss Vor. A pretty amusement.


Jessy. And it seems, madam, to convey this lesson -- Not to despise the lowly
mind, but rather with fostering hand, to draw it from its chill obscurity,
that, like these humble flowers, it might grow rich in worth and native energy.


Miss Vor. Oh! (aside), -- mind -- energy! -- What Is the matter with the poor
girl, I wonder! uncommon odd! -- I hear, Oatland, you are reduced in your
circumstances.


Jessy. Yes, madam.


Miss Vor. That Is very lucky, because it will make you humble, child! -- Well,
and what are your qualifications?


Jessy. Cheerful industry, madam. I can read to you, write for you, or converse
--


Miss Vor. Converse with me! I dare say you can. -- No, thank you, child --
instead of my listening to your voice, you will be polite enough to be as
silent as convenient, and do me the honor of listening to mine. -- Oh! here
comes Mr. Rapid.


Jessy. Ah! (in great agitation); May I retire madam?


Miss Vor. Yes; I shall follow to dress. -- No, stay -- Yes, you may go.


Jessy. Oh, thank you! thank you, dear madam!


Exit, with rapidity. Miss Vor. That poor girl appears to me rather crazy.


Enter OLD and YOUNG RAPID, and VORTEX. Miss Vor. Welcome to Bangalore Hall,
gentlemen.


Y. Rap. Charming house! plenty of room. --


(Runs about and looks at every thing.) O. Rap. A very spacious apartment,
indeed.


Vortex. Yes, sir; but I declare I forgot the dimensions of this room.


O. Rap. Sir, if you please, I Will measure it -- my cane is exactly a yard, good
honest measure -- it is handy -- and that mark is the half yard, and --


Y. Rap. (Overhears, and snatches the cane from him.) Confound it! The
pictures, father -- look at the pictures (pointing with the cane); did you ever
see such charming --


Miss Vor. Do you like pictures?


Y. Rap. Exceedingly, ma'am; but I should like them a great deal better if they
just moved a little.


Miss Vor. Ha! ha! I must retire to dress -- till dinner, gentlemen, adieu.


Exit. Y. Rap. (to his Father) Zounds! you will ruin every thing! -- Cannot you
keep the tailor under.


Vortex. Your son seems rather impatient.


O. Rap. Very, sir -- always was. -- I remember a certain Duke --


Y. Rap. That Is right, lay the seen high, -- push the Duke -- push him as far
as he will go.


O. Rap. I will, I will. I remember a certain Duke used to say, Mr. Rapid, your
son is as sharp as a needle.


Y. Rap. At it again!


O. Rap. As a needle --


Y. Rap. (interrupting him.) Is true to the pole, As a needle is true to the
pole, says the Duke; so will your son, says the Duke, be to every thing
spirited and fashionable, says the Duke. -- Am I always to be tortured with
your infernal needles?

( aside to OLD RAPID.)
Vortex. Now to sound them. -- I hear, gentlemen, your business in this part of
the country is with Sir Hubert Stanley, respecting some money transactions.


O. Rap. It Is a secret, sir.


Vortex. Oh! no -- the Baronet avows his wish to sell-his estate.


O. Rap. Oh! that alters the case.


Vortex. I think it would be a desirable purchase for you -- I should be happy
in such neighbors -- and if you should want forty or fifty thousand, ready
money, I Will supply it with pleasure.


O. Rap. Oh, Sir, how kind! -- If my son wishes to purchase, I would rather
leave it entirely to him.


Y. Rap. And I would rather leave it entirely to you.


Vortex. Very well, I Will propose for it. -- (aside). This will cut Sir Hubert
to the soul. -- There is a very desirable borough interest -- then you could
sit in Parliament.


Y. Rap. I in Parliament? ha! ha!


O. Rap. No; that would be a botch.


Y. Rap. No, no, I was once in the gallery -- crammed in -- no moving --
expected to hear the great guns -- up got a little fellow, nobody knew who,
gave us a three hours' speech -- I got devilish fidgetty -- the House called
for the question, I joined the cry -- "The question, the question," says I. --
A Member spied me -- cleared the gallery -- got hustl'd by my brother
spectators -- obliged to scud -- Oh! it would never do for me.


Vortex. But you must learn patience.


Y. Rap. Then make me a Speaker -- if that would not teach me patience, nothing
would.


Vortex. Do you dislike, sir, Parliamentary eloquence?


O. Rap. Sir, I never heard one of your real downright parliament speeches in
my life -- never

( yawns.).
Y. Rap. By your yawning I should think you had heard a great many.


Vortex. Oh, how lucky! -- at last I shall get my dear speech spoken. -- Sir, I
am a Member, and I mean to --


O. Rap. Keep moving.


Vortex. Why, I mean to speak, I assure you; and --


Y. Rap. Pus^ on, then.


Vortex. What, speak my speech? -- That I will -- I Will speak it.


Y. Rap. Oh, the devil! -- Don't yawn so --

( to OLD RAPID).
O. Rap. I never get a comfortable nap, never!


Y. Rap. You have a devilish good chance now -- Confound all speeches. -- Oh!
--


Vortex. Pray be seated -- ( they sit on each side VORTEX). -- Now we'll
suppole that the chair --

( pointing to a chair) --
O. Rap. Suppose it a chair! why it is a chair, an't it?


Vortex. Pshaw! I mean --


Y. Rap. He knows what you mean -- it is his humor.


Vortex. Oh, he is witty!


Y. Rap. Oh, remarkably brilliant indeed! --

( significantly to his Father).
Vortex. What, you are a wit, sir!


O. Rap. A what? Yes, I am -- I am a wit.


Vortex. Well, now I Will begin. -- Oh, what a delicious moment! -- The House
when they approve cry, "Hear him! hear him!" -- I only give you a hint in case
any thing should strike --


Y. Rap. Push on. -- I can never stand it --


( aside.) Vortex. Now I shall charm them -- ( addresses the chair) -- "Sir,
Had I met your eye at an earlier hour, I should not have blink'd the present
question -- but having caught what has fallen from the other side, I shall
scout the idea of going over the usual ground." -- What! no applause yet? (
aside -- During this OLD RAPID has fallen asleep, and YOUNG RAPID, after
showing great fretfulness and impatience, runs to the back scene, throws up the
window and looks out) -- "But I shall proceed, and, I trust without
interruption" --

( turns round and sees OLD RAPID asleep).
Vortex. Upon my soul, this is -- What do you mean, sir? --

(RAPID awakes.)
O. Rap. What Is the matter? -- Hear him! hear him!


Vortex. Pray, sir, don't blush -- ( sees YOUNG RAPID at the window) -- What
the devil! --


Y. Rap. (looking round.) Hear him! hear him!


Vortex. By the soul of Cicero, it is too much.


O. Rap. Oh, Neddy, tor shame of yourself to fall asleep! -- I mean to look out
of the window -- I am very sorry, sir, any thing should go across the grain. --
I say, Ned, smooth him down!


Y. Rap. I will -- What the devil shall I say? -- The fact is, sir, I heard a
cry of fire -- upon -- the -- the -- water, and --


Vortex. Well, well -- But do you wish to hear the end of my speech?


O. Rap. Upon my honor, I do.


Vortex. Then we'll only suppose this little interruption a message from the
Lords, or something of that sort. --

( They sit, YOUNG RAPID fretful.)
Vortex. Where did I leave off?


Y. Rap. Oh! I recollect; at -- "I therefore briefly conclude with moving an
adjournment" --

( rising).
Vortex. Nonsense! no such thing -- ( putting him down in the chair.) -- Oh! I
remember! "I shall therefore proceed, and, I trust, without interruption. -- "


Serve. Dinner's on the table, sir.


Vortex. Get out of the room, you villain! -- "Without interruption -- "


Serve. I say, sir --


Y. Rap. Hear him! hear him!


Serve. Dinner is waiting.


Y. Rap (jumping up.) Dinner waiting! -- Come along, sir.


Vortex Never mind the dinner.


Y. Rap. But I like it smoking.


O. Rap. So do I -- Be it ever so little, let me have it hot.


Vortex. Will Not you hear my speech?


Y. Rap. To be sure we will -- but now to dinner. -- Come, we'll move together
-- Capital speech! -- Push on, sir -- Come along, dad -- Push him on, dad.


Exeunt forcing VORTEX out. SCENE III. -- An ancient Hall.
Enter Sir HUBERT, leaning on CHARLES STANLEY. Charles. Take comfort, sir.


Sir Hub. Where shall I find it, boy? -- To live on my estate, is ruin -- to
part with it, death. -- My heart is twined round it. -- I Have been the patriarch
of my tribe -- the scourge of the aggressor -- the protector of the injured! --
Can I forego these dignities? -- my old grey-headed servants, too, whose only
remaining hope is to lay their bones near their loved master, how shall I part
with them? -- I prate, boy, but it is the privilege of these white hairs.


Charles. Oh! say on, sir.


Sir Hub. All! all is dear to me! -- these warlike trophies of my ancestors! --
Charles, thou see that goodly oak, 'twas planted at my birth -- Would
thou think it? In the late hurricane, when the tempest humbled with the dust
the proudest of the forest, it bravely met the driving blast -- my people with
shouts of joy, hailed the auspicious omen, and augur'd from it prosperity to me
and mine -- Fondly I believed it -- fondly I thought it. Fie! fie! I dote --


Charles. My father, I doubt not but they augur'd truly. I must to the active
world. Why should I fear that the virtue and independence you have inspired --


Sir Hub. Ah, boy! but while licentiousness and party zeal command the choicest
gifts of fortune, virtue and genius must be content with their leavings.


Enter Servant -- delivers a letter to Sir HUBERT, who reads it with great
agitation. Charles. Ah! what is it shakes you, sir? -- That letter!


Sir Hub. Nothing, my dear boy! -- it is infirmity! -- I shall soon be better.


Charles. Excuse me, dear Sir ( takes the letter and reads). Mr. Vortex, at the
request of Mr. Rapid, informs Sir Hubert Stanley, it is inconvement for him to
advance more money on mortgage. Mr. Vortex laments Sir Hubert's pecuniary
embarrassments -- damnation! -- to relieve which, he will purchase the castle
and estate. -- Sooner shall its massy ruins crumble me to dust. -- Don't
despond, my father: -- bear up!


Enter FRANK, running -- his face bloody. Frank. Oh Sir! -- At Neabob's table
they have even so abusing your father!


Charles. Ah?


Frank. And I Have been sighting --


Charles. Hush!


Sir Hub. What Is his business?


Charles. Oh, sir! ( concealing his agitation) -- My friend Frank consults me
on a love assair; and I must not betray his considence. -- In his hurry he
sell. -- Was Not it so

( significantly)?
Frank. Ees, fur, ees.


Sir Hub. You are not hurt, young man?


Frank. No, fur. -- Thank heaven! my head be a pure hard one.


Charles. Within! -- ( Enter two Servants) Attend my Father.


Sir Hub. My boy, don't stay from me long.


Exit, leaning on Servants. Charles. Now, good Frank, ease my tortured mind. --
What of my father?


Frank. Why, your honor, Mr. Bronze came laughing out of dining room, and
says, "Daame, how the old Baronet has been roasted." So, fur, I not knowing
what they could mean by roasting a Christian, axed. "Why," says he, grinning.
"they voted, that it was a pity the dignity of the bloody hand interfer'd, or
the old beggar might set up a shop."


Charles. What!


Frank. The old beggar might set up a shop.


Charles. Unmanner'd, cowardly babblers.


Frank. And that you, fur, would make a dapper 'prentice.


Charles. I heed not that. -- But, when I forgive a father's wrongs --


Frank. So says I, Domme, if young 'squire had been among them, he would have
knocked all their heads together. Now wouldn't you, fur, have knocked their
heads together? Then they all laughed at me: which somehow made all the blood
in my body come into my knuckles. So says I, "Mr. Bronze, suppose a case --
suppose me young 'squire Stanley -- now, say that again about his honored
father." -- So he did; and I lent him such a drive of the feace -- and I was
knocking all their heads together pretty tightish -- till the cook laid me flat
wi' the poker: then they all fell upon me; and when I could sight no longer, I
fell a crying, and run to tell your honor.


Charles. Thanks, my affectionate lad! -- Return to the Nabob's today.


Frank. I be sartain I shall never do any good there.


Charles. To morrow you shall live with me. I shall dismiss all my servants --
my circumstances require it.


Frank. What! all but me! -- What! I do all the work? -- Lord, Lord, how glad I
be, fur, you cannot afford to keep any body but I.


Charles. Good Frank, farewell -- Hold -- here

( presenting a purse).
Frank (refusing) Nay, prayee, fur, dan't you beheave unkind to me -- I be a
poor lad, that do worship and love you -- not a spy for the lucre of gain --
pray use me kindly, and don't gi' me a farding.


Charles. Frank, I beg your pardon -- Farewell!


Frank. Lord, how glad I be he can only afford to keep I.


Exit. Charles. Insult my father! -- unmanly villain! -- who'er thou art, thy
life shall answer it!


Exit. END OF THE THIRD ACT.
ACT IV.
SCENE I. -- Enter VORTEX, in great terror, reading a letter.
Vortex. Dear me! -- here is a terrible affair! ( reads) Give me up the author
of the slander on my father that was myself -- I never can find in my heart to
give myself up -- or personally answer the consequences -- CHARLES STANLEY. --
Oh dear! since I sind my words are taken down, I must be more parliamentary in
my language -- What shall I do? -- I cannot sight -- my poor head will not bear it
-- it might be the death of me.


Y. Rap. (without.) Huzza, my fine fellows! Bravo!


Vortex. Eh! egad, a fine thought -- Young Rapid is loaded muzzel high with
Champaigne -- I Will tell him he said the words, and make him own them. I Have
persuaded him into a marriage with my daughter; after that, the devil's in it if
I cannot persuade him into a duel.


Enter YOUNG RAPID ( tipsey). Y. Rap. Here I am, tip-top spirits -- ripe for
any thing.


Vortex. How did you like my Champaigne?


Y. Rap. Oh! suits me exactly; a man is such a damned long while getting tipsy
with other wine -- Champaigne fettles the business directly -- it has made me
--


Vortex. Lively, I see.


Y. Rap. Lively -- it has made me like a skyrocket. Well, how did I behave? --
Quite easy, was not I? -- Pushed on -- at every thing -- barred prosing. --
Jolly dogs within -- the fat parson's a fine fellow -- kept the bottle moving
-- said a nice short grace.


Vortex. Well, and did you lose at play the five hundred pounds I let you?


Y. Rap. As easy as could be.


Vortex. That was lucky.


Y. Rap. Very -- particularly for those who won it. --


Vortex. Well, now you will do.


Y. Rap. Huzza! I Am a finished man

(staggering, and strutting about).
Vortex. You only want a quarrel to make you --


Y. Rap. A what? -- A quarrel -- Damme, I Will settle that in two minutes

(running off).
Vortex. Stop. -- You need not go out of the room for that.


Y. Rap. What! will you quarrel with me, eh? -- With all my heart.


Vortex. Me! Oh no! -- I say I could get you such same --


Y. Rap. How, my dear fellow? -- Dash on.


Vortex. Why, at dinner you reflected on the Baronet.


Y. Rap. No, it was you.


Vortex. No, not I.


Y. Rap. Yes, it was you.


Vortex. Well, it might be I; but I don't say it was --


Y. Rap. I. do. -- Push on.


Vortex. Young Stanley has demanded the author. -- Now, if you were to own the
words -- how the newspapers would teem with -- "The elegant Charles Stanley
was called out by the dashing: Young Rapid about some trifle" --


Y. Rap. Bravo!


Vortex. Any thing does for a duel now adays -- the length of a dancer's great
toe -- an election leg of mutton and trimmings.


Y. Rap. Say no more -- I Will do it. By heavens, no man of fashion will be more
infamous -- I mean more famous. -- I Will go write to him directly.


Vortex. First take another bottle of Champaigne. You cannot think what a free
dashing style it will give you.


Y. Rap. I will ( going -- returns.) No, I cannot take up this quarrel.


Vortex. Oh dear! -- Why not?

( alarmed).
Y. Rap. Because I Am sure I Am depriving you of a pleasure.


Vortex. Oh, don't mind me! I give it you, to show my regard for you. --
Indeed, I Have had so much fighting in my time, that with me it really ceases to
be a pleasure -- the sweetest things will cloy -- so the quarrel's yours -- I
wash my hands of it.


Y. Rap. You're a damned good hearted, generous fellow!


Vortex. Then you will return triumphant, and marry my daughter.


Y. Rap. To be sure -- keep moving ( going). I hope he will fight directly. --
Like a sailor, I hate a calm, particularly when an enemy's in fight. -- Hold --
what must we sight with? I can fence.


Vortex. You have no objection to pistols and bullets?


Y. Rap. I like bullets -- they come so quick. But I must push on -- the other
bottle, and then -- I Am a first-rats fellow. -- Champaigne for ever!


Exit. Vortex. You shall have my pistols -- hey've never been used. ( Enter
Miss VORTEX.) Here Is policy. "Crown me, shadow me, which laurels." -- Oh my
dear, I Have achieved two such difficult points!


Miss Vor. How, my dear Nabob?


Vortex. In the first place, I Have persuaded Young Rapid to marry you.


Miss Vor. Was that so difficult?


Vortex. No, no, certainly. But the next will delight you. -- Rapid is going to
have an affair of honor with Young Stanley.


Miss Vor. A duel! and about me!


Vortex. Yes. -- ( aside) I may as well tell her so.


Miss Vor. Charming!


Vortex. Now an't I a kind father, to set two young men fighting about you?


Miss Vor. Ah! that is, indeed, acting like a parent!


Vortex. Egad, I must look after Rapid, though.


Miss Vor. But how did you manage it?


Vortex. By policy, to be sure: for, as I observe in my speech -- "Policy is --
"


Miss Vor. And a very good observation it is.


Vortex. How do you know, till you hear it? -- "Policy -- "


Miss Vor. But pray go to Mr. Rapid

( pushing him off.)
Vortex. "Policy -- "


Miss Vor. Nay, I must insist -- ( Exit VORTEX.) Oh delightful! -- Oatland!


Enter JESSY. I Am in such uncommon spirits, Oatland!

Jessy. May I inquire the cause, madam?


Miss Vor. Certainly. A duel is going to be fought about me.


Jessy. A duel! Horrible thought!


Miss Vor. Sensibility, I now! Too comic, a vast deal! Ha! ha! cottage pathos
must proceed from a source unknown to me, I Am sure!


Jessy. It proceeds, madam, from the heart.


Miss Vor. Umph! -- Let me have no more of it

( sharply.)
Jessy. I beg your pardon -- I forgot the extent of a servant's duty. -- I
forgot that servants have no right to feel pleasure or pain, but as their
employers please; and that suppressing the sensibilities of Nature is
considered in their wages

( sarcastically).
Miss Vor. No doubt of it. -- That Is so very sensibly observed, that I Will
forgive you, Oatland. -- The pride of young Stanley will be so humbled --


Jessy. Is the safety of that noble youth implicated?


Miss Vor. What! -- A lover, I suppose -- came to the farm, I warrant --
attended Miss Jessy in the dairy -- ruffled the cream with his sighs -- talked
of Arcadia, and sipped butter-milk. -- Ha! ha! I should not wonder, after what
I have seen of his taste -- Yes, he is implicated -- I dare say Mr. Rapid will
--

( going)
Jessy. Heavens! Is Edward --

( catching hold of a chair for support).
Miss Vor. Edward!


Jessy. I mean, madam, ( trembling and curtesying,) is Mr. Rapid's life
involved?


Miss Vor. Upon my honor, you seem to have an uncommon sensibility for all
mankind! -- Do you mean to sit down in my presence?


Exit Miss VORTEX. Jessy. No, madam! ( sinks down in the chair). Oh, Edward,
unkind as thou art, how gladly would I resign my life, to save thee!

( weeps.)
Enter ELLEN. Ellen. In tears, Jessy? -- Sweet girl, tell me --


Jessy. Oh, madam! the most dreadful event is about to take place. Mr. Stanley
is engaged in a duel with --


Ellen. Forbid it, Heaven. -- Let us fly to his Father: -- he may prevent it.


Jessy. Alas, madam! I fear he regards not his Father's injunctions.


Ellen. Not regard his Father: -- who, child?


Jessy. Mr. Rapid, madam!


Ellen. Mr. Rapid?


Jessy. Oh!

( hiding her face.)
Ellen. Is it so, sweet Jessy? -- But has he deserved thy love? -- Is he not
unkind?


Jessy. Oh! true, madam! -- But is not his life in danger?


Ellen. We will not lose a moment. -- Let us seek Sir Hubert.


Jessy. I Am very faint.


Ellen. I Will support thee; for in addition to the oppression of our common
grief, thou, sweet girl, must bear the agonizing weight of disappointed love.
-- Come, rest on my arm.


Jessy. Oh, such kindness! -- I cannot speak -- but indeed my heart feels it.


Exeunt, ELLEN supporting JESSY. SCENE II. -- Another Apartment in VORTEX's
House.
Enter YOUNG RAPID, followed by FRANK, who carries Pistols, a Sword, and
Champaigne. Y. Rap. Got the pistols, eh?


Frank. Here they be ( lays them down). -- Your Feather were axing for you, fur.


Y. Rap. My father! -- Should any thing happen -- when I reflect -- Reflect --
Zounds, that will not do. Some Champaigne ( singing) "If a man can then die much
bolder with brandy" ( drinks). I Will write to him, however; -- a few words on a
scrap of paper may cheer him ( takes a letter out of his pocket, and is about
to tear a piece of it off). What! ( reads) "Dear Edward, your faithful Jessy
Oatland" ( strikes his head) -- Jessy Oatland! -- What a scoundrel I am! (
kisses the letter). -- Oh, Jessy, what an infernal pain at my heart! -- More
Champaigne!


Enter Servant. Servant. A letter, sir, from Young Stanley.


Y. Rap. Then the die is cast. -- ( Reads) "You are a scoundrel -- meet me
immediately, or," -- Um, um, a decisive short letter enough. Damn this pain. --
Quick! my pistols! Take them to Stanley Park: there wait for me. -- Oh! Jessy!


Enter OLD RAPID at the back scene. Frank. Ecod, he will kill thee. -- I Will lay
half acrown 'Squire Stanley hits thee the first shot.


Exit FRANK with the pistols. O. Rap. (coming forward.) Pistols -- kill --
Stanley! -- Ned, tell me --


Y. Rap. (aside.) My father here. -- Oh, fir, nothing. -- Come, drink.


O. Rap. Look at me. -- Ah, that agitation! -- Tell me the cause! -- A parent
commands you. -- Your old doting father entreats it!


Y. Rap. (aside.) I must deceive him. -- Sir, l've received an insult that no
gentleman of fashion can submit to.


O. Rap. Gentleman of fashion! -- Need a man resent it?


Y. Rap. Read that letter, and judge.


O. Rap. Lack a day! consider you're only a taylor's son. -- ( Reads) "You're a
scoundrel." -- That Is a hard word. --


Y. Rap. Would you have me submit to be called scoundrel?


O. Rap. No, I would not -- ( with tears). -- Yes, I would.


Y. Rap. Sir, you don't feel like a man.


O. Rap. I Am sure I feel like a father!


Y. Rap. Read on, sir.


O. Rap. (reads.) "And unless" ( wipes the tears away,) "unless" -- I cannot --


Y. Rap. (takes the letter and reads.) "And unless you immediately give me the
satisfaction of a gentleman, expect the chastisement due to a coward."


O. Rap. Chastisement! -- chastisement! -- Coward! ( with irritation). We are
flesh and blood, Ned.


Y. Rap. Would you see me spurned? --


O. Rap. (emphatically, and running into his Son's arms.) No!


Y. Rap. Pray leave me, sir.


O. Rap. Where shall I go? -- What shall I do? -- What will become of me? Oh,
boy, try to avoid it. -- Remember your old father, -- remember his life hangs
on yours. But, Ned -- don't forget you're a man!


Y. Rap. Pray leave me, sir.


O. Rap. I will. -- Farewell, my dear boy, 'twill break my old heart. -- But
remember you're a man, Ned.


Exit. Y. Rap. (alone) So, I Am proceeding full tilt to murder; -- have planted
a dagger in a kind father's heart -- But here goes -- ( fills wine -- throws
away the bottle and glass) -- Its power is gone. Oh -- this infernal pain!
Could I with honor avoid? -- but ( looking at the letter) -- Chastisement!
Coward! -- Damnation! I must push on. Fool! Dolt! Villain that I am!


Exit. SCENE III. -- A retired place in Stanley Park.
Enter Sir HUBERT STANLEY. Sir Hub. What can it mean? -- Charles parted from me
in an agony the ingenuousness of his nature had not art to conceal; -- he
grasped my hand, -- bade me farewell, as if it were for ever, -- then broke
away -- leaving me a prey to wild conjecture and despait; -- soon shall I be at
peace. -- infirmity, when goaded on by sorrow, presses to the goal of life with
double speed -- Surely through that laurel grove, I see two female figures glide
along; my eyes are not of the best, and the sorrow I have felt for my dear boy
has not strengthened them; -- they approach --


Enter ELLEN and JESSY. Ellen. Pardon, Sir Hubert, this intrusion! -- My name,
Sir, is Ellen Vortex.


Sir Hub. Madam, I welcome you as my daughter.


Ellen. Oh, sir! -- the urgency of the moment will not allow me to thank such
goodness as I ought! -- your son, sir --


Sir Hub. Ah! What of him?


Ellen. I saw him pass along, he sled from my outstretch'd arms, -- he was deaf
to my cries; -- even now he is engaged in a duel.


Sir Hub. Ha! ( draws his sword and is running out, staggers, drops his sword.
-- ELLEN and JESSY support him) My functions are suspended! -- Oh nature! do
thou desert me at this moment? -- Who is the villain that has caused it?


Jessy. Ah, my poor Edward!


Sir Hub. Oh that I could rush before my child, and receive the fatal ball in
this old broken heart! -- Perhaps -- dreadful thought! -- even now the deadly
tube is levelled at his manly breast. ( The report of a pistol is heard --
ELLEN sinks into his arms.) Bear up, I cannot support thee. ( Another pistol is
discharged) -- Horrible suspense! -- what a death-like silence!


Ellen. Death! -- Oh, my adored Charles!


Jessy. Ah, my poor Edward!


Frank. (without.) Huzza! huzza! ( enters) Huzza! -- He Is safe -- he is safe. --


All. Who? --


Frank. 'Squire Charles, -- 'Squire Charles, -- Huzza!


( Exit. -- Sir HUBERT folds his hands on his breast in silent gratitude.)
Jessy. Ah, my poor Edward!


Ellen. Your son is safe; -- heard you the words?


Sir Hub. They have shot life through me.


Ellen. Jessy! rejoice with me -- ( Seeing her dejected) Wretch that I am, to
forget thy sorrows! -- Take comfort, sweet girl! -- perhaps --


Enter OLD RAPID, capering. O. Rap. Tol de roll lol -- Safe and sound -- safe
and found -- tol de roll lol. --


Jessy. Who?


O. Rap. My boy Neddy, -- my darling Neddy, safe and sound, -- tol de roll lol.

( Sees Sir HUBERT, and bows respectfully. JESSY and ELLEN talk apart.)
Sir Hub. So, Mr. Rapid! -- How happened this, sir?


O. Rap. Really, Sir Hubert, I don't understand the cut of it; all I can say
is, your son's behavior was -- oh -- supersine; -- when they had fired their
pistols they drew out their swords, and your son disarmed Neddy, and then he
generously gave him his sword again, which was extremely genteel, -- for it was
a brand new silver-hilted sword, and, I suppose by the laws of honor he might
have kept it. --


Sir Hub. Mr. Rapid, why did you break your appointment?


O. Rap. Mr. Vortex, sir --


Sir Hub. Mr. Vortex. -- I fear your son has selected an imprudent preceptor.


O. Rap. Chose a bad pattern you think, sir? -- I am afraid he has --


Sir Hub. Will you, sir, favor me with a few minutes conversation?


O. Rap. You know, Sir Hubert, I Am your faithful servant to command. --


Sir Hub. ( to ELLEN.) Come, let us to our hero. Will you, fair creature,
condescend to be a crutch to an old man? ( takes ELLEN'S arm.) I shall expect
you, sir.


Ellen. Jessy!


Jessy. I follow, madam. ( Exeunt Sir HUBERT and ELLEN.) Do I address the
father of Mr. Rapid?


O. Rap. You do, pretty one!


Jessy. (taking his hand and kissing it.) I beg your pardon; but are you sure
your son's life is safe -- quite safe? --


O. Rap. Yes. -- A very charming girl, I declare! -- I Am very much obliged to
you for taking notice of my Neddy! -- Poor fellow! -- nobody seemed to care
what became of him. -- I Am very much obliged. -- A sweet pretty-spoken creature
as ever I saw! But I must away to the Nabob's, or I shall be too late for the
wedding.


Jessy. Wedding! whose, sir?


O. Rap. Whose! why, my boy Neddy's with Miss Vortex, to be sure!


Jessy. Married! Edward married! It Is too much --

( leans on OLD RAPID for support.)
O. Rap. Eh! what! speak -- tell me!


Jessy. Oh, Edward! is this the return for my love? have I merited this cruel
desertion?


O. Rap. Desertion! -- What! -- has the rascal -- I shall choke myself -- Has
he behaved ill to so sweet a creature? Your tears tell me so -- I Will kill him.
-- He Is my own son, and I have a right to do it -- Your name, your name! pretty
soul!


Jessy. Jessy Oatland. -- The indiscretion of my father has made me a servant.


O. Rap. And the discretion of his father has made him a gentleman -- But I Will
make the rascal know you are not humbled by your Father's conduct, nor is he
exalted by his, a villain! -- Can he hope to be called a man of honor for
opposing his head to a pistol, while himself levels the shaft of anguish at an
innocent woman's heart? -- But I Will kill him, that is one comfort. -- Come with
me, sweet one!


Jessy. Sir, I must attend my mistress -- I am servant to his bride --

( weeps).
O. Rap. I shall go mad! -- Don't cry -- If he, by marriage, will not make you my
daughter -- I, by adoption, will. -- Good bye, sweet Jessy! -- Oh, the rascal!
-- Cheer up? -- the scoundrel! -- Pretty creature! -- The dog! -- What a shape!
-- I Will kill him!


Exeunt severally. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.

H. D. Sit down, sir, done in a moment.


Rap. Well, well; I Am as patient as -- ( Sits -- Enter FRANK at the door, RAPID
jumps up and runs to him). -- Well! -- Speak -- quick!


Frank. Sur -- I -- that is -- she -- no, I went --


Rap. You tedious blockhead -- Is she gone? Is Jessy gone?


Frank. Ees, sur.


Rap. What! left her Father's! -- Where is she?


Frank. I don't know -- that is, I will not tell --


( aside). Rap. What must she think me? What I am -- a rascal.


H. D. Sit down, sir; -- done in a moment.


Rap. Yes, yes; I am as calm as --

( sits.).
Enter Servant. What do you want?

( jumps up again). Serve. Sir, my master and Miss Vortex wait for you.


Rap. Aye, to fulfill that infernal marriage promise. -- Oh, Jessy! ( to FRANK)
What are you at?


Frank. Sur, I were only twiddleing about my thumbs.


Rap. You are always twiddling about your thumbs. What shall I do? Go to them.
-- No, I Will write. -- I want to write.


Frank. Oh, you do?


Rap. I tell you I want to write.


Frank. I Am sure I don't hinder you.


Rap. 'Sdeath! then don't stand there.


Frank. It be all the same to me where I stand --

( moving to another place).
Rap. Thickhead, bring pen and ink.


Frank. Why did you not tell I so?


Exit, and returns with pens and ink. Rap. Oh, this infernal pain! -- A candle
to seal a letter ( Exit. FRANK, and returns with a candle.) -- Zounds! it is
not lighted!


Frank. You didn't tell I to light it.


Rap. Was ever man plague'd with such a hollow-headed ninny-hammer.


Frank. (aside..) May be that be better than a hollow-hearted one!


Enter Servant. Rap. (jumps up.) Well!


Serve. My master has sent you those parchments to peruse.


Rap. (throwing them down.) I wouldn't read them for his estate.


Serve. He will wait on you sir, directly.


Rap. Begone all of you! -- Stop ( to FRANK.) Give me my coat! (FRANK helps him
on with one arm.) -- Bring the glass! -- (FRANK leaves him so, and brings down
a dressing glass.) -- Leave me, dunderhead!


Exit FRANK. Enter VORTEX. Vortex. Bravo, my sine fellow! you fought nobly! --
I say, who sir'd first?


Rap. Never mind, that is past!


Vortex. Well, now I must entrust you with a little secret --

( they sit).
Rap. I have no objection to a little secret.


Vortex. In the first place, then, I Will read this paper.


Rap. No; I Will read it -- I shall read it much quicker. Reads. -- "Received of
Mr. Vortex the sum of five thousand pounds, in consideration of which I assign
over all my right and title to -- hum, um, um -- Signed, ELLEN VORTEX." -- I
understand --


Vortex. Now you must know the father of my niece --


Rap. Jessy Oatland!

( in reverie.)
Vortex. No, her name is Ellen.


Rap. I know it, I know it -- I know it --


( fretfully.) Vortex. Her father died in India.


Rap. With all my heart.


Vortex. With all your heart!


Rap. Zounds! keep moving, will you?


Vortex. Yes, if you will keep still.


Rap. Then be quick,


Vortex. Why I am quick, an't I? -- Died in India, and left her to my care. All
was in --


Rap. Confusion.


Vortex. You are right, all was in confusion. So I prevailed on --


Rap. Jessy Oatland!


Vortex. No, no, Ellen -- to sign that paper; since which, indeed her affairs
have turned out pretty lucky. I purchased this estate with her fortune, which
will be yours, my boy! -- It was a very snug bargain.


Rap. What a horrible thing is the gift of speech!


Vortex. Speech! -- Did you say any thing about a speech? Ah! had you heard
mine out. -- Do you remember how it began? -- "Had I met your eye at an earlier
hour, I should" --

( During VORTEX's narration, RAPID, influenced by the most fretful impatience,
has unconsciously bit, and torn to pieces, the paper given him by VORTEX.)
Rap. (jumping up.) 'Sdeath and sire! is this a time for speeches! Is not your
daughter waiting? -- Is not? -- Oh Jessy!


Vortex. True, another opportunity! But, oh! it is a pretty speech. -- Well, now
give me back the paper.


Rap. The paper!


Vor. Yes, now you have thoroughly digested the contents of the paper, give it
me again.


Rap. Oh! the -- the -- the paper

( sees it torn on the ground.)
Vortex. Yes; that precious scrap that secures us a hundred thousand pounds,
you dog! -- Come, give it me.


Rap. My dear fellow! you gave me no paper.


Vortex. But I did, though.


Rap. Yes, you certainly did; but then -- you -- you -- did not --


Vortex. But I Will take my oath I did! -- Come, give it me directly! -- You -- (
sees the fragments on the ground). Eh! what! -- No; -- yes. -- I Am undone, I Am
ruined. -- Oh, my head! I Am going, I Am going!


Rap. Upon my soul I Am very sorry, but --


Vortex. But what?


Rap. That infernal speech!


Vortex. Oh! ( looking at the scraps of paper) -- Eh, but hold! when he marries
my daughter he will keep the secret for his own sake. Oh dear! I must lose no
time.


Rap. I Am very sorry; I Am sure if hearing your speech will be any compensation
--

( sits down) --
Vortex. No, no, not now -- come with me, all the lawyers are waiting. -- Oh,
pray come!


Rap. I Am coming, but you're always in such a hurry.


Vortex. I Will send my daughter to him -- I must push him. Pray come directly.


Exit in a hurry. Rap. Upon my soul you will break your neck, if you hurry so. Am
I always to have this infernal pain? ( goes up to the glass). Behold a
high-finished rascal at full length. -- Curse me, if I can look myself in the
face.


Enter JESSY. Jessy. (apart.) There he stands! -- Now, heart, be firm. --
Virtuous indignation support me! Sir, my mistress waits for you.


Rap. Don't plague me about your mistress. I Will come by and by. -- ( Turns
round) Heaven and hell! Jessy Oatland!


Jessy. My mistress, sir, waits for you.


Rap. Your mistress! -- A servant! Jessy Oatland a servant! -- A servant to --
and I -- Jessy! my life! -- my soul! -- will you forgive --?


Jessy. Wretch!


Rap. I am. -- I despise myself. -- On my knees -- only listen to me.


Enter Miss VORTEX. Miss Vor. Mr. Rapid!


Rap. (jumping up.) What Is the matter?


Miss Vor. How can you debase yourself -- to --


Miss Vor. How can you debase yourself -- to --


Jessy. How dare he debase me, madam, by offering to an honest heart the
affections of a villain?


Miss Vor. Sir!


Rap. Madam!


Miss Vor. (to Jessy.) Leave the room!


Jessy. (apart.) Now, poor heart! having passed thy pride's probation, retire
to a corner, and break with weeping.


Miss Vor. Sir! what am I to understand?


Rap. That I Am crazy.


Miss Vor. Have I deserved insult?


Rap. Upon my soul, I don't mean to insult you -- I ask your pardon -- upon my
knees

( kneels).
Enter FRANK. Frank. You, fur!


Rap. (jumping up) What Is the matter?


Miss Vor. Well, I Will forgive you if you will come directly.


[RAPID nods and she exits. Rap. What do you want?


Frank. You be's a desperate villain! (RAPID going to strike.) Come, dan't you
do that -- it will not do. -- Poor sister! if you had drawn a harrow across her
heart, you could not have hurt her so.


Rap. Damn't -- I know nothing of your sister! Who the devil is your sister?
you --


Frank. Why! Jessy Oatland!


Rap. What! your sister -- the brother of Jessy my servant? -- Damnation! why
did not you tell me so? to raise my hand against the brother of Jessy? -- I
shall go mad! -- Frank, will you forgive me? I love Jessy -- by my soul I do!
-- And may heaven desert me, if --

( kneels.)
Enter VORTEX. Vortex. Heyday!


Rap. (jumping up.) What Is the matter?


Vortex. (to Frank.) Leave the room! [ Exit FRANK] insult upon insult! -- What
satisfaction --


Rap. I know what you want. Come along; I Will sight you directly.


Vortex. Fight! Nonsense.


Rap. Then I Will ask your pardon.


Vortex. But what the devil's the meaning of all this?


Rap. Why, don't you see I Am mad? -- Stark flaring mad!


Enter YOUNG STANLEY. Stanley. Mr. Rapid!


Rap. (jumping round.) What do you want?


Vortex. Oh! Lord, how fierce Stanley looks at me. Pray come, Mr. Rapid. -- (
To STANLEY) Sir, your most obedient!


Exit, running. Rap. That little fellow will break his neck to a certainty.


Stanley. I have just seen a lovely girl that you have wronged.


Rap. I know I have; and I Will fight you again, if you like it.


Stanley. Could the result benesit Jessy Oatland, I would accept your
invitation.


Rap. The fact is, I am the most unhappy -- the -- What do you charge for
shooting a man? I Will give you a thousand to blow my brains out. I Am the most
miserable dog -- Pray, sir, will you tell me one thing? -- Are you a man of
fashion?


Stanley. I trust I Am a gentleman.


Rap. That Is pretty much the same thing -- an't it, sir?


Stanley. It ought to be.


Rap. Pray, sir, how did you become a gentleman?


Stanley. Simply, by never committing an action that would not bear reflection.


Rap. Can I be a gentleman and an honest man?


Stanley. Can you be a gentleman, and not an honest man?


Rap. Pray, sir, have you always an infernal pain at your heart?


Stanley. No, sir.


Rap. No! Huzza! Thank you! -- By heaven I Will -- Now don't hurry yourself. --
If I don't, may I --

(walks about).
Stanley. Ah! Mr. Rapid, how different are our situations! You, possessing the
love of a most charming and fascinating girl, dash the cup of happiness away.


Rap. May be not, my dear fellow! -- Push on.


Stanley. I, possessing the heart of my dear Ellen, am miserable: because on
account of the narrowness of her fortune, she compels me to abandon her.


Rap. What! The narrowness of her fortune compels --


Stanley. Yes! I say --


Rap. No! Don't say it again. Don't despair, that is all

(nodding.)
Stanley. She has given a fatal paper.


Rap. A paper! -- Yes, I know, I know.


Stanley. And I Am come to take leave of her.


Rap. No, you are not! -- I Will show you such a scene. -- Nay, don't ask me any
questions -- follow me, that is all. -- Wait at the door; and when I cry, Hem!
come in. But don't be in such a hurry. By heavens, the pain in my side is
better already! Huzza! -- Come along! (Going, returns, and runs to the glass
and nods.) How do you do? How do you do? What! you rascal! you can grin again,
can you? Come along; but don't hurry; because, my dear fellow! it is impossible
to do any thing well in a hurry. Come along! but, zounds! never hurry.


Exeunt, RAPID speaking very quick. SCENE II. -- Another Apartment in VORTEX's
House.
Enter JESSY and FRANK. Frank. How be thee now, Jessy?


Jessy. Better. Quite recovered. What passed between you and Edward?


Frank. Why, at first, he were in a desperate passion; but when I told him I
were thy brother, he were so humble, and did ax I; so to forgive un, that I
could say no more to un. Dom it, I could not hit him, when he were down; and
I Have a notion his conscience was pegging him about pretty tightish. He swear'd
he did love thee!


Jessy. Did he, Frank? Did he say he loved me?


Enter Mr. and Miss VORTEX. Miss Vor. What! torn the paper! -- A hot headed --
only wait till he is my husband --


Vortex. Egad, I wish he would come, though --


Miss Vor. Oh! here he is.


Jessy. How my poor frame trembles!


Miss Vor. I vow I feel uncommon discomposed -- Oatland! your arm, child!

( leans on JESSY).
Enter YOUNG RAPID. Y. Rap. Heavens, how interesting! the languor of those
lovely eyes --


Miss Vor. Flattering creature!


Y. Rap. My senses are restored. Oh, will you pardon -- will you again receive
a heart full of love and adoration? --


Miss Vor. What shall I do? -- I must pardon him.


(Miss VORTEX is preparing to speak.) Jessy. Edward! what shall I say? -- your
love has been too long my joy, -- my pride, to be torn from my heart without
many a bitter wound; -- (Miss VORTEX with surprise and chagrin withdraws her
arm from JESSY;) -- but your late conduct has been --


Y. Rap. Detestable? -- But I Am pardoned, your eyes tell me so. Thanks, my
angel! (running to her and kneeling.) I Am so oppressed with joy. -- Ma'am, will
you have the goodness to help me up? --


Miss Vor. Help you up! --


Frank. He! he! he! Gi' me a buss, Jessy! he! he! thee be's a domn'd honest
fellow! ( shaking RAPID's hand.) I Will run and tell poor Feyther -- Now I shall
have a farm of my own! (capering and snapping his singers.) -- Dong it, how I
will work. He! he! he!


Exit. Miss Vor. To be used so twice in one day! -- it is not to be borne. --
Nabob! will not you sight him?


Vortex. No, not I.


Miss Vor. Coward!


Vortex. You Would better be quiet, or I Will convince you I Am none, however.


Miss Vor. He! he! I declare it is so uncommon ridiculous! -- so comic! -- He!
he! -- I Am quite faint with laughing.


Jessy. Shall I assist you?


Miss Vor. No! (resentsully.) I must retire, or I shall expire with laughing!
-- he! he! -- Oh! --


Exit, crying. Enter ELLEN. Ellen. Heaven! what is the matter?


Y. Rap. Allow me to introduce Mrs. Rapid, madam. --


Ellen. Sweet Jessy! -- Sir, I thank you, for giving my heart a pleasurable
sensation which I thought it had for ever taken leave of.


Y. Rap. Bless your heart! perhaps I may tickle it up a little more. -- ( To
VORTEX) Now, stand out of the way, will you?


Vortex. You're quite free and easy.


Y. Rap. My way.


Vortex. You forget it is my house.


Y. Rap. No, I don't; -- you bought it with her money, you know --


Vortex. Umh!


Y. Rap. Mum, now for young Stanley's cue. ( To ELLEN) 'Ppon my honor, ma'am,
any man might be proud to -- Hem -- He does not hear me -- Such beauty! -- such
a shape! such a -- Hem --


Enter CHARLES STANLEY. Vortex. Zounds! he is here again ( getting behind YOUNG
RAPID). What does he want?


Y. Rap. Shall I ask him?


Vortex. Do. -- I Will be very much obliged to you.


Y. Rap. I will. -- I Will manage

( winking and nodding to VORTEX).
Vortex. Oh, thank you!


Charles. Once more, my Ellen! supported by indulgent parent's blessing on our
union, I entreat --


Ellen. Oh Charles! shall I then return your father's goodness by destroying
his hopes for ever? Shall I repay my Stanley's love by inslicting on him penury
and sorrow? In pity, no more!


Y. Rap. -- (to CHARLES STANLEY.) What may may be your business here, sir?


Charles. I came to take leave. --


Y. Rap. Hush! (apart). -- To inquire respecting that lady's fortune. We'll
soon answer all that, will not we?

( nodding to VORTEX.)
Charles. I say, sir --


Y. Rap. (slopping him.) We grant it, -- we grant Mr. Vortex has recovered
property to a considerable amount, but what signisies that? She assigned it for
five thousand pounds! -- You see how I Am going on

( to Nabob).
Vortex. Oh, thank you, my dear friend!


Y. Rap. I Have seen the paper; haven't I? --

( to VORTEX).
Charles. And I should be satisfied --


Y. Rap. You would be satisfied if you faw. it -- Certainly -- very proper --
nothing in nature can be more reasonable; so, Nabob, show him the paper, and
settle the business at once ( walks about, VORTEX following him.). Show him the
paper! -- don't keep the gentleman waiting all day. -- Show him the paper. My
dear fellow! what is the use of walking after me? Show him the paper.


Vortex. (taking advantage of the pauses in the foregoing speech.) I say, my
dear friend, hush! Be quiet! I want to speak to you; you forget you destroyed
it.


Y. Rap. I destroyed it!


Vortex. Hush!


Y. Rap. He says I destroyed it!


Vortex. I did not. -- I Will take my oath I did not.


Y. Rap. And it is true.


Charles and Ellen. What?


Y. Rap. True, upon my honor! He has no more hold on your estates, madam, than
I have.


Charles. (kneeling to ELLEN.) Will you now allow the humble Stanley to destroy
the hopes of wealthy Ellen? Will you permit me to repay your love with penury
and sorrow?


Ellen. Oh, chide on! (raising him) Dear Stanley, my happiness is now complete.


Y. Rap. This is your house, ma'am. I give you joy! -- Sir, I give you joy! --
Nabob, I give you joy!


Vortex. Oh, my head! You villain!


Y. Rap. Don't talk about villainy, -- it will make you worse. Sit down, my
dear fellow!


Charles. He Is justly punished for the falsehood of the story he told.


Y. Rap. I say, he is justly punished for the length of the story he told.


Charles. Mr. Rapid, in expressing my obligations, allow me to be --


Y. Rap. Not more than a minute, I entreat.


(OLD RAPID and SIR HUBERT without.) O. Rap. Where is he?


Sir Hub. Be patient.


O. Rap. I will not. -- Let me come at him.


Enter OLD RAPID and SIR HUBERT. Jessy. (YOUNG RAPID and JESSY kneel.) Your
blessing, sir!


O. Rap. What? Oh!

(falls down on his knees and embraces them both.)
Sir Hub. (after talking apart to his son.) Mr. Rapid, by asserting your
character as a man of honor, in rewarding the affections of this amiable
woman, you command my praise; for bestowing happiness on my dear Charles,
receive an old man's blessing.


Y. Rap. Approbation from Sir Hubert Stanley is praise indeed.


O. Rap. Dam'me, there is the son of a tailor for you!


Vortex. What, a tailor?


O. Rat. Yes; and let me tell you, that one guinea honestly gotten by blood
drawn from the singer, is sweeter than a million obtained by blood drawn from
the heart! -- So, take that.


Y. Rap. Well, Nabob, how do you feel?


Vortex. Egad, it is very odd; -- but I declare I feel light and comfortable
since Ellen has got her estate, and I somehow breathe more free. I Have a notion
the last line of my speech is true.


Y. Rap. Come, I Will hear the last line.


Vortex. Why, that the first step toward securing the esteem of others, is to
secure your own.


Y. Rap. Stick to the last line.


Ellen. And, dear uncle, take Sir Hubert Stanley for your physician. Follow his
prescription of justice and benevolence, and my life on it, you will soon thank
me for my recommendation.


Vortex. Well, to show the sincerity of my intentions, allow, me, Ellen, to
present you these parchments, the title deeds of this estate.

(presents parchments.)
O. Rap. I say, Ned, what nice measures they would make!


Ellen. And, sir, allow me to show you the true value of riches -- ( giving
parchments. to STANLEY) -- Convert them into happiness.


O. Rap. Well, I Have only one observation to make.


Y. Rap. I hope it is a snort one.


Jessy. What, impatient again?


Y. Rap. I am; and if I err

It Is you, my generous Patrons, are the cause,
My heart's impatient for your kind applause.

EPILOGUE,
WRITTEN BY M. P. ANDREWS, ESQUIRE. M. P. SPOKEN BY MRS. MATTOCKS.
SHAKESPEARE, a shrewd old quiz, in his dull age,
Said, very gravely, "All the world's a stage."
But if the Poet on our times could drop,
He Would rather own that "all the world's a shop."
"And what is the trade?" exclaim the critic railers
Why, "Men and women all are merely tailors."
Nay, frown not, Beaux; and Ladies, do not pout
You Have all your cuttings in and cuttings out.
And, first, Miss Hoyden, just escaped from school
Slighting mamma, and all domestic rule;
If she on fashion's road should chance to trip,
What says the world? why, "Miss has made a slip.
And if, a falling character to save,
She weds with age just tottering over the grave,
The sportive world will still enjoy the joke,
And spouse, at home, at once is made a cloak.
The Politician too, who when in place,
Views public measures with a smiling sace,
Croaks, when he is out, a discontented note, --
Sure he is a tailor -- he has turned his coat.
Often have I measured you when closely sitting,
To see what twist, what shape, what air was sitting.
Once more I Will try, if you will make no resistance;
Mine Is a quick eye, and measures at a distance.
Produces the sheers and measure. Great Mr. Alderman -- your worship -- sir,
If you can stomach it, you need not stir,
Room you require, for turtle and for haunch,
It Is done -- two yards three quartersround the paunch.
Slim sir, hold up your arm -- Oh, you're a Poet,
You want a coat, indeed -- your elbows show it.
Don't tremble, man; there is now no cause for fears,
Though often you shirk the Gemmen of the sheers;
Genius stands still, when tailors interpose,
It Is like a watch -- it ticks -- and then it goes.
The needle dropped, the warlike sword I draw,
or often our sex must yield to martial law;
ady Hubbuffet came to me last night,
"Oh, my dear ma'am, I Am in such a fright:
"They Have drawn me for a man; and, what is worse,
"I am to soldier it, and mount a horse:
"Must wear the breeches." Says I, "Don't deplore
"What in your husband's life you always wore;
"But that your La'ship's heart may cease from throbbing,
"Let your fat Coachman mount upon fat Dobbin;
"And for the good old pair I Will boldly say,
"Nor man, nor horse, will ever run away."
"Run!" -- "Arrah, who is that dare fear betray?"
Cries patriot Paddy, hot from Bantry-Bay.)
[assuming the Brogue.] "The Frenchmen came expecting us to meet 'em,
"And sure we all were ready there to greet 'em,
"With piping hot potatoes made of lead,
"And powder that would serve instead of bread;
"And, by my soul, such dainty fine fat frogs,
"With warm dry lodging for them in the bogs."
"They came, alas!" cried I, of terror full.
"They made a conquest?" -- "No, they made a bull."
But softly -- what with measures, bulls, and battle,
You must be tired with my poor foolish prattle;
But while you look so plea^ant, kind and elever,
Had I my way, I Would talk to you for ever.

THE END.
