The length of this species is about thirteen inches and a half; the breadth
more than two feet; the weight eight ounces; the female is exactly like the
male both in form and color, but is rather smaller.

It lays four eggs, of a dirty olive cast, speckled with black Pennant observes
that the eggs are held in great esteem for their delicacy; and are sold by the
London Poulterers for three shillings the dozen.
, in a slight nest composed of bents, or on a bed of dried grass, scraped
together on the ground; the hen fits about three weeks; the young as soon as
hatched run together like chickens.

The old birds show a remarkable solicitude for their young, flying with great
anxiety about them if disturbed; and using every stratagem to decoy the
disturber from the nest; feigning to flutter as if wounded on the ground at a
little distance, or running along as if lame: should those artifices prove
useless they become desperate, and will strike at the person or animal whom
they cannot entice away.

Toward winter both young and old assemble in flocks of four or five hundred
on the heaths or marshy places, at which time they are caught in nets for the
use of the table in the same manner that Ruffs are.

They are common in most parts of Europe, as far as Iceland; change place
according to the season; are met with in Persia and Egypt in winter, and Latham
says he has seen a specimen from China.

They are esteemed a delicacy as their nourishment is only slugs and worms;
these they draw out of the ground morning and evening. They are sometimes kept
in gardens, and by good treatment become both useful and familiar.


PLATE XXVI. PARUS CRISTATUS. CRESTED TITMOUSE. PASSERES.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill short, strong, entire, bristles at the base. Tongue
blunt, with bristles at the end.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Forehead and sides of the Head white; on the head a crest
of black pointed feathers with white edges. Chin and Throat black; with a
collar of the same color bounding the Cheeks. Back, Wings, and Tail, rufous
gray. Under parts of the Body white, sides with a rufous tinge. Legs lead

The Crested Titmouse is so very rarely found in this country, that neither
Latham or Pennant has described it as a British species; nor has the latter
included it in the Appendix of the British Zoology, among the foreign birds
which visit us at unstated periods.

It is met with in many parts of France, particularly in Normandy, and the
intermediate country between that and Sweden; writers concur that it is of a
very solitary disposition, never mixing with other birds, nor in numbers even
with its own species; it is chiefly found among the ever-green trees in the
deep and gloomy recesses of extensive forests, and is therefore little known
even in those parts where the species is most frequent.

Walcot mentions that they are sometimes seen in Scotland, and once visited
that country in a large flock; the specimen from which our figure is copied was
shot in Scotland also, in company with several others in the year 1792.


PLATE XXVII. EMBERIZA NIVALIS? TAWNY BUNTING. PASSERES.
Bill conic, pointed. Nostrils oval, broad, naked.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill conic, angular on each side; a hard knob within the
upper mandible.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Bill yellow tipped with black. Head and round the Neck
tawny. Back brown, marked with black. Legs black. Rump tawny. Tail twelve
feathers, rather forked, exteriors white.

These birds are sometimes met with in the northern parts of England, but are
not common; three males and one female were shot in the garden of Mr. Slade,
Vauxhall-road, about a fortnight since. I carefully examined them, and found
they varied very much in their colors: it is not indeed surprising that the
accurate Linnaeus should consider the Tawny and Mountain Buntings with their
varieties, as the Snow Bunting in its different approaches to its summer
appearance.

Pennant is of a different opinion, and has described it under the English name
Tawny Bunting, as a distinct species. Latham has also described it as a
different species in his general Synopsis; and in the list of the Birds of
Great Britain, in the supplemental volume, he adds "EMBERIZA FRIGIDA," and
refers to the description of the Tawny Bunting in the British Zoology, No 121.

The name "Emberiza glacialis" has been also given to the same, or a mere
variety of this bird.

Our specimens are about six inches and three quarters in length, twelve inches
and three quarters in breadth; weight an ounce.

The Guillemot is found in immense numbers on several of the English coasts in
summer; they continue in the Orknies Penn. Br. Zool.
the whole year; chiefly breed in the uninhabited Isle of Priestholm, near the
Isle of Anglesea; the Farn Isles near the coast of Northumberland, and among
the high cliffs in the neighborhood of Scarborough Willoughly.
, Yorkshire. Like the Auk, (which are also found with them in vast numbers).
They lay only one egg, more than three inches in length, of a blueish white or
pale seagreen color, most elegantly streaked with black lines crossing each
other in every direction.

They are very silly; for though they see their companions killed by their
side, they only make a short circuit, and alight in the same place to be shot
at in turn.

Our bird is seventeen inches in length, weight twenty-five ounces, breadth
twenty-seven inches and a half. Brunnich mentions a variety, with a broader and
shorter bill, and yellow margins. Muller speaks of a variety, with a white ring
round the eyes, and a line of the same color behind.

They are found in most of the northern parts of Europe to Spitzbergen Both
Pennant and Latham has separated the Guillemots from the Diverse, and Grebes; to
the first Latham has given the generic title Uria after Brisson; the second he
continues under the Linnaean genus (Colymbus); and the third he calls Podiceps.
, the coast of Lapmark, along the White and Icy Sea to Kamtschatka; are found
at Newfoundland and in some parts of North America.

It is called Guillem by the Welsh, Guillemot or Sea Hen, at Northumberland and
Durham; in the southern parts, Willocks.


PLATE XXIX. COLYMBUS AURITUS. EARED GREBE. ANSERES.
Bill obtuse, covered with a thin membrane, broad, gibbous below the base,
swelled at the apex. Tongue fleshly. Legs naked. Feet finned, or webbed.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill straight, slender, pointed. Nostrils linear, at the
base of the bill. Legs near the tail. Feet webbed.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Bill curved a little upwards at the point. Lore and irides
crimson. Head black, with an orange-coloured tuft of feathers behind each eye.
Breast silvery white. Ridge and tips of the wings white. Legs olive.

The length of this Species is twelve inches; they inhabit the fens near
Spalding, where they breed; they are found in the northern parts of Europe, and
in the temperate parts of Siberia and Iceland. Said by Bougainville to be met
with in Falkland Islands, wnere it is called the Diver with Spectacles. --
Boug. Voy. p. 61.

The nest, like most others of the same Genus, is composed of twigs, roots and
stalks of water-plants, and is usually found floating among the reeds and
^^ags, nearly filled with water. The female lays four or five small white eggs,
which are hatched in the water.


PLATE XXX. FALCO APIVORUS. HONEY BUZZARD. ACCIPITRES.
Birds of prey. Bill and claws strong, hooked. An angle in each margin of the
upper mandible. Body muscular. Females larger and more beautiful than the males.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill arched from the base, which is covered with a wax-like
membrane, or cere.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Bill and Cere black. Legs yellow; Claws black. Head
ash-colored. Back and Wings dark brown. Breast and Belly white, spotted. Tail
barred.

Though the Honey Buzzard inhabits various parts of the continent of Europe it
is no where common except in the open parts of Russia and Siberia; is seen as
far north as Sondonor in Norway. In England it is scarcely ever met with.

The length of our Specimen is twenty-three inches; weight when taken thirty
ounces. In its colors it precisely corresponds with the description of the
Honey Buzzard in Latham's General Synopsis of Birds, but differs very
materially from that either of Linnaeus Linnaeus describes the tail with only
one cinerous band, the tip white.
, Brisson Brisson says "the side tail-feathers are banded with white on the
inner webs, and are spotted with brown."
, Pennant Albin describes the tail of his specimen "plain without bars."
, or Albin Pennant, in the Br. Zool. describes the Honey Buzzard, "Chin,
breast, and belly white; the two last marked with dusky spots, pointing
downwards; and three dusky bars on the tail." He mentions a variety "entirely
of a deep brown; had much the fame marks on the wings and tail as the male; and
the head tinged with ash color."
.

Albin says, "This bird builds its nest of small twigs, laying on them wool,
and upon the wool its eggs. Some of them have been found to make use of an old
nest of a kite to breed in, feeding their young with the nymphae of wasps, the
combs of wasps being found in the aforesaid nests, in which were two young
ones, covered with a white down, spotted with black; their feet of a pale
yellow, their bills between the nostrils and the head white, their craws large:
in the crops were found lizards, frogs, etc. In one of them were found two
lizards entire, with their heads toward the bird's mouth, as if they fought to
creep out." -- "This bird runs very swiftly like a hen." -- Alb. 1. t. 2.

The eggs of the Honey Buzzard are variously described by different authors;
the specimens formerly preserved in the Portland Museum were of a very deep red
brown, with ferruginous blotches of chestnut; Mr. Latham says he was informed by
Mr. Boys, "that they are of a blueish white, marked with irregular rufous
spots; the shape of the egg almost globular; usually three in the nest." Mr.
Pennant says he was favored with a description of the eggs by Mr. Plumly;
"they were blotched over with two reds, something darker than those of the
Kestril."


PLATE XXXI. LANIUS COLLURIO. RED-BACKED SHRIKE, BUTCHER-BIRD, or FLUSHER.

upper mandible. Body muscular. Females larger and more beautiful than the males.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill hooked toward the end, with a notch near the tip of
the upper mandible; base not furnished with a cere. Tongue jagged at the end.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Bill black. A black stroke through the eyes. Head light
gray. Upper parts of the back, and wing coverts, ferrugineous. Breast, belly,
and sides, blossom-coloured. Legs black. Tail black; all the feathers, except
the two middle ones, more or less white at the base.

The length of this Species is seven inches and a half, breadth eleven inches;
the female is of a dull ferruginous, mixed with gray: the breast, belly, and
sides, dirty white, crossed with semicircular dusky lines: the tail deep brown,
except the outer feather on each side, whose exterior webs are white; the
female is rather larger than the male.

It visits this country in the spring and departs in autumn; it is common in
France and Italy, as well as in the temperate parts of Russia.

It builds its nest in a hedge or low bush, and lays six white eggs, encircled
at the largest end with a rufous brown circle; it not only feeds on insects,
but will devour the young of other birds, taking hold of them by the neck and
strangling them, then tearing out the eyes, brain, etc. and when satisfied
sticks the remainder on a thorn for another meal; when confined in a cage it
will do the same against the wires with beetles, grasshoppers, or pieces of
sheep's kidney.

It is said to imitate well the notes of other birds, though it has none of its
own.


PLATE XXXII. TRINGA CINCLUS. OX-EYE, PURRE, OR STINT. GRALLAE.
Bill roundish. Tongue entire, fleshy. Thighs naked. Toes divided.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill roundish strait, about the length of the head.
Nostrils narrow. Toes four.

This Species is very common in most parts of Europe, and is said to be found
at the Cape of Good Hope; in Jamaica and other West India Islands. They
frequent our coasts in the winter in vast flocks, alternately swimming and
flying in large circles with the greatest regularity: they leave our shores in
spring, and retire to some unknown place to breed. Mr. Latham suspects that
they breed on the coast of Kent, having received some birds which scarcely
differed from the description, from Mr. Boys of Sandwich; they were shot at
Romney, in the month of August.

Le Cincle of Buffon and L'Alloutte de Mer a Collier of Brisson has much
affinity to this Bird, and is supposed to be only a difference of sex or age,
as they are often taken in company.

On the authority of Mr. Pennant we have ventured to introduce this species.
"Of these birds," says Mr. Pennant, in the appendix to the British Zoology, "we
have heard of only two being seen at large in our Island; one was shot near
Helston-bridge, Cornwall, and an account of it transmitted to us by the Reverend
Doctor William Borlase."

These birds are frequent in most parts of Europe; in Germany, Sicily and Malta
they are so common as to be sold in the markets Willughby.
. Edwards mentions one shot on Gibraltar Rock; it is also met with from the
southern parts of Russia to the neighborhood of the Irtish Arct. Zool.
.

It makes its nest in woods, most frequently in Birch trees Frisch.
; never lays more than five eggs, which are of a clear green, sprinkled with
innumerable dark specks Latham.
. It does not come to its color till the second year; flies in troops in
autumn, and is often seen in tilled ground, with rooks and other birds,
searching for worms, small seeds, and roots Frisch.
; it feeds also on frogs and beetles Faun. Suec.
.

By one author it is said sometimes to make the nest in holes in the ground, in
one of which two eggs were found Hist. des Ois. iii. p. 139.
; by another, it is observed never to be seen on the ground Dec. Russ. I. p.
108.
.

"It is remarkable for making a chattering noise; from which it is called by
some Garrulus." Pennant.


PLATE XXXIV. LE GEAY BLANC. WHITE JAY.
Bris. av. 2. p. 51. A.

In the description of CORVUS GLANDARIUS, COMMON JAY, we mentioned the specimen
from which our present figure is taken; it was found in a nest with four other
Jays of the common sort, and can only be considered as a variety.

We have introduced it into this work, as a solitary example how far the
plumage of birds will sometimes vary from local circumstances.


PLATE XXXV. STRIX BRACHYOTOS. SHORT-EARED OWL. ACCIPITRES.
Birds of prey. Bill and claws strong, hooked. An angle in each margin of the
upper mandible. Body muscular. Females larger and more muscular than the males.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill short, hooked, without cere. Head large. A broad disk
surrounding each eye. Legs feathered to the toes. Tongue bifid. Nocturnal.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Horns or ears a single feather. Above dark brown
intermixed with pale yellow color. Beneath pale yellow longitudinally streaked
with dark brown; feathered to the toes. Tail yellow brown barred with dark
color, tip white. Wings when closed reach beyond the tail.

Mr. Pennant appears to be the first author who has described this species Mr.
Latham has made this severe, though not entirely unmerited animadversion on the
remarks of M. de Buffon, in Hist. des Ois. Vol. I. p. 353, note (a) "M. de
Buffon seems to think that this bird is the Scops, than which no two species
differ more. We have not the Scops in England, neither do I think the
above-described bird to be a native of France. It would therefore have appeared
candid in the abovementioned author, to have suspended his opinion of the
matter till he had been better informed, as he seems to bear somewhat hard upon
Mr. Pennant, who, I am clear, is the first who has described it." -- Genesis Syn.
; he says it is a bird of passage, has been observed to visit Lincolnshire the
beginning of October, and to retire early in the spring; he supposes its summer
retreat is Norway. It conceals itself in the long grass in the daytime; when
disturbed it will seldom fly far, but will light and sit looking at one, at
which time the horns may be seen very distinctly. Mr. Pennant further adds, "it
is found frequently on the hill of Hoy in the Orknies, where it flies about and
preys by day like a hawk. I have also received this species from Lancashire,

This is the smallest European species of the Woodpecker genus we have any
knowledge of at this time; its length is six inches, breadth eleven inches, and
weight one ounce.

It visits orchards, and feeds on the larva of insects, which it sometimes
pecks out of the trunks of trees or decayed wood. It builds in an hole of a
tree. Our figure represents the male; the female has the crown of the head
white. -- This species is not commonly met with in England.

Buffon says it inhabits most of the provinces of France Salerne denies its
being found in France. Orn. p. 107.

This species is thirteen inches in length, weight six ounces and an half. The
female has no red mark on the lower jaw; Frisch and Klein observe they have no
red on the crown of the head; but Latham, in his Synopsis of Birds, says, he
has had them when they could scarcely fly, the red was then mixed with brown,
but became full red after the first moult.

It is common in many parts of Europe, and is found as high north as Lapmark;
in England it is met with in most woody places.

They build in the hollow trunks of trees, fifteen or twenty feet from the
ground: with their bills, which are very strong, hard, and formed like a wedge,
they can bore through the living part of the wood, till they come to that which
is rotten; the hole thus formed is as perfectly in the form of a circle as if
made with the assistance of a pair of compasses, and is hollowed out to a
proper depth before the eggs are deposited. They lay generally five, sometimes
six Willoughby. Pennant.
eggs; the young birds climb up and down the trees before they can fly.

According to Pennant the eggs are of a beautiful semitransparent white;
greenish, with black spots, Latham; and greyish or yellowish white, marked with
irregular pale yellow brown lines in the figure of the egg in Sepp's plate
Sepp. Vog. pl. in p. 43.
.

It feeds on Insects, which it sometimes extracts from beneath the bark of
trees, or from the solid wood by means of its strong, though slender barbed
tongue; is said to make great havoc among bees.

In the Leverian Museum there is a variety of this species, entirely of a straw
color, except the crown, which is faintly marked with red. It was shot at
Belvoir chase.

have represented the male, the female has only the rudiment of a crest: the
head and upper part of the neck, dull ferruginous: chin white: fore part of the
neck and the breast ferruginous, mottled with black and white: upper part of
the neck, back, rump, and scapulars, cinerous: the lower part of the breast and
belly white.

Both male and female are very liable to variation in the color of their
plumage; in some the white space on the neck is much more diffused than in
others; the same has been observed of the portion of white on the wings; and
the females differ in the brightness of their color frequently.

Mr. Latham mentions a specimen which was shot near Sandwich in Kent; but it is
chiefly found in the northern parts of Great Britain; it is observed to breed
on Loch Mari, in the county of Ross, and in the Isle of Ilay Pennant's Zool.
.

The nest is made of withered grass, and is lined with the down of the bird's
breast; it lays from eight to thirteen eggs, like those of a wild duck, but
smaller and whiter; the young are of a dirty brown like goslings Latham Genesis
Syn.

It is found in most of the northern parts of Europe, in Russia, about the
great rivers of Siberia, and the lake Baikal; also frequent in Greenland, where
it breeds on the shores; in Newfoundland and Hudson's Bay.

The length of this bird is six inches and three quarters; it is distinguished
from other species of the same genus by the very singular structure of its
bill, both mandibles of which curve across each other. The male is generally of
a fine orange red inclining to rose-colour, mixed more or less with brown, the
female of a dull green; but both sexes are very liable to variations: the male
is sometimes of a yellowish orange; of a deep red; or even inclining to a dark
purple hue, intermixed with yellow, red, brown, green, etc. the female varies
also, but seldom acquires more than a dull intermixture of other colors on the
olive-green according to the different seasons. The males are like the females
when young, and gradually change to a fine red.

Mr. Pennant says there are two varieties of this species, our present
specimen, and another which is very rare; of the latter he says he received a
male and female from Shropshire; they were superior in size to the former, the
bill remarkably thick and short, more encurvated than that of the common kind,
and the ends more blunt Pennant's Br. Zool.
.

The Cross-bill is common in Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland; is found also in
Russia and Siberia, in North America, Greenland, etc. It is not supposed to
breed in England, but to visit us generally in small flocks, though it has been
seen in vast multitudes in some seasons. As the seeds of the Fir, or Pine, is
their natural food, they always retire to forests where those trees grow in
most abundance: they feed also on Hemp Seed; and are said to do great damage in
orchards, by tearing the apples to pieces to eat the pips or seeds.

It is observed, in North America, to build its nest in the highest part of the
Fir-trees, fastening it to the branches by the resinous matter which exudes
from the trees Latham.

Three kinds of Wagtails are found in this country, the Common, or White, the
Yellow, and the Gray; the two former we have already figured; the latter is a
very elegant bird, and appears to be the rarest of the three species, it breeds
in the north of England; supposed not nearer than Cumberland Latham, Genesis Syn.
, and departs southward in October.

In the male only the chin and throat are black. Length seven inches and an
half.

All the birds of this genus frequent watery places; are very lively, and have
a brisk motion in their tails. They feed on Insects. The nest of the Gray
Wagtail is made on the ground; it is composed of dried fibers and moss, lined
with wool or feathers within; it contains from six to eight eggs, of a dirty
white, marked with yellow spots.

The earliest appearance of the Cuckoo in this country is supposed to be in
February Mentioned in Br. Zool. Pen.
, it is rarely in March, but more commonly in April: it has been emphatically
called the harbinger of Summer, or the messenger of Spring; and its note, when
heard early in the year, should never fail to invite the rural oeconomist to
his useful occupation. With Stillingfleet and Pennant we acknowledge the
fallibility of human Calendars, for the purposes of husbandry; and with them
must conclude, that "some attention should be given to those feathered guides,
who come heaven-taught, and point out the true commencement of the season;
their food being the Insects of those seasons they continue with us Br. Zool.
."

The Cuckoo is so well known in this, and every other country of Europe, that
we are not surprised to find its Natural History has engaged the particular
attention of every writer on Ornithology, in whose works it could be introduced
with propriety: it may hence be difficult, if not impossible, to treat of its
peculiar habits with an elegance of language superior to the description of
Buffon, to select more judiciously the beautiful fictions of Ancient Bards,
than has been done by Pennant and other preceding writers; who have thus
embellished its history; or to add to general information any material
circumstance that has evaded the vigilance and accuracy of Latham.

The note of this bird is a call to love, and is peculiar to the male; who,
perched on the branch of a tree, or the summit of an eminence, thus invites the
female from the coppice in which she sits in silence: in a calm evening his
note may be heard among the trees far off; and when disappointed of its mate,
the neighboring woods reecho his hollow note at the distance of a quarter of a
mile.

All Authors have allowed that the Cuckoo does not hatch its own eggs, but
deposits them in the nest of some other bird, generally in that of a
Hedge-Sparrow, Water-Wagtail, or a Yellow-Hammer; some Writers say the Cuckoo
lays only one egg, others two The egg figured by Sepp is like the Jackdaw's,
both in size and shape, of a greenish white, speckled with brown. -- Latham
says it is certainly not that of the Cuckoo, which he describes not much bigger
than that of the Hedge-Sparrow, greatly elongated in shape, the ground color
not unlike it, and mottled all over with ferruginous purple.
in the nest; the foster-parent attends them with the same care as her own, and
when the brood is hatched, she shows no dislike to the spurious offspring; she
treats them with equal tenderness, and toils with the same assiduity to supply
them with food; the young Cuckoo, when fledged, follows its little instructor
for a short time; but as its appetite increases, and the small Insects it
collects, in imitation of its supposed parent, soon become insufficient for its
subsistence, they separate. Its ingratitude is proverbial among the French
"Ingrat comme un Coucou."
, from a ridiculous supposition that it changed into a Hawk, and devoured its
nurse.

About the end of June the call of the male ceases, though it does not take its
final departure till the end of September or beginning of October. Latham
observes he has heard it call at midnight more than once or twice in the course
of the Summer, and adds it was bright moonlight every time.

They feed on Insects, flesh, etc. in the stomach of several that have been
dissected the Caterpillars of the Fox Phal. Rubi.
and Buff-tip Phal. Bucephalo.
Moth have been found; in others vegetable matter, egg-shells, Beetles, etc.

They are supposed to migrate to Africa and Aleppo, and to visit several
countries in their passage; and are known in the northern parts of the world,
even to Kamtschatka.

Le Coucou roux, of Brisson, is a variety of a young bird, having the upper
parts varied with rufous, where the other is white. Birds of the first year are
very liable to variation, scarce two being found alike; the bars are much more
numerous in some than in others, and the ground color more or less varied with
ferruginous, according to the age.

On dissection, the stomach has been discovered to be very capacious and long;
protruding far beyond the sternum, that part being so very short, as not to be
sufficient to take off the pressure in incubation, whereby digestion may be
impeded. This has been assigned as the reason why it does not hatch its own
eggs.

Length of the adult bird is fourteen inches, breadth twenty-five inches,
weight two ounces and an half.

ounces; the Female is rather larger, the colors are in general more obscure,
the white stripe over the eye is narrower, the black on the belly is intermixed
with white, and the white line across the breast is wanting.

They are found in plenty in some parts of England, in others are unknown. Are
most common in Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, and Derbyshire, about the latter
end of April, in May and June; during which time they are very fat, and are
much esteemed for their delicate flavor. In April and September they are taken
on the Wiltshire and Berkshire downs Latham.
: they are also seen on the sea side at Meals, in Lancashire, in April; where
they continue about three weeks; from thence they remove northward to Leyton
Haws, where they stay about a fortnight (...).

Westmoreland, as they appear there in May, and are observed there after the
breeding season. They breed also on several of the Highland hills Latham.

This beautiful bird is rarely met with in this country except in winter; it is
only an occasional visitor with us, though in France it is not uncommon; and in
Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the southern parts of Russia it is very plenty. It
has been seen in England in the summer months once or twice, and Latham seems
inclined to believe they may sometimes breed here.

They feed on berries, and on the kernels of cherries, almonds, haws, etc.
their bills are very large, and so strong that they are able to crack the
hardest stones of any fruit with the greatest facility.

They are said to build the nest in hollow trees; or between the forked
branches, about twelve feet from the ground; it is composed of small dry
fibers, intermixed with liver-wort; they lay five or six eggs Willughby.
of a roundish shape, of a bluish green, spotted with olive brown, and
interspersed with a few irregular black markings according to Latham; in the
figure given by Sepp the eggs are of a pale purple color, spotted with brown;
the nest appears of a loose texture, and is placed on an oak.

The length of this species is seven inches, breadth thirteen, weight two
ounces; the colors of the Female are not so bright as those of the Male, and
the space between the bill and the eye, which is black in the latter, is gray
in the other sex.

The general description we have given of its colors must not be supposed to
constitute its distinguishing character: they vary exceedingly in different
specimens; in some the bill is almost black, the crown of the head in some is
whitish; in others wholly black: sometimes the white band across the wing
inclines to gray; in others no trace of white can be perceived: it has been
seen with the body wholly black, and Scopoli mentions one entirely white, the
quills excepted.

The Golden Plover is found in small flocks on our moors and heaths, in the
winter season; it is not a common species in this country. It breeds on several
unfrequented mountains, particularly on those of the Isle of Rum, and the
loftier Hebrides Pennant Br. Zool.
: and on the Grampian, and all the heathy hills of the islands, and Highlands
of Scotland Fl^r. Scot. 1. p. 35.
.

It is an inhabitant of Sweden, Denmark, Lapland, and other countries toward
the frozen ocean; and according to Russel Russel, p. 71.
extends to the south as far as Aleppo.

It lays four eggs, sharply pointed at the lesser end, two inches and
one-eighth in length, of a pale cinereous olive, blotched with blackish spots
Lath. Genesis Syn.
.

In some specimens the belly is black, in others black intermixed with white;
this is entirely owing to the season; early in March the black on the breast is
first seen, it increases till that part becomes full black; but after the time
of incubation that color disappears. Instead of a hind toe some have only a
small claw.

This species is the most common of all the gulls. It breeds on the rocks and
cliffs on our shores and rivers which are contiguous to the sea, and is seen in
vast numbers on the Thames in spring and winter, picking up the small fish,
worms, etc. left by the tide.

It is seen as far north as Iceland, Lapland, and the Russian Lakes, and also
on the coast of Newfoundland. It is an inhabitant of the warmer climates of the
south, as Greece, some parts of Italy, and most of the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea.

The length is seventeen inches: breadth thirty-six inches, and weight one
pound. The eggs are two inches and a half in length; of a deep olive brown,
marked with irregular deep red reddish blotches Lath. Genesis Syn.
.

They differ a little in their markings: Mr. Latham mentions one, the head and
half the neck of which were marked with short dusky streaks.

The Kite is very common in England, and is well known in several parts of the
continent of Europe "The flesh is gross. Aldrov. yet it is eaten by the poor
people in Germany." R^^t. Lovell, Hist. Animals and Birds, 1661.
; but it inhabits the more northern countries only during the hottest months of
summer. Bosman mentions it as a native of Guinea Bosman, Voy. de Guinee, p. 278.
; Linnaeus also says it inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. No author has yet
described it as a native of America.

It breeds in woods. The nest is formed of different materials; the outside of
sticks, the lining of rags, bits of flannel, rope, paper, etc Penn. Br. Zool.
. It lays two or three eggs, which are roundish, and of a whitish color,
spotted with dirty yellow. The egg of the Kite is described by Mr. Latham (in
his Supplement to the Synopsis of Birds) from the specimen formerly preserved
in the Portland Museum; it was of a bluish white, inclining to red at one end,
blending itself with the white by small markings.

As a bird of prey, the Kite is known to be very destructive among poultry; it
devours also small birds and animals, and Mr. Latham says it will sometimes eat
fish, as it has been found feeding on the remains of one by the side of a pond,
after having probably beaten off its first possessor.

The forked tail of the Kite distinguishes it from every other bird, and serves
to direct its flight with the greatest precision. It sometimes appears
suspended, and quite motionless at a considerable height, then glides with
astonishing velocity through the sky, without the smallest apparent action of
its wings. When it descends on small birds, it generally carries them off in
its talons, to devour them.

The length of this bird twenty-six inches: breadth five feet. They differ very
frequently in their colors. Mr. Pennant mentions a beautiful variety entirely
of a tawny color that was shot in Lincolnshire.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill strait, slender. Tongue jagged.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Bill black, head brown, marked with dusky
streaks, a white line over the eye, with a black line above it; cheeks brown.
Back, wings, and tail, brown; wing coverts edged with pale brown. Body beneath

This elegant bird is commonly met with in marshy places, or near rivers where
willows, reeds, and sedges grow. The nest is generally made among the reeds. It
is composed of straw, and dried fibers of plants, lined with hair, and contains
five eggs, of a dirty white color, marbled with brown Latham. Genesis Syn.
.

It feeds on flies, spiders, etc. which it finds on the willows, or among the
rushes, where it conceals itself. It imitates the note of the swallow,
sky-lark, house-sparrow, and other birds, in a pleasing but hurrying manner,
and sings all night Pennant. Br. Zool.
.

Some authors have supposed that it leaves us before winter, but that is
uncertain.

Length of this bird is six inches and an half.
