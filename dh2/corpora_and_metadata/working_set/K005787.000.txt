THE NOBLE PEDLAR.
PART I.
(Arabella discovered dressing a flower-pot.) DEAR lovely rose, that in the
morn,
When first I plucked thee from the thorn,
With matchless blushes died.
Why should thy charming beauties fade,
Which in the morning thou displayed,
In all thy infant pride?
Where are thy varied colors fled?
Thy scent is gone, thy leaves are dead;
Alas! I Have lost my rose!
Where are thy heavenly beauties laid,
When winter kills each verdant blade,
With cold and chilling snows?

RECITATIVE. Sweet rose adieu! thy emblem is too plain,
Thy youth gave pleasure, but thy death gives pain;
Ye dear remaining few, I yet will strive
To keep your crimson-tinted dies alive; --
Before the thirsty sun your buds shall kill,
My water-vase a thousand times I Will fill;
For your sweet sakes a thousand turns I Will bring,
And rob each crystal brook, and cooling spring.
[Ex. with a watering-vase.
Enter FLORIMORE. Bewitching maid, thou have ensnared my heart,
And I must 'gin to play the lover's part:
To ease the pleasing pain which now I feel,
I Will try by some device her heart to steal;
But then the curse of being laughed to scorn,
When I have fixed on one so lowly born.

SONG. A plague on degree, for I find I Am in love,
And I will indulge the dear flame;
What fool of degree would that passion remove,
For the sake of a paltry name.
Even Jove on his fair-mortal maidens has smiled,
And gazed with an amorous eye,
'Till his Godship at last found his heart was beguiled --
Then plague on it, why should not I?
What Is pomp or degree, without freedom of mind?
They serve but our bliss to annoy,
Then I Will even venture, should I but once find
Young Cupid a generous boy.

RECITATIVE. But let me pause -- methinks it would be wise,
To try my little charmer in disguise.
A Pedlar I Will assume, with trinkets rare,
And that way try the passion of my fair.
[Exit.
Re-enter ARABELLA. Plague on that old mamma of mine, I say;
I Have sometimes half a mind to run away,
Wherever I want to go, whatever to see,
She Is sure to knit her brows, and hinder me.
Who would, like me, this imprisoned life endure,
And live for ever in a state obscure.

SONG. From morn to night alone I sit,
For liberty I sigh and fret,
Like Robin in his cage;
Mamma she kills me with her care,
She tells me I am young and fair,
At a bewitching age --
No gay assembly must I see,
She says, such things will ruin me,
That men are false and vain:
But she is old and full of spleen,
Were she like me, at gay sixteen,
She Would sing another strain.

Enter SOPHORINA. RECITATIVE. SOPHORINA. Why look thou grave, my girl? I Have
news to tell,
Will make thee smile; -- I know 'twill please thee well;
Thou have a prisoner taken --

ARABELLA. A prisoner! How?

SOPHORINA. Oh, heed not that, he is thy prisoner now;
He sighs, protests, and swears that he will be kind,
There never was man so suited to thy mind;
Yet ere he takes the bliss, for which he sues,
He must be bound in Hymen's silken noose.

ARABELLA. Alas, I Have been myself confined too long,
To wish another half so great a wrong.

SONG. SOPHORINA. Foolish wench, thou soon shall find,
I Have got a plaything to thy mind;
Leave thy pouting,
And thy glouting,
Throw thy foolish fears away.
If thou too long have been confined,
I Will soon release, and soon will bind;
I come to teaze thee,
And to please thee.
And to fix thy wedding day.

RECITATIVE. ARABELLA. My wedding day! alas, with whom and when?

SOPHORINA. With one, the bravest of all gentlemen;
So tall he is, so gallant and so gay,
He Would steal the heart of any saint away.

ARABELLA. How can my bosom to a stranger yield?
How can he love the maid he never beheld?

SOPHORINA. Behold he comes himself to tell his tale,

ARABELLA. And if he talks of love to me, he will fail:
If that is the man, he will never my passion move;
He is already with himself in love:
See how he views his person in the glass;
Indeed, mamma, I think your man's an ass.

Enter BARBARINO. BARBARINO. O yes, by Jove! aye, there she is, I see
The little huzzy is in love with me.
What shall I say, though, now we are brought together?
We'll 'gin at first to talk about the weather;
Good Morrow, Miss, it is a charming day.

ARABELLA. Ah, very, very true, Sir, as you say;
Pray tell me, Sir, how came it first about,
That you should find the mighty secret out?

BARBARINO. Pray tell me, pretty little smiling dove,
Will you not listen to a man in love,
To one that loves you dearly. --

ARABELLA. No, not I,

BARBARINO. Then would you wish to see your lover die?

ARABELLA. With all my heart, Sir, die what way you choose,
Or hang yourself -- I Will not untie the noose.

BARBARINO. O cruel!

SOPHORINA. Impertinent and hateful --
There never was sure a baggage so ungrateful;
You Will raise my blood, you will put me in a passion --
To see how you can use a man of fashion.

BARBARINO. I much do wonder, Madam, as you say.

SOPHORINA. But I will make the saucy jade obey.

BARBARINO. And so would I indeed, were I but you,
I Would make her answer as she ought to do.
I never was used so strangely in my life;
I would not bear this usage from a wife.

SONG. It Is mighty fine,
Were she but mine,
I Would make her love
Whom I approve,
Or else she soon should find,
If she denied
Through prudish pride,
Should she refuse
Whom I should choose,
She never should see mankind.

RECITATIVE. SOPHORINA. Ungrateful minx; how dare you use me thus?

ARABELLA. Dear heart, mamma! you make a mighty fuss.

SOPHORINA. As you did, saucy gipsy, every day;
Have you not teased me for a husband, pray?
Have you not told me, you would fain be free,
And wished to marry for your liberty.

ARABELLA. What must I do?

SOPHORINA. Why, cannot you understand,
Consent to give this gentleman your hand;
Ah, you're a foolish aggravating jade,
Give him your hand, and then your fortune's made. [Aside to Arabella.

Enter FLORIMORE as a Pedlar. FLORIMORE. God bless ye all, my worthy gentry,
I Am come to sell, if you will please to buy. --
I Have buttons, studs, and egrets for the hair,
And many things beside, all choice and rare.

BARBARINO. Pray, saucy fellow, take yourself away.

ARABELLA. No, no, good master, prithee, prithee stay.

SOPHORINA. I Will tell you what, my friend, 'tween you and I,
I Would have you go to those who mean to buy,
You Would better take my counsel, for I fear,
You Will meet with very little custom here.

FLORIMORE. Whether my Lady buys, or should she not,
She Is welcome, ma'am, to look at what I Have got.
[Arabella takes the box and over looks it.
SONG. I Have earings of the best,
All made of polished paste;
I Have boxes fine as gold,
No better ever were sold.
Etwees all curious wrought,
No better ever were bought;
All cheap, as cheap can be,
Pray, Lady, buy of me.

RECITATIVE. SOPHORINA. I tell you, man, we have something else to do,
Than talk all day about your toys and you.

BARBARINO. Dear Arabella, your consent, I pray.

ARABELLA. You have it, Sir, -- to take yourself away.

BARBARINO. Then you're resolved for ever to refuse.

ARABELLA. Pray, good mamma, what earings shall I choose.

SOPHORINA. A fig of the earings, pray ma'am give your answer.

ARABELLA. I Will love, indeed, as soon as ever I can, Sir.
But to speak plainly first, 'tween you and me,
I fear that time will never, never be.

FLORIMORE. O, well replied; by heaven, she has wit,
And what is more rare, she well can manage it. [Aside.

SOPHORINA. Then since you're so perverse, the devil take me,
Thou shall consent to marry, or I Will make thee.

ARABELLA. I would in all respects my duty fill,
But never will marry one against my will.

SONG. It Is in vain, Sir, to pursue me,
Marriage this way will undo me;
I Would rather live confined.
I Would rather be confined for life,
Than this way yield to be a wife,
To break my peace of mind.

BARBARINO. Such treatment is not to be borne,
For my love, she returns me her scorn.

SOPHORINA. A jade, I could, tear out her eyes,
To see her effect to despise,
A person of your high degree.

FLORIMORE. It Is excellent pastime to me.

ARABELLA. I Will never, no never comply.
I Would sooner feed hogs in a stye.

SOPHORINA. You huzzy, you shall,

ARABELLA. But I wont.

SOPHORINA. You shall feed the hogs if you don't.

BARBARINO. Odds heart, what a pother is here.

FLORIMORE. It Is a pother which I like to hear. [Aside.

SOPHORINA. Come, give him your hand, and have done,

ARABELLA. I Will take to my heels first and run.

SOPHORINA. Get home, and be locked up for life,

ARABELLA. I Would rather be so than his wife;
So I Will take your good counsel, and go.

SOPHORINA. Was ever a mother used so?
[Ex. omnes.
END OF THE FIRST PART.
PART II.
Enter ARABELLA. GENTLE Pedlar, I could love thee,
Were I not so much above thee;
So kind he gives, and speaks so mild,
He has my heart almost beguiled.
His cheeks are of the rose's dye,
Like pearl his teeth, like jet his eye;
O, gentle Pedlar, it is a shame
Thou art not worth a better name.

Enter SOPHORINA and BARBARINO, the latter yet unseen by ARABELLA. RECITATIVE.
SOPHORINA. Well, Arabella, do you persevere?
Will you never lend a charitable ear?
Your gentle lover, I Am afraid will die.

BARBARINO. But not of love, good mother; no, not I. [Aside.

ARABELLA. I wish, mamma, you would say no more about him,
I shall be better off indeed, without him;
If he is in love, I pity him I Am sure,
Though pity seldom will a lover cure;
But yet, mamma, indeed, 'tween you and I,
I Have got another lover in my eye.

BARBARINO [ rushing forward.] Another lover? this is worse and worse!
Oh! I could burst with storm, could swear, could curse;
My jealousy, with fury, now increases,
I Will tear this newfound lover all to pieces.

ARABELLA. Oh, mercy on us! what a dreadful creature!
If he would a wife, he certainly would eat her.
But were you once my newfound spark to see,
You would adore the rogue as well as me.

SONG. BARBARINO. Was ever mortal man so treated?
What! in my love to be defeated?
Oh! let me but lay hold of him,
I Will tear the traitor limb from limb;
I Would rather met with death, I swear,
Than once the name of rival hear.
Yes; I Would adore him, you should find;
I Would strew his limbs before the wind.

RECITATIVE. ARABELLA. Then here behold the dear bewitching thing,
Behold your rival in this sparkling ring.

BARBARINO. And am I then at last so much despised,
As by a gaudy ring to be outpris'd.

SOPHORINA. A ring! for heaven's sake, how came you by it?

ARABELLA. I had it given me ma'am, I don't deny it.

SOPHORINA. By whom, by whom; pray tell me, Miss, and when?

ARABELLA. By one, the humblest of all humble men;
And lo, he comes, in hopes you will something buy,
Some necklace, earing, or some rarity.

Enter FLORIMORE. SOPHORINA. Pray tell me, worthy friend, how is it you live?
Is it by what you sell, or what you give?

FLORIMORE. To those, in whom civility I meet,
It is my fancy oftentimes to treat;
To those I do not love perhaps so well,
To such I neither care to give or sell.

BARBARINO. This fellow's some imposture, you will find,
The country swarms with numbers of his kind.
I Would not receive the favor of a pin,
He only gives away to take you in.

SOPHORINA. Return the ring, and let the villain go,
Nay, he may be a thief, for ought you know.

FLORIMORE. Dear Lady, judge not hardly of me, pray.

SOPHORINA. Then take yourself and trumpery away.

SONG. FLORIMORE. O, it is cruel thus to judge me.
And without the least offense,
You Will surely not the time begrudge me,
While I prove my innocence.
I came to steal, indeed, it is true,
A jewel which belongs to you,
For which I Would give my heart.
Then, lovely maiden, interfere,
And stand a poor man's friend;
Thou art the jewel I revere,
I seek no other end.
But I Am, I fear, by much too rude,
A poor man never should intrude;
Take this, and I Will depart. [gives her a diamond necklace.

BARBARINO. Presumptious fellow! know you were you have got?

FLORIMORE. Pray, good gentleman, be not so hot.

BARBARINO. How dare such knaves as you to talk of love?

FLORIMORE. Because 'twas taught me by the gods above.

BARBARINO. You talk too free, methinks, 'tween you and I.

FLORIMORE. I thought your question wanted a reply. [ Barbarino whispers
Sophorina.
Am I deceived, or is it truly so? [Looking at Barbarino.
My vassal, as I live, my Barbarino!
But I will still pursue this vagrant plan,
To try my fair one, and to know my man. [Aside.

SOPHORINO. I fear it is very true, Sir, what you say, [To Barbarino.
We'd better send the saucy knave away.

BARBARINO. Pray tell me, fellow, where you got those things,
Those golden boxes, diamonds and rings.

FLORIMORE. I bought 'em.

BARBARINO. Stole 'em, if you please;
Come, Sir, confess, and down upon your knees.

FLORIMORE. Excuse me, Sir, I Have always made a rule,
Never to make confession to a fool.

BARBARINO. Death and vengeance! shall I bear all this?
If you will return the knave his necklace, Miss,
You soon shall see how I will treat the slave,
I Will slay the thief, and make yon ditch his grave.

ARABELLA. For what, pray Sir, what has the poor man done?

SOPHORINA. What, do you take his part? then we are undone.

ARABELLA. Indeed, mamma, I do, indeed I will,
For I believe the Pedlar honest still;
His looks, the name of villain must reprove,
For they are all humility and love.

BARBARINO. Immortal Cupid! this is mighty fine!

SOPHORINA. She cannot be a daughter sure of mine;
A Pedlar-man! is that your taste you jade?
Pedlar indeed, oh me! I shall go mad.

SONG. Get out you sleekey-headed hound,
What Devil sent you here?
Alas, alas, my head turns round,
I shall go mad I fear.
Take, take your trinket baits away,
Nor dare to dark my door;
I Will have you hanged -- mind what I say,
If here you venture more.

RECITATIVE. FLORIMORE. My tender, lovely maid, farewell! adieu!
I Will go myself, but leave my heart with you.
But ere I go this di'mond locket take,
And wear it, dear one, for a Pedlar's sake. [To Arabella.

ARABELLA. Stay, stay, my gentle Pedlar, prithee stay,
For I could listen to thee all the day;
What Pedlar ever talked in such a strain?
Come back, dear friend, and talk to me again.
It Is not the jewel which so much I prize,
It is the language of thy tongue and eyes.

BARBARINO. Fire and brimstone! I Will no more behold;
Away, get hence, you saucy beggar bold;
I Will put an end, you villain, to your rout,
Good ma'am assist me, and we'll hand him out.

SOPHORINA. Aye, that I will, good Sir, with all my heart.

ARABELLA. Would I a giant were to take his part.
[ Barbarino and Sophorina, in struggling with Florimore, they throw off his
cloak, and pull off his false hair, and discover a star upon his breast.
BARBARINO. Ye Gods! my Lord! my rival and my master!
Did ever mortal meet with such disaster?
Now, what the Devil shall I do or say?
The best way'll be, I think, to run away. [Aside.

FLORIMORE. Pray, gentlefolks, why are ye both so grave?
I thought you would have made yon ditch my grave;
Perhaps you have changed your minds.

SOPHORINA. Oh! lack a day,
We Are both confounded -- and have naught to say.
[ Florimore makes affectionate signs to Arabella.
SONG. BARBARINO. O pardon what is past, my Lord,
I Will never, no, upon my word,
I Will never do so again.
O let this shameful scene pass by,
And for the future I will try
To wipe away the stain.
SOPHORINA. O mercy, how I quake and tremble,
How could your Lordship so dissemble,
And feign your part so well?
I hope your Lordship will forgive me,
It was your pleasure to deceive me,
Your own love tale to tell.

RECITATIVE. FLORIMORE. It Is all forgot; but for the sake of me,
Use other Pedlars with more charity.
I trust you will never more yourself expose,
Nor act the lover in your master's clothes. [To Barbarino.

SOPHORINA. I wish him hanged, my Lord, if you will believe me,
Because the villain strove so to deceive me.

FLORIMORE. Then since you seem so truly to repent,
To make amends, now give me your consent,
To wear this lovely charmer by my side,
I wish to make the matchless maid my bride.

SOPHORINA. Your bride! my Lord? I Am all surprise and wonder;
You Have my consent; -- but make her knuckle under
Dear Arabella, who ever thought to see
Thee stand so fair a chance for quality.

FLORIMORE. And now fair maid, it does on you depend,
To give this comic scene a happy end. [To Arabella.

ARABELLA. Give your instructions, I will naught deny,
That may befit a maiden's modesty.

FLORIMORE. It Is fairly spoke; now yield me that fair hand.

ARABELLA. You have it, gentle Lord, upon demand;
Were It but my hand, the gift were mean and poor,
Had you not archly stole my heart before.

FLORIMORE. Celestial maid! thou'st hushed each doubt and fear;
Was ever maid so lovely and sincere?
In thy dear arms, I Will seek eternal rest,
And lull my cares, to sleep upon thy breast.

SONG. Let smiling Cupids weave a crown,
Young Hymen's brows to bind;
Then make this matchless maid my own,
The fairest of her kind.
ARABELLA. Her hateful head, let Envy hide,
Whilst I my joys confess;
There never sure was yet a bride
Felt equal happiness.
BOTH. Ye mighty Gods, I ask no more,
I Have got the maid / man that I adore,
SOPHORINA. Let happiness on both attend,
And may your joys never know an end.
BARBARINO. Come let us all then join the lay,
To celebrate the wedding day.
ALL. Come let us all then join the lay,
To celebrate the wedding day.

FINIS.
