THE COURT OF ALEXANDER. An OPERA, In TWO ACTS.

THE COURT OF ALEXANDER.

An OPERA, In TWO ACTS.

As it is performed at the THEATER ROYAL IN COVENT GARDEN.

In Times of Old indeed, when TIME was young,
HOMER, the first of Bards, his History sung;
And every Poet, since the Iliad, chooses,
For Want of Voice, t'invoke the Singing Muses;
From whence (with Leave) this Inference we draw,
In ARISTOTLE'S Institutes, it is Law.
"Blank Verse, or Rhyme, to Instruments well strung,
"Should be Recitativ'd, or else in Ballad sung."

THE ARGUMENT OF THIS OPERA.
ALEXANDER the Great, tempted by the Accounts which several Prisoners had
related of the immense Wealth in India, determined upon invading the Dominions
of King PORUS, who was then its Sovereign.

Upon ALEXANDER'S crossing the River Hydaspes, PORUS was made Captive, and
entertained in the Macedonian Camp with great Hospitality; where the Indian
Monarch fell in Love with PARISATIS, who was betrothed to LYSIMACHUS.

The Son of PHILIP was ambitious of being thought the best Drinker, as well as
the greatest Fighter of his Time. Both Accomplishments then (as now) were
looked upon to be Acts which equally constituted the Hero.

No Wonder therefore, if, after the Defeat of the Indian King, his Conqueror,
in Honor of the Victory, should order a Drinking-Match: And immediately after
the Exercise of that Engagement, or Carousal,

The OPERA is supposed to begin.

As to the Complexion of PORUS, Historians are divided: Some supposing him
White, like the Chinese; others Copper-colour'd, like Mangolans: Some declare
him to have been only Tawny, like the Malays. But we have followed the
authenticated Commentaries of MELEAGER and GORGIAS, two Generals, who were
belonging to ALEXANDER: One commanded the Light Horse, the other the Left-Wing
of the Mirmydonian Infantry at the Time, and they declare PORUS to have been a
Black.

The Editor is aware that some anachronismical Objections, relative to
Chronology, may be raised against his keeping CLYTUS alive until the Year of
the World 2096, when the Battle with PORUS was sought: But it is according to
the Account of BAGOAS, who is supposed to be the most impartial Writer in those
Times; and upon the Credit of PLUTARCH, JUSTINIANUS, ARRIAN and DIODORUS.
BAGOAS was Preceptor to ROXANA; and it was from him we are told, that both the
Zogdian Princess and THAIS attended ALEXANDER in all his Expeditions.

As to the Descent of JUPITER, we have not only Pantomimical, but also
Classical Authority, to vindicate such a Measure -- It being common in Old
Rome, even to a Proverb, Nunc pro Machina: And HORACE allows it, in his Ne^
Deus intersit, etc.

The Scene is laid in Bucephalon, a City ALEXANDER built in Honor to his Horse.

The Lines marked thus "are omitted in the Representation.

THE COURT OF ALEXANDER.
ACT I. SCENE I. The Curtain drawn up: The Court of ALEXANDER discovered
asleep. Bottles, Glasses, Punch Bowls, etc. emptied upon the Tables. The Guards
asleep upon the Floor. The Court waking by Degrees. All arise, except ALEXANDER.
SEMI CHORUS.
CLYTUS. ALEXANDER! our Commander!
Pray now rise, Sir;
Open your Eyes, Sir.

GRAND CHORUS.
ALEXANDER!
Our Commander!
Our Commander!
ALEXANDER! ALEXANDER!
ALEXANDER. Who calls on ALEXANDER? Honest CLYTUS!
What is the Foe marched forth, and means to fight us?

CLYTUS. Dread Sir, you have no Foes: You're so magnanimous;
Your Mightiness has made the World unanimous.

ALEXANDER. That Is true: I dreamed indeed of Chariots rattling;
Of Horses, and of high-bred Heroes battling;
Of clashing Weapons, and of Armor clinking;
But my Head's all abroad, with last Night's Drinking:
My Lips are cracked, my Palate rough and rusty;
As I Am an Emp'ror, I am mighty thirsty.
Before me dance, methinks, each warlike Trophy:
HEPHESTION, order us a Pot of Coffee.
Exit HEPHESTION. But where is THAIS? I am not me ipse
'Till I Have a Song from that Sol-fa-ing Gipsey.
AIR.
Should Scandal dare to pelt her,
Oh! how would I helter skelter;
Ding dong,
Right or Wrong,
For a Lover his Fury never stifles:
Pray what is Wrong or what is Right?
When a Man is to fight,
He will not trouble his Head with such Trifles.
Give me a Bumper.


CLYTUS. Now, my King, you say right;
Hob Nob, your Honor: Fuller! I see Daylight.
AIR.
I.
In spite of the Maxims of School Men,
Whose cynical Sentences Fool Men;
Shall Pedants pretend, pray, to Rule Men?
Or tell us what we should be at?
'Twas as well if the World had never known'em;
But a Bottle has always o'erthrown'em,
For a Bottle is Life's Summum Bonum;
We all can be Scholars at that.
II.
Over Books who all Night would be Blinking,
That all Night could Bumpers be drinking?
That Study well suits with my Thinking:
No Classic, but BACCHUS, for me.
The Heart and the Head's best Assistance,
The Power which conquers Resistance,
Makes Pain, Care and Fear, keep their Distance;
My Bucks, Ecce Signum, it is He.
Shows a Bottle. III.
Philosophers Prate melancholy,
Pretending that Life is but Folly;
Because they cannot keep it up, jolly,
But, over poor Pump-Water, pine.
I laugh at their Moods and their Tenses,
Their Major, and Minor Defenses;
They shall not talk me out of my Senses,
Nor make me for Logic leave Wine.

Enter THAIS. ALEXANDER. Come, THAIS, sing.


CLYTUS. So now we shall be bother'd,
And Common Sense in Symphonini's smothered.
Imperial Emperor, whose Sword and Dagger
Made, like a drunken Man, DARIUS stagger;
To whom even India's sun-burn'd Sultan truckles,
Thy Magnanimity raps Nabobs Knuckles:
Over Terra Cognita you rule the Roast.
Yet, ah!
Before Miss THAIS sings, your CLYTUS begs a Toast.

ALEXANDER. CLYTUS, well said; and thus says ARISTOTLE,
"Wine without Toasting's bad; Life bad without a Bottle."
Where stands the Glass?

THAIS. Thou Monarch of my Soul,
Quit, for my sake, the Brain-beguiling Bowl:
Leave the Gout-giving Juice; retire with me,
In my Chinese Pavilion drink some Tea.

CLYTUS. BACCHUS forbid! Shall he, who conquers Nations,
Fribblish submit to such slip-slop Potations?
In spite of Water-bibbers, you and I know,
We must be true to Wine; Est Veritas in Vino.

ALEXANDER. Sing, sing, my THAIS; Echo waits thy Words
To symphonize, encore Fifths, Eighths and Thirds;
With that same shapeless Mimic of each Tongue,
Attention tip-toe stands to hear thy Song.
So sing, dear THAIS.

THAIS. What, Sir, shall I sing?


ALEXANDER. Just what you please; but let it be the Thing.
ORPHEUS was Musick-Master to the Woods,
Gave Groves a Gamut, put in Tune the Floods;
He made tall Trees a Minuet-Step advance in,
Taught Hedges Hornpipes, Shrubberies Country-Dancing;
For every Reptile he had Songs and Jigs,
And Symphonies composed for Guinea Pigs.
AIR.
For Weazels and Rats,
He had both Sharps and Flats,
For Dogs barking Largo and Affetto;
From the grinding of Knives,
And the scolding of Wives,
He composed a Dismallo Duetto.
He made of Frogs Croaks,
And the kawing of Rooks,
And Cats caterwawling Arpegios:
Found in D, that Cocks crow,
Bulls sound G, below,
And sucking Pigs squeak out Adagios.
Now, THAIS, sing; and Silence, my Compeers;
Your Lips take Prisoners, and let loose your Ears;
Mute waits each Muse, in her celestial Arbor,
'Till she has sung to Chorus; that is the Barber.

THAIS. I Have so immense a Cold, Sir, without joaking;
So monst'rous hoarse, my Singing will be shocking.
AIR.
Poets, in pretty sing-song Strains,
With Fancy's Pinions sledge their Brains;
From Height to Height romantic rise,
O'er-top the Clouds, and tread on Skies:
Could I but mount the Muse's Wing,
Oh! how I Would soar! Oh! how I Would sing! --

LYSIMACHUS. Sire, CLYTUS is asleep.


ALEXANDER. So, ho! 'Squire DROWSY!
Take that, Sir SOMNUS; that, I think, will rouse ye.

Throws a Glass of Wine at him. LYSIMACHUS. Full in his Face, great King, the
Bumper splash'd.


CLYTUS. How soon, you see, a modest Man is dashed:
I could have kept awake, Sire, all Night long,
Had you a Bottle ordered with the Song.
SONG.
I.
Commander, you know I Am no sol-fa-ing Fellow,
Nor care I a Crotchet for Coxcomb APOLLO;
His Poets, poor Devils! are soup-maigre Pages,
Who feed on his Physic, instead of Board-Wages.
II.
No Grapes on the Mount of Parnassus can grow,
Nor Castaly 's Cascade with Burgundy flow:
What Is Pegasus good for? Yes, he shall be mine,
I Will make him my Hackney, to fly for my Wine.
III.
For DAPHNE a Tune PHOEBUS struck up, to bring her;
But she would not submit to an Opera-Singer:
Draw, draw your Bows up and down, Tweedle and Tweedling;
I Will draw a long Cork, and a Fig for your Fiddling.

ALEXANDER. March all: Our Royal Word is Promenade,
And we will wend our Way in Grand Parade:
Soon as I make the Signal for Egression,
Trumpet us off aloud in full Procession;
Make the Air shake, the rafter'd Roof rebellow:
So wheel off, two by two; and then we two will follow.

A PROCESSION here. Instead of War Trophies, Drinking Trophies. After all are
gone except ALEXANDER, who has led THAIS to the Side-Wing: Enter ROXANA, and
seizes ALEXANDER 'S Robe, just as he has quitted the Stage. She pulls him back
by it, and down he tumbles. ALEXANDER. [On the Ground. Now, by our Royal Self,
why all this Fury?


ROXANA. Because your Royal Self seems in a Hurry.


THAIS. Do not, my Hero, give yourself Uneasiness;
Mind not that Creature, let us mind our Business.

ROXANA. The Creature! But I Am calm. Your Business, Boldface!
A Man of Taste indeed! to admire an old Face.
AIR.
You Harlot!
You Varlet!
Your Sex, as I know ye,
In few Words, I Will show ye:
Self-Consequence fools ye,
And Prejudice rules ye:
To your own Follies Slaves,
While to us you are Knaves;
Nor know ye the Value of what you betray,
But rob us, and then throw those Riches away.
For Man is no more than an overgrown Baby,
A Rattle can please him, or put him in Rage;
An Ape or an Ass, just as Accidents may be:
A sensible Man is a Show of an Age.

ALEXANDER. Piano, Child, I beg.


ROXANA. No, I Will be louder;
Give me, ye Gods and Goddesses, Gunpowder:
Great AMMON'S Son himself shall not keep me under;
I Will look in Lightning, and I Will speak in Thunder.

The two Ladies seize ALEXANDER 'S Hands, and pull him first one Way then the
other. ALEXANDER. RECITATIVE Accompanied.
So have I seen a Deal at Whist often played,
One Partner trumps a Club, and one a Spade;
Thus fix a See-saw, as these Ladies clawing,
ROXANA this, and that Way THAIS drawing,
The mighty ALEXANDER are See-sawing.

GRAND TRIO.
ALEX. ROXANA, I tell you, you had better be quiet:


ROX. That for you, that for you, Snaps her Fingers.
I Will kick up a Riot.

THA. Turn to me, my Dear;
Turn from her your Ear.

ROX. Must I this Gipsey hear,
Yet tame stand by?

THA. The Lady is in Drink;

ALEX. So, indeed, I think:

ROX. Indeed you lie.
Where Is your Conscience?

ALEX. Curse your Nonsense.

Exeunt. End of the FIRST ACT.
ACT II. SCENE, A Chamber.
PARISATIS at the Tea-Table. The MAID waiting. PARISATIS. AIR.
WITH a Love-laden Lass, dear VENUS, take Part,
Nor longer let me in Suspence-lye!
That Creature, King PORUS, I hate from my Heart,
But LYSSY I love most immensely.
Alas-a-day! was ever Lass like me?


MAID. Illustrious Princess, please to drink your Tea.


PARISATIS. I don't mind Tea; nay really, enter nous,
I don't know what I mind, or what I do:
My Reason, like a ragged Ruffle rent-is,
And all my Senses are Non Compos Mentis.

MAID. Yes, you're frustration'd; so 'twas with me, Madam,
Sick for my Sweethearts, always, 'till I had 'em:
For Love, like Drink, brings our weak Brain to Trouble,
And either blinds us, or else we see double.
AIR.
Ah me! Young Women wear much Woe;
Alack! ah, well-a-day!
Because as why; we don't know how,
Nor when, to answer, Nay.
By Wine bewitched; the next Day, Men
Resolve to drink no more;
So we weak Girls protest -- what then?
We wish to taste, encore.

Enter LYSIMACHUS; who, as he runs to embrace PARISATIS, over-sets the
Tea-Table. LYSIMACHUS. Dear PARISATIS --


PARISATIS. Lord! sure, LYSIMACHUS, the Duce is in ye!
You Have broke my Set of Babylonish China.
AIR. Melancholissimo.
My Basin blue,
My Tea-Pot too;
Ah, me! how could they fall so?
My Cups are dashed,
My Saucers smash'd,
My Sugar-Dish eke also.

Enter PORUS. PORUS. Who Is this I see?


LYSIMACHUS. Me!


PORUS. Thee!
And what is your Business, ha! Sir?

LYSIMACHUS. What Is that to you?


MAID. What Is here to do?


LYSIMACHUS. I Am here, and here will stay, Sir.


MAID. Pray, Sir, King PORUS, do you call this Carriage
The Indian Way of Wooing before Marriage?

PORUS. What would the Wench? Nothing to me your Prate is;
I Will box LYSIMACHUS for PARISATIS.

LYSIMACHUS. Mahogony, if I get a proper Purchase,
I Will coit to Earth your Charcoal Carcass.

QUARTETTO.
POR. Sallow Grecian, I abhor you:

LYSIM. Zounds, Sir, strip; I Am ready for you;
Right and Left I Will give you purely:

MAID. Old Nick 's in the Fellow, surely.

[Enter ALEXANDER, and runs between the Combatants. ALEX. Heyday!
What Is here to do?

[LYSIMACHUS, attempting to strike PORUS, hits ALEXANDER in the Face.
ALEXANDER. PORUS, I wish you had kept that Fellow's Blows off;
LYSIMACHUS has almost knocked my Nose off.

LYSIMACHUS. Great ALEXANDER, humbly I beg Pardon.


ALEXANDER. Sirrah, you're only fit for a Bear-Garden:
You shall not have my Head your Strength to try on;
Seize him: I Will make him set to with a Lion.

CLYTUS. May it please your Mirmydonship to forgive him;
CLYTUS, on both Knees, begs you will reprieve him.
Ah! were you sober; I most humbly think --

ALEXANDER. What says the Rebel? Is your King in Drink?
The Thought is Treason. I will have the Dog's-Head;
I Will pierce the Traitor, as they tap a Hogshead.
[ Seizes a Javelin, and stabs CLYTUS.
CLYTUS. So, I Am right served: Yes, it is quite through my Lungs;
Learn from my Fate, my Friends, to hold your Tongues.
AIR.
I die, depart,
Groan and start;
Quivering,
Shivering,
Sighing,
Shaking,
Crying,
Quaking;
Thus I go,
Below, below.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

After CLYTUS has sung himself to Death; ALEXANDER, in RECITATIVE Accompanied.
How could I thus to Death my Friend affair?
His Lights are lost, and all his Pimples pale.
Toss me, ye Tempests! suffocate me, Vapors!
Ye Furies, singe me with your Brimstone Tapers!
I am mad! Sad and merry, lightheaded and heavy;
On a Hand-gallop Reason is running Tantivy.
Now I mount on the Back of Bucephalus prancing,
Or methinks --
On the big-belly'd Billows I Am dancing.
MAD SONG.
They toss me on high,
'Till I knock at the Sky;
Then down, down I go,
To Antipodes below.
What with Wine and Wenches coiling,
Like a Hot-Bath my Brain's boiling.
Zounds! what is the Matter?
How my Teeth chatter!
I Am to an Ice-House turning;
And now, now, now, now, now,
I don't know why or how,
I Am like a Glass-House burning.

[ALEXANDER is carried off upon the Shoulders of his Guards. LYSIMACHUS. Behold
where yonder light-heel'd MERC'RY jumps;
I know the Poster by his feathered Pumps.

MERCURY flies across the Stage, and then Enters. MERCURY. From his Empyrean
Dome, Star-rob'd, survey
The Olympic Landlord of the Milky-Way;
In Eagle-Chariot mounted, he descends
To pay a Visit to terrestrial Friends.

Stage opens, and JUPITER descends in his Chariot. JUPITER. I Have brought my
Lightnings; Madam, don't be frighted;
As the Moon's down, I would not be benighted.
Our Bard-Historian, HOMER, has made known
In Days of Yore, we Deities came down
To save a Soldier, or to sack a Town:
Poets rode Post on Pegasus, to invite us;
And here we post it, to restore old CLYTUS.
CLYTUS, thy Spirits Animal retreated,
As if by Bite Tarantula, defeated:
Sons of the String, with Symphonies awake him,
And let your instrumental Uproar shake him.

A Crash, or Clash, of all the Orchestra. THAIS. SONG.
When on Air a Tune sloats,
Through musical Throats,
The Notes how we quavering distribute 'em?
'Till Alto non Troppo,
We finish Da Capo,
And run a Division ad Libitum.

CLYTUS reviving. AIR.
Ha! why? what? how?
Where am I now?
Methought,
I was brought,
I don't know where,
Nor do I care;
I am here, without Doubt;
So let us drink about.

THAIS. Your Life was lost, and JOVE came to restore it.


CLYTUS. Did he? Why then I humbly thank him for it.


PORUS. Ruler of Atmospheres, if PORUS' Fate is
TO enjoy the illustrious Princess PARISATIS --

LYSIMACHUS. You have her! Ink-Face? --


CLYTUS. Cousin, hold your Prate;
JOVE is your Judge, and what he Wills is Fate.

JUPITER. Then thus it is decreed by JUPITER AMMON,
You Rivals play a Rubber at Backgammon.
Let him who Wins her, make no Noise about her;
Let him who is Gammon'd, silent go without her.

CLYTUS. It shall be so. LYSIMACHUS and PORUS
Will both obey, and play the Match before us.
SONG.
I see, I see them battling,
Elbows shaking, Dice rattling;
Size Ace,
Quater Tray;
Now Doublets:
Huzza!
What
Chattering?
What
Battering?
What
Swearing?
What
Tareing?
'Till Fortune determine the Fray.

JUPITER. Our Labor finished; now, it is fitting,
As Ida's Council will be sitting,
We must return, with equal State and Train:
You played us down -- so play us up again.

GRAND CHORUS.
Tara, tantara,
Tantararararararara,
Tara, tantara, tan ti:
Tweedle dum,
Deedle dum,
Tweedle dum di.
FINIS.
