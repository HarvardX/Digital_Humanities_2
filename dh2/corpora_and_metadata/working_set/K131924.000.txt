Sally of our Alley.
OF all the girls in our town
There Is none like pretty Sally,
She is the darling of my heart;
And lives in our alley:
There Is never a lady in the land
Is half so sweet as Sally,
She is the darling of my heart,
And lives in our alley.
Her father he makes cabbage nets,
And in the streets does cry them,
Her mother she sells laces long,
To all who choose to buy them;
But sure such folks could never beget
So sweet a girl as Sally,
She is the darling, etc.
When Sally's by I leave my work,
I love her so sincerely,
My master comes like any Turk,
And bangs me most severely,
But let him bang his belly full,
I Will bear it all for Sally, she is, etc.
Of all the days that is in the week,
I dearly love but one day,
And that is the day that comes between
A Saturday and Monday:
O then I Am dressed in all my best,
To walk abroad with Sally, she is, etc.
My master carries me to church,
And often I am blamed,
Because I leave him in the lurch,
As soon as text is named:
I leave the church in sermon time,
And slink away to Sally, she is, etc.
When Christmas comes about again,
O then I shall have money,
I Will hoard it up, and box and all,
I Will give it to my Sally,
And would it were a thousand pounds,
I Would give it all to Sally, she is, etc.
My master and the neighbors all
Make game of me and Sally,
And but for her I Would better be
A slave, and row a galley;
But when my seven long years are out,
O then I Will marry Sally,
O then we'll wed, and then we'll bed,
But not in our alley.
