AN ODE ON THE DEATH OF Mr. PELHAM.
LET others hail the rising sun,
I bow to that whose course is run,
Which sets in endless night;
Whose rays benignant blessed this isle,
Made peaceful nature round us smile
With calm, but cheerful light.
No bounty past provokes my praise,
No future prospects prompt my lays,
From real grief they flow;
I catch th'alarm from Britain's fears,
My sorrows fall with Britain's tears,
And join a nation's woe.
See -- as you pass the crowded street,
Despondence clouds each face you meet,
All their lost friend deplore:
You read in every pensive eye,
You hear in every broken sigh,
That PELHAM is no more.
If thus each Briton be alarmed,
Whom but his distant influence warmed,
What grief their breasts must rend,
Who in his private virtues blessed,
By nature's dearest ties possessed
The HUSBAND, FATHER, FRIEND.
What! mute ye bards? -- no mournful verse,
No chaplets to adorn his hearse,
To crown the good and just?
Your flowers in warmer regions bloom,
You seek no pensions from the tomb,
No laurels from the dust.
When power departed with his breath,
The sons of flattery fled from death:
Such insects swarm at noon.
Not for herself my muse is grieved,
She never asked, nor ever received,
One ministerial boon.
For what peculiar strange offense,
Have we incensed Omnipotence,
To blast our coming May?
Is it a warning to the times?
Is it a punishment for crimes?
That PELHAM'S snatched away?
Uncheck'd by shame, unawed by dread,
When vice triumphant rears her head,
Vengeance can sleep no more;
The evil angel stalks at large,
The good submits, resigns his charge,
And quits th'unhallow'd shore.
The same sad morn The 6th of March, 1754, was remarkable for the publication
of the Works of a late Lord, and the death of Mr. PELHAM.
to Church and State
(So for our sins 'twas fixed by fate)
A double stroke was given;
Black as the whirlwinds of the north,
St. J -- n's fell genius issued forth,
And PELHAM'S fled to heaven!
By angels watched in Eden's bowers,
Our parents passed their peaceful hours,
Nor guilt nor pain they knew;
But on the day which ushered in
The hell-born train of mortal sin,
The heavenly guard withdrew.
Look down, much honored Shade, below!
Still let thy pity aid our woe;
Stretch out thy healing hand;
Resume those feelings, which on earth
Proclaimed thy patriot love and worth,
And saved a sinking land.
Search, with thy more than mortal eye,
The breasts of all thy friends: descry
What there has got possession.
See if thy unsuspecting heart,
In some for truth mistook not art,
For principle, profession.
From these, the pests of human kind,
Whom royal bounty cannot bind,
Protect our parent King:
Unmask their treach'ry to his sight,
Drag forth the vipers into light,
And crush them ere they sting.
If such his trust and honors share,
Again exert thy guardian care,
Each venomed heart disclose;
On Him, on Him, our all depends,
Oh save him from his treacherous friends,
He cannot fear his foes.
Whoever shall at the helm preside,
Still let thy prudence be his guide,
To stem the troubled wave;
But chiefly whisper in his ear,
"That GEORGE is open, just, sincere,
"And dares to scorn a knave."
No selfish views t'oppress mankind,
No mad ambition fired thy mind,
To purchase fame with blood;
Thy bosom glowed with purer heat;
Convinced that to be truly great,
Is only to be good.
To hear no lawless passions call,
To serve thy King, yet feel for all,
Such was thy glorious plan!
Wisdom with generous love took part,
Together worked thy head and heart,
The Minister and Man.
Propitious heaven extend thy care,
Accept a suppliant nation's prayer,
A nation's loss supply;
To us another PELHAM give,
Who may like him applauded live,
Like him lamented die.
FINIS.
