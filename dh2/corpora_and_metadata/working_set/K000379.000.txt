HINTS TO A SCHOOLMASTER.
I.
SHOULD You, my Friend, employ your Time
In teaching tuneful POPE to rhyme,
And harmonize his Style:
Or should our Poet cease to write,
And teach brave VERNON how to fight,
The wondering World would smile.
II.
Not less absurd may I be thought,
Who bred, from Colleges remote,
In honest simple Truth;
Never studied Science at the Schools,
And yet presume to give You Rules
For educating Youth.
III.
Yet if the Maxims I advance
May be of Use, or right by chance,
They cannot give Offense:
Forgive me then, for Reason's sake;
For Reason dictates what I speak,
And says, it is Common Sense.
IV.
A Man of moderate Skill may teach
His Pupils all the Parts of Speech,
Perhaps old HOMER's Songs:
But there are other things, my Friend,
Important things! that far transcend
This wondrous Gift of Tongues.
V.
O! skilled in all the various Parts
Of Learning, and the liberal Arts,
That polish Human Kind,
Early instruct your tender Youth
In Heaven's unerring Law of Truth,
Engrave it on their Mind.
VI.
Ere Vice the spotless Paper foul,
Imprint the Volume of the Soul
With VIRTUE's noble Mark!
The Mark, extending by degrees,
Shall grow like Letters carved on Trees,
That widen with the Bark.
VII.
As VIRTUE shall her Charms display,
(Charms! which increasing every Day,
Shall make her more approved)
Your Pupils shall adore the Dame,
Shall court her with a Lover's Flame,
As worthiest to be loved.
VIII.
To make her Beauty more complete,
The Handmaid Sciences shall wait
Around her Day and Night;
To polish and adorn the Fair,
To make her pleasing Charms appear
In more conspicuous Light.
IX.
Be VIRTUE, then, their chief Regard;
For VIRTUE is her own Reward,
Were there no other given:
Let nothing mean their Souls entice;
Teach them to tremble more at Vice,
Than at the Bolts of Heaven.
X.
For conscious Merit is a Meed
That amply crowns each honest Deed
With Joy of acting well:
While conscious Guilt allows no Rest,
But stings and burns the Villain's Breast,
Worse than the Flames of Hell.
XI.
A Sense of Honor, and of Shame,
Will best your erring Youth reclaim,
Whenever they give Offense:
By gentle Methods guide your School,
Nor follow BUSBY's bloody Rule,
To flog them into Sense.
XII.
No. Be not rigid, stern and sour;
Display your Mercy more than Power,
And imitate your GOD:
For Tyrants cannot be approved,
They may be feared, but never loved,
Who daily use the Rod.
XIII.
Teach them a reasonable Awe
Of true Religion, as by Law
Established in the Land.
Yet never puzzle Truth with Lies;
But leave all heavenly Mysteries
For Heaven to understand.
XIV.
Avoid the Rock where Thousands split,
On purpose to display their Wit,
Or Folly to expose;
Where he who wrangles best, confutes,
And with rash Eloquence disputes
Of what he nothing knows.
XV.
Beware your Pupils tender Age
Imbibe no superstitious Rage,
Which Fools Religion call;
Such narrow Principles remove,
Inculcate universal Love,
And Charity to all.
XVI.
Bid them assert their Country's Cause,
Teach them our Government and Laws,
All servile Precepts shun,
Such as, contrived by holy Knaves,
Persuade us, Subjects are but Slaves,
And All were made for One.
XVII.
The Law of Nature Alluding to the Law of Nature and Nations, lately published
by Dr. Turnbull.
let them know,
Instruct their Bosoms how to glow
And pant for honest Fame;
Make it their Business and Delight
To vindicate the native Right,
Which freeborn Britons claim.
XVIII.
Yet shun the furious Zeal of such
Who act the Patriot overmuch,
And Monarchy invade;
Who mindless of their Laws at home,
Would copy those of Greece and Rome,
Where Commonwealths-men swayed.
XIX.
Where Civil Wars were often waged,
Where mad Ambition hotly raged,
While Public Spirit cooled;
Where Tyrants now usurped Command,
Where now a Senate swayed the Land,
And now a Rabble ruled.
XX.
Where, wanting Pilots at the Helm,
To guide and moderate the Realm,
The Bark of State was tossed
By Waves of Faction to-and-fro,
Sometimes too high, sometimes too low,
And frequently was lost.
XXI.
Our Fathers wisely dared to raise
Their Fabric on the triple Base
Of COMMONS, LORDS, and KING;
And hence BRITANNIA's happy Fate,
Hence all the Music of our State,
Hence all our Blessings spring.
XXII.
We see a MONARCH grace the Throne,
Who makes our Happiness his own,
Our Property defends:
Maintains, in spite of Party Hate,
The well-pois'd Balance of the State,
On which our Bliss depends.
XXIII.
Let HIM be cheerfully obeyed,
Instruct your Pupils how to aid
Their KING with loyal Care;
That all may some Assistance yield,
For Council these, and those to wield
The Thunder of the War.
XXIV.
So shall your SCHOOL increase each Day,
And flourish like the verdant Bay,
Or branching Vine in Spring;
Your Youth be virtuously inclined,
Be real PATRIOTS of Mankind,
And loyal to their KING.
XXV.
But whither would my Thoughts aspire?
Rash daring Muse, resign the Lyre;
For Shame! be not so bold;
Nor useless Hints to Him impart,
Who knows so well to cast the Heart
In VIRTUE's genuine Mould.
