THE WIDOW's VOW. A FARCE, IN TWO ACTS, AS IT IS ACTED AT THE THEATER ROYAL,
HAY-MARKET.

LONDON: ^^INTED FOR G. G. J. AND J. ROBINSON, PATERNOSTER ROW. 1786.

PROLOGUE,
Written by Mr. HOLCROFT,
Spoken by Mr. BANNISTER, jun.
PROLOGUES, with caustic touch, have often tried
To probe your spleen, prove knaves and fools allied;
Have twisted words and wit ten thousand ways,
To show that these are most degenerate days!
A different task be ours. -- We'll prove that you
Are wise and happy. Nay! though strange, it is true!
First on your safety think! now belles appear
By ample bulwarks guarded, front and rear!
Now male and female amble, side by side,
Exempt from harm, by breast-works fortified!
Here polygons defend Miss Molly's breast!
There horn-works hush the husband's fears to rest!
By ramparts, daily raised, he is freed from cares;
If he will but grant sufficient for repairs.
Our strength thus proved, proceed we to disclose
How new-made wealth through new-made channels flows!
How rich we are, in medal-rust and rare things!
In copper coins, gilt pence and -- Queen-Anne-farthings!
How shells, stuffed monkies, and Cremonas old,
In hand of Auctioneer, are current gold!
He "Going! going!" cries. "The hammer's up!
"This fine antique! this Roman -- caudle-cup!"
A gem so rare makes connoisseurs turn pale,
Fearful, alike, to purchase or to fail!
Hope trembles, starts, from lip to lip rebounds,
Till down she is knocked by -- Ah! -- one thousand pounds!
The envied purchaser, with joy e^ate,
Pays for his prize by -- felling his estate!
While Smirk, in florid style, words nicely placed,
Protests theee lot does, anner to his taste! Mimick^^^
Yes! sure you're happy! and should rest content,
Now landscapes are reduced fifteen per cent:
And Claude's and Titian's newfound wonders may
By new-made Peers be bought -- if new-made Peers to pay.
Assuming sorrow. One thing, indeed, may well your peace invade,
Pawnbrokers! threaten you to leave off trade! W^t
Returning to his former cheerful tone. All things considered, now, while
safety smiles,
And wealth inundates thus our Queen of isles;
While Vickery head defects so soon repairs,
And half unpeoples Greenland of her bears;
While exhibitions, galas and reviews,
Lisle-street, Vauxhall, the Abbey, Handel, Hughes,
Flutes, fiddles, trombos, double-drums, bassoons,
Mara, the speaking-figure, fish-balloons,
Earth-baths, live-eagles, such as never flew,
L' Hercule du Roy! and General Jackoo!
While these create a round of such delight,
Sure, we may hope, you will not frown tonight!
While farces numerous as these go down,
Our farce may in its turn amuse the town;
And, smiling thus on Folly's vast career,
Sure not on us, alone, you will be severe!

ACT I.
SCENE I. A Hall in a Castle.
Enter JEROME and FLORA. ^^^RA. I Cannot go at present, Mr. Jerome, for I expect
my Lady every moment to ring, if I should be out of the way she will be an^ and
as I am but new in her service --


^EROME. She angry! Oh you don't know her -- When you have been a day or two
with you will find she is never angry -- She is best tempered creature -- and
were it not for aversion to us men, she would not have a (...).


FLORA. Do you consider that as a fault, b^ Jerome?


JEROME. To be sure I do -- For my part think she had much better be too fond
of us, ^ the rest of her sex are.


FLORA. Pray, Mr. Jerome, what caused (...) aversion to the men?


JEROME. I Will tell you, Flora, if it will not (...) you melancholy.


FLORA. Oh, no, Mr. Jerome -- I like a ^^lancholy story -- I like dearly to
cry, when it is (...) on my own account.


JEROME. Well then -- When my Lady was ^^ly fifteen she fell deep in love with
a fine ha^ some young fellow, inferior to her both in (...) and fortune; but my
good old Lord, her fa^^ who doated upon her, was afraid a disapp^^^^ment might
break her heart, and so c^nsente^ her having him; but he proved so bad a husb^^
that my poor old Master soon died with grief.


FLORA. Poor man!


JEROME. Don't cry yet, there is someth^^^ worse to come -- My Lady, on this,
took such dislike to her husband, that he died of (...) too.


FLORA. Indeed, Mr. Jerome, this is (...) moving. cries.


JEROME. On this --


^LORA. I hope there is nothing worse to (...)?


^EROME. On this, my Lady made a vow to (...) herself up from the whole sex.


^LORA. Well, that is more affecting than any (...)


^^ROME. And she immediately retired to this ^y castle, where, except the house
of Donna ^^lla next door, we have not a neighbor for (...); and even there we
are strangers -- for my ^ I have never so much as seen Donna Isabella,
^^changed a word with any of the servants since ^ came to the place -- though
indeed they have ^een here above eight days.


^^ORA. But how long has my Lady kept this ^ of avoiding all your sex?


^^ROME. Eighteen months.


^^ORA. Eighteen weeks! what a time!


^^ROME. Months.


^^ORA. Months! she has certainly lost her (...).


^^ROME. Not she.


^^ORA. O but I am sure she must have lost (...) of them.


^^ROME. I tell you no. -- But I must leave you (...) Mrs. Flora, for yonder is
Don Antonio, and ^^^ieve he is coming this way.


FLORA. I thought no man was admitted in the castle but you, Mr. Jerome?


JEROME. Yes; Don Antonio lives here -- then he is my Lady's uncle; and you
know th^^ can be no fear of her falling in love with him, ^ he is a relation.


FLORA. But you are no relation, Mr. j^rome.


JEROME. Why, as you say, she might f^l^ love with me -- Stranger things have
happened and to tell you the truth, she does not seem ^^sitive she shall not, for
she bids me keep out of (...) sight as much as possible, for fear I should put
(...) in mind of that handsome villain that brought (...) to this retirement.


FLORA. Here comes the old Gentleman!


JEROME. Then I must go, for he'il be with wan^ to say something to you -- he
is for ever ru^^ after all the maids -- I am sorry to leave you -- ^ am,
indeed, Flora; indeed I am -- Oh it would a happy thing for me if I could bring
m^se^^ care as little for the women, as my Lady does ^ the men. Exit Jero^^


FLORA. A fine sweetheart, truly, I have go and if this old fright proves
another, I Will be (...) with him.


Enter Antonis -- She courtesys ANTONIO. Hah! -- what! -- what is all this ^
what have we here? -- what have we here? ^ ^retty girl -- a very pretty girl
indeed! -- My ^iece's new maid, I suppose -- Aye, aye, I had the ^ther sent
about her business -- She must be like ^er mistress forsooth, and have nothing
to say to a ^^an -- going up to Flora My dear, come this way* I think yours is
a new face --


FLORA. Yes, Sir -- and I think yours is an old ^^e.


ANTONIO. Hem -- hem. -- Pray what is your ^^me?


FLORA. A very good name -- and I intend ne^^r to change it for a bad one. --


ANTONIO. Look in my face -- What do you ^^ush for?


FLORA. For you.


ANTONIO Come, come, no pertness -- but let (...) bid you welcome to the
castle. offers to salute (...).


FLORA. No, indeed you shall not.


ANTONIO. I will bid you welcome to the ^^stle. after a struggle he salutes her.


FLORA. Upon my word, Sir, you are very (...) -- How would you like I should
serve you (...)*


ANTONIO. Do -- Do -- serve me so -- you are very ^^^come.


Eater JEROME. JEROME. Flora, there is a young woman at the gate, who says she
lives with Dona Isabella, and wants to speak to you upon some particular
business -- Can your Honor spare her with no inconvenience to yourself?


ANTONIO. Yes -- Yes -- she may go -- Exi^ Flora and Jerome A young woman at
the gate, now do I want to bid her welcome to the cast^e -- ^ a maid of Donna
Isabella, our neighbor -- by the bye I must bring about an acquaintance with
Donna Isabella and the Countess my niece, if I can, for I am told Isabella is a
very beautiful lady -- and I should like to bid her welcome to the castle --
but, notwithstanding all the pains I have takes, ever since she has arrived, to
procure a sight of her, I have not been able -- I would, however, fo^^^ myself
into the house, but it seems she has a young brother, the Marquis, come down on
a vi^^t to her within these three days, and he might take upon him to resent my
gallantry -- and I cannot say I am fond of resentments, rage and hatred -- no,
no, the soster passions possess me wholly. Exi^^


SCENE II. A Chamber at DONNA ISABELLA's.
Enter ISABELLA followed by the MARQUIS. MARQUIS. But my dear sister, did not
you seduce me to this melancholy spot, on a promise (...) ^ou would procure me
an introduction to the rich ^idow, the charming Countess? -- Interest first
^rompted my wishes, but since I have beheld her, ^ is love.


ISABEL. Beheld her!


MARQUIS. Yes, beheld her -- walking in her ^^rden -- sitting negligently in an
arbor.


ISABEL. But how? -- How contrive to see (...)? --


MARQUIS. From the top of our house, through ^elescope -- but, my dear sister,
do bring us a ^^^le nearer, or I Will purchase a speaking trumpet, (...) make
love to her through it, though my ^^ssion be heard by every soul within a
quarter of ^^ile.


ISABEL. I tell you I have great hopes.


MARQUIS. But why not accept of her ac^^^intance, and prevail on her yourself
to see ^?


^SABEL. I tell you again, the letters I expect ^n her uncle at Madrid will
have more weight ^n volumes I could say -- She dare not disobey (...), and must
see you.


MARQUIS. And yet I would not compel her to ^ Unless she consents to my
acquaintance free^ without being constrained by force, or de^^^ed by stratagem,
I had rather have recourse ^he top of the house and my telescope again.


ISABEL. Do not let your scrupulous honor overcome all your future prospects --
Notwithstanding these letters will strongly recommend you, yet it will be with
her own consent only she will yield to the recommendation.


MARQUIS. But when do you expect the letters?


ISABEL. Every instant -- my servants are no^ gone to the Post Office.


MARQUIS. I Will fly and see if they are ^^turned.


ISABEL. Do; for as soon as the letters are ^^rived, I would not have you lose
a moment (...) away, and know your fate at once -- yet if she (...) but see you
I think with such a person as your^ there can be little to fear.


MARQUIS. But they tell me she is so auste^^ since this rigid vow -- so awful
-- she will petr^^^ me with a look.


ISABEL. Pshaw -- away, and see if the lette^ are come.


MARQUIS. I will, and if they are, and I g^^^ admittance, I Am resolved I will
obtain (...) husband within a week, in return, my dear sist^^ for your kindness
to me. Exit Marqu^^


Enter INIS. ISABEL. Well, Inis -- I am impatient to he^^* What success?


INIS. Delightful, Madam -- I have been intro^^ced to the young Countess -- I
first communi^^ted the intelligence of the pretended plot form^^g against her
to her waiting woman, who was ^^fficiently alarmed at it, to take me to her
Lady ^^mediately.


ISABEL. Well.


INIS. And so, Madam, as soon as I was in^^^duced I fell a crying -- I thought
that was the ^^st way.


ISABEL. Very well.


INIS. And then, before I discovered what I had say, I made her promise not to
betray me, ^^^ch she did most solemnly, and without the ^^st reluctance -- and
now, Madam, says I, I (...) servant with your neighbor, Donna Isabella,
^^^ighty Lady, who turns every thing serious and ^^ed into ridicule; and she
has resolved to make ^^^t of you for pretending an aversion to men, (...) for
that purpose she has procured recom^^ndations for you to receive the visits of
the ^^^ng Marquis her brother, but instead of him, ^ purposes to come herself,
disguised as a man, ^vail on you to consent to be married to her, ^ then throw
off the mask, and make you and (...) vow the jest of the whole kingdom.


ISABEL. This is all right -- go on.


^NIS. On this she thanked me a thousand times ^ the discovery.


^SABEL. But did she say she would receive ^?


INIS. Oh yes -- she has promised to receive you on my account, that my
divulging the scheme may not be detected.


ISABEL. And she is absolutely resolved to receive me under the title of my
brother?


INIS. You may depend upon it -- but how are you to proceed now?


ISABEL. Send my brother to her immediately.


INIS. Your brother!


ISABEL. Yes -- The Countess, from what you have told her, will suppose him a
woman, receive him, and consequently suffer a thousand endearing familiarities;
till, charmed by the graces of his mind and person, she shall love him without
knowing it, and, when she detects the impostor, be unable to part with him.


INIS. And if she is like me, she will think it the happiest day of her life --
but have you prepared your brother how to act his part?


ISABEL. He has nothing to act, being the very person he represents, and
therefore shall not know of the art by which he is introduced -- for, except
being a little too attentive to dress and etiquette, a circumstance which, with
his youthful appearance, favors our design, he is one of the mo^^ amiable
young men in the world, and the le^^ idea of imposition would shock his honor,
and put an end to my scheme.


INIS. Then he is not to know he is to be taken for a woman.


ISABEL. Certainly not -- Hush, here he is, now for my credentials. taking out
letters from her packet.


Enter MARQUIS. MARQUIS. Oh, my dear sister, there are no letters arrived.


ISABEL. Yes, here they are -- Gives a packet ^f letters my maid has just
brought them me.


MARQUIS. O with what joy I receive them -- they are all right? -- There will
be no mistake I ^ope? -- Nothing to make me appear ridiculous? -- I would not
appear ridiculous for the world.


ISABEL. All is right -- No, no.


MARQUIS. They are addressed to her uncle!


ISABEL. Yes, because it will be far more de^icate to be introduced through his
means -- ^ut there is one enclosed to her.


MARQUIS. Do You think she will see me?


ISABEL. Yes; I dare say -- There is little doubt ^f it.


INIS. By my dream last night, I Would lay my life he will.


MARQUIS. Why, what did you dream?


INIS. I dreamt she ordered her servants to drag your Lordship by force out of
the house, and duck you in the great fish pond for a whole hour.


MARQUIS. Is that a sign? --


INIS. O yes -- Dreams always go by contraries.


MARQUIS. Going, returns. But I know she is so haughty and reserved, that,
should she admit me, I shall appear confused and awkward. --


INIS. So much the better -- she expects you will be awkward.


MARQUIS. Expects I shall be awkward!


ISABEL. Pshaw, pshaw -- Hesitate no longe^ with your fears, but away -- you
know your first court must be to the uncle, and when you have been a little
time in the house your apprehension will vanish. -- Away, away.


MARQUIS. But if she should not condescen^ to see me?


INIS. Oh, my Lord, you may depend upon (...) she will, because of my dream.


Exit Marquis on one side and Isabella and Inis (...) the other. SCENE III. The
Hall in the Castle.
Enter FLORA and JEROME. ^LORA. Ha, ha, ha, ha.


^EROME. Ha, ha, ha, ha -- But is all this matter act?


^LORA. As true as I am alive, Jerome -- I have ^e nothing but laugh ever since
I heard it -- But ^ou think, Jerome, she will be dressed all over like ^n?


^EROME. To be sure.


^LORA. What, every thing?


^EROME. Yes -- -- Every thing -- Egad, I long to (...) a peep at her!


^LORA. Aye, and so would Antonio too, if he (...). --


^EROME. Aye, that he would -- he would be so fond ^e young Marquis there would be
no keeping away from her -- but he does not knew of it, say?


^LORA. No; no soul knows of it yet but my (...) and I, and now I have told it
to you; and (...) to tell it to all the servants as soon as she ^es, that they
may not think my Lady has ^en her vow, by admitting a man -- Lord, I ^der how I
should look in men's clothes!


JEROME. There Is the Priest's old great clo^^ doublet, and jack-boots hanging
up behind t^^ door, if you have a mind to try, and I Will step ^ of the way till
you have put them on.


A loud rapping at the doo^ FLORA. Here she is -- Here she is -- Oh dea^ Oh
dear -- how ashamed I am for her.


JEROME. And I wish I may die if so ben't ^


Covering his ey^ FLORA. And yet somehow I long to see her


Another rappin^ FLORA. Run, Jerome, run.


JEROME. This moment turning back bu^ am so afraid I shall laugh.


FLORA. O no -- Don't laugh -- if you do y^^ will spoil all, and my Lady will
never forgi^^ you.


JEROME. Well -- I will not -- I will not, if I ^ help it -- I Will look so -- just so,
if I can -- as s^ri^^ as a judge -- will that do? looking serious.


FLORA. Yes; that will do. Rapping again


JEROME. Going. Ha, ha, ha, ha -- I cannot b^ laughing a little though -- but
not before he^ I Will be as serious as a judge before her. (...) Egad I am afraid
-- I am afraid I shall laugh.


Exit, stifling a laug^ FLORA. Now where shall I run to have a pe^ at her? --
in here. Exit Flo^^


^er JEROME, bowing before the MARQUIS, ^ith his face on one side, as if he was
afraid to look ^t him for fear he should laugh. ^ARQUIS. Let Don Antonio know I
have let^ for him.


^EROME. Yes, your Honor -- Lordship. Lift-^p his eyes, looking at him with
side glances, and ^ d^fficulty stifling a laugh. Your Honor, ^ Lordship -- Let
Don Antonio -- know -- you ^^ve -- letters -- for -- him. Suppressing a laugh.


^ARQUIS. Yes; is not that plain?


^^ROME. Yes. still suppressing a laugh. And ^ be very glad to wait upon your
Honor.


Laughs right out and exit. ^ARQUIS. A strange fellow this -- How my ^t beats!


^LORA. from a door. Oh that she would ^ turn this way, that I might see her
face -- Oh ^mpudent slut.


Enter JEROME with a grin on his face. ^EROME. Noble Lord, Don Antonio will be

Enter ANTONIO. The Marquis bows very respectfully whilst Je^ is laughing and
making faces behind. MARQUIS. Letters, my Lord, from your b^^ther at Madrid.


ANTONIO. Signior. Taking the letters.


MARQUIS. aside while Antonio reads. Heaven whence this palpitation? If such
are the feelin^ of my bosom on knowing myself in the same ho^^ with her, what
must be my agitation on a ne^^ approach!


ANTONIO. My letters inform me it is the M^^quis who does me the honor of this
visit -- ^ Lord, your Lordship --


JEROME. Ha, ha, ha.


ANTONIO. What Is the matter with you?


JEROME. Sir, I was only --


ANTONIO. Only what? Leave the room.


JEROME. Aside. Well I thought the ^ Don would have found out a woman in any
d^^guise. E^


ANTONIO. My Lord, you may command ^ services and friendship, but I fear you
will not ^ them so highly as I could wish, as you must be ^ barred the
acquaintance and society of my niec^ ^ You are no stranger to the vow she has
taken ^


MARQUIS. I am not -- and yet I flatter my ^ the manner in which I am spoken of
in these ^ters --


ANTONIO. Be certain, Sir, my niece shall ^^ceive them, urged with all my
authority for an ^^^^^view. Will your Lordship take a turn in the ^den while I
deliver them and enforce their con^ ^ts?


MARQUIS. I will -- and should you prove suc^^^ful, Don Antonio, I shall ever

^OUNTESS. Man! -- Ha, ha, ha, I dare say he ^s a little awkward?


^NTONIO. Awkward! No; he is as elegant in ^eportment, and as fine, as finished
a young ^w as ever I saw.


COUNTESS. After looking over the letter. Certainly, I shall comply with my
uncle's request -- Let his Lordship be admitted.


ANTONIO. Niece, I always knew you could no^ keep your vow -- I always knew the
very first man that came in your way -- crash it would go directly, but let me
persuade you to break it by degrees and not let the world say you made no
strugg^^ first.


COUNTESS. Struggle! Now, my dear Uncle with all your deep discernment,
particularly i^ regard to our sex, to see you at last imposed upon delights me.


ANTONIO. Imposed upon!


COUNTESS. Yes; for this self-same Marqu^^ is a woman.


ANTONIO. A woman!


COUNTESS. Yes; this "fine, elegant cre^ture."


ANTONIO. That is, then, the very reason w^^ I thought her so -- "a fine
creature," -- now that ^ intuition, instinct, love without knowing it -- But,
my dear niece, are you sure you are r^ght* Are you sure you don't deceive me?
Don't di^appoint me -- I cannot bear a disappointment in ^ matter like this -- I
am vastly pleased, and a di^appointment might be fatal.


COUNTESS. I assure you again a woman -- (...) to the Marquis -- and has
undertaken this sche^^ ^^rely to make love to me, and turn me into ridi^^le.


ANTONIO. Now I think of it again, she was de^^ish awkward -- and I believe
wore her sword on ^ wrong side.


COUNTESS. It is she herself depend upon it.


ANTONIO. To be sure it is -- and I Will be hanged ^t did not strike me to be a
woman the moment ^id my eyes on her -- for she came up to me ^ping and sliding,
and tossing her head, just as ^ fine ladies do. Mimicks. Well -- But what you
intend to do? I know what I intend to ^


COUNTESS. I shall carry on the scheme, and ^^end to be deceived, till I turn
the joke she ^^gns for me, on herself.


ANTONIO. Yes; and I intend to have my ^e too.


COUNTESS. But you must keep the secret.


ANTONIO. I will not say a word.


COUNTESS. Take his Lordship into the sa^ ^, and I Will wait upon him immediately.


ANTONIO. Aye, my dear -- and you need not ^ in a hurry -- Egad, I like the
joke of all ^gs.

FLORA. Well, I declare she looks as like man!


COUNTESS. I shall certainly laugh in h^^ face.


JEROME. Oh no, don't laugh -- Never g^ your mind to laughing -- I did not even
smile, ^ kept my countenance as steady -- just thus -- D^ not I, Flora? Oh --
it is such a weakness to laugh Look just so -- as I do now --

^LORA. Aye, in mens' clothes, like the mas^ and so there could be no harm you
know.


^RSULA. I did not know the servant was a ^an too!


^LORA. Why, I am not sure of it -- but I ^g it so when I let him kiss me, and
I thought ^hen I promised to meet him in the grove -- ^ will even go -- for I
dare say it is only a wo^


URSULA. Aye, now I think of it again, I a^ sure it is not a man -- Do you

FLORA. Very true; and I wish, Ursula, yo^ would go instead of me to the grove,
for I am s^ busy just at this time --


URSULA. And yet old Jerome says, and I never knew Jerome mistaken in my life,
he says i^ is a man -- however, I am not afraid of him if i^ is, and I will go
instead of you.


FLORA. No, Ursula -- I will go after all -- (...) if it should prove a man,

that I did not take it all upon myself.

perfumes from my army -- or in case ^ repulse, would engage at any time to
raise a ^ and escape pursuit, only by commanding ^y man to shake his head, and

MARQUIS. Ha, ha, ha, ha -- I protest (...) more can I -- Sure fate directed me
to this heav^^ ^pot, where ceremony has no share in polite^

Madam, ^ charming society has inspired me. Salutes ^


^OUNTESS. Now, if you were really a man, ^t would you deserve for that?


MARQUIS. Madam! Astonished.


COUNTESS. I say, if you were really a m^^ what would you deserve for that

ANTONIO. Certainly, my dear, if you have (...) used ill.


COUNTESS. Most scandalously -- Frighten her a ^le. Aside to Antonio.


MARQUIS. Upon my honor, Sir --


ANTONIO. Zounds, Sir, my niece is one of the ^st reserved, prudent young women

ANTONIO. I have received many a blow from ^ady, but never such a one as this!

ANTONIO. A Lady, oh no -- you are a tyge^ a fury --

COUNTESS. Why, Uncle, the tables are fa^^ turned upon you.


ANTONIO. Yes, Niece, and I Am much oblig^ to you, for your advice in the

Going. MARQIUS. Come back, Sir, I insist upon yo^ coming back, and recalling
what you have sa^d* ^ist upon your begging me pardon for your im^ ^inent
insinuation. --


^NTONIO. What insinuation? -- That I think ^ a female? -- I am sure there is
no offense ^nt in that -- for, when I suppose you a wo^ ^, I suppose you what I
like better than any^ ^g in the world; what I am never happy with ^ and what I
even make myself poor, de^ ^ed, and ridiculous, in the daily pursuit of.


MARQUIS. And pray, Sir, in what, do I ap^ ^ like a woman?


^NTONIO. And pray, Sir, in what, does any ^our modern coxcombs appear like a

you ^ last.


MARQUIS. You too, rascal! --


JEROME. Well, I declare with her sword i^ her hand, she is as fine a creature
as ever I saw! -- Oh you audacious minx.


MARQUIS. Scoundrel --


JEROME. Sure, your Honor, she must be t^ Maid of Orleans.


MARQUIS. I am no maid, Sir.


JEROME. I am sorry for your misfortune.


MARQUIS. Don Antonio, this treatment ^ suppose you inflict as a just
recompense for ^ presumption in daring to hope for an alliance ^ your family,
spite of the prejudice which I kn^ the Countess had conceived -- I cannot deny
t^ justice of the accusation -- I came into he ho^ with the vain hope --


COUNTESS. By no means vain -- I am ready ^ comply, be your hopes what they
will.


MARQUIS. Can I believe what you say real?


COUNTESS. Certainly -- Were you going to say (...) hoped to marry me? If you
were, call the ^^^est, and we'll be married immediately.


ANTONIO. Aye, if that is what your Lord^^^p wants, the Priest shall tack you
together in (...) minutes.


MARQUIS. This sudden consent staggers me -- ^ was not prepared for it -- one
likes a little pre^^^ation before marriage as well as before death.


Aside. COUNTESS. What! you are cast down -- ^^med -- want to recant -- but I
will not let you -- (...) shall marry me -- I insist upon it.


MARQUIS. What, directly?


COUNTESS. Yes, directly -- I am in a hurry.

ANTONIO. Then this, I suppose, is your br^ther?


JEROME. Aye, in womens' clothes -- O de^ another fine sight!


COUNTESS. Oh Heavens, if it is a man, ta^ him out of the room or I shall faint.


MARQUIS. Sister Isabella, when I shall rela^ to you the strange reception I
have met with ^ this house, you will be amazed -- but I think y^ will sincerely
rejoice at the final event of my vi^ when I tell you it is a solemn promise
from t^ Lady to become my wife.


ISABEL. I give you joy most unfeigned


Pulls off her vei^ COUNTESS. It is a woman.


ANTONIO. Aye, that it is -- Madam, let me ^ you welcome to the castle. Goes
and salutes (...)


COUNTESS. To the Marquis. Why, ^ are you -- After trembling as if much
terrified ^ you a woman?


ISABEL. Countess, I knew you never wo^ have consented to have seen the
Marquis, had ^ been introduced into the house as a man, therei^ I formed this
stratagem, unknown to him, (...) to bring you together.


MARQUIS. To the Countess. Do not droop, ^ dearest wife.


COUNTESS. And are you really the Marquis? ^at a strange blunder have I made!


MARQUIS. I am the Marquis -- and it shall be ^ future care to banish for ever
from your me^ ^y, the recollection of that marriage which has ^n the source of
so much woe to you.


ANTONIO. Donna Isabella, we are all infinite^ ^bliged to you for this
stratagem, by which you ^e induced the Countess, innocently to break a ^, which
she could not have kept without draw^ ^ upon herself both ridicule and
melancholy -- ^ dear Niece, depend upon it, there is but one ^ a woman is
authorized to take.


COUNTESS. And what vow is that one Uncle?


ANTONIO. A vow to LOVE, HONOR and OBEY.
