PROLOGUE.
By a FAIRY. FAVORED mortals! ye, whose eyes
Pervade our nightly mysteries,
Would ye taste the simple scene,
"Be sure your bosoms be serene;"
Let not cruel frown, or sneer,
Come the fairy-revels near!
Hear, and obey our great command,
Or look and dread this magic wand!
The mighty power, herein contained,
Poets, of old, have well explained.
Thus I charm box, gall'ry, pit! Waves a wand.

Patient and attentive sit:
Be to our errors very blind,
To our endeavors very kind,
Or all our fancies disappear,
Untimely lost in empty air.

THE FAIRY FAVOR.
A GROVE. GOSS'MOUR and MILKAH, lying on banks in mournful attitudes. SONG.
GOSS'MOUR. FROM KENNA's groves, ah! see,
How fast the beauties flee,
While we our favorite moan;
No more shall moonlight sport
Revive the Fairy-court --
Alas! our ORIEL's gone!

Shall our peerless queen remain
Still oppressed with doubt and pain?
She, whose visage, pure and bright,
Emulates the snow-drop white;
She, whom, trim in regal state,
The daisy fails to imitate;
She, whose dancing on the green
With such wonder has been seen,
That her graceful revelry
Peering Morn unwillingly
Has interrupted -- Oh! shall she.
Sunken deep in misery,
Never learn what is become
Of her boy of rosy bloom,
Her much-loved ORIEL, lawful heir
To KENNA's grove and regal chair?

MILKAH. Soon may OBERON untie
The twisted knot of witchery,
Which TITANIA's sense has bound,
So many moon^, in sleep profound!
Wondrous means! which, for her sake,
The monarch was compelled to take,
To calm the outrage of her grief,
And give her wounded mind relief;
So frantic were her cries, so wild,
When first she missed her lovely child.

GOSS'MOUR. This night, soon as in floods of sleep
Mortals 'gan their senses steep,
Our little favorite, gentle PUCK,
Frequent herald of good luck,
Wandered forth, in duteous love,
To search the mazes of our grove;
Never to return, but to relate
Some tidings of our ORIEL's fate.

MILKAH. Or I mistake, or PUCK and you,
My GOSS'MOUR, if report say true,
Have sometime passed the summer-day,
On beds of flowers, in amorous play.

GOSS'MOUR. Often beneath the primrose shade
Softly-sighing has he strayed,
Breathing such sweet vows of love,
As filled with incense KENNA's grove;
Hence is ROBIN well inclined
To soothe and please his GOSS'MOUR's mind;
And sure his errand well has sped,
For here he scuds with nimble tread.

Enter PUCK. SONG.
PUCK. Quick, and light as the air,
In and out, here and there,
Have I tript, till I Am weary to death;
Lend, lend me your hand,
For I hardly can stand --
Lack-a-day! I am quite out of breath.

GOSS'MOUR. My gentle ROBIN, I am grieved --
Here rest thy head till you are relieved.
Has aught, beside the length of way,
Which thou tonight have measured, say,
Alarmed thee, or thy steps misled,
Or caused thy foot awry to tread?
Or poisonous thing, or pest unclear,
Tainted KENNA's wholesome air? --
Trust me, I joy to see thee safe --

PUCK. Ha! ha! -- I cannot choose but laugh --
How credulous and blind you are!
Mortals in love scarce blinder are:
So often, as, through the live-long night,
Thou'st known me range in airy flight,
Or DIAN's stated circle run,
Ere forty minutes well were done,
By 'hest of royal OBERON:
Or, for thy sake, in blaze of day,
The butterfly, with amorous play,
In many a various-winding-ring,
Have chased to steal his painted wing,
Of new device, and beauty rare,
To form a robe for GOSS'MOUR fair --
By loyalty or love inspired,
When have thou known thy ROBIN tired?
Or when did any poisonous thing,
Or noisome pest, on vapour's wing,
Wafted through these windings clear,
Come the fairy-essence near?

GOSS'MOUR. Mischievous elf! no more shall thou
To GOSS'MOUR breathe thy faithless vow;
No more, in lily-persum'd vale,
Repeat thy soft deceitful tale.
Can mortals more perfidious prove?
To win, then mock a maiden's love!
Away. --

PUCK. -- I Am gone -- elsewhere to tell
What I have learned of ORIEL.
[Going.
MILKAH. You shall not think to cheat us so --
This moment tell us all you know.
[Running after him.
PUCK. List then! -- Such wonders shall ye hear,
As never entered fairy-ear. --
Through all this flow'r-embroider'd grove,
Where elves and fays delight to rove,
Through bush, through brake, through lowly dale,
Through dank, through dry, over stream, through vale;
By every odour-breathing bed,
Where violets nod the purple head;
By every bank of gurgling rill,
Embellished with the daffodil;
Every mead, and every mound,
Where cowslips, harebells, paint the ground;
Every bower, where jess'mines fair
Softly scent the ambient air,
Or luscious woodbine, or flushed rose,
Round a lavish fragrance throws --
Nay, even each narrow crankling nook,
Where playful trills the scantiest brook,
And every shrub, where rude mishap
In tender rind has made a gap --

MILKAH. Thou have explored? --

PUCK. -- All these throughout --
Your ROBIN has not set a foot.

SONG.
GOSS'MOUR. Faithless! -- through some distant grove
Then thy steps have strayed;
Thou have breathed thy vows of love
To some happier maid:
Henceforth in my bosom's grace
Never shall thou find a place.

PUCK. Sweetest! -- through no distant grove
Have my footsteps strayed;
No, nor have my vows of love
Tempted other maid:
In thy ROBIN 's love and grace
Thou alone shall find a place.

Together. GOSS'MOUR. In thy GOSS'MOUR 's love and grace, etc.

PUCK. In thy ROBIN 's love and grace, etc.

GOSS'MOUR. O forgive if jealous fear
Finds an easy passage here.

PUCK. Come, a sweet amends I Will make:
Our ROYAL MISTRESS is awake. --
The cause of all your grief and care,
Where ORIEL is, why fled from here,
She knows, and all will soon approve.
Attentive now in duteous order move,
While I with magic sounds awake the grove!

SONG.
I.
Elves, elphins, fairies, says,
Wherever, in sportive maze,
Ye haunt the winding stream,
And paint the poet's dream;
Quick to OBERON resort,
Speed ye to the fairy-court.
CHORUS. Quick to OBERON, etc.
II.
And ye, from violet blue
Who steal the silver dew,
With which, like di'monds sheen,
Ye deck your light-rob'd queen;
Quick to OBERON resort;
Speed ye to the fairy-court.
CHORUS. Quick to OBERON, etc.
III.
Ye too, who, light and trim,
Over air's soft bosom skim,
And point the moon's keen rays,
The hooting owl to daze;
Quick to OBERON resort,
Speed ye to the fairy-court.
CHORUS. Quick to OBERON, etc.
[Exeunt. SCENE changes to the FAIRY-BOWER. OBERON and TITANIA discovered.
OBERON. Let me now hope, my beauteous queen, thy soul Is soothed to rest.

TITANIA. -- My royal lord, no more
I murmur at thy will. The pleasing dreams
(Children of gentle sleep) wherewith my mind
Was pregnant, and thy reasons since, have eased
My doubts, my terrors. O! consider, sir,
They were a mother's feelings, and forgive 'em.

OBERON. Nor deem so lightly of a father's love,
As to suppose, a slavish race of men,
Or tributary thrones, had gained my boy --
No -- To our matchless island, gorgeous
In victory's rich trappings, and a people
Endowed with birthright freedom, is he yielded;
And every bliss attend it!

(The last CHORUS repeated within.) CHORUS. Quick to OBERON resort,
Speed we to the fairy-court.

OBERON. -- See my people!
Whose happiness, no less than interest,
I value as my own, with anxious looks,
Enquire of ORIEL's fate. Approach, my subjects;
Ye props and glories of our mighty throne!
Attend your monarch's words. -- Your ORIEL
Is not for ever lost -- An age, or so,
(Small space in fairy-life!) he spends with man;
To glad a glorious nation; to procure
Love, honor, and esteem, by virtuous deeds;
And blessing others, to be blessed himself.
For this dear purpose, ORIEL foregoes
The sweets of KENNA's grove, whilom the seat
Of purpled majesty, and, thence, beloved
Of fairy-foot. -- My trusty PUCK, thy looks
Seem big with new enquiry -- Is there aught
Thou wishest yet to know, that may to thee
Give ease, and glad my people? -- Speak undaunted.

PUCK. High monarch of our happy race,
Do us yet the mighty grace,
To say, in what part of this isle,
Deserv'dly honored with thy smile,
In what rich grove, or flowery way,
Does our much-loved ORIEL stray?

OBERON. Not westward far of this our KENNA's court
(Short trip to fairy-foot) a seat appears,
Close by whose verdant verge, THAMESIS fair,
Checking his silver stream, with tardy pace
Glides lingering on, enamored of the scene.
From flow'r-enamell'd banks soft Zephyr steals
The fragrant sweets; and every blushing bough
Hangs pendant with POMONA's choicest store.
Groves, grottos, temples, lawns, promiscuous rise,
As art with nature vied to deck the scene,
Destined to soothe a monarch's patriot cares,
When empire's fate, and proud parade of courts,
Yield to the comforts of domestic ease,
And social solace of connubial joy.
Amid these scenes (by HYMEN ever blessed)
Your ORIEL, clad in guise of mortal prince,
Crowns the fond wishes of a happy pair;
Pleased in his insant mind to see the bud
Of every grace that dignifies a throne
Give early promise of a people's love.

PUCK. Thanks, gracious OBERON! -- yet deign
Certain means, and marks to show,
How, in mortal dress, and mien,
We may our darling ORIEL know.

SONG.
OBERON. I.
By the amber-locks, that flow
Down his temples, white as snow;
By the dimples in his cheek,
Temper sweet that sweetly speak;
By the lips of ripening red,
Rivals of the musk-rose bed;
By the thousand smiles that dance
In his blooming countenance!
Where ye see such beauties blow,
There shall ye your darling know.
II.
By truth's ray, that, even now,
Dawns upon his infant brow;
By the look erect and clear,
Honor's early harbinger;
By the melting of the eyne,
Mercy's sweet unerring sign;
By the glow of conscious grace,
Flushing quick over all the face;
Where ye see such beauties blow,
There shall ye your darling know.

PUCK. Happy youth! and happy pair!
Who our ORIEL make their care!

OBERON. Begin we now the mighty charm! the song,
That pierces every fairy-bow'r, unlocks
Each store of choicest gifts, and on the head
Of some high-favour'd mortal heaps them all!

SONG.
OBERON. I.
Ye fairies, who in youth delight,
And mark each dawning ray,
O soothe with gentle dreams his night,
And cheer his opening day!
For ORIEL all your care employ,
Strew all his paths with love and joy!

CHORUS. For ORIEL all your care, etc.

OBERON. II.
Ye too, who manhood's nervous page,
And wisdom's records scan,
Confirm ye his maturer age,
And bless the ripened man!
Success attend each virtuous deed,
And deathless glory be the meed!

CHORUS. Success attend, etc.

OBERON. III.
Ye sprites select, who silvered age
With reverend love regard,
Let peace endear his life's last stage,
And general praise reward!
Thus full of blessings, late, oh! late,
May ORIEL leave his mortal state!

CHORUS. Thus full of blessings, etc.

A DANCE of FAIRIES. FINIS.
