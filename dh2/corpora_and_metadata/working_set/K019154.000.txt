TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE Princess of Wales.
MADAM,
IF I take the Liberty, once more, to crave the Protection of your ROYAL
HIGHNESS, for another Tragedy of my writing, it is because I am led, almost
unavoidably, to it, by my Subject. In the Character of ELEONORA I have
endeavored to represent, however faintly, a PRINCESS distinguished for all the
Virtues that render Greatness amiable. I have aimed, particularly, to do
justice to her inviolable Affection and generous Tenderness for a PRINCE, who
was the Darling of a great and free People.

Their Descendants, even now, will own, with Pleasure, how properly this
Address is made to your ROYAL HIGHNESS. I am, with the profoundest Respect,

MADAM, Your ROYAL HIGHNESS'S most humble, and most devoted Servant, JAMES
THOMSON.

PROLOGUE.
By a FRIEND.
IN former Times, when fierce religious Rage,
And priestly Sway deformed each suffering Age,
All manly Wit, all useful Learning lay
In Darkness lost, nor hoped returning Day.
Religion then was stained by cruel Deeds:
And freeborn Reason stooped to Craft and Creeds.
But happier We! -- And though tonight we show
What fatal Ills from blind Devotion flow,
It Is not that we such Rage renewed can fear,
Or dread the Hand of Persecution here --
Our Scene would wide Humanity impart;
Would breathe extensive Candor through the Heart;
Show true Religion even to Error kind,
And claim the perfect Freedom of the Mind.
If too the Poet paints a noble Strife
'Twixt the fond Husband and the generous Wife;
If all the Father in his Voice complains,
And all the Mother in her tender Strains;
If these best Passions prompt the pleasing Woe,
Indulge it freely -- Nature bids it flow:
Where Parent Nature leads, you cannot stray;
And what she wills, it is Virtue to obey.
Fond of BRITANNIA's Fame, and just to YOU,
He bids old English Honor live anew,
And calls your great first EDWARD up to view.
But if his Line too weak, his Stroke too faint,
The graceful Figure, in full Light, to paint;
In candid part his honest Meaning take,
And spare the Poet for the Hero's sake.
EPILOGUE.
By a FRIEND.
THese Poets are such Fools! -- The Man behind,
Who wrote this Play -- a simple Soul, I find, --
Believes, with all his Heart, there was a Wife,
Who needs would die -- to save a Husband's Life!
He in the printed Chronicles has read it:
And true it is -- Sir Richard Baker said it.
Why what an Ass these Books do make a Man?
Read Nature -- then believe it -- you who can.
Look round this Town -- the question is not -- whether
Spouse dies for Spouse: but who will live together?
Of old, they say, a Husband was a Lover:
But, thank our Stars! these foolish Days are over:
To such substantial Prudence are we come,
We wed not Heart to Heart -- but Plumb to Plumb.
What Sense? what Beauty? are not now the Things:
But can he settle -- up to what she brings?
Yet in this easy, all-forgiving Age,
Bear with such moral Fooleries -- on the Stage.
Perhaps too, there may be some gentle Soul,
Who rather likes to weep -- than win a Vole;
Who thinks that there are Charms in generous Love,
And would to Edward Eleonora prove.

SCENE, EDWARD'S Tent in the Camp before Jaffa, a City on the Coast of
Palestine. Edward and Eleonora.
A TRAGEDY.
ACT I. SCENE I.
Prince EDWARD, THEALD Archdeacon of Liege, Earl of GLOUCESTER. EDWARD. I Will no
longer doubt. It Is plain, my Friends,
That with our little Band of English Troops,
By all Allies all western Powers deserted,
All but the noble Knights that guard this Land,
The Flower of Europe and of Christian Valor,
Naught can be done, naught worthy of our Cause,
Worthy of England's Heir, and of the Name
Of Lion-hearted RICHARD; whose Renown,
After almost a Century elapsed,
Shakes through its wide Extent this Eastern World.
What else could bend the Saracen to Peace,
Who might, with better Policy, refuse
To grant it us? Yes, to the Prince of Jaffa
I will accord the Peace he has demanded:
And though my Troops, impatient, wait the Signal
To storm yon Walls, yet will I not expose,
In vain Attempts, Valor that should be saved
For better days, and for the public Welfare.
Rash fruitless War, from wanton Glory waged,
Is only splendid Murder -- What says THEALD?
Approves my Reverend Father of my Purpose?

THEALD. EDWARD, illustrious Heir of England's Crown,
I must indeed be blinded with the Zeal
Of this our holy Cause, to think your Arms,
Thus all-forsaken, thus betrayed, sufficient
To reach the Grandeur of your first Design,
And, from the Yoke of Infidels, to free
The sacred City, Object of our Vows.
Yet this, methinks, this Jaffa might be seized:
That still were something, an auspicious Omen
Of future Conquest -- But, unskilled in War,
To you, my Lord, and GLOSTER'S wise Experience,
I this submit.

EDWARD. Speak, GLOUCESTER, your Advice,
Before I fix my latest Resolution.

GLOUCESTER. You know, my Lord, I never was a Friend
To this Crusado. My unchanged Advice
Is strenuous then for Peace. Nor this, alone,
From your deserted Circumstance I urge,
But from the state of our unhappy Country.
Behold her, EDWARD, with a filial Eye,
And say, is this a time for these Adventures?
Behold Her still with deep Commotion shook,
Beneath a false delusive Face of Quiet:
Behold Her bleeding still from Civil War,
Exhausted, sunk; drained by ten thousand Arts
Of ministerial Rapine, endless Taxes,
Ill-manag'd Expeditions, Strangers, Legates,
Italian Leeches, and insatiate Rome;
That never raged before with such gross Insult,
With such abandoned Avarice. Besides,
Who knows what evil Counselors, again,
Are gathered round the Throne. In Times like these,
Disturbed, and lowering with unsettled Freedom,
One step to lawless Power, one old Attempt
Renewed, the least Infringement of our Charters,
Would hurl the giddy Nation into Tempest.
Return, my Prince. You have already saved
Your Father from his Foes, from haughty LEISTER:
Now save him from his Ministers, from those
Who hold him captive in the worst of Chains --

EDWARD. You, GLOUCESTER, saved us both.

GLOUCESTER. I did my Duty;
Even while I joined with LEISTER, did my Duty --
I hope I did -- He, who contends for Freedom,
Can never be justly deemed his Sovereign's Foe:
No, it is the Wretch that tempts him to subvert it,
The soothing Slave, the Traitor in the bosom,
Who best deserves that Name; he is the Worm
That eats out all the Happiness of Kingdoms.
EDWARD, return; lose not a Day, an Hour,
Before this City. Though your Cause be holy,
Believe me, it is a much more pious Office,
To save your Father's old and broken Years,
His mild and easy Temper, from the Snares
Of low corrupt insinuating Traitors:
A nobler Office far! on the firm Base
Of well-proportion'd Liberty, to build
The common Quiet, Happiness and Glory,
Of King and People, England's rising Grandeur.
To you, my Prince, this Task, of right, belongs.
Has not the Royal Heir a juster Claim
To share his Father's inmost Heart and Counsels,
Than Aliens to his Interest, those, who make
A Property, a Market of his Honor?
One Reason more allow me to suggest
For Peace, immediate Peace -- should blind Misfortune,
In this far-distant hostile Land, oppress us;
A Chance to which our Weakness stands exposed:
What, EDWARD, of thy Princess would become,
Thy ELEONORA; she, whose tender Love
Through stormy Seas, and in fierce Camps, attends thee?
What of thy blooming Offspring? charged with these,
To give our Courage scope were cruel Rashness.

EDWARD. Enough, my Lord, I stand resolved on Peace;
And will to England strait -- But where, alas,
Where shall we cover our inglorious Heads;
When gay with Hope the People round us press,
To hear by what Exploits we have sustained
The Fame of RICHARD, and of English Valor?
Shall I, my generous Country, I be ranked
With those weak Princes, who consume thy Wealth,
And sink thy Name in idle Expeditions? --
Perfidious France! Be this the ruling Point
Of my whole Life, the Passion of my Soul,
To humble thee, proud Nation! -- Meantime, GLOUCESTER,
See that the captive Princess be restored,
DARAXA to the Sultan of this City,
Whose Bride she is -- We wage not war with Women.

SCENE II.
EDWARD, THEALD, GLOUCESTER, An Officer belonging to the Prince. OFFICER. One from
the Prince of Jaffa, Sir, demands
Your secret Ear on some important Message.

EDWARD. Conduct him to my Tent --
[Officer goes out. He brings, I judge,
The Sultan's last Instructions for this Peace.
Here wait: I may your faithful Counsel want.

SCENE III.
THEALD, GLOUCESTER. THEALD. Whatever Woes, of late, have clouded England;
Yet must I, GLOUCESTER, call that Nation happy,
On whose Horizon smiles a dawning Prince
Of EDWARD'S Worth and Virtues.

GLOUCESTER. True, my Friend;
EDWARD has great, has amiable Virtues,
That Virtue chiefly which befits a Prince:
He loves the People he must one day rule;
With Fondness loves them, with a noble Pride;
Esteems their Good, esteems their Glory his.
One Instance it becomes me to recount,
That shows the genuine Greatness of his Soul.
Though I have met him in the bloody Field,
He fighting for his Father, I for Freedom;
Yet bears his Bosom no remaining Grudge
Of those distracted Times: to me his Heart
Is greatly reconciled -- Virtue! beyond
The little unforgiving Soul of Tyrants!
Now will I tell thee, THEALD, whence I stoop
To wear the gaudy Chains of Court-Attendance,
At these gray Years; that should in calm Retirement
Pass the soft Evening of a bustling Life,
And plume my parting Soul for better Worlds.
Amidst his many Virtues, youthful EDWARD
Is lofty, warm, and absolute of Temper:
I therefore seek to moderate his Heat,
To guide his fiery Virtues, that, misled,
By dazzling Power and flattering Sycophants,
Might finish what his Father's weaker Measures
Have tried in vain. And hence I here attend him,
In Expeditions which I never approved,
In holy Wars -- your Pardon, Reverend Father --
I must declare I think such Wars the Fruit
Of idle Courage or mistaken Zeal,
Sometimes of Rapine and religious Rage,
To every Mischief prompt.

THEALD. You wrong, my Lord,
You wrong them much. To set this Matter only
Upon a Civil Footing: say, what Right
Had Robbers rushing from Arabian Deserts,
Fierce as the Suns that kindled up their Rage,
Thus, in a barbarous Torrent, to bear down
All Asia, Africa, and profane their Altars?
And to repel brute Force by Force is just.
Nay, does not even our Duty, Interest, Glory,
The common Honor of the Christian Name,
Require us to repress their wild Ambition,
That labors westward still, and threatens Europe?

GLOUCESTER. Yes, when they burst their Limits, let us check them:
And with a firmer hand than those loose Christians,
The most corrupt and abject of Mankind,
Slaves, doubly Slaves, who suffered these Arabians,
In Virtue their Superiors as in Valor,
To measure Conquest with a Traveller's Speed.
By Rage and Zeal, it is true, their Empire rose:
But now some settled Ages of Possession
Create a Right, than which, I fear, few Nations
Can show a better. Sure I am it is Madness,
Inhuman Madness, thus, from half the World,
To drain our Blood and Treasure, to neglect
Each Art of Peace, to set Mankind adrift:
And all for what? By spreading Desolation,
Rapine and Slaughter over the other half,
To gain a Conquest we can never hold.
I venerate this Land. Its sacred Hills,
Its Vales, its Cities, trod by Saints and Prophets,
By GOD himself, the Scenes of heavenly Wonders,
Inspire me with a certain awful Joy.
But the same GOD, my Friend, pervades, sustains,
Surrounds and fills this universal Frame;
And every Land where spreads his vital Presence,
His all-enlivening Breath, to me is holy.
Excuse me, THEALD, if I go too far:
I meant alone to say, I think these Wars
A kind of Persecution. And when that,
That most absurd and cruel of all Vices,
Is once begun, where shall it find an end?
Each, in his turn, or has or claims a Right
To wield its Dagger, to return its Furies;
And, first or last, they fall upon our selves.

EDWARD, behind the Scenes. Inhuman Villain! is thy Message Murder!

THEALD. Ha! heard you not the Prince exclaiming Murder?

GLOUCESTER. Should this Barbarian Messenger --
[Moving toward the Noise. It Is so!

SCENE IV.
THEALD, GLOUCESTER; to them Prince EDWARD wounded in the Arm, and dragging in the
Assassin. EDWARD. Detested Wretch! And does the Prince of Jaffa
Send base Assassins to transact his Treaties?
There -- take thy Answer, Ruffian!
[Stabs him with the Dagger he had wrested from him. Blow too hasty!
I should have saved thee for a fitter Death.

ASSASSIN. I would have triumphed, Christian, in thy worst.
For know, thou vile Destroyer of the Faithful!
That though my erring Dagger missed thy Heart,
Yet has it fired thy Veins with mortal Poison,
Whose very touch is Death -- ALLAH be praised!
O glorious Fate! Prophet, receive my Soul!
[Dies.
EDWARD, after a short Pause. Why stare you pale Amazement on each other?
Are we not Men, to whom the various Chance
Of Life is known?

GLOUCESTER. Ha! Poison! did he say?
Then is at once my Prince and Country lost!
O fatal Wound to England!

THEALD. Quick, my Lord,
Retire, and have it dressed, without delay;
Ere the fell Poison can diffuse its Rage,
And deeply taint your Blood.

EDWARD. The Princess comes!
O save me from her Tenderness!

SCENE V.
EDWARD, THEALD, GLOUCESTER; to them the Princess ELEONORA. ELEONORA. My EDWARD!
Support me! -- Oh!

EDWARD. She faints -- My ELEONORA!
Look up, and bless me with thy gentle Eyes! --
The Color comes, her Cheeks resume their Beauty,
And all her Charms revive -- Hence, spurn that Carcass:
A Sight too shocking for my ELEONORA.

ELEONORA. And lives my EDWARD, lives my dearest Lord,
From this Assassin saved? -- Alas! you bleed!

EDWARD. It Is naught, my lovely Princess! -- A slight Wound --

ELEONORA. But ah! methought, I entering heard of Poison,
Tainting the Blood -- What! was the Dagger poisoned? --
Ha! ssilent all? will none relieve my Fears? --

GLOUCESTER. Madam, restrain your Tenderness a moment --
The Prince delays too long -- Let him retire.
Meanwhile, the troubled Camp shall be my Care;
Lest the base Foe should make a sudden Sally,
While yet our Troops are stunned with this Disaster.

EDWARD. I thank thee, noble GLOUCESTER. Nor, alone,
Support my Troops; go, rouse them to Revenge;
Tell them their injured Prince will try their Love,
Their Valor soon -- And you, my Friend, good THEALD,
Attend the Princess -- Cheer thee, ELEONORA!
I cannot, will not, leave thee long, to vex
Thy tender Soul with aggravated Fears.

THEALD. Behold DARAXA, the false Sultan's Bride.

SCENE VI.
ELEONORA, THEALD, DARAXA. DARAXA. Princess of England, let me share thy Grief.
Whence flow these Tears? and what this wild Alarm,
This Noise of Murder and Assassination?

ELEONORA. Alas! the Prince is wounded by a Ruffian;
And with a poisoned Dagger, as I fear.
Yet none will ease me of this racking Thought --
Nay, tell me, THEALD, since to know the (...)
Is often a kind of miserable Comfort;
What has befal'n the Prince? For this slight Wound
Could never thus overcast the Brave with Terror.

THEALD. I dare not, Princess, dally with your Fate.
An impious Villain, from the Sultan SELIM,
Pretended to the Prince a secret Message,
About the Peace in Treaty. Dreading naught,
He left us here, and to his Tent retired,
There to receive this execrable Envoy.
Strait with the Prince alone, the fierce Assassin
Attempted on his Life; but, in his Arm,
He took, it seems, the Blow, and from the Villain
Wresting the Dagger, plunged it to his Heart.
This last we saw, and heard the inhuman Bigot,
Who deemed himself a Martyr in their Cause,
Boast, as he died, the Prince's Wound was poisoned --

ELEONORA. Then all I feared is true! then am I wretched,
Beyond even Hope!

DARAXA. A Villain from the Sultan! --

ELEONORA. Ah the distracting Thought! And is my Life!
My Love! my EDWARD! on the brink of Fate!
Of Fate that may this moment snatch him from me!

DARAXA. What! SELIM send Assassins? and beneath
A Name so sacred? SELIM, whose Renown
Is Incense breathing over the sweetened East;
For each humane each generous Virtue famed;
SELIM! the Rock of Faith! and Sun of Honor!

ELEONORA. O complicated Woe! The Christian Cause
Has now no more a Patron, and Restorer;
England no more a Prince, in whom she placed
Her Glory, her Delight, her only Hope;
These desolated Troops no more a Chief;
No more a Husband, a Protector, I,
A Friend, a Lover! and my helpless Children
No more a Father!

DARAXA. Pardon, gentle Princess,
If in this Whirlwind of revolving Passions,
That snatch my Soul by turns, I have forgot
To pay the Tribute which I owe thy Sorrows --
But I my self, alas! am more unhappy!

ELEONORA. What Woes can equal mine? who lose, thus vilely,
The Best! the Bravest! Loveliest of Mankind! --

DARAXA. You lose the Lover, I must learn to hate him,
To scorn what once wasall my Pride and Transport!
Should EDWARD die by this accursed Crime,
(Which Heaven forbid) he dies admired, beloved,
In the full Bloom of Fame and spotless Honor.
To you, the Daughter of illustrious Grief,
Your Tears remain, and sadly-sweet Reflection;
You with his Image, with his Virtues, still,
Amidst the pensive Gloom, may Converse hold:
While I -- Ah! nothing meets my blasted Sight
But a black View of Infamy and Horror!
What is the Loss of Life to Loss of Virtue! --
And yet how can this heavenly Spark be lost?
No! Virtue burns with an immortal Flame.
He is belied -- some Villain has abused him.

THEALD. I honor, Madam, this your virtuous Grief:
But that the Sultan did employ th'Assassin
Is past all doubt -- Behold the false Instructions,
By which he gained Admittance.
[Giving her the Letter the Prince had dropped.
DARAXA. Ha! -- It Is so!
His Hand! his Seal! -- From my detesting Heart,
I tear him thus for ever! -- Perish, SELIM!
Perish the feeble Wretch, who more bewails him!
That were to share his Guilt! -- Unhappy Princess!
Now let me turn my Soul to thy Assistance --
There is a Cure, it is true --

ELEONORA. A Cure, DARAXA!
O say, what Cure?

DARAXA. No; it avails not, Madam;
None can be found to risque it.

ELEONORA. None to risque it?
Quick tell me what it is, my dear DARAXA!

DARAXA. To find some Person, that, with friendly Lip,
May draw the Poison forth; at least, its Rage
And mortal Spirit. This will bring the Wound
Within the Power of Art: but certain Death
Attends the generous Deed.

ELEONORA, kneeling. Then hear me, Heaven!
Prime Source of Love! Ye Saints and Angels, hear me!
I here devote me for the best of Men,
Of Princes and of Husbands. On this Cross
I seal the cordial Vow: confirm it Heaven!
And grant me Courage in the Hour of Trial!

THEALD. O Tenderness unequaled!

DARAXA. Glorious Princess!

ELEONORA. Go, THEALD, quickly find the Earl of GLOUCESTER,
And with him break this matter to the Prince.
As for the Person, leave that Task to me.
I with DARAXA will your Call attend;
O all ye Powers of Love, your Influence lend.

End of the First ACT.
ACT II.
SCENE I.
GLOUCESTER, THEALD. GLOUCESTER. NO, THEALD, no; he never will consent --
I know him well -- he never will purchase Life,
At such a Rate: besides, in aid of Love,
His generous Pride would come, and deem it Baseness.

THEALD. Then is yon Sun his last. The blackning Wound
Begins already to confess the Poison --
Meantime, my Lord, both Friendship and our Duty
Demand, at least, the Trial. Well I know,
That, poise his Life with hers, he would as nothing
Esteem his own: but sure the Life of Thousands,
The mingled Cause at once of Heaven and Earth,
Should over the best the dearest Life prevail.

GLOUCESTER. Alas! my Friend, you reason, EDWARD loves.
How weak the Head contending with the Heart!
Yet be the Trial made -- Behold he comes.

SCENE II.
EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, THEALD. EDWARD, entering. O thou bright Sun! now hastening to
those Climes,
That Parent-Isle, which I no more shall see;
And for whose Welfare often my youthful Heart
Has vainly formed so many a fond Design;
O thither bear, resplendent Orb of Day,
To that dear Spot of Earth, my last Farewell!
And thee, Eternal Providence, whose Course,
Amidst the various Maze of Life, is fixed,
By boundless Wisdom and by boundless Love,
I follow thee, with Resignation, Hope,
With Confidence and Joy; for thou art good,
And of thy rising Goodness is no end!
Well met, my dearest Friends! -- It was too true
The Villain's Threatening, and I nearly touch
That awful Hour which every Man must prove,
Yet every Man still shifts at distance from him.
Come then, and let us fill the Space between,
These last important Moments, whence we take
Our latest Tincture for Eternity,
With solemn Converse and exalting Friendship --
Nay -- THEALD -- GLOUCESTER -- wound me not with Tears,
With Tears that fall over venerable Cheeks!
What could the Princess more? -- Ah! there, indeed,
At every Thought of Her, I feel a Weight,
A dreadful Weight of Tenderness, that shakes
My firmest Resolution -- Where is she?

THEALD. She burns with fond Impatience to attend you.

EDWARD. And how, brave GLOUCESTER, did you leave the Camp?

GLOUCESTER. The Camp, Sir, is secure: each Soldier there
From Indignation draws new Force and Spirit.
O it is a glorious, an affecting Sight!
Those furrowed Cheeks that never knew before
The Dew of Tears, now in a copious Shower
Are bathed. Around your Tent they, various, crowd,
Rank over Rank: some pressing for a Look;
Some sadly musing, with dejected Eye;
Some, on their Knees, preserring Vows to Heaven;
And, with extended Arm, some breathing Vengeance.
" Base Saracens, they cry, perfidious Cowards!
" But Blood shall wash out Blood -- Ah! poor Atonement!
" Did the whole bleeding City fall a Victim!

EDWARD. What unbought Love and generous Valor fire
The freeborn Heart! -- Yet moderate their Zeal;
And let the Sword of Justice only strike
The faithless SELIM, and his guilty Creatures.
My new-departed Spirit, just escaped
From the low fev'rish Passions of this Life,
Would grieve to see the Blood of Innocence,
With that of Guilt confounded, stain my Tomb.

THEALD. Permit me, Sir, the Hope, that you your self --
I speak it on just Cause -- may live to punish
This Breach of all the sacred Rights of Men.

EDWARD. Why will you turn my Thoughts, from Earth enlarged,
To soft enfeebling Views of Life again?

THEALD. Not to a vain Desire of Life, my Lord,
I would re^^^ them; but inspire each Hope,
Advise each Possibility to save it.
And there is yet a Remedy.

EDWARD. Delusion!

THEALD. The fair Arabian Princess mentioned one.

EDWARD. She one! -- DARAXA! -- something to complete
Her Lover's Crime.

THEALD. You could not wrong her thus,
Had you beheld the Tempest of her Soul,
Her Grief, her Rage, Confusion, when she heard
Of SELIM'S Baseness; had you seen that Honor,
That glorious Fire that parted from her Eyes;
'Till in a Flood of virtuous Sorrow sunk,
She almost equaled ELEONORA'S Tears.

EDWARD. What was it she proposed?

THEALD. It was, my Lord,
To find some Person, who, with friendly Lip,
Might draw the deadly Spirit --

EDWARD. I have heard
Of such a Cure; but is it not, good THEALD,
An Action fatal to the kind Performer?

THEALD. Yes, surely fatal.

EDWARD. Name it then no more.
I should despise the paltry Life it purchased.
Besides, what Mortal can dispose so rashly
Of his own Life? Talk not of low Condition,
And of my public Rank: when Life or Death
Becomes the Question, all Distinctions vanish;
Then the first Monarch and the lowest Slave
On the same Level stand, in This the Sons
Of equal Nature all.

THEALD. Allow me, Sir.
If it is a certain, an established Duty,
Than Duty more, the Height of human Virtue,
To sacrifice a transitory Life
For that kind Source from whence it is derived,
And all its guarded Joys, our dearest Country;
To sacrifice it in the Cause of Heaven,
Author of every Good: by the same Reason,
It may be justly sacrificed for Those
On whom depends the Welfare of the Public.
And there is one, my Lord, who stands devoted,
By solemn and irrevocable Vows,
To die for you.

EDWARD. To die for me! -- Kind Nature!
Thanks to thy forming Hand, I can myself,
Cheerful, sustain to pay this Debt I owe Thee,
Without the borrowed Sufferings of Another.
No, THEALD, urge this Argument no more.
I love not Life to that Degree, to purchase,
By the sure Death of some brave guiltless Friend,
A few uncertain Days, that often rise,
Like This, serene and gay, when, with swift Wing,
A Moment wraps them in disastrous Fate.

GLOUCESTER. Did we consult to save your single Life,
Was that the present Question, thy Refusal
Were just, were generous. But, my Lord, this Person,
Who stands for you devoted, should, in That,
Be deemed devoted for the Christian Cause,
The common Cause of Europe and thy Country.
For That this Martyr dies; dies for thy Children;
Dies for the brave Companions of thy Fortune,
Who weeping now around thy Tent conjure Thee,
To live for them, and England's promised Glory.
O I must give it way! My Heart is full
Of Thee, my Country; and my aged Veins,
At Thought of Thee, resume the Fire of Youth. --
If Honor, Glory, can exalt the Mind,
Above the common Passions that involve
The grovelling Race of Men; if the first Beauty,
If Virtue dressed in her divinest Charms,
All Nature's mingled Tenderness, the Parent,
The Brother, Lover, Friend, can touch the Heart;
O save our Country, EDWARD! save a Nation,
The chosen Land, the last Retreat of Freedom,
Amidst a broken World! -- Cast back thy View,
And trace from farthest Times her old Renown.
Think of the Blood that, to maintain her Rights,
And nurse her sheltering Laws, has flowed in Battle,
Or on the Patriot's Scaffo'd. Think what Cares,
What Vigilance, what Toils, what bright Contention,
In Councils, Camps, and well-disputed Senates,
It cost our generous Ancestors, to raise
A matchless Plan of Freedom: whence we shine,
Even in the jealous Eye of hostile Nations,
The happiest of Mankind. -- Then see all This,
This Virtue, Wisdom, Toil and Blood of Ages,
Behold it ready to be lost for ever.
Behold us almost broken to the Yoke,
Robbed of our ancient Spirit, sunk in Baseness,
At home corrupted, and despised abroad.
Behold our Wealth consumed, those Treasures squandered,
That might protect and nourish wholesome Peace,
Or urge a glorious War; on Wretches squandered,
A venal Crew that plunder and disgrace us.
In this important, this decisive Hour,
On Thee, and Thee alone, our weeping Country
Turns her distressful Eye; to Thee she calls,
And with a helpless Parent's piercing Voice.
Will thou not live for Her? for Her subdue
A graceful Pride, I own, but still a Pride,
That more becomes thy Courage and thy Youth
Than Birth and public Station? Nay, for Her,
Say, would thou not resign the dearest Passions?

EDWARD. O there is nothing which for Thee, my Country,
I, in my proper Person, could not suffer!
But thus to sculk behind another's Life,
It Is what I scarce have Courage to support,
It makes a kind of Coward of me, GLOUCESTER.
And yet the Reasons urged, I must acknowledge,
Demand a deep Regard. -- Well -- be it so --
Ere to this Instance of amazing Friendship
I can submit, let me behold the Friend.
Perhaps my Bounty may requite his Love,
To those he holds much dearer than himself.
Conduct him hither, THEALD.

SCENE III.
EDWARD, GLOUCESTER. EDWARD. Ah, my GLOUCESTER,
You have not touched on something that here pleads
For longer Life, beyond the Force of Reason,
Perhaps too powerful pleads -- my ELEONORA!
To Thee, my Friend, I will not be ashamed
Even to avow my Love in all its Fondness.
For Oh there shines in this my dearer Self!
This Partner of my Soul! such a mild Light
Of careless Charms, of unaffected Beauty,
Such more than Beauty, such endearing Goodness,
That when I meet her Eye, where cordial Faith,
And every gentle Virtue mix their Luster,
I feel a Transport that partakes of Anguish!
How shall I then behold her, on the Point
To leave her, GLOUCESTER, in a distant Land?
For ever in a stormy World to leave Her?
There is no Misery to be feared like That
Which from our greatest Happiness proceeds!

SCENE IV.
EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, THEALD presenting the Princess ELEONORA as the Person he went
to bring, DARAXA. EDWARD. Great God! -- what do I see? -- I am betrayed! --
[Turning away.
ELEONORA. EDWARD!

EDWARD. O it is too much! O spare me, Nature!

ELEONORA. Not look upon me, EDWARD?

EDWARD. ELEONORA!
How on this dreadful Errand can thou come?

ELEONORA. Behold me kneel --

EDWARD. Why kneel, thou best of Women!
Thou never offended, never in Thought offended!
Thou art all Truth, and Love, and Angel-Goodness!
Why do thou kneel? O rise, my ELEONORA!

ELEONORA. Let me fulfill my Vow.

EDWARD. O barbarous Vow!

ELEONORA. Let me preserve a Life, in which is wrapped
The Life of Thousands, dearer than my own!
Live thou, and let me die for Thee, my EDWARD!

EDWARD. For me! -- thy Words are Daggers to my Soul.
And would thou have me then thus meanly save
A despicable Life? a Life exposed
To that worst Torment, to my own Contempt!
A Life still haunted by the cruel Image
Of thy last Pangs, thy agonizing Throws,
The dire Convulsions of these tender Limbs;
And all for one -- O Infamy! -- for one,
By Love, by Duty bound, each manly Tie,
Even by a Peasant's Honor to protect Thee?

ELEONORA. This never can blemish Thee. I know full well,
There is no Danger, Pain, no Form of Death,
Thou would not meet with Transport to protect me.
But I, alas! an unimportant Woman,
Whose only Boast and Merit is to love Thee;
Ah, what am I, with nameless Numbers weighed?
With Myriads yet unborn? All Ranks, all Ages,
All Arts, all Virtues, all a State comprizes?
These have a higher Claim to thy Protection.
Live then for them. -- O make a great Effort!
What none but Heroes can, bid the soft Passions
The Private stoop to Those that grasp a Public.
Live to possess the Pleasure of a God,
To bless a People trusted to thy Care.
Live to fulfill thy long Career of Glory,
But just begun. To die for Thee be mine.
I never can find a brighter gentler Fate;
And Fate will come at last, inglorious Fate!
O grudge me not a Portion of thy Fame!
As mixed in Love, O raise me to thy Glory!

EDWARD. In vain is all thy Eloquence. The more
Thou would persuade, I, with increasing Horror,
Fly from thy Purpose.

ELEONORA. Do thou love me, EDWARD?

EDWARD. Oh! -- If I love Thee? -- Witness Heaven and Earth!
Angels of Death that hover round me, witness!
Witness these blinded Eyes, these trembling Arms,
This Heart that beats unutterable Fondness,
To what delightful Agony I love thee!

ELEONORA. Then will thou save me, sure, from greater Pain.

EDWARD. O that I could from all! engross thy Sufferings!
Pain felt for Thee, were Pleasure!

ELEONORA. Hear me, EDWARD.
I speak the strictest Truth, no Flight of Passion,
I speak my naked Heart. -- To die, I own,
Is a dread Passage, terrible to Nature,
Chiefly to those who have, like me, been happy. --
But to survive Thee -- O it is greatly worse!
It Is a continual Death! I cannot bear
The very Thought -- O leave me not behind thee!

EDWARD. Since naught can alter my determined Breast,
Why do thou pierce me with this killing Image?

ELEONORA. Ah! selfish that thou art! with thee the Toil,
The tedious Toil of Life will soon be over;
Thou soon wilt hide thee in the quiet Grave:
While I, a lonely Widow, with her Orphans,
Am left defenseless to a troubled World,
A false, ungrateful, and injurious World! --
Oh! if thou love me, EDWARD, I conjure thee,
By that celestial Flame which blends our Souls!
By all a Father, all a Mother feels!
By every holy Tenderness, I charge thee!
Live to protect the Pledges of our Love,
Our Children! --

EDWARD. Oh! --

ELEONORA. Our young, our helpless --

EDWARD. Oh! --
Distraction! -- Let me go!

ELEONORA. Nay, drag me with thee --
To the kind Tomb -- Thou can not leave our Children!
Exposed, by being thine, beyond the lowest!
Surrounded with the Perils of a Throne! --

EDWARD. Cruel! no more embitter thus our last,
Our parting Moments! Set no more the Terrors
Of these best Passions in Array against me!
For by that POWER, I swear, Father of Life!
Whose universal Love embraces all
That breathes this ample Air; whose perfect Wisdom
Brings Light from Darkness, and from Evil Good;
To whom I recommend thee, and my Children:
By him I swear! I never will submit
To what thy horrid Tenderness proposes!

GLOUCESTER. My Lord --

EDWARD. Oh! -- these Emotions are too much --
I feel a heavy Languor steal upon me:
Death, or his Image Sleep, weighs down my Soul --
Conduct me to my Couch -- Ah! ELEONORA!
If we never meet again -- This one Embrace --
Absolute Nature! thou must be obeyed.

ELEONORA. I will not, cannot quit thee! --

SCENE.V.
ELEONORA, DARAXA. DARAXA. Princess, stay.
Resistless Sleep now rushes on his Powers:
For so the various Poison often begins
To spread its dark Malignity. --

ELEONORA. Ha! -- Sleep? --
Then is the Time -- Thanks to inspiring Heaven!
But come, and ere the Poison sink too deep,
Swift let me seize the favoring Hour of Sleep.

End of the Second ACT.
ACT III.
SCENE I.
GLOUCESTER. O Miracle of Love! O wondrous Princess!
It Is such as thou, who keep the gentle Flame,
That animates Society, alive,
Who make the Dwellings of Mankind delightful.
What is vain Life? an idle Flight of Days,
A still-delusive Round of sickly Joys,
A Scene of little Cares and trifling Passions,
If not enobled by such Deeds of Virtue?
And yet this matchless Virtue! what avails it?
The afflicting Angel has forsook the Prince,
And now pours out his Terrors on the Princess.
Forsook him, said I? -- No; he must awake
To keener Evils than the Body knows,
Which Minds alone, and generous Minds can feel.
O Virtue! Virtue! as thy Joys excel,
So are thy Woes transcendent, the gross World
Knows not the Bliss or Misery of either --
The Prince forsakes his Couch -- He seems renewed
In Health -- Ah short deceitful Gleam of Ease!

SCENE II.
EDWARD, GLOSTE.R EDWARD, advancing from his Couch. Hail to the fresher Earth
and brighter Day!
I feel me lightened of the mortal Load
That lay upon my Spirits. This kind Sleep
Has shed a balmy Quiet through my Veins.
Whence this amazing Change? --
But be my first chief Care, Author of Good!
To bend my Soul in Gratitude to thee!
Thou, when blind Mortals wander through the Deeps
Of comfortless Despair, with timely Hand,
Invisible, and by unthought-of Ways,
Thou lead'st them forth into thy Light again.

GLOUCESTER. How fares my Lord, the Prince?

EDWARD. To Health restored.
Only a Kind of Lassitude remains,
A not unpleasing Weakness hangs upon me:
Like the soft Trembling of the settled Deep,
After a Storm.

GLOUCESTER. Father of Health be praised!

EDWARD. The Moment that I sunk upon my Couch,
A sick and troubled Slumber fell upon me.
Chaos of gloomy unconnected Thought!
That, in black Eddy whirled, made Sleep more dreadful
Than the worst waking Pang. While thus I tossed,
Ready to bid Farewell to suffering Clay,
Methought an Angel came and touched my Wound.
At this the parting Gloom cleared up apace;
My Slumbers softened; and, with Health, returned
Serenity of Mind, and ordered Thought,
And fair Ideas gladening all the Soul.
Aerial Music too, by Fancy heard,
Soothed my late Pangs and harmoniz'd my Breast.
Through Shades of Bliss I walked, where Heavenly Forms
Sung to their Lutes my ELEONORA'S Love --
But where is she? the Glory of her Sex!
O dearer, justly dearer, far than ever!
Quick, let me find her, pour into her Bosom
My full^full Soul, with Tenderness o'ercharg'd,
With glad Surprise, with Gratitude and Wonder. --
Ha! why this Silence? this dejected Look?
You cast a drooping Eye upon the Ground.
Where is the Princess?

GLOUCESTER. She, my Lord, reposes.

EDWARD. Reposes! -- No! -- It is not likely, GLOUCESTER,
That she would yield her weeping Eyes to sleep,
While I lay there in Agonies -- Away!
I am too feeble then to know the Truth.
Say, is she well?

GLOUCESTER. Now show thy Courage, EDWARD --

EDWARD. O all my Fears! I shall start out to Madnss!
What! -- while I slept?

GLOUCESTER. Yes --

EDWARD. Misery! Distraction!
My Peace, my Honor is betrayed for ever!
O Love! O Shame! O murdered ELEONORA!

SCENE III.
GLOUCESTER. Unhappy Prince! go find thy ELEONORA,
And in heart-easing Grief exhale thy Passion:
All other Comfort, now, were to talk down
The Winds and raging Seas. -- But yonder comes
The Arabian Princess. From her Tears I learn
The moving Scene within.

SCENE IV.
GLOUCESTER, DARAXA, a Messenger from SELIM, attending at some distance. DARAXA
Oh! it is too much!
I can no more support it.

GLOUCESTER. Generous Mourner,
How is it with the Princess ELEONORA?

DARAXA. Struck by the Poison, on her Couch she lies,
A Rose soft-drooping in Sabean Vales,
Beneath the fiery Dog-star's noxious Rage.
O Christian Chief, I never shall forget
The Scene these melting Eyes have just beheld,
With mingled Tears of Tenderness and Wonder.

GLOUCESTER. How was it, Madam?

DARAXA When this Pride of Woman,
This best of Wives, which in his radiant Course
The Sun beholds, when first she, sickening, felt
The imperious Summons of approaching Fate,
All robbed in spotless White she sought her Altars;
And, prostrate there, for her departing Soul,
The Prince her Husband, and her Orphan-Children,
Implored the ETERNAL MIND. -- As yet she held
Her swelling Tears, and in her Bosom kept
Her Sighs repressed: nor did the near Approach
Of the pale King of Terrors dim her Beauty;
No, rather adding to her Charms, it breathed
A certain mournful Sweetness through her Features.
But as the increasing Bane more desperate grew,
Wild to her Bed she rushed, and then, indeed,
The lovely Fountains of her Eyes were opened,
Then flowed her Tears. -- "Connubial Bed, she cried,
" Chaste Witness of my Tenderness for him,
" To save whose Life I unrepining die,
" In Bloom of Youth, farewell! -- Thou shall, perhaps,
" Receive a fairer, a more happy Bride;
" But never a more faithful, never one
" Who loves her Husband with a fonder Passion.
Here flowed her Tears afresh; with burning Lip,
She pressed the humid Couch, and wept again.
At last, while weary Sorrow paused, she rose,
And, fearing lest immediate Death might seize Her,
Demanded to be led to see the Prince;
But Fear of chasing from his Eyes, too soon,
The salutary Sleep that healed his Pangs,
Restrained her trembling Footsteps. On her Couch,
Abandoned to Despair, she sunk anew,
And for her Children called. Her Children came.
A while, supported on her Arm, she eyed them,
With Tears pursuing Tears a-down her Cheek,
With all the speechless Misery of Woe --
I see her still -- O God! -- the powerful Image
Dissolves me into Tears!

GLOUCESTER. Madam proceed.
Such Tears are Virtue, and excel the Joys
Of wanton Pride.

DARAXA. Then starting up, she went
To snatch them to a Mother's last Embrace;
When strait reflecting that the piercing Poison
Might taint their tender Years, she sudden shrunk
With Horror back -- "O wretched ELEONORA!
" (She weeping cried) and must I then not taste
" The poor remaining Comfort of the Dying,
" To see a Husband, clasp my dearest Children,
" And mix my parting Soul with theirs I love?"
Her sad Attendants, that till then had mourned
In silent Sorrow, all, at This, gave way
To loud Laments -- She raised her languid Eye,
And casting on them round a gracious Smile,
To each by Name she called, even to the lowest,
To each extended mild her friendly Hand,
Gave, and, by Turns, received a last Farewell.
Such is the dreadful Scene from which I come.

GLOUCESTER. How heightened now with EDWARD'S mingled Woes!
Why were my lingering Years reserved for this?

DARAXA. Come nearer, you, the Messenger of SELIM,
And bear him back this Answer -- His chief Aim,
He says, in stooping to solicit Peace,
Was from the Chains of Insidels to save me.
What! was it then to rescue me he sent,
Beneath an all-rever'd and sacred Name,
Beneath the Shelter of his Hand and Seal,
A murdering Wretch, a sacrilegious Bigot,
To stab at once the gallant Prince of England,
And Mousol Faith? nay, with a poisoned Dagger
(Such his inhuman Cowardice) to stab him?
So well, it is true, he judged, the Christian Prince
Had now been mingled with the harmless Dead;
If his bright Princess, glorious ELEONORA,
Had not redeemed his dearer Life with hers.
You heard in what Extremity she lies.
Go, tell the Tyrant then -- O Heaven and Earth!
O Vanity of Virtue! that DARAXA
Should ever to SELIM send so fell a Message --
I will suppress its Bitterness -- Yet tell him,
This Crime has placed eternal Bars betwixt us.
See my last Tear to Love -- Arabian Wilds
Shall bury 'midst their Rocks the lost DARAXA.
Away!

GLOUCESTER. Behold they bear this way the Princess,
Once more to taste the Sweetness of the Sun,
Ere yet to mortal Light she bid farewell.

SCENE V.
GLOUCESTER, DARAXA, THEALD, EDWARD, ELEONORA born in by her Attendants on a
Couch. ELEONORA, entering. A little on; a little further on,
Bear me, my Friends, into the cooling Air.
O cheerful Sun! O vital Light of Day!
O Clouds that roll your Tempest through the Sky! --

EDWARD. That Sun is Witness of our matchless Woes,
Is Witness of our Innocence -- Alas!
What have we done to merit this Disaster?

ELEONORA. O Earth! O genial Roofs! O the dear Coast
Of Albion's Isle! which I no more shall see! --

EDWARD. Nay, yield not to thy Weakness, ELEONORA!
Sustain thyself a little, nor desert me!
The all-ruling GOODNESS may relieve us still.

ELEONORA. EDWARD! I tremble! Terror seizes on me!
Through the rent Veil of this surrounding Sky,
I had a Glimpse, I saw the eternal World.
They call, they urge me hence -- Yes, I obey.
But O forgive me, Heaven! if it is with Pain,
With Agonies, I tear my Soul from His!

EDWARD. Heavens! what I suffer! -- How thy plaintive Voice
Shoots Anguish through my Soul!

ELEONORA. Some Power unseen --
Thy Hand, my EDWARD -- some dark Power unseen
Is dragging me away -- O yet a little,
Stern Tyrant, spare me! -- Ah! how shall I leave
My weeping Friends, my Husband and my Children?

EDWARD. Unhappy Friends! O greatly wretched Husband!
And O poor careless Orphans, who not feel
The Depth of your Misfortune!

ELEONORA. Lay me down;
Soft, lay me down -- my Powers are all dissolved --
A little forward bend me -- Oh!

EDWARD. O God!
How that soft Frame is torn with cruel Pangs!
Pangs robbed from me!

ELEONORA. It Is thence they borrow Ease --
My Children! O my Children! you no more
Have now a Mother; now, alas! no more
You have a Mother, O my hapless Children!

EDWARD. What do I hear! What desolating Words
Are these? more bitter than a thousand Deaths!
Death to my Soul! Call up thy failing Spirit,
And leave me not to Misery and Ruin!

ELEONORA. EDWARD, I feel an Interval of Ease;
And, ere I die, have something to impart
That will relieve my Sufferings.

EDWARD. Speak, my Soul!
Speak thy Desire: I live but to fulfill it.

ELEONORA. Thou see in what a hopeless State I lie,
I who this Morning rose in Height of Youth,
High-blooming, promised many happy Years.
I die for Thee, I self-devoted die.
Think not, from This, that I repent my Vow;
Or that, with little Vanity, I boast it:
No; what I did from unrepenting Love
I cheerful did, from Love that knows no Fear,
No Pain, no weak Remission of its Ardor.
And what, alas! what was it but the Dictate
Of Honor and of Duty: nay, 'twas selfish,
To save me from unsufferable Pain,
From dragging here a wretched Life without Thee.
Two Fears yet stand betwixt my Soul and Peace.
One is for Thee, lest thou disturb my Grave
With Tears of wild Despair. Grieve not like Those
Who have no Hope. We yet shall meet again;
We still are in a kind Creator's Hand;
ETERNAL GOODNESS reigns. Besides, this Parting,
This Parting, EDWARD, must have come at last,
When Years of Friendship had, perhaps, exalted
Our Love, if That can be, to keener Anguish.
Think what thy Station, what thy Fame demand;
Nor yield thy Virtue even to worthy Passions.
My other Care -- my other Care is idle --
From That thy equal Tenderness with mine,
Thy Love and Generosity secure me.
Our Children --

EDWARD. Yes* I penetrate thy Fear.
But hear me, dying Sweetness! On this Hand,
This cold pale Hand I vow, our Children never,
Shall never call another by the Name
Sacred to Thee; my ELEONORA'S Children
Shall never feel the hateful Power thou fear.
As one in Life, so Death cannot divide us.
Nor high Descent, nor Beauty, naught that Woman,
In her unbounded Vanity of Heart,
Can wish, shall ever tempt my Faith from Theee,
Shall ever, said I? Piteous Boast indeed!
O nothing can! -- I should be gross of Heart,
Tasteless and dull as Earth, to think with Patience,
Without Abhorrence, of a second Hymen,
Where can I find such Beauty? Where such Grace,
The Soul of Beauty? where such winning Charms?
Where such a soft Divinity of Goodness?
Such Faith? such Love? such Tenderness unequaled?
Such all that Heaven could give -- to make me wretched!
Talk not of Comfort -- Into what a Gulf
A lone Abyss of Misery I fall,
The Moment that I lose Thee -- Oh! I know not!
I dare not think! -- But these unhappy Orphans --
Ah the dire Cause that makes it double Duty --
Shall now be doubly mine to shelter them,
These Pledges of our Love, I will attempt
To brave the Horrors of loathed Life without Thee.

ELEONORA. Enough! it is enough! On this Condition
Receive them from my Hands.

EDWARD. Dear Hands! dear Gift!
Dear, precious, dying, miserable Gift!
With Transport once received, but now with Anguish!

ELEONORA. I yet should live, my Children -- and I die.

EDWARD. How truly lost! what shall I be without Thee!

ELEONORA. All softening Time will heal thy Woes. The Dead
Soon leave the Passions of the Living free.

EDWARD. Detested Life! -- O take me, take me with Thee!

ELEONORA. My single Death, O Grave, may well suffice.

EDWARD. Severe mysterious Heaven! that This should be!

ELEONORA. What darksome Ways I tread! -- O Sun! -- O Earth!

EDWARD. Stay, cruel, stay! -- Thou leave me, ELEONORA!

ELEONORA. Ah! the strong Hand of Iron Fate compels me!

EDWARD. Raise raise, my ELEONORA, thy sweet Eyes,
Nor quit thy Children!

ELEONORA. With what Pain I quit them!
Well then -- receive my last Adieu --

EDWARD. Again,
O yet again behold them!

ELEONORA. Oh! -- It Is Darkness --
A deadly Weight --

EDWARD. Thou leave me then for ever! --

ELEONORA. Where am I? -- Ah! -- a Tenant still to Pain.
The quivering Flame of Life leaps up a little.
Meantime, my EDWARD, it is my last Request,
That Thou would leave me, while I yet enjoy
A parting Gleam of Thought -- Leave me to HEAVEN! --
GLOUCESTER -- farewell -- Be careful of the Prince --
Attend him hence -- and double now thy Friendship!

EDWARD. Barbarian! off! -- Ah! whither would thou drag me!

GLOUCESTER. My Lord, in Pity to the Princess --

EDWARD. Oh!

ELEONORA. Farewell! farewell! -- What must be -- must be, EDWARD!

EDWARD. O Word of Horror! -- Can I? -- No! I cannot!
There, take me, lead me, hurl me to Perdition! --

SCENE VI.
ELEONORA, DARAXA, THEALD, Attendants. ELEONORA. It Is past, the Bitterness of
Death is past --
Alas! DARAXA, I can never requite
Thy generous Cares for me. Thou art the Cause
My EDWARD lives, my Children have a Father,
Thy Heaven-inspir'd Proposal -- Tell him, THEALD,
That, in the troubled Moments of our Parting,
I had forgot to beg he would restore
The Arabian Princess to her Friends and Country --
Thy Hand -- This sure, however in Faith we differ,
Humanity, the Soul of all Religion,
May well permit.

DARAXA. By Virtue's sacred Fire!
Our Paradise, the Garden of the Blessed,
Never smiled upon a purer Soul than thine.
For me, think not of me; such are my Woes,
That I disdain all Care, detest Relief:
My Name is trod in Dust; Thine beams for ever,
The richest Gem that crowns the Worth of Woman.

ELEONORA. The Guilt of SELIM cannot stain thy Virtues:
It rather lends them Luster -- Bear me back,
My dear Attendants: and, good THEALD, come,
Come, aid my mounting Soul to spring away,
From the loved Fetters of this kindred Clay.

End of the third Act.
ACT IV.
SCENE I.
THEALD, and a Gentleman belonging to him. THEALD. TO me a Dervise? Through the
furious Camp,
Yet raging at the Perfidy of SELIM,
How did he safely pass?

GENTLEMAN. Sir, he had fallen
A Victim to their Vengeance: but he told them,
His Life was of Importance to the Prince,
That he who struck him stabbed the Heart of EDWARD.
This stayed their Rage; then, after a strict Search,
They let him pass through Ranks of glaring Eyes.
I have besides to say, an English Ship
And one from Italy are just arrived:
The first brings great Dispatches to Prince EDWARD;
The other, holy Father, these to you.
[Kneeling.
THEALD. Go, bid this Dervise enter.

SCENE II.
THEALD: he opens and looks on the Dispatches. Awful HEAVEN!
Great Ruler of the various Heart of Man!
Since thou have raised me to conduct thy Church,
Without the base Cabal too often practiced,
Beyond my Wish, my Thought, give me the Lights,
The Virtues which that sacred Trust requires:
A loving, loved, unterrifying Power,
Such as becomes a Father; humble Wisdom;
Plain primitive Sincerity; kind Zeal,
For Truth and Virtue rather than Opinions;
And, above all, the charitable Soul
Of healing Peace and Christian Moderation. --
The Dervise comes.

SCENE III.
THEALD, SELIM disguised as a Dervise. THEALD. With me, what would thou,
Dervise?

SELIM. The Princess ELEONORA lives she still?

THEALD. She lives, and that is all.

SELIM. ALLAH be praised!
Then lives the Honor of the brightning Name
Of Saracen and Mussulman.

THEALD. How, Dervise?
What can wipe out the Horror of this Deed?

SELIM. A holy Man's Humanity shall cancel
The savage Fury of an impious Bigot.
But, Christian Imam, lead me to the Princess.
For know, a Dervise, who, amid the Rocks
Of Cedar-shaking Lebanon, beheld
Twelve hundred Moons complete their pale Career;
And who by Fasting, Meditation, Prayer,
And silent Converse with instructive Nature,
Had from his inward Eye and peaceful Heart,
Purged off the Mist and Turbulence of Passion:
This venerable Dervise, not confined
To the still Transports of unactive Virtue,
Felt a warm Zeal to serve his Fellow Creatures;
And to his pious Search the Grace was given
Of finding out a Remedy for Poison.
Nor can it come too late, while wandering Life
Yet, with faint Impulse, stirs along the Veins.

THEALD. Ha! Dervise, art thou sure of what thou say?

SELIM. Yes. He himself consigned it to my Care.
The powerful Juice of Plants, for which he scaled
The tufted Cliff, and over the Torrent hung;
The Balm of Mountain-Herbs, where the gross Soil
But little mixes, tempered Sun and Dew.
And not to those of his own Faith, alone,
He this, from narrow Charity, bequeathed;
No, as it was the Gift of bounteous Nature,
He bade it freely go to all her Sons.
Come, lead me to the Princess: Though she lay
Even in the last Extremity, though called
By the fierce Angel who compels the Dead,
Yet bold Experience gives me Room to hope.
Often have I seen its vital Touch diffuse
New Vigor through the poisoned Streams of Life,
When almost settled into dead Stagnation;
Swift as a Southern Gale unbinds the Flood.
Say, will thou trust me with the Trial, Christian.

THEALD. Thou know, we have great Reason for Distrust;
But Fear in those who can no longer hope
Were idle and absurd.

SELIM. Bright Heaven! what Fear?
Is there a Slave of such inhuman Baseness
Nursed on the sickening Bosom of this Earth,
To add fresh Outrage to a dying Princess?
For Virtue dying? Look into my Eye:
Does one weak Ray there shun thy keenest Gaze?
Say, do thou there behold so foul a Bottom?

THEALD. No; seeming Truth and generous Candor shine
In what thou say. Come, follow me, good Dervise.

SELIM. A Moment yet. -- Should Heaven accord Success,
I have, besides the Life of ELEONORA,
My injured Sultan's wounded Name to save;
Whose Soul abhors the Crime imputed to him.
Then let me be the first who to the Prince
Imparts the happy News; that SELIM'S Honor,
Enforced by EDWARD'S Joy, may strike more deep,
With strong Conviction -- But of this hereafter --

SCENE IV.
THEALD, SELIM disguised, DARAXA. DARAXA. At last, through various Pangs, the
dying Princess
Sees the delivering Moment, and demands
Thy Presence, Reverend Christian.

THEALD. Dervise, come.
Forbid it Heaven this Aid should be too late!

SCENE V.
DARAXA. Ha! -- let me think -- I surely know this Dervise --
O my astonished Fancy! -- can it be? --
But in his Looks, methought, I marked the Sultan;
And, as he shot athwart me, from his Eye
Flashed the proud Lightning of affronted Virtue.
He must be innocent; his being here
Is radiant Proof he must -- O weak DARAXA!
What Man of Virtue more would deign to lodge
His Image in thy Breast? Ah! what avails
The light unfounded Love, the treacherous Friendship,
That, with inhuman Cowardice, gives up
A worthy Man to Infamy and Slander?
They talked of Aid -- what Aid?
[A Cry heard within. Alas! it is past!
For Death was in that Cry -- and now her Soul,
Exulting, quits the Coil of this dim World.
Severe Misfortune! -- If there was a Cure,
That it should come too late!

SCENE VI.
DARAXA, an OFFICER. OFFICER. Madam, the Prince,
Roused by that deathful Cry, from the cold Earth,
Where in his Tent he lay, to Grief abandoned,
And told by an Attendant of the Princess,
That she this fatal Moment breathed her laft,
Now rushes hither to indulge his Sorrows.

DARAXA. Unhappy Prince! I venerate his Tears,
And will retire -- But whither? Rage, Confusion,
Despair and Desolation frown around me! --
I must find out this Dervise, must discover
If he indeed be SELIM -- EDWARD comes.

SCENE VII.
EDWARD. She is no more! the Soul of every Grace,
Of every Virtue! Tenderness itself!
The matchless ELEONORA is no more! --
Where am I? -- Heavens! -- Ah! what a hideous Desert
Is now this World, this blasted World, around me?
O Sun I hate thee, I abhor thy Light,
That shows not ELEONORA! Earth, thy Joy,
Thy Sweetness all is fled, all all that made
Thy Ways to me delightful, ELEONORA!
O ELEONORA! perished ELEONORA!
Pour not so fast thy Beauties on my Heart:
Ah! whither shall I fly from thy Perfections? --
Would I could think no more! -- What shall I do?
Where go? what say? -- That Tent! Ah me! that Tent!
I dare not enter there. There Death displays
His utmost Terrors -- Pale and lifeless, there,
She lies, whose Looks were Love, whose Beauty smiled
The sweet Effulgence of endearing Virtue --
And here I last beheld Her -- Ay, and how,
And how beheld her! -- The remorseless Image
Will hunt me to the Grave -- I see Her Suffering,
With female Softness yet to Pain superior,
Fearful and bold at once, with the strong Hand
Of mighty Love constraining feeble Nature,
To steal me from Affliction -- In the Camp,
Can I appear? A Chief among his Soldiers?
A Chief, who stoops to hold dishonored Life,
Life purchased by the Death of one for whom
The Brave in every Age have joy'd to die? --
And England -- O I cannot bear the Thought
Of ever returning to that Country more!
That Country, Witness of our happy Days,
Where at each Step remembered Bliss will sting
My Soul to Anguish. I already hear
Malice exclaim, nay, blushing Valor sigh:
Where is thy Princess? where the Wish of Thousands?
The Charm, the Transport of the public Eye?
Base Prince! And art thou not ashamed to bring
No Trophy home but ELEONORA'S Corse? --
The Grave too is shut up, that last Retreat
Of wretched Mortals -- Yes, my Word is passed
To ELEONORA passed. Our Orphan-Children
Bind me to Life -- O dear, O dangerous Passions!
The Valiant, by himself, what can he suffer?
Or what does he regard his single Woes?
But when, alas, he multiplies himself
To dearer Selves, to the loved tender Fair,
To those whose Bliss whose Beings hang upon him,
To helpless Children! then, O then! he feels
The Point of Misery festring in his Heart,
And weakly weeps his Fortune like a Coward.
Such, such am I! undone! --

SCENE VIII.
EDWARD, GLOUCESTER. EDWARD. My Lord of GLOUCESTER,
I thought my Orders were to be alone.

GLOUCESTER. Forgive my fond Intrusion -- But I cannot
Be so regardless of thy Welfare, EDWARD,
As to obey these Orders.

EDWARD. But they shall,
Shall be obeyed -- I will enjoy my Sorrows,
All that is left me now.

GLOUCESTER. The more thy Grief,
Just in its Cause but frantic in Degree,
Seeks aggravating Solitude, the more
It suits my Love and Duty to attend thee,
To try to sooth --

EDWARD. Away! thou never shall*
Not all that idle Wisdom can suggest,
All the vain Talk of proud unfeeling Reason,
Shall rob me of one Tear.

GLOUCESTER. Of Nature's Tears
I would not rob Thee: they invigorate Virtue,
Soften, at once, and sortify the Heart;
But when they rise to speak this desperate Language,
They then grow Tears of Weakness; yes --

EDWARD. I care not.
Weakness, whatever they be, I will indulge them,
Will, in Despite of Thee and all Mankind,
Devote my joyless Days for ever to them.

GLOUCESTER. Reason and Virtue then are empty Names?

EDWARD. Hence! leave me to my Fate -- You have undone me;
You have made Shipwreck of my Peace, among you,
My Happiness and Honor; and I now
Roam the detested World, a careless Wretch!

GLOUCESTER. Thy Honor yet is safe, how long I know not,
For full it drives upon the Rocks of Passion.
O all ye pitying Powers that rule Mankind!
Who so unworthy but may proudly deck him
With this fair-weather Virtue, that exults,
Glad, over the Summer Main? The Tempest comes,
The bold Winds speak aloud; when from the Helm
This Virtue shrinks, and in a Corner lies
Lamenting. -- Heavens! if privileged from Trial,
How cheap a Thing were Virtue!

EDWARD. Do -- insult me --
Rail, spare me not -- rail, GLOUCESTER, all the World --
But know, mean time, thou can not make me feel thee --
I have no more Connection with Mankind.

GLOUCESTER. Insult thee, EDWARD? Do these Tears insult thee?
These old Man's Tears! -- Friendship, my Prince, can weep,
As well as Love -- But while I weep thy Fortune,
Let me not weep thy Virtue sunk beneath it --
Thou have no more Connection with Mankind?
Put off thy craving Senses, the deep Wants
And infinite Dependencies of Nature;
Put off that strongest Passion of the Soul,
Soul of the Soul, Love to Society;
Put off all Gratitude for what is past,
All generous Hope of what is yet to come;
Put off each Sense of Honor and of Duty:
Then use this Language -- Let me tell thee, EDWARD,
Thou have Connections with Mankind, and great ones,
Thou know not of; Connections! that might rouse
The smallest Spark of Honor in thy Breast,
To wide-awaken'd Life and fair Ambition.

EDWARD. What do thou mean?

GLOUCESTER. What mean? -- this Day, in England,
How many ask of Palestine their King,
EDWARD their King? -- Read these --

EDWARD, opening the Dispatches. O GLOUCESTER! -- GLOUCESTER! --
Alas! my Royal Father is no more!
The gentlest of Mankind, the most abused!
Of gracious Nature, a fit Soil for Virtues,
'Till there his Creatures sowed their flattering Lies,
And made him -- No, not all their cursed Arts
Could ever make him insolent or cruel.
O my deluded Father! Little Joy
Had thou in Life, led from thy real Good
And genuine Glory, from thy People's Love,
That noblest Aim of Kings, by smiling Traitors.
Is there a Curse on human Kind so fell,
So pestilent, at once, to Prince and People,
As the base servile Vermin of a Court,
Corrupt, corrupting Ministers and Favorites?
How often have such eat up the Widow's Morsel,
The Peasant's Toil, the Merchant's far-sought Gain,
And wantoned in the Ruin of a Nation!
Thus weak of Heart, thus desolate of Soul,
Ah, how unfit am I, with steady Hand,
To rule a troubled State! -- She, she is gone,
Softner of Care, the dear Reward of Toil,
The Source of Virtue! She, who to a Crown
Had lent new Splendour, who had graced a Throne
Like the sweet Seraph Mercy tempering Justice.
O ELEONORA! any Life with Thee,
The plainest could have charmed: but Pomp and Pleasure,
All that a loving People can bestow,
By thee unshar'd, will serve alone to nourish
The Wounds of Woe, and make me more unhappy!

GLOUCESTER. Now is the Time, now lift thy Soul to Virtue!
Behold a Crisis, sent by Heaven, to save thee.
Whatever, my Prince, can touch, or can command.
Can quicken or exalt the Heart of Man,
Now speaks to thine -- Thy Children claim their Father,
Nay, more than Father, claim their double Parent;
For such thy Promise was to ELEONORA:
Thy Subjects claim their King, thy Troops their Chief:
The Manes of thy Ancestors consign
Their long-descended Glory to thy Hands;
And thy dejected Country calls upon thee
To save Her, raise Her, to restore her Honor,
To spread her sure Dominion over the Deep,
And bid her yet arise the Scourge of France.
Angels themselves might envy thee the Joy,
That waits thy Will, of doing general Good:
Of spreading Virtue, chearing lonely Worth;
Of dashing down the Proud; of guarding Arts,
The sacred Rights of Industry and Freedom;
Of making a whole generous People happy.
O EDWARD! EDWARD! the most piercing Transports
Of the best Love can never equal These!
And need I add -- Thy ELEONORA'S Death
Calls out for Vengeance --

EDWARD. Ha!

GLOUCESTER. If thou, indeed,
Do honor thus her Memory, then show it,
Not by soft Tears and Womanish Complaints,
But show it like a Man! --

EDWARD. I will!

GLOUCESTER. Yon Towers! --

EDWARD. It Is true!

GLOUCESTER. Yon guilty Towers! --

EDWARD. Insult us still!

GLOUCESTER. The Murderer of thy Princess riots there! --

EDWARD. But shall not long! -- Thou art my better Genius,
Thou brave old Man! thou have recalled my Virtue --
I was benumbed with Sorrow -- what -- or where --
I know not -- never to have thought of this.
Bright Virtue, welcome! Vigor of the Mind!
The Flame from Heaven that lights up higher Being!
Thrice welcome! with thy noble Servant Anger,
And just Revenge -- Hence, let us to the Camp,
And there transfuse our Soul into the Troops.
This Sultan's Blood will ease my fever'd Breast.
Yes, I will take such Vengeance on this City,
That all Mankind shall turn their Eyes to JAFFA;
And, as they see her Turrets sunk in Dust,
Shall learn to dread the Terrors of the Just.

End of the Fourth Act.
ACT V.
SCENE I.
SELIM. O MY DARAXA! thou have charmed my Soul!
This reconciling Interview has soothed
My troubled Bosom into tender Joy:
As when the Spring first, on the softened Top
Of Lebanon, unbinds her lovely Treffes,
And shakes her blooming Sweets from Carmel's Brow --
It only now remains to see the Prince. --

SCENE II.
SELIM, THEALD. THEALD. I sought thee, worthy Dervise.

SELIM. Reverend Christian,
My toiling Thoughts can find no fixed Repose,
'Till the wronged Sultan's vindicated Honor
Shine out as bright as yon unsullied Sky.
Conduct me to the Prince -- I claim thy Promise. --
It stings my conscious Soul with sick Impatience,
To think what SELIM suffers. For a Man,
Who loves the Ways of Truth and open Virtue,
To ly beneath the burning Imputation
Of Baseness and of Crimes -- such horrid Crimes! --
O it is a keen unsufferable Torment!
Come, let me then discharge this other Part
Of my Commission.

THEALD. That thou soon shall do.
He strait will come this Way, the King of England,
Such now he is. Mean time, it is fit to tell thee,
He must be managed softly; for his Passions
Are all abroad, in wild Confusion hurled:
The Winds, the Floods, and Lightning mix together.
I need not say how little, in this Uproar,
A vails the broken thwarted Light of Reason.

SELIM. Fear not. Thou know, that with with one softning Word,
I can appease his highest Storm of Passion.
But let me take the Method that will gain,
With most convincing Evidence, my Purpose.

THEALD. He cannot long delay, for, as I entered,
I saw him parting from the hurried Camp,
That lightened wide around him: burnished Helms,
And glittering Spears, and ardent thronging Soldiers,
Demanding all the Signal, when to storm
These Walls, devoted to their Vengeance. --

SELIM. Ha!
Then let us quickly find him -- But he comes.

SCENE III.
SELIM, THEALD, EDWARD, GLOUCESTER. EDWARD. Whence is it those Barbarians, here
again,
Those base those murdering Cowards, dare be seen?
What new accursed Attempt is now on foot?
What new Assassination? -- Start not, Dervise,
Tinge not thy caitiff Cheek with red'ning Honor.
What thou! -- Do thou pretend to feel Reproach?
Art thou not of a shameless Race of People,
Hardened in Arts of Cruelty and Blood,
Perfidious all? Yes, have you not profaned,
The Faith of Nations? Broke the holy Tie
That binds the Families of Earth together,
That gives even Foes to meet with hostile Joy,
And teaches War Security? Your Prince,
Your Prince has done it! And you should hereafter
Be hunted from your Dens like Savage Beasts,
Be crushed like Serpents!

THEALD. Sir, this Dervise comes,
To clear the Sultan SELIM from that Crime,
Which you, with strong Appearance, charge upon him.

EDWARD. Appearance, THEALD? with unquestioned Proof.
Doubtless the Villain would be glad to change
The Course by Nature fixed, enjoy his Crimes
Without their Evil -- But he shall not escape me!

SELIM. If, King of England, in this weighty Matter,
On which depends the Weal and Life of Thousands,
You love and seek the Truth, let Reason judge,
Cool, steady, quiet and dispassion'd Reason.
For never yet, since the proud selfish Race
Of Men began to jar, did Passion give,
Nor ever can it give, a right Decision.

EDWARD. Reason has judged, and Passion shall chastise,
Shall make you howl, ye Cowards of the East!
What can be clearer? This vile Prince of Jaffa!
This Infamy of Princes! Sends a Ruffian,
By his own Hand and Seal commissioned, sends him,
To treat of Peace: And, as I read his Letters,
The Villain stabs me -- This, if This wants Light,
There is no Certainty in human Reason;
If This not shines with all-convincing Truth,
Yon Sun is dark -- And yet these Cowards come
With lying Shifts, and low elusive Arts --
O it inflames my Anger into Madness!
This added Insult on our Understanding,
This treacherous Attempt to steal away
The only Joy and Treasure of my Life,
Sweet sacred Vengeance for my murdered Princess!

SELIM. The cursed Wretch who did assail thy Life,
O King of England, was indeed an Envoy
Sent by the Prince of Jaffa: This we own.
But then he was an execrable Bigot,
Who, for such horrid Purposes, had crept
Into the cheated Sultan's Court and Service;
As by the Traltor's Papers we have learned.
For know, there lives, upon the craggy Cliffs
Of wild Phenician Mountains, a dire Race,
A Nation of Assassins. Dreadful Zeal,
Fierce and intollerant of all Religion
That differs from their own, is the black Soul
Of that infernal State. Soon as their Chief,
The Old Man (so they style him) of the Mountains,
Gives out his baleful Will, however fell,
However wicked and abhorred it be,
Though clothed in Danger the most cruel Death,
They, swift and silent, glide through every Land,
As fly the gloomy Ministers of Vengeance,
Famine and Plague; they ly for Years concealed,
Make light of Oaths, nay, sometimes change Religion,
And never fail to execute his Orders.
Of these the Villain was, these ruffian Saints,
The Curse of Earth, the Terror of Mankind:
And the Engagement, Prince, in this Crusado,
That was the Reason whence they sought thy Life

EDWARD. False, false as Hell! the Lie of guilty Fear!
You all are Bigots, Robbers, Ruffians all!
It is the very Genius of your Nation.
Vindictive Rage, the Thirst of Blood consumes you:
You live by Rapine, thence your Empire rose;
And your Religion is a mere Pretense
To rob and murder, in the Name of Heaven.

SELIM. Be patient, Prince, be more humane and just.
You have your Virtues, have your Vices too;
And we have ours. The liberal Hand of Nature
Has not created us, nor any Nation,
Beneath the blessed Canopy of Heaven,
Of such malignant Clay, but each may boast
Their native Virtues, and their Maker's Bounty.
You call us Bigots. -- Oh! can thou with that
Reproach us, Christian Prince? What brought thee hither?
What else but Bigotry? What do thou here?
What else but persecute? -- The Truth is great,
Greater than thee, and I will give it Way;
Even thou thyself, in all thy Rage, wilt hear it --
From their remotest Source, these holy Wars
What have they breathed but Bigotry and Rapine?
Did not the first Crusaders, when their Zeal
Should have shone out the purest, did they not,
Led by the frantic Hermit who began
The murderous Trade, through their own Countries spread
The Woes their Vice could not reserve for ours?
Though this exceeds the Purport of my Message,
Yet must I thus insulted in my Country,
Insulted in Religion, bid thee think,
O King of England, on the different Conduct
Of Saracens and Christians, when beneath
Your pious GODFREY, in the first Crusado,
Jerusalem was sacked, and when beneath
Our generous SALADIN it was retaken --
O hideous Scene! my Soul within me shrinks,
Abhorrent, from the View! -- Twelve thousand Wretches,
Received to Mercy, void of all Defense,
Trusting to plighted Faith, to purchased Safety,
Behold these naked Wretches, in cold Blood,
Men, Women, Children, murdered, basely murdered!
The holy Temple, which you came to rescue,
Regorges with the barbarous Profanation.
The Streets run dismal Torrents. Drowned in Blood,
The very Soldier sickens at his Carnage.
Could thou, O Sun, behold the bla^^ing Sight,
And lift again thy sacred Eye on Mortals?
A ruthless Race! Who can do This, can do it,
To please the general Father of Mankind!
While nobler SALADIN --

EDWARD. Away! be gone!
With thee, vile Dervise, what have I to do?
I lose my Hour of Vengeance, I debase me,
To hold this Talk with Thee.

SELIM. While Truth and Reason
Speak from my Tongue, vile Dervise as I am,
Yet am I greater than the highest Monarch,
Who, from blind Fury, grows the Slave of Passion.
Besides, I come to justify a Prince,
However in other Qualities below thee,
In Love of Goodness, Truth, Humanity,
And Honor, Sir, thy Equal; -- Yes, thy Equal! --

EDWARD. What? How? compare me with a damned Assassin?
A matchless Villain! -- Ha! presumptuous Dervise!
Thou gnawst thy quivering Lip -- A smothered Passion
Shakes through thy Frame. -- What Villainy is That
Thou dare not utter? -- Were thou not a Wretch,
Protected by thy Habit, this right Hand
Should crush thee into Atoms -- Hence! away!
Go tell thy Master that I hold him base,
Beyond the Power of Words to speak his Baseness!
A Coward! an Assassinating Coward!
And when I once have dragged him from his City,
Which I will straitway do -- I then will make him,
In all the Gall and Bitterness of Guilt;
Grinding the vengeful Steel betwixt his Teeth,
Will make the Traitor own it.
[ SELIM, discovering himself. Never!

EDWARD. Ha!

SELIM. Thou can not, haughty Monarch! -- I am He!
I am this SELIM! this insulted SELIM!
Yet clear as Day, and will confound thy Passion.

EDWARD. Thou SELIM!

SELIM. I.

EDWARD. Was ever Guilt so bold?

SELIM. Did ever Innocence descend to fear?

EDWARD. This bears some Show of Honor. Will thou then
Decide it by the Sword?

SELIM. I will do more --

EDWARD. How more?

SELIM. Decide it by superior Reason.

EDWARD. No weak Evasions! --

SELIM. If I not convince thee,
If by thy self I am not of this Crime
Acquitted, then I grant thee thy Demand.
Nay more, yon yielded City shall be thine:
For know, hot Prince, I should disdain a Throne,
I could not fill with Honor. Were I guilty,
I would not tremble at thy threatening Voice;
No, it is my self I fear.

EDWARD. What shall I think?

SELIM. Hear but one Witness, and I ask no more,
To clear my Name. The Witness is a Woman.
Her Looks are Truth; fair uncorrupted Faith
Beams from her Eyes. Thou never can doubt such Beauty;
For it is the Expression of a spotless Soul.

EDWARD. Curse on thy mean luxurious Eastern Arts
Of Cowardice! Thou would seduce my Vengeance --
But I detest all Beauty -- Barbarous Sultan!
Ah! thou have murdered Beauty! thy fell Crime --
Haste, GLOUCESTER, haste -- In sight of Camp and City,
Prepare the Lists -- Now show thy self a Prince,
Or die in shameful Tortures like a Slave.

SELIM. I came not hither or to dread thy Wrath,
Or court thy Mercy.

GLOUCESTER. Sir, you cannot, justly,
Refuse him his Demand. The servent Soul
Of undissembled Innocence, methinks,
Is felt in what he says. First hear this Person,
And if she gives not full Conviction, then,
Have then Recourse to what should always be
The last Appeal of reasonable Beings,
Brute Force.

EDWARD. Well then, conduct Her hither, Sultan. --
[ SELIM goes out. Ah! my disordered Mind! from Thought to Thought,
Uncertain, tossed, the Wreck of stormy Passion!
This Rage awhile supports me; but I feel
It will desert me soon, and I again
Shall soon relapse to Misery and Weakness.
O ELEONORA! little did thou think,
How deeply wretched thy dire Gift of Life
Would make me!

SCENE IV.
EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, THEALD; To them SELIM conducting ELEONORA, DARAXA. SELIM.
Raise thy Eyes, O King of England;
To the bright Witness of my blameless Honor.

EDWARD. No; Beauty shall no more engage my Eyes,
It shall no more profane the Shrine devoted
To the sweet Image of my ELEONORA! --
Let her declare her Knowledge in this Matter.

ELEONORA. Will not my EDWARD bless me with a Look?

EDWARD. What Angel borrows ELEONORA'S Voice! --
O thou pale Shade of Her I weep for ever!
Permit me thus to worship thee -- Thou art! --
Amazing Heaven! -- Thou art my ELEONORA!
My ELEONORA'S Self! my dear, my felt,
My living ELEONORA! -- What -- to whom
Owe I this Miracle? this better Life? --
Oppressive Joy! -- owe I my ELEONORA?

ELEONORA. To him, that generous Prince, who put his Life
His Honor on the desperate Risque to save me,
When numbered with the Dead; who brought, himself,
A swift and powerful Remedy, by which
I am to Light restored -- to thee, my EDWARD!

EDWARD. To him! to him! -- O monstrous! -- whom I, thus,
Have with such Inhumanity insulted!
O blind, O brutish, O injurious Rage!
They they are wise, who, when they feel thy Madness,
Seal up their Lips. And can thou then forgive me,
Thou who have over me gained that noblest Triumph,
The Triumph of Humanity? -- Thou can.
It Is easier for the Generous to forgive
Than for Offense to ask it.

SELIM. Use not, Prince,
So harsh a Word. More than forgive, I love
Thy noble Heat, thy beautiful Disorder.
O! I am too much Man, I feel, myself,
Too much the charming Force of human Passions,
Ever to pretend, with supercilious Brow,
With proud affected Virtue, to disdain them.

EDWARD. How, generous Sultan, how shall I requite Thee?
Here -- Take thy loved DARAXA, whom I meant
To have restored, when this Misfortune happened;
But secret-working HEAVEN ordained her Stay,
To save us all.

SELIM. Were thou the Lord of Earth,
Thou could not give me more! -- my dear DARAXA!

EDWARD, Hence, to the Camp, my GLOUCESTER -- Bid the Soldiers
Forsake the Trenches -- Let unbounded Joy
Reign, fearless, over the mingled Camp and City --
Go, tell my faithful Soldiers, that their Queen
My ELEONORA lives! A Prize beyond
The Chance of War to give! She lives to soften
My too imperious Temper, and to make them,
To make my People happy! -- O my Soul!
What Love ever equaled thine? O dearest! best!
Pride of thy Sex! inimitable Goodness!
Whenever Woman henceforth shall be praised
For conjugal Affection, Men will say
There shine the Virtues of an ELEONORA!
Transporting Bliss! -- How bountiful is Heaven!
Depressing often, but to raise us more.
Let never those despair who follow Virtue.
Love -- Gratitude -- divide me -- Once more, Sultan,
Forgive me, pardon my mistaken Zeal,
That left my Country, crossed the stormy Seas,
To war with thee, brave Prince, to war with Honor.
Now that my Passions give me leave to think:
The Hand of HEAVEN appears in what I suffered,
My erring Zeal has suffered by a Bigot.

SELIM. It does, O King. And venerable Christian,
I know thy Moderation will excuse me.
But since by ruling WISDOM (who unweigh'd,
Unmeant, does Naught) Men are so various made,
So various turned, that, in Opinions, they
Must blindly think, or take a different Way;
In spite of Force, since Judgment will be free;
Then let us in this righteous Mean agree:
Let holy Rage, let Persecution cease;
Let the Head argue, but the Heart be Peace;
Let all Mankind in Love of what is right,
In Virtue and Humanity unite.

The END.
