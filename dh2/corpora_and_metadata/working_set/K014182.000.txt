A SUPPLEMENT TO THE TOUR THROUGH GREAT BRITAIN, CONTAINING A CATALOGUE OF THE
ANTIQUITIES, HOUSES, PARKS, PLANTATIONS, SCENES, AND SITUATIONS, IN ENGLAND AND
WALES, ARRANGED According to the Alphabetical Order of the several Counties;

BY THE LATE MR. GRAY, Author of the ELEGY written in a Country Churchyard,
etc.

To which are now added, by another Hand, Several Additions; also Blank Spaces
at the End, to enable every Traveller or Reader to make his own Remarks or
Corrections.

LONDON: PRINTED FOR G. KEARSLEY, AT JOHNSON'S HEAD NO. 46, FLEET STREET, 1787.

ADVERTISEMENT.
THIS Catalogue was originally written on the blank pages of Kitchen's English
Atlas, by Mr. GRAY. His own extensive researches into the topography of this
island furnished him with many of the particulars; the Summer tours which he
made supplied him with more; and to these he was frequently adding, from the
information of such persons on whose taste and judgment he could best depend.

A few copies were first printed, and interleaved, with a view that those, to
whom they were presented, might at their leisure, make such short remarks as
their own personal knowledge of the several counties enables them to do; and in
these to add or expunge what they may think proper. Because, as, on the one
hand, it is possible some places worthy of note may be omitted, so, on the
other, some may be mentioned which are hardly deserving of the traveller's
attention. The excellent person beforementioned, who made the Catalogue, was
apprehensive of this; and was therefore far from thinking his manuscript
perfect. Yet, as many of his friends had transcribed it in his lifetime, and
many more have requested copies since his decease, it was thought best to print
it in this pocket form; not only for their present gratification, but as the
most likely means of rendering this little work complete, and of fitting it
hereafter for the eye of the public.

The present prevailing passion for viewing and examining the beautiful scenes
which abound in our native country, precludes every necessity for an apology
for the publication now offered to the World, and the name of the Compiler will
secure to it a favorable reception. What Mr. GRAY thought important enough to
engage his attention, those for whose use it is intended will not receive with
neglect. Scenes, Situations, Seats, and Antiquities, selected as worthy of
notice by the elegant Author of the Churchyard Elegy, will be visited with a
degree of respect unfelt before. To his taste no person will venture to
dissent, and to his judgment few but will readily subscribe.

As the present Catalogue was compiled several years since, some alterations,
by change of property or by deaths, may have happened in the names of the
owners of particular seats -- these however can be but few, and, it is
presumed, of no material consequence; but as the Publisher wishes to be
accurate, he will very thankfully receive any corrections which may render the
Work more perfect, and by that means more useful.

The copies of the former Edition where interleaved, in this the blank leaves
are placed at the end, upon a more convenient plan. See page. 63, etc.

(*) This Mark placed before any place, denotes that it is more particularly
worthy of Notice.

desire the Reader, who feels an inclinat^on to censure any of these Letters,
will recollect the persons between whom they appear to have passed, and the
situations of those persons.
