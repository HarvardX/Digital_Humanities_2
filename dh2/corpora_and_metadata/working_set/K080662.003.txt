The Goosander is never seen in the southern parts of Great Britain, except in
very severe winters. In summer it retires northward to breed; continues the
whole year in the Orknies, and has been shot in the Hebrides in summer; it
frequents rivers and lakes, and feeds on fish. In winter it appears about
Sandwich, with the Smew, Red-breasted Merganser, and other water birds.

It is common in the northern parts of the Continent of Europe and Asia. In
summer is found in Iceland, Greenland, Lapland, and other Arctic regions, where
it rears it is young; but migrates toward the south as the winter season
approaches. In America also it abandons the more northern parts in winter.

Length of this Bird is twenty-eight inches; breadth forty: weight nearly four
pounds.

The Bird we have figured is generally considered as the male, and the
Dun-Diver as the female of the same species; and among the more respectable
Naturalists who have held this opinion, we must place Linnaeus, and since his
time Mr. Pennant Willoughby does not seem inclined to adopt this opinion
implicitly; he says, "In the Dun-Diver, which we take to be the female of the
Goosander, we found a large labyrinth -- so that we will not be very confident
that the Goosander and Dun-Diver differ no more than in sex." Orn. p. 336.
; Mr. Latham, to whose abilities and attention the science of Ornithology is so
much indebted, has, however, endeavored to prove, not only that they are two
distinct species, but that the Mergus Castor of Linnaeus is a mere variety The
specimen Mr. Latham describes was killed on the coast of Suffolk; it was no
bigger than the Smew, but agreed in the general color of its plumage with the
Dun-Diver, except the neck, which had a greater mixture of ash color, and that
it had a pale streak between the nostrils and eye.
of the Dun-Diver, or supposed female of the Mergus Merganser, our present
species.

Mr. Latham also observes, among other minute particulars, that the Dun-Diver
is ever less than the Goosander; and individuals of that bird differ greatly in
size: that in one specimen the crest of the supposed female was longer and
fuller than in that thought to be the male; a circumstance observed in no other
bird that is furnished with a crest; for in such the females in many cases have
not even the rudiment of one. He says also, on the authority of Dr. Heysham,
that the Dun-Diver is infinitely more common in Cumberland than the Goosander,
at least ten or fifteen of the first, to one of the last. And he farther adds
in the Supplement, "I have been lately informed by Dr. Heysham, that he some
time since dissected two Dun-Divers, the one weighing about two pounds: this
proved a female; the eggs numerous, and appearing very distinct. The other bird
being much larger, weighed full three pounds. The crest in this was longer than
that of the other, and the belly of a bright buff color. This proved, on
dissection, a male."

This species continues with us the whole year: about the latter end of harvest
they collect together in flocks, and separate again in spring: they feed on
corn, oats, and most other kinds of grain, which they easily bruise with the
hard protuberance with which the inside of the upper mandible is furnished.

The female builds the nest among low bushes, and lays five or six eggs; she
can scarcely be distinguished from the male, except by the color of her
plumage, being somewhat paler. Length six inches and an half.

It is common in this country, though much less so than the Yellow-hammer,
which also is a species of the Bunting genus: they are found in vast numbers in
Italy, in Germany, and in the southern parts of Russia, Sweden and Denmark. --
They are frequently shot, or taken in nets, and sold for Larks, or Bunting
Larks.

Albin says, "It sings sitting upon the highest twigs of trees or shrubs;" but
Latham observes it has no song, only a scream, or tremulous kind of shriek,
three or four times repeated.

The male of this species is much more beautiful than the female; the former
(of which a figure is given in the annexed plate,) weighs about six ounces and
a half: its length fourteen inches; and measures, when the wings are expanded,
twenty-seven inches between each tip. The female weighs eleven ounces: the
color of the back and wings is more pale and dusky than in the male; and the
middle of each feather is marked with an oblong dark streak, pointing
downwards: the breast of a dirty yellowish white; and the tail pale red brown,
crossed with numerous black bars.

It is not uncommon in England, and many other parts of Europe; it breeds in
the hollows of trees, cavities of rocks, old buildings, etc. It lays four eggs,
of a pale ferruginous color, marked with irregular spots of a deeper hue
Portland Museum.
. It feeds on mice, small birds, and insects; and throws up the fur and
feathers in the form of a round ball.

This bird was formerly used in falconry, to catch small birds and young
partridges.

This bird is found in the southern parts of England in winter. It is said to
be found as far south as latitude 37, being met with in the island of Fino; in
the Archipelago Lath. Genesis Syn.
, it migrates toward the north in summer, to breed along with the other
Mergansers; and is therefore met with during that season in Iceland, Lapland,
and other Arctic regions.

Length fourteen inches and a half: breadth twenty-three inches: weight fifteen
ounces.


PLATE LIII. FALCO PEREGRINUS. PEREGRINE FALCON. ACCIPITRES.
Birds of prey. Bill and claws strong, hooked. An angle in each margin of the

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill arched from the base, which is covered with a wax-like
membrane or cere.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Cere, legs and feet yellow. Beak blue. Above ash color
barred with black and brown. Beneath white tinged with brown, with longitudinal

The Peregrine Falcon is very common in the north of Scotland; where it is
trained for falconry; it does not, however, appear to be common in England. It
breeds on some high rocks near Gilsland in Cumberland: in the mountains about
Keswick Latham.
; and on the rocks of Llandidno in Caernarvonshire Pennant.
.

It is common on the continent of Europe, in summer; inhabits also Kamtschatka,
most parts of America, etc. It varies very much at different periods of age;
one mentioned by Pennant, had the whole under side of the body of a deep dirty
yellow, but marked with black, as usual, in other specimens. It feeds on
smaller birds, as partridges, plovers, moor game, etc. The size of this species
is generally about nineteen inches in length, breadth thirty-eight inches,
weight thirty-six ounces.

This elegant Bittern is rarely met with in this country. The first instance we
find on record, on which we can venture to describe it, as a British species,
is that of a male specimen having been shot as it perched on one of the trees,
in the quarry, or public walks in Shrewsbury, on the banks of the Severn. This
account, together with a general description and drawing of the bird, was
communicated by Mr. Plymley of Lagnor, Shropshire, to Mr. Pennant, who inserted
them in the Appendix to his British Zoology Published in 1776.
.

Additional authority is also given to this circumstance by Mr. Latham, in the
fifth volume of the Synopsis of Birds; he says, "another specimen was killed in
1773, near Christ Church in Hampshire, now 1785.
in the Museum of Mr. Turnstall." He observes they have been found frequently
in Arabia, but are scarce in other parts. In France are very rare.

This bird does not exceed fifteen inches from the bill to the tip of the tail;
it is form is graceful, it is body not larger than that of a thrush. According to
Sepp, it lays four eggs, of a white color, and size of a blackird's; the nest
is composed of bits of sticks, with some flag leaves interspersed.


PLATE LV. CHARADRIUS HIMANTOPUS. LONG-LEGGED PLOVER. GRALLAE.
Bill roundish. Tongue entire, fleshy. Thighs naked. Toes divided.

GENERIC CHARACTER. Bill strait, roundish, obtuse. Nostrils narrow.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Bill black, long. Legs red, very long and
slender, and without a back toe. Wings extend beyond the tail. Forehead,
breast, belly, tail, white. Wings and back black, glossed with green. A few
dark spots on the back of the neck and crown.

This bird measures thirteen inches from the tip of the bill to the end of the
tail; to the claws nearly eighteen inches. The extraordinary and very
disproportionate length of the legs gives it such an uncommon appearance, that
we may pronounce it, with strict propriety, the most singular species ever met
with in this country.

It is also not less rare than singular. Sir Robert Sibbald records a brace
that were shot in Scotland; another was shot a few years ago on
Stanton-Harcourt Common near Oxford Pennant, Br. Zool.
: and Mr. White, bookseller, of Fleet Street, has a specimen which was shot out
of a flock of six or seven, in Frenchman-ponds, in Hampshire. This bird does
not perfectly agree in it is plumage with our specimen, but is no doubt only a
mere difference in the sex.

According to Latham it is common in Egypt; plentiful about the salt lakes, and
often on the shores of the Caspian Sea; and in the southern deserts of
Independent Tartary. Found also at Madras, in the East Indies; and in the
warmer parts of America.


PLATE LVI. PODICEPS MINUTUS. LITTLE GREBE. ANSERES.

This Bird frequents marshy places with other species of the same tribe. It
makes a very large nest of grass and aquatic plants in the water, without any
fastening to the banks, so that the nest rises or falls with the water: it lays
five or six eggs of a dirty yellowish white color, which are kept constantly
wet by the water that rises through the nest: the natural warmth of the Bird
when sitting excites a fermentation in the vegetables, and serves to hatch the
young brood.

It is a most expert diver, and is said by Salerne Salerne Orn. p. 377.
to be able to stay a quarter of an hour under water. If pursued it plunges
into the water, and seldom appears again within the reach of gunshot.

Length of this species is ten inches, weight six ounces and a half. The male
very nearly corresponds in colors with the female, and both vary according to
their age. Having no tail, and the legs being placed far behind, give a very
awkward and clumsy appearance to this bird. Common in most parts of Europe, and
mentioned as a native of America.

This is a very beautiful bird, it frequents gardens and orchards where it does
much injury to the fruit trees by tearing off the blossoms, in search of the
eggs and larva of insects. The female builds its nest in holes of walls, or
trees, and lays from fourteen or fifteen to twenty eggs; it is said to desert
its nest, if any of the eggs are touched or broken: but defends its young when
hatched, with much spirit. Length of this species four inches and a half.

This is a large bird, it measures more than three feet in length, in breadth
four feet six inches: weight sixteen pounds.

It is far from common on our shores, and is entirely confined to the northern
parts of the island, except in very severe winters. If we consider the
authority of Albin worth quoting on this occasion, we may conclude it was
scarcely known as a native of this country in his time: he has given a figure
of it in the third volume, plate 93. and says, "It was brought from
Newfoundland, and presented to the Right Honorable the Lord Ilay, who was
pleased to lend it me to draw its picture." Willoughby mentions one being taken
in the island of Jersey; and Latham, in a note, says, "One of these was caught
alive near Keswick, in Cumberland, in July, 1781. It was, as is supposed,
making for the lake, but grew tired before it had power to reach it. Dr.
Heysham."

This last circumstance is very remarkable, as it lives for the most part on
the open sea, and except in the breeding season seldom frequents fresh waters;
nor are we certain whether it breeds on our coasts, as many water birds migrate
to Norway, Iceland, Greenland, etc. to breed, and this species is always found
common in those northern regions. Pennant says in Scotland it is called
Mur-buachaill, or Herdsman of the sea, from its being so much in that element.

The female lays two large pale brown or stone-coloured eggs, in June Latham.
. The skins are tanned by some northern nations with the down upon them, and
are made into caps and other garments.


PLATE LIX. FALCO CYANEUS. HEN-HARRIER. ACCIPITRES.

Many authors have supposed the Ring-tail to be the female of the Hen-harrier,
but Mr. Pennant does not subscribe to this general opinion; he observes of the
Ring-tail, "from some late observations by the infallible rule of dissection,
males have been found of this species." And Mr. Latham, after noticing the
opinion of Pennant, says, "To this I may add my own observations; the Bird I
now possess, as an English specimen, being set down in my notes as a male."

The Hen-harrier is very destructive to the young poultry, skims the ground
when it flies, and does not perch on trees. Length seventeen inches, breadth

This is a common Bird in most parts of Europe. In England it is seen in the
North only in the summer; but in the South it continues the whole year. It is
frequently seen on the heaths with the Stone-chatter; but is not so common as
that Bird. It builds its nest among the furze: its food is chiefly insects.

The colors of the female are not so beautiful as in the male. The white on
the wing is less conspicuous, the breast is of a plain color, and instead of
the white and black streaks on the cheeks, it has only one broad streak of dull
brown. Length about six inches.

The length of this bird is eleven inches; the breadth seventeen. The crescent
of white on the breast is more obscure in the female than in the male; in the
former it is sometimes wholly wanting, and hence some writers on birds have
made the male and female two distinct species Ring-Ouzel and Rock-Ouzel.
. Mr. Latham mentions several varieties, one quite white; a second spotted with
white; and a third, which is bigger than the common one, spotted with white,
and without any crescent on the breast.

This appears to be a migratory species in most parts of Europe. It is met with
in Burgundy in France, about the beginning of October, but stays there only two
or three weeks; it returns there again in April or May for a short time only;
it is found as high as Lapmark, but not in Russia or Siberia Pennant.
; it is also found in Africa and Asia according to Adanson, and other authors.

It breeds in the North of Wales, in Cumberland and Scotland; but is very
rarely seen in the Southern parts of this country, except during its
migrations, at which time it flies in small flocks of five or six. Mr. Pennant
says they are known to breed in Dartmoor, in Devonshire, in banks on the sides
of streams, and that they are very clamorous when disturbed; he further adds,
those that breed in Wales and Scotland never quit those countries; in the last
they breed in the hills, but descend to the lower parts to feed on the berries
of the Mountain Ash.

The Oyster-catcher is very common on some of our shores. It feeds on marine
insects and shellfish; chiefly on oysters and limpets. When it finds an oyster
that gapes wide enough for the insertion of t's bill, it thrusts it in and eats
the fish; it is bill is well constructed for this purpose, it is flattened on
the sides, for more than half it is length, and by forcing it into the shell
sideways, it answers the same purpose as a knife for opening it. In the winter
these birds are seen in considerable flocks, in summer only in pairs; at this
time they live in the neighborhood of the sea and salt rivers. The female lays
four or five eggs on the bare ground, above high water mark; they are of a
whitish brown hue, thinly spotted and striped with black, according to Pennant;
Latham says they are of a greenish gray blotched with black.

It is mentioned by many authors and navigators as an inhabitant of very
distant countries. It is common from New York to the Bahama Islands Arch. Zool.

The female of this species differs so much from the male, that though a figure
of the last has been given in a plate of this work, it cannot be amiss to give
a figure of the female at this time. The female exceeds the male in length, but
considerably more in bulk, weighing eleven ounces, the male only six ounces and
a half. They are both very fierce, and beautiful birds, and were formerly used
in falconry; but as that amusement is now much disregarded, they are seldom
trained for that purpose.

These birds breed in the ledges and cliffs of the most stupendous and craggy
rocks on our coasts. They appear in the British seas early in February, but do
not inhabit their breeding places till May. The female lays only one egg; but
that is of an extraordinary size compared with the bird, being three inches
long: it is of a pale sea green, irregularly spotted with black; sometimes the
ground color is white. They build no nest, but lay the egg on the bare rock,
so close to the verge of the precipice, that if it is the least disturbed,
human ability can rarely place it on its former equilibrium. If the first egg
is destroyed, or taken away, it lays a second, and sometimes a third, if the
second is missing.

These eggs are so eagerly sought after by the inhabitants of the sea coast;
that they often brave the greatest dangers to find them; and not unfrequently
sacrifice their lives in the attempt. The usual method of taking them is for
two persons, having a rope tied round the middle of each, to stand close to the
edge of the precipice, and one to lower the other down gradually, the person
above holding the rope as fast as possible whilst the other collects the eggs.
It however often happens, in this perilous situation, that the weight of the
lowest overbalances the strength of his companion above, and both are forced
down the precipice, where they must inevitably be dashed to pieces.

The Razor-bill is found very common in the north of Europe, in Iceland,
Greenland, etc. They extend along the White Sea into the Arctic Asiatic shores,
and from thence to Kamtschatka and the gulf of Achotka Latham. Arct. Zool. etc.
.

Latham mentions, in his Supplement, the following curious particular of this
species. "The method this bird takes in fishing is rather singular, often
diving and catching several small fish, which it is observed to range on each
side of the bill, with the head in the mouth, and the tails hanging out on each
side of the bill; and when the mouth can hold no more, the bird retires to the
rocks to swallow them at leisure."

After the account that has been given of this bird, in the description of the
male, Mergus Merganser, plate 49, we can add nothing material concerning it. In
the Leverian Museum, the Dun-Diver and Goosander are placed together as male
and female. Pennant has described them as the two sexes of Mergus Merganser;
and the authority of Linnaeus may also be quoted to sanction this opinion. Yet
Latham has endeavored to prove, by the most satisfactory experiments, that
they are distinct species, and that Mergus Castor is only a variety of the
Dun-Diver. Thus perplexed between such opposite opinions, both of which are
advanced by the most respectable naturalists, we can scarcely determine to
which opinion we should incline; but as the observation of Dr. Heysham Vide
Description of Mergus Merganser, pl. 4^.
most evidently tends to confirm the opinion of Mr. Latham, we will not
hesitate to consider them as distinct species, and the Mergus Castor only a
variety. Our readers must, notwithstanding, see the necessity of adopting the
synonyms as for the female of the Goosander.

The length of this species is eighteen inches Sometimes twenty inches, or
rather more.
. The body is small, but the legs are remarkably long. The male differs very
little from the female; and in the essential characteristic, the bill, they
perfectly agree: this part, which is about three inches and a half long, is of
a substance like whale-bone; it is very slender, and compressed, is flexible,
and, unlike the bills of other birds, turns up toward the end, and tapers to a
point.

This bird is common in winter on the eastern coasts of this kingdom,
particularly on those of Suffolk and Norfolk; and sometimes on the lakes of
Shropshire. They are found in great plenty, in the breeding season, in the fens
in Fossdike Wash in Lincolnshire, and in the fens of Cambridgeshire and
Suffolk. They feed on worms and insects, which they scoop out of the mud and
sand; and are sometimes observed to wade or swim, but always close to the
shores.

They lay two eggs, about the size of those of a pigeon. Pennant says, they are
white, tinged with green, and marked with large black spots. In the description
given by Latham, he observes, they are of a cinereous gray, whimsically marked
with deep brownish black patches, of irregular sizes and shapes, besides some
under markings of a dusky hue.

The Avoset is far more frequent in some parts of Europe than in England. Albin
says, in Rome and Venice they are common. Salerne writes, in the breeding time
they are so plenty on the coasts of Bas Poictou, that the peasants take their
eggs by thousands. They are found also in Russia and Siberia, Denmark, Sweden,
and other northern countries.

It is difficult to describe the diversified plumage of this beautiful bird.
The colors are, throughout, of the plainest kinds; but they are so exquisitely
softened, neatly speckled, and elegantly interspersed and varied with streaks
and waves of black, that no description can convey a just idea of its beautiful
appearance.

It has many characters of the Swallow tribe. Klein has placed it in that
genus, and distinguishes it by its undivided tail from the other species; and
Pennant says, it may with justice be called the Nocturnal Swallow, as it
differs from the Swallows chiefly in the time of its flight, the latter being
on the wing in the day, and the Goat-Sucker only in the evening. It agrees in
several respects also with the Owl tribe. Its manners are much the same in most
countries in Europe: it retires into some dark recess in forests, woods, or
among rocks, and never ventures out in the day time but in very gloomy weather,
or when disturbed. As it can see best in the twilight, it comes out in the dusk
of the evening and morning, and collects its food; this it does chiefly on the
wing when it finds abundance of moths and other insects stirring. In the month
of July, it is said to live entirely on the dorr beetle, or cock-chaffer
Scarabaeus Melontha.
; and from this circumstance Charlton has called it the Dorr-Hawk.

The notes of this bird are of two kinds: "the loudest," says Pennant, "so much
resembles that of a large spinning-wheel, that the Welsh call this bird aderyny
droell, or the Wheel Bird." And he farther adds, "it begins its song most
punctually on the close of day, sitting usually on a bare bough, with its head
lower than the tail, the lower jaw quivering with the efforts. The noise is so
very violent, as to give a sensible vibration to any little building it chances
to alight on, and emit this species of note. The other is a sharp squeak, which
it repeats often: this seems to be a note of love, as it is observed to
reiterate it when in pursuit of the female among the trees."

The male is distinguished from the female by a large oval white spot, situated
on the inner web of the first three quill feathers, and another at the ends of
the two exterior feathers of the tail.

The bill is alike in both male and female: it is short, but the gape is
remarkably wide. It is, probably, from the structure of the mouth that the
ancients supposed this bird sucked the teats of goats. In the days of
Aristotle, this ridiculous notion was generally prevalent; but among modern
naturalists, none except Scopoli seems inclined to credit such an opinion.

The female makes no nest, but lays her eggs on the bare ground. They are
usually two in number, of a whitish hue, and marbled with brown.

This is a very confined genus. Latham enumerates, including his supplementary
volume, but seventeen species, and of these we find only our present subject,
mentioned as a native of Europe. It appears to be an inhabitant of every
country on the continent, but is very sparingly diffused in some parts, and no
where common: it is also said to inhabit Africa and Asia. Sonnerat met with one
on the coast of Coromandel. With us it is a bird of passage, and arrives about
the latter end of May. It entirely disappears in the northern parts of the
kingdom in August, but does not quit the southern parts till September.

The size of this species is ten inches and a half, breadth twenty two inches
and a half, weight two ounces and three quarters.

This is the largest bird of the genus that inhabits Great Britain; its length
is twenty-three inches, weight two pounds and a half. The extraordinary length
of the neck, and remarkable structure of the feet, give it a most awkward, yet
singular appearance. The breast and belly is of a very beautiful silvery white,
intermixed with shades of pale ferruginous color, and has a gloss like satin;
these skins are in much request, and like those of the Grebe of Geneva are made
into muffs, tippets, etc. In February the skins lose the bright color, and in
the breeding time the breast is almost bare.

Mr. Latham gives a minute account of the plumage of this species in several
stages of life; he says, "At first they are perfectly downy and striped,
especially down the neck, with black: after this, when about half grown, the
stripes on the neck are less distinct, being rather mottled than striped, and
the under parts, though white, is clouded with dusky; at this period a fullness
round the head is observed: as the bird advances still further toward
perfection, the brown and white appears clear and distinct, the head becomes
much tufted, and the horns are a little elongated. But we have great reason to
believe that the bird does not obtain the full and perfect crest till the
second year at least."

This species is common in some parts of this country. They breed in the meres
of Shropshire and Cheshire, and in the east fen of Lincolnshire They are called
by the country people of this part Gaunts.
. The female lays four white eggs, the size of those of a pigeon; the nest in
which they are deposited, like others of the Grebe kind, are composed of
different kinds of water plants, such as the stalks of the Water Lily, Pond
Weed, etc. carelessly put together, and left floating on the water, among the
flags and rushes. The old bird feeds on small fish; when the young brood is
hatched, they are fed upon small eels. This bird is rarely seen on the land,
and though common, it is very difficult to be shot, as it darts into the water
on the least appearance of danger, and seldom flies farther than the end of the
lake it frequents Pennant.

This is a very common species in this country, as well as in many other parts
of Europe: it is also said to inhabit the most remote parts of Africa.

It frequents gardens, and does much injury to fruit trees in the spring, by
tearing off the young shoots; but, it is also very beneficial, in destroying
the insects that infest those trees. In confinement it prefers hemp seed to all
others.

In its manner it very much resembles a Wood-pecker, it is continually running
up and down the bodies of trees in quest of insects, and such as are concealed
under the bark, it discovers by sounding with its bill. It is very alert and
almost always seen hanging by its legs, or running in a suspended posture. It
is also very courageous, and will attack birds that are far more powerful than
itself.

In the breeding-time it lives chiefly in the woods, and builds in hollow
trees. The female lays from eight to twelve eggs; they are white, spotted with
rust color.

The length of this bird is five inches and three quarters, weight almost an
ounce.

The length of this Bird is twenty-three inches; breadth five feet four inches.
It is a very powerful creature, and is armed with long, hooked claws, and a
remarkably strong bill; in the structure of it is feet it differs from all other
birds of prey; the outer toe turns backwards, and the claw belonging to it is
larger than that of the inner toe.

It frequents the sea-shores, rivers and lakes. Some authors say it feeds on
waterfowl, but its chief food is fish; and these it does not take by swimming,
but hovering in the air, with its eye directed into the water, it soon
discovers it is prey, when precipitating like lightning upon it, it brings the
fish up in its talons, and retires to a distance to devour it. The Italians
call it the Leaden Eagle, because it descends with so much violence on its
prey: and Latham has adopted with an (?) among his synonyms the account of
Kolben, of a bird he supposes the Osprey. Kolben observes, "That it is of all
birds the most destructive to the Flying-fish, taking them during their rise
from the water."

Pennant says it builds it is nest on the ground among reeds, and lays three or
four white eggs of an elliptical form; rather less than those of a hen.

Ancient writers have asserted that the left foot is subpalmated; many
respectable Naturalists of late years have followed this opinion, and indeed
the authority of Linneus had almost finally sanctioned this error. Pennant
contradicts this opinion, and gives a faithful description of the bird, and
Latham has added a very curious and interesting note to his account of it "I do
not believe," says Mr. Latham, "that there is either bird or quadruped, in
which each side of the body does not correspond in size and shape, in a natural
state, though the contrary is sometimes seen in the insect tribe." He further
adds, "In respect to winged insects, it is observed that even the marks of the
wings exactly correspond on each side. Indeed a singular circumstance occurs in
one of the BLATTA or Cockroach genus (Blatta thetcroclita Linneus describes
this Insect Cassida petiveriana, -- Cassida 7 guttata nigra, coleoptris maculis
septem albis. Syst. Ent. 90. 26. -- Linn. Syst. Not. 2. 577. 19. -- Fabricius,
Blatta petiveriana nigra, elytris maculis quatuor flavescentibus. Syst. Ent.
272. 11. -- Spec. Ins. 1. 343. 13.
) which I believe is the only one recorded, at least observed by me. In this
species, one of the elytra, or wing-cases, is marked with sour white spots, and
the other with three only; which holds good in every specimen of it I have yet
seen.

"As to Lusus Naturae, they are far from being uncommon; such as a duck without
webs to the toes, which I have often seen; a common snail with the spiral turns
of the shell reversed, one of which was found in my garden a few years since;
also a flounder having the eyes and lateral line on the left side instead of
the right Br. Zool. vol. 8. p. 293.
, etc.

"These, and an hundred such which might be mentioned, must be reckoned as
singularities happening now and then, but by no means to be set down for
permanent distinctions of species."


, which is certainly an apology in some measure for the mistake in the first
instance; since a bird perfectly according with the description given by early
writers may have occurred. We cannot suppose, without some good authority in
ancient writers, Linneus would have adopted their errors.

This is a very elegant Bird: length two feet, weight two pounds two ounces.
The female differs very little from the male, except that her colors are not
so bright. It is found in vast quantities on several of our seacoasts, and
particularly about the rivers and lakes in Lancashire and Essex, where it finds
abundance of small fish, marine insects, etc. It breeds in holes that it digs
in the earth, or in the deserted burrows of rabbits. The female lays from
twelve to sixteen eggs, of a roundish form and white color. These are
deposited at the farthest end of the hole, and are carefully covered with fine
down, which the female supplies from her breast. The old Bird is very careful
of her little brood, and uses many cunning stratagems to draw the attention of
any disturber from her young: it is even said that if she cannot favor their
escape from danger by that means, she will carry them away in her bill, or on
her back. The time of sitting on the eggs is about thirty days.

Some have attempted to domesticate them by bringing them up under the common
Duck; but they do not thrive so well as when they are wild, nor will any such
attempt be likely to succecd, unless it be made in the neighborhood of the
sea. The flesh is very rank, but their eggs are much esteemed.

This species remains with us all the year: in winter it collects in large
flocks; leaves the Orknies in that season, and returns there again in the
spring. It is also found very far to the North: in Asia about the Caspian Sea

The length of this Bird is seventeen inches; breadth twenty-nine; weight
fourteen ounces and a half. It is much less frequent in this country than the
Curlew, to which it bears a great resemblance in appearance, though not in
size; the latter being usually from twenty to twenty-five inches in length. In
its manners it is also much like the Curlew.

It is met with in flocks from April to May on its passage to the North, where
it is supposed they breed. Mr. Pennant says he received one from Invercauld,
shot on the Grampian Hills. This species seems to vary in a great degree: the
Bird described by Mr. Latham does not accord in several respects with that
given by Mr. Pennant. A specimen of this has been received from Sweden: Mr.
Latham says it is also found in America.
