A Declaration of TRUTH TO Benjamin Hoadly.
BE it known unto thee, Friend Benjamin, that albeit we, who are the People of
the Lord, own thee not in thy proud Titles, neither in thy Office, as thou
exercisest the same; neither can we treat thee with that Distinction wherewith
Men distinguish thee, forasmuch as we do not acknowledge the same (as thou
do) to be of God: Nevertheless I shall treat thee respectfully in this thing,
whereof I am now to commune with thee, seeing thou have uttered much Truth with
thy Mouth, and therefore have moved much Wrath of wicked Men against thee.

And would thou, Benjamin, faithfully pursue the Light which I perceive is
in thee, and which shines abroad far and nigh; I say, would thou act
according to the Light which I plainly see is in thee, thou should have
Praise; for thou have verily done worthily, in that thou have restored the
Kingdom to them to whom it solely appertains, and have dethroned the
Usurpations of wicked Men, who have unrighteously set themselves up in the
Throne of Jesus.

Verily, Benjamin, thou have done worthily, in that thou have appeared for the
Cause of our God against the Unrighteousness of Men; and have not been afraid,
neither discouraged, when they have risen up against thee with great Wrath: And
I am sent unto thee to declare in words of Seriousness, that thou should not
faint, neither be dismayed, for that many of the Faithful Servants of God are
with thee in this thing, and do say unto thee God speed, which thou know we
are forbidden to say unto the ungodly, and unto Men who are not led in the
right way.

Having thus given my Testimony to thy good Works, I communicated my Intentions
to Friends: Among these, Aminadab, a righteous Man, fearing not the Face of
Men, but fearing God only, says unto thee, that his Heart is likewise with
thee in the things which thou have said; to wit, That the Power of Men, or the
Laws of Men, have no Authority to interfere with, or to join their Power with
the Right Hand of Jesus, who allows no Partners in the Throne of his Glorious
Kingdom on Earth, any more than he will admit Partners in the Throne of his
Glorisy'd Kingdom in Heaven. Moreover, he has sent Messengers unto me, saying,
Speak thou Ebenezer in the Ears of Benjamin Hoadly, and say unto him, Fear not
the Face of Men, though many rise up against thee, saying, Thou lie, thou
lie; for verily thou lie not Benjamin, but have spoken the Truth, and it
shall prevail.

Aaron, a Man filled with Knowledge, and a Teacher of Wisdom, sent also unto
me, saying, Ebenezer, the thing which Aminadab our Friend has communicated
unto thee concerning Benjamin Hoadly, are things which savor of Truth; and
thou will do well to speak unto the said Benjamin, saying, Fear not Benjamin,
for wise Men are with thee, and good Men are with thee; and verily they be
better Men, and more in number, that are with thee than those that be against
thee.

I might name unto thee many Friends, endowed with Wisdom and Knowledge, who
speak well of thee, for that thou have spoken the Truth with great boldness,
and have not feared to utter it, even in the hearing of the King, and we may
not doubt but that our Lord the King will be thy strong Helper against all
thine Enemies, and will assist thee to silence the Gainsayers of thy Doctrine;
for verily, the King is an unfeigned Friend unto the Truth, and would be
willing that all Men should walk in the path to Heaven, howbeit he may not be
enlightened equal to our Friends, which nevertheless we hope he may hereafter
be, if God sees it good to bring his Heart over unto us.

And albeit Friend Benjamin, thou art not yet joined unto the faithful Servants
of God our Friends, but that thou for a little while remainest, as to some
things, in the Darkness of the World; yet forasmuch as thou joinest with us in
the Truth, we embrace thee willingly, nothing doubting but that the Heavenly
Light which has shone out in thy Word, will hereafter shine in thy Heart, and
thou will come over more perfectly unto us Friends, who are already established
in the Truth.

And I am the farther confirmed in the truth hereof, in that thou have so
boldly acknowledged the Truths of God, being the same professed by us, and for
the sake whereof we are inclined to think well of thee; and seeing I have
informed thee that thou have so exactly taught what we in Principle believe,
and closely adhere to in Practice, I shall let thee know, Benjamin, how exactly
thou agreest with us who have received the Truth, and that we hold and believe
all the Truths that thou have taught, and that also even in the same words in
which thou have declared them, or but with small variation thereof, as thou will farther be informed, when thou shall read the following Heads, which are
part of the Principles of Truth, or of those things about Doctrine, which we
Friends do most surely believe and recieve; to wit,

Concerning Religion, we believe, that it is only the Spirit of the Lord that
makes Men truly Religious; and no Man ought to be compelled to or from any
exercise or practice in Religion, by any outward Law or Power, but every Man
ought to be left free, as the Lord shall persuade his own mind, in doing, or
leaving undone this or the other practice in Religion; and every Man of what
Profession in Religion soever, ought to be protected in Peace; provided himself
be a Man of Peace, not seeking the wrong of any Man's Person or Estate.

And we believe, That to reprove false Opinions and unsound Doctrines and
Principles seeking to convince them that oppose themselves, by Exhortation or
sharp Reproof, by word or writing, ought not to be counted a breach of the
Peace; or to strive about the things of the Kingdom of God, by Men of contrary
Minds or Judgments, this ought not to be punished by the Magistrates and their
Laws: for we believe that the outward Laws and Powers of the Earth are only to
preserve Men's Persons and Estates, and not to preserve Men in Opinions: neither
ought the Laws of the Nation to be laid upon Men's Consciences, to bind them to
or from such a Judgment or Practice in Religion.

And we believe, That Christ is, and ought only to be Lord and Exerciser of
Men's Consciences, and his Spirit must only lead into all Truth.

And we believe, That Obedience and Subjetion in the Lord belongs to Superiors,
and that Subjects ought to obey them [in the Lord] that have rule over them:
and that Children ought to obey their Parents, and Wives their Husbands, and
Servants their Masters in all things, which is according to God, which stand in
the exercise of a pure Conscience toward God: But where Rulers, Parents or
Masters, or any other, command or require Subjection in any thing which is
contrary to God, or not according to him, in such cases all People are free,
and ought to obey God rather than Man; and we believe, that herein God will
justify them, being guided and led by his Spirit in all that which is good,
and out of all that which is evil.

Herein, Friend Benjamin, thou may see, as in a Vision of clear Light, that
thou art in the same way of Truth with us, and I have Freedom to own thee
therein; for verily thou have clearly testified unto the Truth which we
believe, in that thou have likewise said, even in our Words, That every Man
ought to be left free as the Lord shall persuade his own Mind.

Now Benjamin let it not seem strange unto thee, that I say unto thee, that
these are our own Words; for I speak therein with Truth and Soberness,
referring thee for Testimony thereof unto a little Book published more than
Forty and Five Years since, by a Body of our Friends, and Signed by John Crook,
a Man endowed with a Spirit of a sound Mind, and also by three other Ancients,
who were likewise Men of true Wisdom. This Book is Entitled, Truth's
Principles, etc. in which Book the Words which I have written unto thee above,
are to be found.

Searching likewise thy Book, Benjamin, which thou have made Public, by the
Command of the King, I find these Words, which I hope thou have learned from
our Friends above written; to wit, That the Language of the Word is, That
knowing the Terrors of the Lord, we should persuade Men; but that the Language
of the Men's Conduct, who profess to succeed Him that Taught the other, is, That
having the Terrors of this World in their power, they do not persuade Men, but
force their outward Profession against their inward Persuasion.

Verily thou have spoken, Benjamin, as one having the Light of the Spirit; and
this is a Truth which the Men of the World cannot be able to resist. Verily,
Friend Benjamin, we agree with thee, that the Kingdom of Jesus is not of this
World, and that the Laws of his Kingdom likewise, and the Rewards and
Punishments of those Laws, are suited to the end of those Laws, and to the
Nature of his Kingdom: Nay, Benjamin, I will use thy Words as thou have used
the Words of wise Men, who went before thee; to wit, "The Laws of this Kingdom,
therefore, as Christ left them, have nothing of this World in their view; not
Tendency, either to the Exaltation of Some, in wordly Pomp and Dignity; or to
their absolute Dominion over the Faith and Religious conduct of Others of his
Subjects; or to the erecting of any sort of Temporal Kingdom, under the Covert
of Name of a Spiritual One." "The Sanctions of Christ's Law are Rewards and
Punishments. But of what sort? Not the Rewards of this Worlds; not the Offices,
or Glories, of this State; not the Pains of Prisons, Banishments, Fines, or any
lesser and more moderate Penalties; nay, not the much lesser Negative
Discouragements that belong to Humane Society. He was far from thinking that
These could be the Instruments of such a Persuasion, as He thought acceptable
to God. But, as the Great End of his Kingdom, was to guide Men to Happiness,
after the short Images of it were over here below; so, he took his Motives from
that place where his Kingdom first began, and where it was at last to end; from
those Rewards and Punishments in a future State, which had no relation to this
World: And to show that his Kingdom was not of this World, all the Sanctions
which He thought fit to give to His Laws, were not of this World at all."



I confirm these thy Positions and Doctrines, Benjamin, with my Voice, and give
thee Praise therefore, for verily thou art worthy of Praise, not only that thou
have spoken boldly the Truth, but for that thou have done it in the Face of the
Adversary, and have not been afraid. And Blessed be the King, into whose Heart
God has put it to Frown upon the Gainsayers; and albeit they were gathered
together against thee, he has seattered them, and has sent them away
discouraged.

Neither do I flatter thee with my Lips; for Friends are not Guilty of such
things, and it would be in me a great Iniquity; but I speak to thee in
Sincerity and in Truth, and my Thoughts are moved to utter the Words of my
Mouth; for verily thou have dethroned and pulled down that Man of Sin, the Son
of Perdition, which has Exalted himself; thou have valintly Encountered the
Tribe of ungodly Priests, who have by an Injurious Usage of the Lord's People,
for many Years usurped the Authority of King Jesus, and have exercised Dominion
over the Souls who they have had committed by Men unto their Charge; these they
have Tyrannized over, and have Cruelly Persecuted under pretense of Authority
from Jesus; albeit Jesus the true King and only Head of all true Believers, as
thou have well said, has given no such Authority unto them.

Now concerning Ministers I will tell thee what Friends do surely Receive and
Believe, and I will not give thee my own words, but the words of the said
Declaration of Truth's Principles mentioned before; to wit,

"Such Ministers as are made by God, who are sanctified by his Word and Power,
who have freely received perfect Gifts from God, and so by the Spirit and Power
of God are sent forth into the World, to turn the People from Darkness to
Light, and from the Power of Satan to the Power of God; who freely Minister
unto others, without coveting any Man's Gold, or Silver, or Apparel; not
seeking theirs, but them: Warning every Man and teaching every Man in all
Wisdom, that they might present every Man perfect in Christ Jesus: such as
minister from the Spirit, and have the Word of God abiding in them; who are
never unprovided, but at all times and seasons, and in all places, do speak and
declare the Truth, as they are moved and instructed, and as the Spirit of Truth
does give them utterance; Such Ministers we own, and have in great esteem."

This we surely do Believe, Benjamin, and thou have done worthily in concurring
with us, and in that thou have taken away from those who call themselves
Ministers, all that Power and pretended Authority which they assume, and which
we say they usurp contrary to the Nature of the Office of a Minister, which we
also Declare to be only to Teach and Instruct, not to Terrify and Affright the
People of the Lord; and herein we know, that although thou will offend them, and
they will show great Wrath against thee therefore; yet, I say, we know thou
have spoken the Truth against them, and I concur with thee therein; nay I
acknowledge thee and own thee therein, because thou have concurred with us in
the Truth, not doubting but thou will be farther enlightened, in the Lord's due
time, to join with Friends in all the words of Truth which we Profess.

I must farther say in thy behalf, Friend Benjamin, that thou have spoken
Excellent words of Wisdom in defiance of the Men of high Notions, who are of
the Tribe who thou did belong to in former time; for thou have taken the
People out of their hands, and have set them free from the mock Terrors of Vain
Men, such as they call the Artillery of the Church; which we that know the ways
of Truth, are acquainted with the Deceitfulness of; and as I Glory in thy Words
thereupon, I shall repeat them in thy Praise as follows, to wit,

"Not the least Tittle of Salvation or Damnation depends upon the Will of weak
Men, but all upon God and your selves; Humane Benedictions, Humane Absolutions,
Humane Denunciations, Humane Excommunications, have nothing to do with the
Favor or Anger of God: But are Humane Engines, permitted to work ( like other
Evils) by Providence."

These are Excellent Things spoken with Wisdom, and thou shall have due Praise
of the same: Likewise have thou Battered down the strong Holds of Satan, in thy
Words on the same Subject.

"In all your Religious Concerns, that effect your Eternal Salvation, and your
Title to God's Favor, your Rule is plain and evident Christ is your sole
Lawgiver, and your sole Judge, as to those Points. The Papists may
Excommunicate the Protestant Non jurors: The Non-jurors may Excommunicate the
High-Church-Men, as well as all other British Protestants, who pray for King
GEORGE: These again may Excommunicate, Unchurch, Unchristian, those whose
Church Government, or Worship, differ from their own; and these again may
Exercise the same Spiritual Discipline, wherever their Terrors can extend
themselves: They may thus scatter Damnation about; Playing, one would think, as
the Man in the Proverbs, with Firebrands and Death, and saying, Are we not in
Sport; and they may every one Flatter themselves, that this Power of the Keys
shuts out from the Catholic Church here, and from the Kingdom of Heaven
hereafter: But it is in truth only from themselves that they can Excommunicate:
And this is very often their own Crime, and their own Loss: but Christ himself
and his Apostles have plainly told you what it is, and what alone that shall
cut you off from him; and Declared a Curse upon all who Preach any other
Gospel; and consequently, who add any thing as absolutely necessary to his
Favor, which he has not made so."

To these Truths of thine, such I call them, as thou have been honored to
speak them first among Men, I bear my Testimony, and the good People, the
People of the Lord, despised by Men, of whom I am the meanest, have born their
Testimony many Years ago: I say, with thee, that the boasted Terms which those
Men make wicked use of, such as Regular and uninterrupted Successions,
Authoritative Benedictions, Excommunications, Absolutions, etc. are Vain Words,
mere Terrors of Men, not the Terrors of the Lord, Niceties and Trifles: And
therefore it is that we disown the whole Tenor and Substance of the Canons and
Institutions of that which they Profanely, as I doubt not thou will in time be
led by these Lights to do also; I Despise and Contemn all the pretended
Authority of that which they weakly and impertinently call, a Power derived
from Christ and his Apostles: I know no Ministers but such as is before
described; as for such as are brought up at Schools and Colleges, and so made
Ministers by the will of Man, who have not freely received perfect Gifts from
God for perfecting of the Saints, but denies Perfection, and so denies the
Ministers Work, neither do minister freely, but seek for Gain from their
Quarters, and will not Preach without a price; who are not sanctified by the
Word of God, but plead for a continuance in Sin while People walk upon the
Earth: Such as Minister from the Letter, and not from the Spirit; who cannot
Preach except they have time to Study, and so by their industry provide
themselves, and are not provided of the Lord (such a Ministry is of Works, and
not the Free Gift from God) such cannot profit People, but lead them captive in
an empty and dead Form, always hearing, but never able to come to the true
Knowledge of God: Such called Ministers we do deny, and turn from them, and
testify against them, as the holy men of God formerly did.

I doubt not, Friend Benjamin, but thy Words tend to bring thee to the same
Just Contempt, that I have entertained, and that Friends most righteously do
entertain of these uncalled Priests, and that in the mean time thou will, by
thy sober and weighty Speeches, bring all that wicked Hierarchy, which those
Priests so violently contend for, into Contempt among the People.

I am therefore moved to bear my Testimony with thee against them; forasmuch as
they usurping high Dignity and Authority, have erected a Kingdom which they say
is the Kingdom of Jesus; howbeit, as I verily think, it is a Kingdom of this
World, forasmuch as they exercise Jurisdictions which be of this World therein,
and have taken to themselves Powers which be of themselves; which nevertheless
they take upon them to say, are descended to them, and by the notions and
pretenses of a Succession of those Powers, they assume a Right to Exercise
those Powers over the Consciences of Men, which Friends say they have no Right
to do: And furthermore we say and believe, That whereas they Exercise the Power
and Authority which alone belongs to King Jesus, the King and sole Chief of his
faithful Followers; they therefore erect their own Kingdom, not the Kingdom of
King Jesus, and exercise the Authority and Power, which is his only, as their
own.

I rejoice, Benjamin, that thou have published true Doctrine, and have given
thy testimony with us to the Truth, which we on so good and solid Foundations
have received; and I question not but thou will be assisted by the Spirit of
Truth to pull down and overthrow the whole Power; Hierarchy and Constitution of
that People who call themselves The Church; verily, they are Usurpers of the
Kingdom and Throne of King Jesus; and thou shall be a Champion of the Truth, in
that thou shall overthrow those Ecclesiastic Principalities and Powers, which
are not of God, and shall establish true Religion in that mighty Principle of
Heavenly Light, in which it is only to be found.

This is that inward Revelation which thou have been obliged to bear thy
Testimony unto, ( viz) That Light which persuades the Minds of Men, and whereby
every step of Reformation which has been made in the World, has been
justified, and which, as thou say well, is all the Account which Protestants
can give for their being reformed from the People called Papists.

And doubtless thou have by the same Arguments justified all those, the People
of the Lord, who being persuaded in themselves of their being guided by
Heavenly Light, have separated and withdrawn from these Usurpations, of which
thou have spoken so worthily.

And what remains, beloved Friend Benjamin, but that thou should, according
as thou have worthily begun, and according to the Light which shines in thy
Mind, separate thy self from these Usurpers of unrighteous Authority, and
joining thy self with the Friends to Truth, should bear thy Testimony against
all Ungodliness; for verily Benjamin, thou can not but see and abhor the
Doctrine which these Men teach, saying, We are the Church, and Power is with
us; which thou know is false, and is not of God, and that the Power which
they use is not of God, but is the Power of Men, tending to ungodly Dominion
and Usurpation; such as is that of the Pope of Rome, which nevertheless they
have disowned while they yet practice.

For verily, Benjamin, it seems to me that thou who have received such Light,
and have acknowledged the Truths which are directly contrary to these Men,
can not any longer continue among them, or wear those profane Ensigns of
Idolatry, whereby thou art distinguished from other Men, even in a manner which
thou thy self know is not appointed by King Jesus: For verily, Benjamin, the
Robes of Distinction which thou wearest, and wherewith thou art honored among
Men, are the Ensigns of that usurped Power which thou have so worthily
condemned, and thou can not longer abide among those who thou know are the
Enemies to the Light which thou have received, and who walk contrary to the
Doctrine which thou have taught, and which we the Lord's People have so many
Years ago received.

Wherefore I am moved to advertise thee, in behalf of the Truth, that thou
should not delay any longer joining thy self unto the Lord's People, whose
Cause thou have already so worthily pleaded: For why should thou not cause
thy Life and thy Doctrine to conform unto each other? And why should thou
decline to profess openly thy adherence to the Lord's People, whilst thou do
not decline to teach the Principles which they believe, and which they have
received from the beginning?

It is true, Benjamin, the mean and humble Station of those who be Teachers and
Ministers of the Lord among us, may not be agreeable to thy present Temper, who
art exalted to be great among Men; but whereas thou know that the Kingdom of
Jesus is not of this World, and that likewise his Rewards are not of this
World, as thou have most worthily taught; so Benjamin, how should thou not
reject the Honors given by Men, which are the Rewards issuing from that
usurped Power which is not according to the Laws of his Kingdom! These
sincerely, according to thy own Rules, are not of God, neither can thou, who
art now enlightened from a higher Spirit, submit to be decked with their
Ornaments, but should cast them off, like as Christians in Primitive Times
refused to be decked with the Garlands and Vestments of Idolatrous Priests; and
like as those People who are called Protestants, refuse and detest the
Habiliments and Vestments, Titles, Dignities and Distinctions, of the Popish
Priests, choosing to be called by the truly venerable Name of Ministers of
Christ, rather than by the Titles of Popes, Cardinals, Abbots, Monks, Friars,
and the like.

Forasmuch then as the Usurpers of the Power and Authority of King Jesus have
manifestly invaded his Crown and Judicatory also, as thou have said, and have
set up Marks of their usurped Authority, to wit, their Antichristian
Excommunications, Absolutions, Exorcisms, and other profane Practices, and have
likewise given Honors, which our Lord and only Sovereign Jesus Christ never
gave, it seems unto me, that thou Benjamin, who have so manfully dethroned
their Power and Authority, and have exposed their Usurpation to such Contempt,
or at least have contemned it in thy Heart, and with the Words of thy Mouth; I
say, it seems unto me that thou can not receive the Honors given by that
usurped Authority without some Breach upon the aforesaid Declaration of thy
Principles, and acting therein contrary to the Light which is within thee.

Furthermore, Benjamin, I admonish thee to consider that thou can not abide
in the Truth which thou have now taught in thy Speaking Place, and published
with boldness in Printed Papers, unless thou come out from among that sort of
People, of whom thou art said now to be a Ruler; forasmuch as thou have
declared them to be Workers of Iniquity, and Sons of Belial: Thy Conscience
therefore will not suffer thee to be called any longer by their Name; neither
can thou be found any longer to own and join thy self unto them: Can thou,
Benjamin, be joined unto Usurpers of the Authority of thy Master and King?
Can thou share his Power, whom thou have so loudly declared to be the sole
Lawgiver and Governor of his Kingdom? Do not these Men continue their
Usurpations? Do they not continue to claim that Authority which, as thou have
said, appertains only to Christ the King? And thou know, Benjamin, they will
continue to claim the same, and to exercise it, as if it was granted unto them,
albeit thou know that it is not. Wherefore, O Man, remove thy self speedily
from these Men; yea, I know thou will remove thy self from them: For why
should thou be found at last in the company of those Men whom thou have
filled with Contempt, saying, They are Enemies to the Kingdom of Jesus in the
World.

Verily, Benjamin, thou have done well in that thou have openly declared the
Iniquity of those who have armed themselves with unlawful Power, and have
exercised Tyranny over their Brethren, saying, Ye must join with us, otherwise
ye shall go to Prison; or otherwise you shall have no Honor, or Part or Lot
among us; whereas King Jesus never left any such Commandment: But it remains
as a Difficulty, or Doubt, unto us who are Friends, how thou can, O Benjamin,
lay a Confederacy with these Men! Art not thou therein an Usurper also with
them of the Power and Authority of thy only Lord and King; and that in a much
grosser manner than they? Verily, Benjamin, if thou come not out from among
them, thou will give occasion to wicked Men to say of thee, that thou have said
that in thy Teaching Office which thou will not put in practice in thy own
Person; and they will speak evil words of thee, saying, Thou teach Men to do
what thou shunnest to do thy self; and that thou shunnest not those things
which thou teach others to shun and avoid. Moreover, Benjamin, Art thou not
even at this time, and after the similitude of thine own words, according to
thy own Doctrine, an Usurper of the Authority of King Jesus, in that thou
continuest to exercise that same Power, of which thou have said that King Jesus
gave no such Power unto Men, to wit, that profane unlawful Power which those
whom Men call Bishops generally exercise over their Brethren, oppressing the
Lord's People in their ungodly Courts. Do thou not preside in thy usurped
Judicature, exercising that Power there which thou have said, the Lord has not
given thee a Right to exercise? And do thou not there make use of those
things which thou have owned to be Trifles and Nullities, to wit,
Excommunications, Absolutions, and such like things? I say, Do thou not
suffer these things to be done in thy Name, to the Subjects of thy Lord, in
those Seats of Evil Men called Ecclesiastic Courts? And how can thou do this
after thou have so plainly told us, that this is to make thy self King in the
stead of thy King Jesus. Nay, Friend Benjamin, in this thou have not done well;
forasmuch also, as thou have sinned herein against the Light that is in thee,
and have caused thy Feet to tread aside out of the Path of Truth, which thou
have chalked out for others, that they might walk therein: But I trust that
thou will be guided by the good Spirit, and by the light of Truth shining in
thy Soul, and then thou will be sure to come away and remove from the Tents of
wickedness.

Wherefore, Friend Benjamin, as I know that the Truth has been spoken by thee,
I warn thee, for thy good, that thou come out speedily from among them; lay
down thy painted Vestments, and profane Trinkets, the Ensigns of that
Usurpation upon thy Lord and Master's Kingdom, which thou have so faithfully
born thy Testimony against; I say, I exhort thee to lay them down speedily, and
come out from among them forthwith, joining thy self unto us, whose Principles
thou have acknowledged: So shall thy Life and Doctrine be Uniform, and thou
shall be sure to deserve that Blessing which attends those who are not ashamed
to Practice the things which they Profess.

Likewise, Benjamin, this will enable thee to overcome the Gainsayers; for
behold they do already upbraid thee herewith; and verily the Man called Andrew
Snape, has spoken unto thee Words of scorning with boldness, in a Book which
he styles, a Letter written unto thee; and in the Twenty and Fifth Page
thereof, that if the Case be as thou have said, it is the Men called Parsons,
have nothing more to do but to throw up their Orders, since their Church has
no need of them, and since they not only do no Service, but are Guilty of a
Criminal Usurpation.

Likewise has the same Andrew Snape said unto thee in his said Book, and in
the Thirty and Sixth Page thereof, these words, to wit, That he does not see
how, upon these Principles, thou can take thy place in the Provincial
Sanhedrim of the Priests, or how thou can require Subscriptions or
Declarations of those of the Sons of the Prophets whom thou do admit to the
Priesthood among thy People, or how thou can Exercise almost any Act of
Episcopal Jurisdiction.

Now verily, Benjamin, albeit this same Andrew Snape is a Man by his Profession
in an evil way, and such as I allow not to be according to the Truth; yet
nevertheless herein has he spoken unto thee words which thou should
consider well of; for that they are of weight unto thee, to wit, That thou
should separate thy self from Evildoers, whose ways thou know to be
Wrong; and that whereas thou have condemned them for Usurpation, and Invasion
of the Kingdom of King Jesus, thou should not at the same time continue
among them, or sit in thy Seat in their Assemblies.

Moreover, it seems unto me, Benjamin, that whereas thou have replied to
Andrew Snape in harsh Words, saying, That he has evil entreated thee, and has
written bitter things against thee, and things which savor not of Truth; yet
nevertheless, I perceive that thou have not said one word unto him to Gainsay
what he has told thee concerning thy coming out from among them, or that thou
can not, by thy own Principles, take thy Seat in the Assembly of thy Priests;
wherefore I rejoice in thy behalf, nothing doubting but that thou will come and
join thy self with the Lord's People, who are Friends unto the Truth, and unto
all that thou have said of the Usurpation of Men, and as I have already given
thee to understand, have many Years received the Truths which thou have
Preached at this day.

Neither let it grieve thee, Friend Benjamin, that thou shall relinquish the
things which Men call Honors and Greatness, and shall lose thereby the
Advantages and Profits which thou do now receive; forasmuch as thou know
that the Rewards of the Kingdom of Jesus, are not of this World; and if the
Rewards of this World are the Sanctions of the Kingdom whereof thou have
spoken, then it is not of Jesus: So that thou shall only relinquish the Rewards
of this World, and shall seek the Rewards of that Kingdom which is not of this
World.

These things being so naturally drawn from thy own words, I trust thou will
not Hesitate thereat, but wilt accept of my wholesome Advice, and show thy self
not to be ashamed of the practicing those things whereof thou have testified,
saying, That they are True.

Neither can thou, Friend Benjamin, be in danger of joining with any other
People than those, whose Profession I have here invited thee to; since there
are not any who have received the Truths which thou have Preached in their full
Degrees, so as the People, who in contempt are called Quakers; with whom, as I
have showed, thou have perfectly conformed thy self to the Honor of thy
Judgment, and of the divine Light showing forth in thee.

As for those People called Presbyterians, thou can by no means join thy self
unto them, seeing they have declared themselves in Terms greatly opposite to
thy Doctrines, saying, That Men have Power to make Laws, binding the
Consciences of others; and that Rewards and Punishments of this World appertain
to Humane Authority, exercised by such as they call a Succession of Officers:
These their Opinions are not according to Truth, as Friends have received it;
neither are they like unto those. Truths which thou have Preached: And
therefore we see that questionless thou will avoid also the Erroneous Opinions
of Persecuting Presbyterians, and wilt join thy self unto us; and this I speak
unto thee with the more certainty, forasmuch as, Blessed by the Lord, thou art
already come beyond the corrupt Tenets of those People: Moreover, beloved
Friend Benjamin, I make known unto thee, that the said Presbyterians are
equally guilty of those things which the People of the Lord abhor; to wit, The
pretenses to a Power, which, as thou said well, Jesus the King of all those
who are led by the light of the Truth, never delegated to them; and this they
not only give to their Followers, but make Laws of their own; I say, Humane
Laws, and Sanctions of Laws, such as Rewards and Punishments, for enforcing
others to comply therewith; to wit, That they admit none to be Teachers among
them, or to Preach and Prophesy unto the People, unless they profess to believe
and to receive certain Points which they call profanely, Articles of Faith;
wherein these wicked usurpations of Power are openly declared by them, saying,

1. "That the Lord Jesus, as King and Head of his Church, has therein
appointed a Government in the hand of Church Officers distinct from the Civil
Magistrate."

2. "That to these Officers the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are committed; by
Virtue whereof they have Power respectively to Retain and Remit Sins, to shut
that Kingdom against the Impenitent, both by the Word and Censures, and to open
it unto penitent Sinners, by the Ministry of the Gospel, and by Absolution from
Censures, as occasion shall require."

3. "That these Church Censures are necessary, etc. for preventing the Wrath of
God, which might fall upon the Church, if they should suffer the Seal of the
Covenant to be profaned by Notorious and Obstinate Offenders."



These things thou know, Benjamin, are contrary to the Doctrines and
Positions which thou have so openly avowed, being no less than Invasions, and
manifest Usurpations, of the Kingdom and Authority of King Jesus, and in
themselves Nullities and Trifles.

Yet these things, and in these Words, thou will find in those Heads of Belief,
which these ungodly Presbyterians call the Confession of their Faith, Article
the XXX. Howbeit, Blessed art thou, O Benjamin, in that thou have born thy
Testimony against these also. Wherefore I know, that leaving behind thee all
these wicked and erroneous Opinions, and bearing witness to the Truth, thou will at length join thy self unto us; and I rejoice over thee in this, that
thou art enlightened to know the Truth; Testifying that I embrace thee with
Affection in the Lord.

Friend Timothy Greeteth thee in like manner; as also James the Aged, a Lover
of those who forsake the Errors of the Wicked: In a word, all Friends Greet,
and speak well of thee.

Fare thee well.
FINIS.
