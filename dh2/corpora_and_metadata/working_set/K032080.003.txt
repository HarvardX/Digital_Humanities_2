THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BRITISH SHELLS.
PLATE LXXIII. MYA MARGARITIFERA. RIVER PEARL MUSCLE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal an Ascidia. Shell bivalve, gaping at one end. The
hinge for the most part furnished with a thick strong broad tooth, not inserted
into the opposite valve.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell oblong, thick, and covered with a
coarse black epidermis, much decorticated or worn down about the beaks. A large
notched conic tooth in one valve, and two small ones in the other.

"This shell," says Pennant, "is noted for producing quantities of pearl. There
have been regular fisheries for the sake of this precious article in several of
our rivers. Sixteen have been found in one shell. They are the disease of the
fish analogous to the stone in the human body. On being squeezed, they will
eject the pearl, and often cast it spontaneously in the sand of the stream.

"The Conway was noted for them in the days of Camden. A notion also prevails
that Sir Richard Win, of Gwydir, chamberlain to Catherine queen to Charles
II. presented her majesty with a pearl (taken in this river) which is to this
day honored with a place in the regal crown. They are called by the Welsh
Cregin Diluw, or Deluge Shells, as if left there by the flood.

"The Irt, in Cumberland, was also productive of them. The famous
circumnavigator, Sir John Hawkins, had a patent for fishing that river. He had
observed pearls plentiful in the straits of Magellan, and flattered himself
with being enriched by procuring them within his own island.

"In the last century, several of great size were gotten in the rivers in the
county of Tyrone and Donegal, in Ireland. One weighed thirty-six carats, was
valued at 40 l. but being foul lost much of its worth. Other single pearls were
sold for 4 l. 10 s. and even for 10 l. The last was sold a second time to lady
Glenlealy, who put it into a necklace, and refused 80 l. for it from the
duchess of Ormond."

"Suetonius reports, that Caesar was induced to undertake his British
expedition for the sake of our pearls; and that they were so large that it was
necessary to use the hand to try the weight of a single one Sueton. Vit. Jul.
Caes. c. lxiv.
. I imagine Caesar only heard this by report; and that the crystaline balls in
old leases, called mineral pearl, were mistaken for them Woodward's Method of
Fossils, 29. part 2.
."

"We believe that Caesar was disappointed of his hope: yet we are told that he
brought home a buckler made with British pearl Plinii, lib. 9. c. 35. Tacit.
Vit. Agric^lae.
, which he dedicated to, and hung up in the temple of Venus Genetrix. A proper
offering to the goddess of beauty, who sprung from the sea. I cannot omit
mentioning, that notwithstanding the classics honor our pearl with their
notice, yet they report them to be small and ill colored; an imputation that
in general they are still liable to. Pliny says, "that a red small kind was
found about the Thracian Bosphorus, in a shell called Mya, but does not give it
any mark to ascertain the species."

The Mya Margaritifera is found only in great rivers, and chiefly in those of
the northern parts of Great Britain. Da Costa mentions the Tees, Alne, North
and South Tyne, Tweed, Dee, Don, etc. and adds, generally inhabits the deeper
parts, as gulphs, whirlpools, etc.

The fishermen in the neighborhood of the river Conway sometimes collect those
shells, and extract the pearl, but as they are now become scarce, and the price
inconsiderable, the fishery affords them little encouragement.


PLATE LXXIV. TROCHUS CINERARIUS. UMBILICAL TOP SHELL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal a slug. Shell spiral sub-conic.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Umbilicated or perforated at the base. Not

in a short canal.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Oblong, reticulated, or furrowed transversely
and longitudinally. Mouth beset with prominent teeth.

PLATE LXXVII. VENUS ISLANDICA. THICK VENUS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Bivalve. Hinge furnished with three teeth; two near each
other, the third divergent from the beaks.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell strong, thick, heavy, covered with
epidermis; space in which the hinge is inserted gaping. Margin acute and
entire. White within.

Da Costa notices a material error amongst the synonyms Linnaeus has given with
his description of Venus Mercenaria. The Venus Mercenaria of Linnaeus is the
shell called North American Clam, and of which the Wampum, or indian money, is
made; this is not the species found on our coast and figured by Lister, p. 173.
as Linnaeus imagined, but a shell altogether distinct; the English species
Lister notices, is the true Venus Islandica of the Linnaean Systema Naturae.

This error has misled Pennant, who confounds the North American kind with our
species, at least as a variety having a purple tinge within it. Gmelin was
aware of this mistake, for in his edition of the Systema Naturae, both the
plates and descriptions of Pennant and Da Costa are referred to in the synonyms
of Venus Islandica.

This shell is perfectly white when fine, and is thickly covered with a fibrous
epidermis of a black, or brownish color. Found on several of our coasts. Da
Costa mentions Northumberland, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Dorsetshire,
Caernarvonshire, and other shores of Wales. Aberdeenshire, and the islands of
Orkney, etc. in Scotland.


PLATE LXXVIII. ARCA CAUDATA. TAILED ARK SHELL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Tethys. Shell bivalve equivalve. Teeth of the hinge
numerous, inserted between each other.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Oblong oval, one end rotundated, the other produced or
lengthened out, angulated, and truncated at the end.

ARCA CAUDATA: testa oblongo ovali anterius rotundata posterius elongata
angulata, apice subtruncata.

Very rare, and not hitherto described as a British species. Found on the
Kentish coast.


PLATE LXXIX. BULLA RESILIENS. ELASTIC BULLA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Shell rather convoluted at one end, sub-oval.
Aperture oblong.

Shell oval, pellucid, elastic. Spire somewhat depressed and canaliculated, or
grooved along the margin.

BULLA RESILIENS: ovalis, pellucida, vi resiliendi praedita, spira, subdepressa
anfractibus canaliculatus.

This interesting species of Bulla, which has lately been found in Devonshire,
and considered as a new discovery, was first introduced to the notice of
English Conchologists by the Rev. Mr. Cordiner. He discovered them some years
ago on the shores of Bamff, and sent them, with several others, disposed in a
grotto work, as a present to the late Duchess of Portland. Since that time they
have been found at Lymington, in Hampshire, by Mr. Keate; and lastly, during
the summer months of 1800, was taken in a moat near Portsmouth, by J. Laskey,
Esquire. of Crediton, who favored us with some particulars respecting the animal
inhabiting it. In a young state, he says, it has the appearance of a winged
insect, and sports in its watery element with all the liveliness of a
butterfly, and formed a pleasing object when kept alive in a glass of sea
water. It seems to prefer little pools, or still waters within reach of the
tide, to more exposed situations.

In general the specimens that have been found at Portsmouth are very small,
the shell from which the upper figure is copied far exceeding the others in
size. This species, though very thin and brittle, is yet so elastic as to bear
much compression without injury, and in this respect differs from every other
British species of Bulla already known. Amongst the foreign kinds are several
eclastic kinds; and this very species is found of a much larger size in the
Mediterranean Sea. -- Independent of its elasticity, the convoluted apex is a
material character of this shell, considered as a British species.


PLATE LXXX. TURBO MUSCORUM. CYLINDRIC, OR MOSS WREATH SHELL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Univalve, spiral or of a taper form. Aperture
somewhat compressed, orbicular, entire.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Cylindric, pellucid, six spires, separated by a strong
furrow, obtuse at the tip. Mouth oval.

TURBO MUSCORUM: testa ovata obtusa pellucida: anfractibus senis secundis,
aperture edentula. Gmel. Linn. Syst. Not. p. 3611. sp. 94. Cochlea testa

Linnaeus and Da Costa have described this species with six spires; Pennant
mentions only four; and we have remarked, that those with four spires are more
numerous than the others.

It is a small shell, rarely exceeding the size of the smallest figures in the
annexed plate; is very transparent, smooth and glossy, but under the magnifier
exhibits many longitudinal streaks.

This shell inhabits mosses on old walls, thatches, trees, etc. It has been
found by Da Costa in Middlesex and Surry; by Petiver on the sandy banks of the
Thames, at Kingston, in the latter county. Dr. Lister, in plenty at Estrope, in
Lincolnshire. Morton, in great plenty in the ground near Morsley Wood, in
Northamptonshire; and received also by Da Costa, from Leeswood, in Flintshire.


PLATE LXXXI. MYTILUS PELLUCIDUS. PELLUCID MUSCLE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge toothless and consists of a longitudinal furrow.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Oblong, very pellucid, rayed longitudinally
with purple.

MYTILUS PELLUCIDUS: oblonga pellucida longitudinaliter violaceoradiata.
MYTILUS PELLUCIDUS. Penn. Brit. Zool. 4. p. 112. sp. 75.
This is one of the new species of Mytilus discovered by Pennant on the coast
of Anglesea, where he says, it is "found sometimes in oyster-beds, and
sometimes in trawling over slutchy bottoms." We dredged up a specimen of it in
the straits of Menai, but it was rather less of an oblong form than that
described and figured by Pennant; and another similar to it was also found on
the Flintshire shores: -- both Pennant's specimen and ours are figured in the
annexed plate.

We have lately received a very analogous species, if not a mere variety of it
from Portsmouth; but those were evidently of foreign growth, having been
gathered from the bottom of the William Tell prize ship, soon after its arrival
from Malta.


PLATE LXXXII. MYA DECLIVIS. SLOPING MYA, OR GAPER.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal an Ascidia. Shell bivalve gaping at one end. The
hinge for the most part furnished with a thick, strong, and broad tooth, not
inserted into the opposite valve.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell somewhat oval, posterior end obliquely
angulated. Tooth of the hinge thick and scarcely prominent.

MYA DECLIVIS: testa subovali, postice oblique subangulata. Cardinis dente
crasso vix prominente. MYA DECLIVIS with a brittle, half transparent shell,
with a hinge slightly prominent; less gaping than the truncata; near the open
end sloping downwards. Penn. Br. Zool. Vol. 4. p. 79. sp. 15.
Pennant informs us that this species is frequent about the Hebrides; and that
the fish is eaten by the gentry. We cannot question his authority in this
respect, but must observe it is uncommonly rare in cabinets of British Shells,
and has not even been noticed, we believe, by any other Author. -- Pennant has
not figured it.


PLATE LXXXIII. VENUS GRANULATA. SPECKLED VENUS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Bivalve. Hinge furnished with three teeth; two near each
other, and the third divergent from the beaks.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell rotund, sulcated longitudinally and
decussated with transverse striae; margins crenulated. Outside whitish,
variegated with livid and purple spots. Inside violet.

VENUS GRANULATA: testa rotundata decussatim striata anterius et margin
crenulato violacea. Gmel. Linn. Syst. Not. p. 3277. sp. 33. Venus marica. Born.
Mus. Caes. vind. test. t. 4. f. 5. 6.
Born has figured and described this shell as Venus Marica, and to distinguish
it from a Linnaean species of the same name some conchologists have denominated
it Venus Marica spuria. It is the Venus granulata of Gmelin, who refers to
Born's figure in the synonyms.

Gmelin describes another shell under the name of Venus Violacea; which nearly
agrees with V. granulata, V. VIOLACEA: testa intus violacea: striis
perpendicularibus squamosis, margin denticulato. Gmel. Syst. Not. p. 3288. sp.
94. This shell is figured in Lister's Conch. t. 338. f. 175. and is destitute
of those external marks and specklings we have invariably observed on specimens
of Venus granulata.

V. granulata is very rare on our coast. The smallest shell in the annexed
plate was found in Cornwall. The large specimen is probably an old shell of
this species.


PLATE LXXXIV. HELIX POMATIA. ITALIAN OR EXOTIC SNAIL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Aperture of the mouth contracted and lunulated.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell globose, with five spires, and
umbilicated; whitish fasciated with brown. Mouth rather roundish.

Pennant has named this species of Helix with some propriety the Exotic Snail,
for, though it is found at this time in vast abundance in several parts of the
country, it is not an indigenous kind. By whom it was first introduced is
uncertain; Pennant mentions Sir Kenelm Digby, and Da Costa speaks of Charles
Howard, Esquire. of the Arundel family. Its history, as related by Da Costa, is so
very interesting, that we shall give it in the words of its author: --

"It is the largest species of land snail in England, and is found in hedges
and woods. It closes its shell carefully against winter, with a white thick
cover or operculum, dull and like plaster, and in the closed state it remains
till the beginning of April, or warm weather, at which time it loosens the
border of the cover, and the animal creeps out of the shell for its necessary
occasions. Dr. Lister informs us he kept one in his bosom about the beginning
of March, when the animal, feeling the warmth, in a few hours disengaged its
cover, and crept out.

"The animal being large, fleshy, and not of an unpleasant taste, has been used
for food in ancient times: it was a favorite dish with the Romans, who had
their cochlearia, or snail stews, wherein they bred and fattened them. Pliny
tells us, that the first inventor of this luxury was a Fulvius Harpinus, a
little before the civil wars between Caesar and Pompey. Varro has handed down
to us a description of the stews, and manner of making them: He says, open
places were chose, surrounded by water, that the snails might not abandon them,
and care was taken that the places were not much exposed to the sun, or to the
dews. The artificial stews were generally made under rocks or eminences, whose
bottoms were watered by lakes or rivers; and if a natural dew or moisture was
not found, they formed an artificial one, by bringing a pipe to it bored full
of holes, like a watering pot, by which the place was continually sprinkled or
moistened. The snails required little attention or food, for as they crawled
they found it on the floor or area, and on the walls or sides, if not hindered
by the surrounding water. They were fed with bran and sodden lees of wines, or
like substances, and a few laurel leaves were thrown on it.

"Pliny tells us there were many sorts, as the Whitish from Umbria, the large
sort from Dalmatia, and the African, etc. This particular kind seems to be that
he mentions, l. 8. c. 39. They propagate very much, and their spawn is very
minute.

"Varro is scarcely to be credited, when he says, some would grow so large,
that their shells held ten quarts.

"They were also fed and fattened in large pots or pans, stuck full of holes to
let in the air, and lined with bran and sodden lees, or vegetables.

"They are yet used as food in several parts of Europe, more especially during
Lent, and are preserved in stews or escargotoires, now a large place boarded
in, and the floor covered with herbs, wherein they nestle and feed.

"In Italy, in many places, they are sold in the markets, and are called
Bacoli, Martinacci and Gallinelle; in many provinces of France, as Narbonne,
Franche Comte, etc. and even in Paris. They boil them, says Lister, in river
water, and seasoning them with salt, pepper, and oil, make a hearty repast.

"This is not indigenous, or originally a native of these kingdoms, but a
naturalized species, that has throve so well, as now to be found in very great
quantities. It was first imported to us from Italy about the middle of last
century, by a scavoir vivre, or epicure, as an article of food. Mr. Aubrey
informs us, it was a Charles Howard, Esquire. of the Arundel family, who, on that
account, scattered and dispersed those snails all over the downs, and in the
woods, etc. at Albury, an ancient seat of that noble family, near Ashted,
Boxhill, Dorking, and Ebbisham, or Epsom, in Surrey, where they have thriven so
much that all that part of the county, even to the confines of Sussex, abounds
with them; insomuch that they are a nuisance, and far surpass in number the
common, or any other species of English snails.

The Epicures, or scavoir vivre, of those days, followed this luxurious folly,
and the snails were scattered or dispersed throughout the kingdom, but not with
equal success; neither have records transmitted to posterity the fame of those
worthies equal to the Roman Fulvius Harpinus, except of two, the one Sir Kenelm
Digby, who dispersed them about Gothurst the seat of that family (now of the
Wrights) near Newport Pagnel, in Buckinghamshire, where probably they did not
thrive much, as they were not frequent thereabout: the other worthy was a lord
Hatton, recorded by Mr. Morton, who scattered them in the coppices at his seat
at Kirby, in Northamptonshire, where they did not succeed.

"Dr. Lister found them about Puckeridge and Ware, in Hertfordshire; and
observes, they are abundant in the Southern parts, but are not found in the
northern parts of this island.

"In Surry, as before mentioned, they abound; in several other counties they
are not uncommon, as in Oxfordshire, especially about Woodstock and Bladen; in
Gloucestershire, in Chedworth parish, and about Frog Mill, in Dorsetshire, etc.
but I have never heard that they are yet met with in any of the northern
counties."


PLATE LXXXV. MYA ARENARIA. SAND GAPER.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal an Ascidia. Shell bivalve, gaping at one end. The
hinge for the most part furnished with a thick, strong, broad tooth, not
inserted in the opposite valve.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell rather ovated, one end rounded, the
other narrow and gaping. Hinge, in one valve a hollow cavity, near which a
broad, erect, rounded tooth of the opposite valve is received.

MYA ARENARIA: testa ovata posterius rotundata, cardinis dente antrorsum
porrecto rotundato denticuloque laterali. Lin. Faun. Suec. 2127. -- Gmel. Linn.
Syst. p. 3218.303. sp. 2. Mya Arenaria. Sand. Penn. Br. Zool. p. 79. T. 42.16.
Chamae media ovata fusca. Arenaria. Da Costa. Br. Conch. p. 232. sp. 56. MYA
ARENARIA. Bast. opusc. subs. 2. p. 69. t. 7. fig. 1-3.
This species is similar in its external appearance to the Mactra Lutraria; yet
it may be immediately distinguished from that shell by the singular structure
of the hinge. The large, erect, plate-like tooth common to the Mya genus, is
particularly characteristic in this species.

Da Costa received it from the Isle of Wight, near Newport, and from
Bigbury-Bay, near Faversham; but observes, it is not a common shell.


PLATE LXXXVI. MUREX DECOLLATUS. SHORTENED MUREX, OR ROCK SHELL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Spiral, rough, the aperture ending in a strait, and
somewhat produced gutter or canaliculation.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. MUREX DECOLLATUS: testa ventricosa laevi,
patulo-subcaudata, spira in capitulum desinente.

Somewhat ventricose, smooth, mouth produced. Spire terminated in a capitulum
or knob.

MUREX DECOLLATUS. Penn. Br. Zool. T. 4. p. 125. sp. 102.

Pennant offers his Murex Decollatus as a species with doubts. It has certainly
the appearance of a shell much mutilated, or of extraordinary growth; but as
all the specimens we have examined exhibit the same appearance, we have
ventured to assign it a new character, and rank it as a distinct species.

It is a rare shell on the British shores, said to have been found on those of
Cornwall and Devonshire.


PLATE LXXXVII. HELIX VIVIPARA. VIVIPAROUS SNAIL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Aperture of the mouth contracted and lunulated.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell suboval, obtuse, spires ventricose or
swelled, umbilicated. Olive, girdled with three brown lines.

This kind is found in abundance in all rivers and stagnant waters. The river
kind seems to vary in some respects from the other; the shells are more opake,
and the colors are brighter than in those which inhabit the stagnant water.

The animal has a head not unlike that of a Bull, from which circumstance the
Swedes, according to Linnaeus, call it the Bull-head, and some French authors,
limacon a tete de boeuf, for the same reason. It feeds on Duck Weed.


PLATE LXXXVIII. BULLA HYDATIS. PINNACE DIPPER, OR BUBBLE SHELL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Shell rather convoluted at one end, sub-oval,
Aperture oblong.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Oblong-oval, fragile, pellucid, finely
striated longitudinally, base deeply umbilicated.

Da Costa observes, that all the shells he had seen of this species were fished
up at, or near, Weymouth in Dorsetshire; and concludes, that it is rare in our
seas, having never heard of it on any other British coast. We believe with Da
Costa, it is local; though it probably inhabits other parts of our coasts.

We have been lately favored with several shells of the Bulla genus from
Portsmouth, which some Conchologists have thought a new species, and named
Citrina; they do not, certainly, differ specifically from the shell in Da
Costa's collection, which he calls Bulla Naviacula, (Hydatis of Linnaeus) as
will appear evident from the specimens figured in the annexed plate.

PLATE LXXXIX. MYA OVALIS. OVAL GAPER.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal ascidia. Shell bivalve, gaping at one end. The hinge
for the most part furnished with a thick, strong, broad tooth, not inserted in
the opposite valve.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell rather an oblong oval, with a large
longitudinal crenulated tooth in one valve, and two in the other.

MYA OVALIS: testa oblongo-ovali cardinis dente primario crenulato

PICTORUM Da Costa. Br. Conch. p. 228. tab. 14. fig. 4. 4.
Pennant and Da Costa have erroneously given this as the Mya pictorum of
Linnaeus, from which it differs in several respects. The Mya pictorum is much
more ovate, or egg-shaped, as Linnaeus expresses it, and thinner than the
present shell, which is of a lengthened, or rather oblong form, and remarkably
thick, though semi-transparent. In adopting a new specific name that of oblonga
would have been preferred, had it not been pre-engaged by Gmelin to a totally
distinct species.

This species is common in rivers and fresh waters, and sometimes produce
little pearls.


PLATE XC. TURBO LACTEUS. SMALL TURBO.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Shell univalve, spiral, or of a taper form.
Aperture somewhat compressed, orbicular, entire.

natural size.

Some specimens are pure white, others beautifully tinged with purple; and the
most perfect white and brown. The mouth is round, surrounded on the outside by
a thick prominent border. It has no umbilicus. The shell consists of five
spires, gradually tapering to an acute point; and separated by a depression.
The longitudinal ribs are thick and prominent.


PLATE XCI. MUREX COSTATUS RIBBED MUREX.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Spiral, rough. The aperture ending in a strait and somewhat
produced gutter or canaliculation,

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Oblong, spires six, tapering, with eight

This elegant little shell was first discovered by Mr. Pennant, on the coast of
Anglesea, and described under the name of Murex Costatus. In retaining this
name it will be proper to observe, that Gmelin, in his edition of the Systema
Naturae, has another shell under the same name, a ribbed and cancellated
species found in a fossil state, in Champagne, altogether distinct from this
shell.

Da Costa received this species from the coasts of Cornwall and Devonshire.
Pennant says it inhabits Norway. The smallest figures denote the natural size.


PLATE XCII. MYA TRUNCTATA. TRUNCATED GAPER.

Those shells are extremely frequent on all the British coasts, either in

shells, assuming sometimes the appearance of a turbinated univalve.

The color is in general white: an elegant variety, deeply tinged with red, as
represented in the annexed plate, was dredged up at Brighton, and communicated
by Mr. P. Munn, of Bond-street.

Da Costa observes, that Linnaeus has placed this shell very improperly in the
Tellina genus, as it does not agree with his own definition of that genus, and
remarks that its habit, shape, convexity, etc. brings it nearer to the Cardium
than any other kind. -- It still remains a Tellina in the last edition of the
Systema Naturae by Gmelin, and we are not disposed in the present instance to
deviate from that authority.

This, and the Tellina rivalis described by Dr. Maton, in the Linnaean
Transactions, are very analogous, though evidently two distinct species, as we
have before noticed in our description of the latter, Plate 62. -- Tellina
Cornea, according to Geoffroy, is a viviparous animal, and is found in great
plenty in most rivers and stagnant waters.


PLATE XCVII. TELLINA FABULA. SEMI-STRIATED TELLEN.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge usually furnished with three teeth, Shell
generally sloping on one side.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell ovate, compressed, inflected, or rather
produced at one end. One valve smooth, the other marked with numerous oblique
reflected striae.

We discovered this very unusual species on the sands opposite to Caldy Island,
about two miles beyond Tenby, Pembrokeshire. It is noticed by Gronovius and
Gmelin as a Norwegian and Mediterranean shell, and is said to have been found
on the coast of Dorsetshire, by the late Dr. Pultney; but has never been before
described as a British species.

The smallest figures represent the natural size.


PLATE XCVIII. TELLINA FAUSTA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge usually furnished with three teeth. Shell
generally sloping on one side.

tinged with yellow within.


PLATE XCIX. HELIX CONTORTA. THICK RIVER CHEESE SHELL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Aperture of the mouth contracted and lunulated.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell thick, umbilicated, flattish. Aperture
narrow and crescentshaped.

This aquatic snail is rather scarce; it has been lately found in the Thames,
near Greenwich. Petiver says his were found in the rivulets about Peterborough
House, Westminster.

Da Costa mistook this for the Helix complanata of Linnaeus: it is evidently
the Helix contorta of that author, who very minutely describes it in the Fauna
Succica.


PLATE C. SERPULA GRANULATA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal a terebella, or whimble worm. Shell tubular, adheres
to other bodies, as shells, stones, etc.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell roundish, spiral, glomerate: three
elevated ridges on the upper side.

SERPULA GRANULATA: testa tereti spirali glomerata; latere superiore sulcis
tribus elevatis. Gmel. Syst. T. I. p. 6. p. 374 l. sp. 9.

This singular species has not been before noticed as an English Shell. We
found it intermixed with Lepas Intertexta on the shell of the common Lobster.
Linnaeus says it is found in the North Seas in large masses, adhering to
stones, and shells.


PLATE CI. MYA DEPRESSA. DEPRESSED MYA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal an ascidia. Shell bivalve, gaping at one end. The
hinge for the most part furnished with a thick, strong, and broad tooth, not
inserted into the opposite valve.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Somewhat ovate, anterior part rather wedge-shaped and
sloping: a slight depression across the middle; posterior part roundish,
gaping. Teeth at the hinge crenulated.

MYA DEPRESSA: testa subovata, antice sub-cuneiformi declivi, medio depressa,
postice rotundata hiante, cardinis dente crenulato.

After comparing the numerous kinds of fresh water Myae found in different
parts of the kingdom, the conchologist will perhaps be surprised at the small
number we shall venture to admit as distinct species. The varieties of those
Shells seem endless, and it may be doubred whether they are not in general
indebted to age, accident, or the peculiar qualities of the waters they
inhabit, for those variations in general appearance that have been too
frequently mistaken for characteristic differences of species.

As the Myae will fall under consideration more fully hereafter, we shall for
the present confine our remarks to the shell before us, and its very analogous
kind, the Mya ovata of Dr. Solander.

This has been considered by some as a mere variety of ovata, and we confess
our opinion is still wavering in assigning it a name and character as a new
species. The Mya ovata has been lately found in the river Froome in
Somersetshire, and likewise in the New River near London. What are usually
deemed its varieties are numerous, but none of them can, we believe, be
considered as distinct species, except the present, which is certainly the most
remote of any, if it is really a variety of that species. The Mya ovata, in all
its gradations, seems somewhat more ventricose and ovate in its contour, than
this Shell; and though the variations of the latter are considerable, we have
generally observed a slight depression, across the middle, which causes the
narrowest end to be rather flattened throughout, and it is also rather more
cunciform or wedge-shaped at this end than Mya ovata: to this we might perhaps
add, with some propriety, that the gaping beyond the hinge at the broadest end,
is wider than in Mya ovata.

Whether this difference is actually sufficient of form a distinct specific
character, and whether it is constant in other shells of this kind, still
remains in some degree of uncertainty. Both this and the Mya ovata inhabit the
same waters, for we have seen several specimens from the river Froome, where it
is known the Mya ovata is also found; and as to color, it is no criterion:
both kinds are greenish, radiated with yellow, and are more or less vivid in
different shells: they are seldom higher in color than the specimen we have
figured; some are more of an olive color, and others are deeply tinged with
brown.


PLATE CII. TURBO FONTINALIS.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Univalve, spiral, or of a taper form.
Aperture somewhat compressed, orbicular, entire.

PLATE CIII. TELLINA RIGIDA. FLAT AND RIDGED TELLEN.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge usually furnished with three teeth. Shell
generally sloping on one side.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Somewhat depressed, subrotund, thick, with
numerous transverse thread-like ridges, and a still deeper longitudinal
depression near the posterior end.

Da Costa, who appears to be the only author that describes this shell, says he
received it from the coast of Cornwall.

This is a thick and heavy shell, though rather transparent; the sides nearly
similar, and the beaks almost central. The color is generally white, with a
tinge of yellow on the outside, and some specimens are beautifully radiated
with pale pink: the inside is remarkably glossy and finely tinged with yellow,
red and orange.

This is the common Whelke of English conchologists, and is sometimes brought
to the markets as an article of food. The brown ones are this common sort, for
as Linnaeus observes, those that are brown fasciated with white or blue are
scarce; the former of those varieties is figured in the annexed plate.

Lister, Pennant and other authors have considered the striated variety of this
Shell as a distinet species; it is certainly destitute of those prominent ribs
or knobs which is so conspicuous in this Shell in general, but the transitions
from the striated kind to those with knobs is so gradual and easy to be traced
that we must coincide with Linnaeus and Da Costa who admit them barely as
varieties.


PLATE CV. HELIX LAEVIGATA. SMOOTH SNAIL.

at Highlake in Cheshire, near Liverpool; at the mouth of the river Mersey; and
on the coast of Aberdeenshire and other shores of Scotland.

The general color of the outside is a kind of milky white, delicately
radiated with brown; within, the young shells are tinged with reddish brown,
the old ones with violet.

rudimento dentis. Mya dubia. Penn. Br. Zool. p. 82. 19.
Pennant, who seems to be the only author that describes this shell, says it
has the rudiment of a to oath within one shell; with an oval and large hiatus
opposite the hinge. Shells brown and brittle, size of a Pistachia nut. Length
of a Horsebean, and found near Weymouth.

This Shell is rare, Pennant notes his from the Portland cabinet.
