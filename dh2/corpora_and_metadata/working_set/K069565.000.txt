ODE.
AVAUNT, ye Deities profane,
And all ye shadowy Powers,
Imagination's airy Train,
That dwell in fabled Bowers!
Thou Heliconian Fount,
Whence Poesy's rich Torrents flow;
And thou, Parnassian Mount,
Where Fancy sees her Myrtles blow!
I bear no votive Offering to your Shrine,
No Incense to the bard-created Nine.
Nor even to thee, O Jove, whose high-thron'd State,
The Muse of Greece has drawn sublimely great,
High over the Pagan Heaven, whilst the blessed Synod near,
Hymn the dread Thunderer's Name throughout the imagined Sphere!
Thee, holy Power! whose awe-impressing Sway,
Earth, Air, and Sea, and Heaven's bright Realms obey;
ESSENCE OF TRUTH! Thee, in thy blessed Abode,
Sole we invoke -- the sole, the LIVING GOD!
O LIVING GOD! from Thee alone,
Bright beaming from thy Sapphire Throne,
Can heavenly Inspiration flow,
And give our melting Hearts with holy Flames to glow!
For, ah! not Touch of Wizard Wand,
Nor wild Romance from Legends old,
Nor moonlight Spell of Elfin Band,
Nor Spectre-Tales, by Poets told;
Nor Necromancer's magic Skill,
Whose Voice the Hero's Blood can chill;
Nor Knights, in terrible Array,
Did ever such wondrous Acts display,
As those which late Britannia saw,
Her trembling Heart deep struck with pious Awe,
Now to Agony oppressed,
And now to Rapture blessed,
When with her Parent King she felt the Almighty Rod,
And the restoring Arm, of Thee the LIVING GOD!
Yes, GOD of Gods! 'twas thine to try --
Judgment and Righteousness thy Throne uphold,
Though Clouds and Darkness are around Thee rolled,
-- A chosen Nation's Sympathy.
Destiny thy dread Command,
As erst in Israel's Land,
Obeyed, and came from Heaven to prove,
A mighty People's Loyalty and Love.
Streaming often from Beauty's Eye,
O filial Love! thy graceful Tear was seen,
Thy Prayer was heard -- and many a Sigh,
Broke from the faithful Bosom of a QUEEN:
From Breast to Breast the Softness stole,
And Sorrow touched the PRINCELY Soul;
PUBLIC ALLEGIANCE joined the Prayer,
With FEALTY unchanged, amidst severe Despair!
Then, LIVING GOD, 'twas Thine to prove,
By Grief sincere, an Empire's Love!
Thine by Adversity to try,
A mighty People's Loyalty.
And who, Thou GOD of Gods, save Thee, can tell,
How Albion to her inmost Heart was cheered;
Ah! who but Thou her Extacy reveal,
When thy RESTORING CHERUBIM appeared?
Not Egypt's suffering Tribe of yore,
Plague-struck, a keener Anguish bore,
When, with our Parent King, we felt the Almighty Rod;
Nor such soul-born Transport knew,
In the Hour the Pest withdrew,
As when that King was saved by Thee the LIVING GOD!
Strike the Lyre to blissful Measure,
Albion holds once more her Treasure;
Brunswick's illustrious Star now shines again!
Let the Notes through Earth resound,
Waft them, triumphant Winds, across the Main,
'Till every Land returns the Sound:
For every Land -- O Theme without Alloy! --
In one full Chorus joins Britannia's Joy!
Now swell the Chords, and in sublimer Numbers own,
The mighty Blessing comes from Heaven alone!
Avaunt! ye Deities profane,
And all ye shadowy Powers;
Imagination's airy Train,
That dwell in fabled Bowers!
We know it is GOD, the LIVING GOD that gives
To our Prayers a Parent King;
We know, we know, that "OUR REDEEMER lives,"
TO HIM -- the MIGHTY ONE we sing!
O for the heav'n-instructed David's Lyre!
O for the wrapped Isaiah's hallowed Fire!
That so the sacred Airs of Harmony may rise,
And waft a Nation's Incense to the Skies,
'Till Angels catch the Strain, and with Archangels sing,
GLORY TO GOD ON HIGH -- TO HEAVEN'S ETERNAL KING!
THE END.
