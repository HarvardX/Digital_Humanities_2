This species is found, of a large size, in the Mediterranean sea; those which
inhabit the English coast, as Falmouth and Cornwall, rarely exceed the size of
the smallest specimen we have represented. It is found likewise on the shores
of Guernsey, and the coast of Ireland, where it is called the dog's cockle.

This shell is white, semitransparent, and rather glossy; and when alive is
covered with a fine thin brown film, or epidermis, which is striated spirally.
It is found on several of the English coasts, as Yorkshire, Northumberland,
Essex, etc. and also on the shores of Scotland and Ireland.


PLATE XXXIX.
FIG. I. HELIX CORNEA. RAM'S HORN.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Aperture of the mouth, contracted, and lunated.

The adult shells of this species are from three quarters of an inch, to an
inch and a quarter in diameter; the colors various, generally brownish or
ashen color, inclining in some to red, in others to yellow; the young shells
are whitish and more transparent.

It is very common in ponds and rivers. The animal is blackish brown, and has
two red capillary horns "This fish emits a fine scarlet humor, if a grain of
salt of any kind, or a little pepper or ginger, be put into the mouth of the
shell. It emits this fine scarlet humor all the year, especially in April and
September. Dr. Lister gives a full account of it. He says, this scarlet humor
may be readily got, and in great quantity, if a large parcel of these shells be
wrapped up in a cloth bag, sprinkling over it a little salt; then the scarlet
liquor will ouze plentifully. The coloring part of this humor immediately
subsides, if sprinkled with powdered alum, and the rest of it remains like
clear water. The coloring part may be strained through a filtering paper, but
the elegance of its color is lost, and it changes into a dull, unpleasant
rusty brown. Moreover, if mired with vinegar, spirit of wine, deliquated
vegetable salts, or common salt dissolved, this elegant scarlet color perishes
in the same manner as when mixed with alum. Neither can this liquor be kept by
itself pure and unmixed; for in vain did the doctor strive to preserve it in
narrow mouthed bottles or phials, perfectly well closed, and with oil or honey
thrown over it. Thus this color is of so fugitive a nature, that no acid or
astringent has been found sufficient, to preserve the elegance of its tint."
"Dr. Lister further recites some observations and experiments he made on this
scarlet fluid, to discover whether it was a humor of the body, or to be got by
laceration or incision, as blood; a saliva from the throat or stomach; or a
particular humor contained in certain vessels or parts; but the nicety and
difficulty of the experiments rendered it impossible for him to determine it
preci^ely." Da Costa, page 61, 62.


.

The Helix Nana, or Dwarf of Pennant, fig. 125, is considered by Da Costa and
other conchologists, as a young shell of this species.

FIG. II. HELIX LAPICIDA. ACUTE EDGED.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Above and beneath rather unequal; back of the
wreaths carinated. Deeply umbilicated. HELIX LAPICIDA: testa carinata
umbilicata utrinque convexa, apertura marginata transversali ovata. Linn. Syst.

This species is found in several countries of Europe. In Great Britain it
seems to be a local and rather uncommon kind. Da Costa says "though found in
many parts of England, is not met with in any plenty, but is scarce. I have
found them on the rocks, at and near Matlock, in Derbyshire, about Bath, in
Somersetshire, also on rocks; in Surrey, Wiltshire, and Hampshire, in the moss
on the bodies of large trees, and in woods. Dr. Lister found them on the grass
in Lincolnshire; Mr. Petiver, in hedges, between Charlton and Woolwich, in Kent
Not uncommon last summer in the woods of Kent.
; Mr. Morton, in hedge-bottoms, in Oakly Parva, in Northamptonshire; and Mr.
Wallis, on the rocks in Northumberland: but they are not common or frequent any
where." page 56.


PLATE XL. MYTILUS UMBILICATUS. UMBILICATED, OR WRY BEAK MUSCLE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge toothless, and consists of a longitudinal furrow.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Hinge much depressed and bent inwards.
MYTILUS UMBILICATUS, umbilicated. Penn. Br. Zool. sp. 76. fig. 76. MYTILUS
CUROIROSTRATUS. WRY BEAK. Da Costa Br. Conch. p. 220.50.


We are informed by Pennant that this shell was discovered by the Reverend Hugh
Davies; that it is a rare and new species, and is sometimes dredged up off
Priestholme Island, Anglesea.

It is about half the size of Mytilus Modiolus, and in some respects resembles
it; but is distinguished by the very remarkable and peculiar structure of its
hinge; the space opposite to it is bent inwards, in a winding manner, into a
deep rugged cavity, which when the shells are closed, form a deep hollow, or
umbilicus, as if bruised in. On one valve this depression is more deeply
inflected inwards than on the other.


PLATE XLI.
FIG. I. TELLINA INAEQUIVALVIS. UNEQUAL-VALVED TELLEN.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge usually furnished with three teeth; shell
generally sloping on one side.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Oblong, one side much produced or beaked;
upper valve flat, lower very unequal. TELLINA INAEQUIVALVIS: testa
oblongo-rostrata, valva altera plana. Gmel. Lin. Syst. Not. Conch. 3233. sp. 23.


The Tellina inaequivalvis is noticed by Gmelin as a native of the
Mediterranean and Norway seas, but has not been hitherto described as a British
shell by any author. It is generally admitted by Conchologists that the species
has been discovered on our shores, and William Pilkington, Esquire. of Whitehall,
has very lately received a specimen of it from the Guernsey coast, which he
obligingly favored us with it to figure and describe.

FIG. II. TELLINA VARIABILIS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Shell somewhat oval or oblong, radiated with pale red
streaks; a single tooth in the hinge of one valve, which is inserted between
two teeth on the other valve, when shut. SOLEN VESPERTINUS: testa ovali oblonga
spadiceo-radiata, cardinis sinistrae valvae dente solitario duplici alterius
inserto. Gmel. Lin. Syst. Conch. p. 3228. sp. 20.


This is the Tellina variabilis of the late Dr. Solander, and the Portland
Museum; Gmelin arranges it amongst the Solens.

Found on the coast of Cornwall and Weymouth, and not noticed by either Pennant
or Da Costa as an English shell.

Found in plenty on several of the British shores, as Cornwall, Dorsetshire,
Devonshire, and Yorkshire; also in the isle of Guernsey, and those of the
Orkneys.

FIG. II. VENUS SINUOSA. A. INDENTED VENUS SHELL.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Thin, unequal, a deep obtuse sinus, or bending on the
front. Penn. Br. Zool. p. 95. sp. 51.

Figured and described by Pennant, from a specimen in the Portland tabinet,
that was found at Weymouth. The shell we have figured is in the collection of
the Rev. T. Rackett.


PLATE XLIII. CYPRAEA PEDICULUS.SEA LOUSE COWRY, or NUN.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Sub-oval, blunt at the ends. Aperture, length of the shell,
longitudinal, linear, toothed.

This shell is very common on our shores, and a variety of the same species is
also abundant in the West Indies. The English shells of this kind are of
various tints, generally whitish, and with or without spots; the exotic kind is
distinguished by a furrow on the back.


PLATE XLIV. VENUS VERRUCOSA. WARTED VENUS SHELL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Bivalve. Hinge furnished with three teeth; two near each
other, the third divergent from the beaks.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Somewhat heart shaped. Deeply decussated on
the sides, with transverse and oblique furrows, which form membraneous
protuberances or warts. Margins finely crenated. VENUS VERRUCOSA: testa
subcordata: sulcis membranaceis striatis reflexis, antice imprimis, verrucosis,

Da Costa says, "this species is rare in our seas. The shores of Cornwall
afford them, and they have been got in Devonshire and Dortsetshire." They have
also been found on the eastern coast of Sussex, but not frequently.


PLATE XLV. OSTREA STRIATA. STRIATED OYSTER.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal a Tethys. Shell bivalve, unequal. Hinge without a
tooth, having a small oval cavity.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Less than the common Oyster. Outside wrought
with threadlike longitudinal ridges. Inside green. OSTREUM STRIATUM: mediae
magnitudinis veluti striatum intus verescente. Da Costa. pl. 11. fig. 4.4. p.
162. sp. 9. Ostreum parvum veluti striatum, testa intus virescente, cardine

interruptis radiatum, squamosum ex fusco viridescens. Gualt. 1. Conch. tab.
102. fig. B?


"This Oyster," says Da Costa, "hitherto only proposed and described by Dr.
Lister, is a very different species from the common Oyster, but has been always
overlooked as the same kind." Dr. Lister observes that it is found in plenty at
the mouth of the river Tees, in Yorkshire, and says he first eat of it at
Bourdeaur, in France, where it is greatly esteemed and called Rock Oyster,
being found among the rocks.

The figure of this shell in the plate of Da Costa above quoted, is so very
indifferent and devoid of true character, that were we not in possession of the
specimen he represents, it would be difficult to ascertain it. In the general
description he says the outside is a little uneven, but not rugged nor of a
leaved or flakey structure as the common Oyster: he adds that the ridges are
longitudinal, about the thickness of a thread, very numerous, irregular, and
run one into another; but toward the bottom always furcate or divide. This
description is accurate but does not accord with the figure, in which the
longitudinal ridges appear of a flakey structure or like laminae, and not
numerous, irregular threadlike striae as in the shell, We have selected several
characteristic specimens of this species in the annexed plate.

This shell is thick, strong, and nearly opake: it is usually about an inch in
diameter; the valves unequal, the under one being very concave, the upper one
flattish. Within, it is of a livid green and rather glossy, the hinge broad,
deep, somewhat triangular and striated transversely. In many shells there is a
remarkable white mark exactly resembling a thick spot of white oil paint,
placed a little below the hinge, this spot always appears in radiated wrinkles
from the center, and is formed by the muscle of the shell.

It is found on many of our shores, as Kent, Sussex, Dorsetshire, etc. in
abundance, and of various colors; some are very fine like japan lacquer, and
others of a violet, green, pink, yellow or pearly tint when much worn. It is
remarkable, however, that the upper valves are so scarce, that hundreds of the
lower valves are found to one of them.


PLATE XLVI. SOLEN SILIQUA. LARGE OR POD SOLEN.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Bivalve, with equal valves, oblong, open at both ends. At
the hinge a subulated tooth turned back, often double; not inserted in the
opposite shell. Animal an Ascidia.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell strait, equally broad, and compressed.
The hinge beset with two teeth in each valve. SOLEN SILIQUA: testa lineari
recta cardine altero bidentato. Linn. Syst. Not. p. 1113. No. 34. -- Fn. Sv. 2.

This shell is found in abundace on many of the English shores, especially the
northern and western coasts, and those of Scotland and Ireland.

The ancients esteemed this fish a delicious food, and Dr. Lister informs us he
thought it nearly as rich and palatable as the Lobster. In England and Scotland
it is at present mostly used for baits, and nor for the table; but in Ireland
is much eaten in Lent. -- It is in season in spring.

From the hinge to the opposite margin the length is about half an inch, and
its breadth from five to seven inches; but some shells are found much larger.
The outside is covered with a thin transparent yellow-brown cuticle or
epidermis, like glue, which peels off soon after the fish is dead or exposed to
the shores. Under this epidermis the shell is smooth, very glossy, and marked
with many concentric transverse wrinkles from the middle to one extreme, the
other half is striated lengthways. Inside white and glossy.

DA COSTA OBS. -- Mr. Wallis, in his History of Northumberland, p. 396. No. 9.
notes a sort of this shell he calls the Orange and White Solen, found in Budle
Sands with this common sort, and in all respects like it, except in color,
which is deep orange and white in transverse fillets, in alternate
variegations. Quere, if a distinct species, or only a variety?


PLATE XLVII. TELLINA CARNARIA. Linn. FLESH-COLOURED TELLEN.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge usually furnished with three teeth; shell
generally shoping on one side.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Somewhat orbicular; valves shallow. White tinged with rose
color, and marked externally with numerous parallel striae, disposed in an
oblique, reflexed and transverse direction. TELLINA CARNARIA: testa
suborbiculata laevi utrinque incarnata oblique striata: striis hinc reflexis.

subrotundum oblique striatum color carneoso. Carneosum. Da Costa. p. 181. sp.
20.


According to Dr. Lister this species is a shore shell, and found very
frequently in the shallows of Lancashire, and near Filey in Yorkshire, etc. It
is also found at Scarborough, Dorsetshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall.

It is an elegant shell, the outside being beautifully marked with numerous
delicate striae like strokes of engraving, and tinged with a fine rose or flesh
color. Some specimens are almost white, or white with transverse bands of
deeper red, and the margins yellow. Within, the red color is much more vivid
than the outside.

Da Costa has placed this species in the Cardium genus, and indeed with much
propriety; though Linnaeus arranges it amongst the Tellens. It has a tendency
on one side to flexure or slope like the Tellens, but the central and remote
lateral teeth we think should remove it to the former genus.


PLATE XLVIII. DENTALIUM ENTALIS. TOOTH SHELL.

The large Escallop is found on most of the coasts of Great Britain and
Ireland, particularly on those of Portland and Purbeck in Dorsetshire. -- The
fish is eaten and much esteemed.

It is said by modern, as well as ancient authors, that Escallops will move so
strongly as to leap out of the catcher wherein they are taken: their way of
leaping or raising themselves up, is by forcing the under valve against
whatever they lie upon.


PLATE L. SOLEN ENSIS. SCYMETAR.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Bivalve, with equal valves, oblong, open at both ends. At
the hinge a subulated tooth turned back, often double; not inserted in the
opposite shell. -- Animal an Ascidia.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell bowed like a Scymetar, equally broad
and compressed. The hinge beset with two teeth in each valve. SOLEN ENSIS:

This is a local and rare species; it has been found at Weymouth on the
Dorsetshire coast, and according to Dr. Lister in plenty in the aestuary of the
Severn, on the side of Wales.

It differs from the Solen siliqua in several respects; it is smaller, and not
strait, but curved or bowed like a Scymetar.

The largest and most produced of the British river snails, and is found in
plenty in all our rivers, lakes, ponds, and other waters.

Lister and Petiver have made two species of this shell maximum and minus; they
appear however to be merely different stages of its growth.


PLATE LII. TROCHUS ZIZYPHINUS. LIVID TOP SHELL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal a slug. Shell conic. Aperture nearly triangular.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell conic, livid, without umbilicus:

This is one of the most elegant of the testaceous tribe found on our coasts;
the color in general is flesh color or pale red, elegantly variegated with
deeper red or brown in streaks, waves, and chequers; when the exterior coat is
worn, the shell is of a fine pearly hue.

It is not an uncommon species on the English shores, and is also found in the
Orkneys and the western isles of Scotland.


PLATE LIII. SOLEN LEGUMEN. PEASECOD.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Bivalve, with equal valves, oblong, open at both ends. At
the hinge a subulated tooth turned back, often double; not inserted in the

Both Pennant and Da Costa note this as a very rare British species, The first
says it is found at Red Wharf, Anglesea, in North Wales; the latter received it
from Christchurch, in Hampshire.

We have found it on the shores of Glamorganshire, and also in abundance in the
sandy bay of Caermarthen this summer.


PLATE LIVE. CARDIUM LAEVIGATUM. LARGE HIGH-BEAKED COCKLE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Two teeth near the beak, and another remote one on each
side of the shell.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell somewhat oval, slightly striated
longitudinally. CARDIUM LAEVIGATUM: testa obovata: striis obsoletis

We have observed, that this species is in general discolored, and deeply
tinged with brown or yellow; when fine it is whitish, sleek, and covered with
an epidermis.

It is found on most of our coasts, yet it is by no means common. Da Costa
notes it from Yorkshire, Northumberland, Dorsetshire, Cornwall, Carnarvonshire,
and the Orkneys.


PLATE LV. MYTILUS CYGNEUS. GREAT HORSE, OR SWAN MUSCLE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge toothless, and consists of a longitudinal furrow.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Somewhat oval, one end rounded, the other
extended, narrow, and compressed; thin and brittle. MYTILUS CYGNEUS: testa
ovata anterius compressiuscula fragilissima, cardine laterali. Gmel. Linn.

This species is not uncommon in our Rivers, Ponds, etc. but is less frequent
than the Mytilus Anatinus, or Small Horse Muscle, which bears some resemblance
to it. Mytilus Anatinus is rarely more than half the size of Mytilus Cygneus,
is more compressed, and has the cartilage side extended in a straight line to
an acute angle at one end.

The usual length of Mytilus Cygneus is about two or three inches, its breadth
five or six inches. The valves deep, or concave. The outside is wrinkled
transversely, and varies in color according to the state of the Shell. The
external covering, or epidermis, is thin, but strong, and of a greenish color;
under this the Shell is varied with bright brown, and when the coating is worn
off, the whole Shell is pearly. The inside is often rugged with small pearls.


PLATE LVI. LEPAS DIADEMA. WHALE ACORN SHELL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Triton. Shell of many unequal valves; affixed by a

This large and interesting species of Balani is found adhering to the Whale,
whence it is called the Whale Acorn Shell. It is not uncommon in the sea round
Scotland. The natives of some of the Western Islands distinguish one species of
Whale from the rest, for its great size, and the big limpets growing on their
backs Martin. Fladda Chuan, near the Isle of Sky.
. The same species is common on the Whales in the Northern Seas about
Newfoundland.

The Animal is figured by Ellis, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1758,
and resembles a cluster of small hooded and eared serpents issuing from the
central cavity, and little openings at the tops of the longitudinal ribs. The
base by which it is affixed, when alive, is covered with a coriaceous skin.


PLATE LVII. VOLUTA TORNATILIS. OVAL VOLUTE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Shell spiral, aperture narrow, without a
beak. Columella plicated.

"This pretty species," says Da Costa, "I have received from Tinmouth and
Exmouth, in Devonshire;" and Pennant notes it from Anglesea only.


PLATE LVIII. MACTRA LUTRARIA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal a Tethys. Bivalve, sides unequal. Middle tooth
complicated, with a little groove on each side; lateral teeth remote.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell oblong oval, smooth; no lateral teeth.
Hinge, a small and large triangular cavity in one valve; a similar cavity and
an elevated triangular tooth in the opposite. MACTRA LUTRARIA: testa ovali
oblonga laevi, dentibus lateralibus nullis. Gmel. Linn. Syst. p. 3259. sp. 14.

The Mactra lutraria is so very similar in general appearance to the Mya
Arenaria, that without attending to the foliated hinge of the latter, they may
be confounded with each other. Both shells are scarce on the British coasts,
except in certain situations. Da Costa says the Mactra lutraria is found in
plenty at Scarborough, in Northumberland, Lancashire, etc. and on the shores of
Scotland. Dr. Maton found them on the coast of Cornwall; and we met with them
very fine, perfect, and beautifully colored, on the sands near Laugharn, South
Wales.

The general color is yellowish, tinged with orange, and irregularly clouded
with brown; and often glossed with a delicate white; the epidermis brown.


PLATE LIX. TURBO STRIATUS. STRIATED WREATH SHELL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Univalve, spiral, or of a taper form.
Aperture somewhat compressed, orbicular, entire.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell swelled, or ventricose, white,
variegated with red, and finely striated spirally. Umbilicated. TURBO STRIATUS:

This species is particularly noticed by most conchologists. Dr. Lister says it
is the most elegant of all our snails, and is found near Oglethorpe and Burwell
woods in Lincolnshire, in Yorkshire, and in Kent. Petiver found it about
Charlton, in Kent; also Morton, in Northamptonshire; Pennant, in the woods of
Cambridgeshire; and Da Costa, in Surrey. It is no where common.


PLATE LX. TELLINA TRIFASCIATA. THREE STREAK TELLEN.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge usually furnished with three teeth; shell
generally sloping on one side.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Shell narrow oval, depressed, whitish, radiated with red;
and striated transversely. TELLINA TRIFASCIATA: testa ovata laeviuscula

This elegant species is rather uncommon upon our coasts. Da Costa says he
received it from Scarborough, in Yorkshire; and adds, it is scarce on the
coasts of Cornwall, but of a larger size; the finest colored specimens we have
seen are from Dorsetshire and Wales.

The Tellina incarnata is smaller than trifaciata but very similar, and may be
easily confounded with it.


PLATE LXI. MACTRA SOLIDA. GIRDLED.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal a Tethys, Bivalve, sides unequal. Middle tooth

The girdles are most prominent in the dead shells; the surface between them
appearing much worn.


PLATE LXII. PHOLAS CRISPATA. CURLED, OR DOUBLE-FRONTED PIDDOCK.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Ascidia. Shell bivalve, opening wide at each end,
with several lesser valves at the hinge. The hinges folded back and connected
by a cartilage.

In referring this ambiguous Shell to the Tellina genus, we may incur censure,
as it does not certainly possess every characteristic of a tellen, yet we
conceive less impropriety in altering the genera than in retaining it as a
trigonella.

This Shell has been admitted as the Venus borealis of Linnaeus and from the
Synonyms of Lister's figure, not without probability. We do not, however, think
the Linnaean descriptions agree sufficiently with our Shell; it may be a
variety of it, though we hesitate to admit it as such.

Pennant has described this Shell twice, the old Shell is Tellins Crassa, No.
28, and the young one Venus borealis, No. 52 of that author; he adds indeed
"the Tellina crassa has the habit of Venus borealis, but its sides are unequal,
one being more extended than the other."

Da Costa has been under similar difficulties, he gives it as a species of his
genus trigonella, though he says in the general description, that "the hinge of
this kind is of a different structure from the TRIGONELLAE, for it consists of
two minute, thin, plate-like, parallel teeth, aside of which is a large
triangular cavity, and has no lateral teeth."

Common on several of the English shores.

FIG. II. TELLINA RIVALIS. RIVER TELLEN.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Shell oblique, somewhat ovated, furrowed transversely, and
of an horn color. TELLINA RIVALIS: testa oblique subovata transversim sulcata
cornei coloris. Maton. Linn. Trans. vol. 3.


The English naturalist is indebted to Dr. William Maton, author of the Tour of
the Western Counties, for the discovery of this new and interesting British
species. The first account of it appeared in a paper presented by him to the
Linnaean Society, and afterward inserted in their Transactions; and it is to
this gentleman also our thanks are due for the specimens figured in the annexed
plate. We have seen it since in the Collection of William Pilkington, Esquire.
Whitehall; who recently found it in the river near Hungerford in Berkshire.

Dr. Maton, in his remarks on this species, says, "It does not appear to have
been described, and probably was never seen by Linnaeus, nor has it been
noticed by any English writer on Conchology; a figure, however, of it occurs in
Gualteri's Index, Testacrum. Conchyliorum (Tab. 7. fig. C. C.) but has been
referred to by Professor Gmelin, in his edition of the Systema Naturae of
Linnaeus for Tellin^ cornea, though it evidently differs from the latter in
shape, which Linnaeus considers as one of the most certain criteria, whereby
species are to be distinguished. Gualtieri mentions the Shells alluded to as
"Musculus fluviatilis, striatus, subflavus pellucidus," which is a vague and
imperfect description, and by no means sufficient to show in what respect it
differs from T. cornea." The difference consists chiefly in the T. rivalis
being of a more oblique and subovated form, and in having the hinge near one
end; T. cornea is somewhat globose, and in particular has the hinge and beaks
placed in a more central manner.

Dr. Maton has generally found Tellina rivalis on chalky parts of the bed of
the river Avon, and in rivulets communicating with it near Salisbury; but has
never seen it in any considerable abundance. He conceives, that if diligently
sought after, it may be discovered in most rivers and streams which are
inhabited by Tellina cornea.


PLATE LXV. HELIX ZONARIA. STRIPED SNAIL.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Aperture of the mouth contracted, and lunulated.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell whitish, striped, unequal, rather
depressed. A deep round central umbilicus. Outer lip of the mouth turned
backward and spread. HELIX ZONARIA: testa umbilicata convexa depressiuscula:

The Shells figured in the annexed plate are the true C. virgata of Da Costa,
but not the Helix Zonaria of Pennant, as that author has erroneously considered
them in his British Conchology. It appears that the latter species came into
the possession of Da Costa after the work was published, for it stands
corrected in some MSS. notes in his collection, though it is not noticed in his
publication. Gmelin in his Systema Natura admits Da Costa's Shell as the
Linnaean Zonaria; Pennant's Shell is not described by either author.

It inhabits dry sandy soils and banks, and, as Da Costa observes, is common
only in some parts, as in the grass on Heddington-heath in Oxfordshire, and in
Hampshire in plenty. It is also found in Corn-wall, and was met with by Petiver
on Newmarket-heath in Cambridgeshire.


PLATE LXVI. BULLA PALLIDA. PALE, OR CYLINDRIC BULLA.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Shell suboval. Aperture oblong, very patulous, and smooth
or even. One end rather convoluted.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Cylindric, white, glossy, four prominent wrinkles on the
pillar lip. BULLA PALLIDA: testa cylindrica, spira elevata acuta. Linn. Mus.

Bulla cylindricea is esteemed a very rare species by collectors of English
Shells. It is found on the western coasts of England. Da Costa received them
from Cornwall and Weymouth; and Lister notes them from Barnstaple in Devonshire.

The smallest figures denote the natural size.


PLATE LXVII. VENUS DECUSSATA. RETICULATED.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Bivalve. Hinge furnished with three teeth; two near each
other, the third divergent from the beaks.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Somewhat oval, wrought with transverse and
longitudinal striae, or prominent ridges, which cross or decussate each other;
outside brown, inside white, with violet spots near the hinge. Cuneus

The young Shells of this species vary considerably in their colors and
markings, but are in general remarkable for their elegance; as they increase in
growth, those colors and markings gradually fade, and in old Shells become
altogether obscure. It is found in plenty on most of the southem coasts of
England and Wales.


PLATE LXVIII. VENUS STRIATULUS. STRIATED.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Bivalve. Hinge furnished with three teeth; two near each
other, the third divergent from the beaks.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Shell somewhat heart-shaped, and marked with three or four
longitudinal rays of brown. PECTUNCULUS STRIATULUS parvus transversim striatus
fusco radiatus. Da Costa. Br. Conch. p. 191. sp. 27. tab. 12. fig. 2.2. Venus

postico minimo, margin crenulato. Linn. Syst. Not. p. 1130. No. 119. -- Fn.
Sv. 2. No. 2143?


This is one of the most elegant of the British Shells. It is found on the
coasts of Dorsetshire, Cornwall, and the isles of Scilly, and also on those of
Wales. The general color is pale flesh color, radiated and figured with a
chestnut brown, but in some instances they vary to an uniform brown or orange,
obscurely spotted with black.

Da Costa is the only English author who notices this species.


PLATE LXIX. PHOLAS PARVUS. SMALL PIDDOCK.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal ascidia. Shell bivalve, opening wide at each end,
with several lesser valves at the hinge. The hinges folded back and connected
by a cartilage.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Shell oval, thin, wrought with transverse
wrinkles, and divided down the middle by a furrow. The half next the hinge
undulated or indented. A slender and oblique curved tooth in the cavity under
the beak. Size of a hazel nut. Pholas Parvus, Little. Pen. Br. Zool. sp. 13.
PHOLAS PARVUS: simillima tota structura Pholade Bifronte. Da Costa Br. Conch.
p. 247. sp. 67.


This shell was first described by Pennant in his Zoology; he says it very much
resembles the Pholas crispatus but is never found larger than a hazed not. Da
Costa describes it also, but doubts whether it is a distinct species or only a
young shell of that kind. As both authors have however figured and described it
separately, we have given it a place as a distinct, or at least doubtful
species.

Pennant says he found these shells in masses of fossil wood in the shores of
Abergelli in Denbighshire: the bottom of their cells were round and appeared as
if nicely turned with some instrument. According to this author they will also
perforate the hardest oak plank that is accidentally lodged in the water. Da
Costa says they are found in great quantities on the same coasts as the other
kind (Pholas crispatus) nitched in the rocks and stones, and adds that there is
an amazing abundance at Scarborough and Whitby in Yorkshire, nitched in the
Alum and other stones.


PLATE LXX. MYTILUS BARBATUS. BEARDED MUSCLE.
GENERIC CHARACTER. The hinge toothless, and consists of a longitudinal furrow.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS. Short, ventricose, obtuse, ferruginous
yellow. An oblique space extending from the hinge to the apex, covered with a
rule epidermis and irregular filaments. MYTILUS BARBATUS: testa laeviuscula
ferruginea exterius apice barbata. Fn. Suec. 2157. Gonel. Linn. Syst. Not. p.
3353. sp. 10. Chemn. Conch. 8. t. 84. f. 749.


In trawling for marine productions in the Straits that divides Caernarvon from
Anglesea (Menai) last summer, we found several specimens of the Mytilus
barbatus of a much larger size than any hitherto described by authors, as the
figures in the annexed plate will fully express.

Da Costa has not noticed this species, though it must have been known to him
from the figures and descriptions in Pennant's Zoology, where it stands under
the name of M. Curtus. sp. 76. A. Short. Pennant's specimen scarcely exceeds
the size of the second specimen figured in our plate; -- it was described from
a Shell in the Portland Cabinet, that had been taken at Weymouth.

Linnaeus mentions this species in the Fauna Suecica. Gmelin quotes the Works
of Chemnitz for its figure, where it appears somewhat smaller than in those of
Pennant. It is certainly very scarce.


PLATE LXXI. TURBO LINEATUS. STREAKED.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Univalve, spiral, or of a taper form.
Aperture somewhat compressed, orbicular, entire.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Somewhat conic. Ash color variegated with fine streaks
and irregular marks of black; a rude tooth at the top of the pillar. TURBO
LINEATUS: trochiformis cinereus lineis aut lituris nigris insignitus, columella
subdentata. Da Costa Br. Conch. p. 100. sp. 56. tab. 6. fig. 7.


We believe this species is rather an uncommon, or at least local kind on the
British shores, though Da Costa says it is found on the coasts of Devonshire,
Cornwall, Dorsetshire, Pwlhely in Caernarvonshire, and in plenty on the coasts
of Norfolk. The collection of that author contains but a single specimen, it is
a worn Shell and indifferently expressed by the figure above quoted. The most
characteristic Shells of this species we have seen, we found on the rocky
shores of Abersraw, on the western side of Anglesea, and at Manachty the
remotest part of the same island.

This Shell is large, thick, and conic or shaped like a trochus. The general
color is ashen with little variation, the lines in some are dark or almost
black, in others of a pale brown, or brown tinged with red; when the external
covering is worn off the Shell appears of a fine mother of pearl.

Turbo lineatus is not described by any English Author except Da Costa.


PLATE LXXII. TURBO PERVERSUS. REVERSED, OR OAT.
GENERIC CHARACTER. Animal Limax. Univalve, spiral, or of a taper form.
Aperture somewhat compressed, orbicular, entire.

SPECIFIC CHARACTER. Taper, somewhat transparent. Spires turn from left to
right. Mouth jagged or beset with teeth. TURBO PERVERSUS: testa turrita

This is one of the heterostrope Shells, or such as have the mouth placed on
the right side instead of the left, as is usual in most species. In general,
heterosphe Shells are mere accidental varieties only of such as turn in the
usual manner Reversed shells of the common garden snail have been found, though
very rarely. One is mentioned by Dr. Latham in his Synopsis of Birds.
; but in the present instance, it constitutes a striking character of the
species itself.

It is a matter of some difficulty to reconcile the various opinions of authors
respecting the several varieties and growths of this species; Da Cos'a has
entered into the enquiry; and the result of his remarks appear at least
satisfactory to us.

"These smaller ones," says Da Costa, "are the young Shells, but always with
them are found old ones of double or treble the size; in every other respect
like these, but proportionally larger and stronger in their several parts and
work. The plaits or foldings near the mouth are deep and very strong; the
striae stronger and more distinct; the border round the mouth greatly turned
outward, very broad, flat, thick, milk white, and the sinuosities, jags or
teeth, within, are large, white, and very conspicuous; some are bidentated, and
most of these old ones have eleven, and some even twelve spires.

"From these circumstances, authors run into confusion, by making the different
growths different species. The accurate and judicious Lister himself has formed
two species, in his tit. 10. and 11. on the difference of the number of the
spires and other slight particulars. The several figures in Gualtieri are only
varieties; and the bidens of Linne, Syst. Not. p. 1240. No. 649. and of Mr.
Pennant, Brit. Zool. No. 117. tab. 81, fig. 117. is apparently no other than an
old Shell, for such large and bidentated ones I have not unfrequently found
nestled with these common smaller Shells.

"Though the number of spires in a Shell is a criterion, yet it is not an
infallible one, for the number of spires vary in some species, either from the
growths or sexes: in such cases the young Shells have always a less number, and
the males have their spires less numerous than the females. This very species
is, perhaps, as strong an instance of the difference in the number of the
spires as can be, for it is found from six to twelve spires, as Linne has also
noted in his Fauna Suecica."

Linnaeus, and Gmelin in his last Systema Naturae, distinguish the two species
Bidens and Perversus chiefly by the number of teeth. The latter is described
with three teeth, the former of course with only two. Fig. 1.1. denotes the
natural size. Fig 2. magnified.
