CONTENT, A PASTORAL SONG.
By the late Mr. CUNNINGHAM.
OVER moorlands and mountains, rude, barren, and bare,
As wearied and wilder'd I roam,
A gentle young shepherdess sees my despair,
And leads me over lawns to her home;
Yellow sheaves from rich Ceres her cottage had crowned,
Green rushes were strewn on the floor,
Her casement sweet woodbines crept wantonly round,
And decked the sod seats at the door.
We sat ourselves down to a cooling repast,
Fresh fruits, and she culled me the best;
Whilst thrown from my guard, by some glances she cast,
Love slily stole into my breast:
I told my soft wishes, she sweetly replied.
(Ye virgins, her voice was divine!)
I Have rich one's rejected, and great ones denied,
Yet take me, fond shepherd, I Am thine.
Her air was so modest, her aspect so meek,
So simple, though sweet, were her charms;
I kissed the ripe roses that glowed on her cheek,
And locked the dear maid in my arms:
Now jocund together we tend a few sheep,
And if on the banks by the stream,
Reclined on her bosom I sink into sleep,
Her image still softens my dream.
Together we range over the slow-rising hills,
Delighted with pastoral views;
Or rest on the rock, whence the streamlet distills,
And mark out new themes for my muse.
To pomp, or proud titles, she never did aspire,
The damsel's of humble descent;
The cottager Peace is well known for her sire,
The shepherds have named her CONTENT.
