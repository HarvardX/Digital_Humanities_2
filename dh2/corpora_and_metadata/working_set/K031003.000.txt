The APPRENTICE'S MONITOR; OR, INDENTURES IN VERSE, Showing what they are bound
to do.
Proper to be hung up in all Shops.
EACH young Apprentice, when he is bound to Trade,
This solemn vow to GOD and Man has made.
To do with joy his Master's just commands,
Nor trust his secrets into other hands.
He must no damage to his substance do,
And see that others do not wrong him too.
His Master's goods he shall not waste nor lend,
But all his property with care defend.
He shall not buy nor sell without his leave,
Nor lie, nor injure, nor at all deceive.
Taverns and ALEHOUSES he shall not haunt,
Those snares to Youth, those scenes of vice and want.
At CARDS and DICE he shall not dare to play,
But fly from such temptations far away.
O Youth! remember thou to this art BOUND,
See that no breach of this in thee be found.
The GOLDEN RULE IN VERSE.
MY Son, behold what GODS commands impart;
Love GOD with all your strength, and mind, and heart.
Take care that you unto another do
What you would have another do to you.
On these as on their great design and end,
The Prophets and the Law alike depend.
