THE PREFACE.
IT may seem strange to publish any thing of this kind, after a New
Dispensatory that has drawn together all that is valuable in Medicine; but this
Manual is ventured into the World, notwithstanding such Disadvantage, because
it contains the Prescriptions of the most eminent Physicians in our Nation,
which were contrived on purpose for the Poorer Sort of People; and are at
present constantly used in the Hospitals of London: And therefore it is a
Collection of the most cheap and most efficacious Medicines, that the whole Art
does supply.

To render it the more Useful, here are annexed to every Prescription,
Explanations of their Virtues and Uses, after the Manner of Dr. QUINCY, in his
New Dispensatory.

The Physicians whose Names this bears in the Title, it is hoped, will not in
the least take it amiss, that what they have been at the Pains to contrive for
the Use of those particularly under their Care, is in this manner made more
extensive for a Common Good.

Pharmacopoeia Pauperum: OR, THE HOSPITAL DISPENSATORY.
THE Waters most commonly in Use in the public Hospitals, are the Aqua Lactis
Alex. -- Cerasor. Nigr. -- Cinnam. sort. -- Hord. -- Menthae. -- Pulegii. --
Rutae. -- Epidemiae. -- Bryoniae Comp. -- Stephani. -- Theriacalis.


And all made exactly as directed by the London Dispensatory, and used for the
same Purposes.

Aqua Antiphthisica.
Fol. Symphit. Maj. Polygonat. Plantag. Pimpinel. a^ M. iv. Rad. Liquorit. ij.
Infundantur frigide 2 Dies in Aq. Calcis Cong. ij.
A Water against Consumptions.
Take Leaves of Comfrey the Greater, Solomon's Seal, Plantane, and Pimpinel,
each 4 Hands full, Liquorice-Root 2 Ounces; infuse them cold for 12 Days in 2
Gallons of Limewater.

This is very easily made, and is much better than if it were to be distilled.
It is of excellent Use in such Consumptions as proceed from a sharp thin Blood;
especially in those who have been injured by a Venereal Taint, or have any
Hereditary Remains of scrophulous or leprous Humors. It is ordered to be drank
for some time together, the Quantity of a Quart or two in a Day. It is also
directed to wash foul Ulcers, and does good Service in such Cases.

Aqua Liberans.
Rassur. Lig. Sassafr. sine Cortice ij. Lig. Guiac. cum Cortice j. Rad.
Glycyrrh. iij. Sem. Coriand. cont. vj. Infund. frigide in Aq. Calcis. Cong. j.
2 aut 3 Dies.
Take of the Shavings of Sassafras without the Bark 2 Ounces, of Guiacum with
the Bark 1 Ounce, Liquorice-Root 3 Ounces, Coriander-Seeds bruised 6 Drams;
infuse them cold in one Gallon of Limewater for 2 or 3 Days.

This is yet more drying than the former, and is therefore good in all Cases
that require Absorbents and Sweetners; especially in all Venereal Affections,
after Salivation. It will assist much likewise in the Itch, and all Foulnesses
which lodge upon the Skin. It may be drank at Discretion, and ought to be used
for some time together.

Dr. M -- 's Snail-Water.
Take Garden-Snails cleansed and bruised 6 Gallons, Earthworms washed and
bruised 3 Gallons, of common Wormwood, Ground Ivy, and Carduus, each one Pound
and half, Penniroyal, Juniper Berries, Fennel-seeds, Aniseeds, each half a
Pound, Cloves and Cubebs bruised, each 3 Ounces, Spirit of Wine, and
Spring Water, of each 8 Gallons; digest them together for the Space of 24
Hours, and then draw it off in a common Alembick.

This is admirably well contrived both for Cheapness and Efficacy; and for
Persons whose Circumstances and Manner of living have not habituated them to
any Delicacies, it is as good a Snail-water as can be made; and with the two
former, are the chief that are used in the Hospitals. And as they are mostly
given in Consumptions contracted from vicious Practices, and Venereal
Contagions, this is the constant Drink of those who are under the like
Weaknesses and Decays from a malum stamen, and require principally Nourishment
from such Substances, as will, with the least Trouble possible, be assimulated
for that purpose.

Aqua ad Strumas. D. M.

D. M -- 's Water for the Evil.
Take sharp-pointed Dock-Roots half a Pound, Monks Rhubarb 4 Ounces, Agaric 2
Ounces, Liquorice, Sweet-Fennel, and Coriander-seeds, each half an Ounce; boil
in a sufficient Quantity of Spring Water, and to the strained Liquor add 2
Ounces of Diaphoretic Antimony.

This is much used in schrophulous Cases, as a Diet-Drink, and has been found
of good Service; but at the first, sometimes, the Diaphoretic Antimony being
unwashed, it proves Emetick, though without any Inconveniency upon that account;
the Points of the Medicine being left gross enough to velicate and draw the
Stomach into such Contractions. This also avails considerably in Venereal and
Leprous Impurities. Its Operation is principally expected from its increasing
of natural Perspiration, and gently scouring all the secretory Passages.

Aqua Theriacalis.
Suc. Putam Virid. Nucum Jugland. lbxij. Suc. Rutae lbix. Cardui Ben. Calend.
Meliss. a^ lbvj. Rad. recent. Petasitidis lbivss. Bardan. lbiij. Angel.

Misc. and distill. S. A.

Treacle Water.
Take of the Juice of green Walnuts 12 Pound, of Rue 9 Pound, of Carduus,
Marigolds, and Balm, each 6 Pound, of Butter-Bur-Root fresh gathered, 4 Pound
and half, Bur-dock 3 Pound, Angelico and Master-wort each one Pound and half,
of Scordium 12 Hands-full, London-Treacle one Pound and half, Philon, Persic.
one Pound, Spirit of Wine 30 Pints and 6 Ounces; mix and distill according to
Art.

This is a very good Water, and warmer than the College Treacle-water. It is
given as a Cordial in any Fainting or Gripes, especially in those which
frequently happen in raising a Salivation.

In the Lock they generally salivate by Unction, and it has been observed, that
the Lues, and many Cases which would not give way to a Salivation raised by
inward means, have been overcome by this; though many are of Opinion, that the
external Method is most dangerous.

Alcohol Chalybis. D. M.

Dr. M -- 's Powder of Steel.
Take of the finest Steel 3 Ounces, red Sugar Candy 2 Ounces; let them be
reduced together into a fine Powder.

This is a very plain, easy, and most natural Preparation of Steel, and is
rendered fit thereby to be taken either in Substance, or to communicate its
Virtues to any Liquor by Infusion. It comes nearest to the common Preparation
of Steel with Tartar; and has the same Qualities of a Deobstruent. Its usual
Dose is from i, to ss, in a Chlorosis, and all menstrual Obstructions. It is
likewise a good Medicine in all Hypochondriacal Affections; but as the Cure of
such Patients consists generally more in their way of living, than in Medicine,
an Hospital cares not for the Admission of such Invalids.

Balsam. Lucatelli.
Ol. Olivar. opt. Terebinth. Ven. a^ lbiv. Cerae flavae tenuiter incisae
lbijss. Liquescant simul addendo sang. Draconis subtiliss. pulv. ij. misc. ut
f. Balsamum rubicundissimum.
Lucatellus's Balsam.
Take of fine Oil of Olives and Venice-Turpentine each 4 Pound, yellow Wax cut
thin 2 Pound and half; melt them together, and add Dragons-blood in fine Powder
2 Ounces, and mix it into a red Balsam.

This is much better than that of the College Dispensatory, though much cheaper
and easier made. The Dragons-blood gives a much better Color than the
Saunders, which is in the other; and if either have any Virtues suitable to the
whole, this bids the fairest; and will also much better mix therewith, because
it in a manner dissolves in the Oil. It is used both inwardly, in all
Suspicions of internal Ulcerations, and externally as a Digestive.

Balsam. Sulphur. Terebinth. is much used in St. Thomas's Hospital, as it is
directed to be made in Bate's Dispensatory, both internally, and in Dressings
for the same purpose, as it is directed by the common Practice.

Balsam. Viride.
Ol. Lin. lbiv. Aeris Virid. purific. and pulver. lbj. Bulliant simul ad
dissolutionem Aerugin. and f. Bals. viride.
The Green Balsam.
Take Linseed Oil 4 Pound, of the finest Verdigrease powdered 1 Pound; boil
them together till the Verdigrease is dissolved, and it will incorporate
together into a green Balsam.

This is of great use in all contused and lacerated Wounds, and likewise in
Gunshot Wounds, there is nothing that exceeds it.

Bolus Alexiter.
Theriac. Androm. Pulv. Alexit. a^ j. Sir. Caryoph. q. s. ut f. Bol.
An Alexiterial Bole.
Take Venice-Treacle, and of the Alexiterial Powder, each one Scruple, Syrup of
Cloves a sufficient Quantity to make into a Bole.

This is frequently directed to be taken, in order to compose and breath a
Person after Amputation, or any other Operation which is attended with extreme
Pain, and threatens a Fever; and is repeated as often as occasion requires:
drinking after it proper Juleps.

Bolus cum Calomel.
Calomel. opt. levigat. Cons. Ros. rub. a^ j.
Misc. f. Bolus.

A Bole with Calomel.
Take Calomel well levigated one Scruple, Conserve of Roses half a Scuple; mix
into a Bole.

This is the common Bole for Salivation, and is repeated as the Symptoms
require. It is also given frequently over Night, to be carried off by the
common Catharticks the next Morning, in any Cases that require brisk Purging.

Bolus Emeticus.
Antimonii resuscitat. Batean. Gr. vij. Cons. Ros. rub. q. s. f. Bol.
An Emetick Bole.
Take of revived Antimony, according to Bate, 7 Grains, Conserve of red Roses a
sufficient Quantity to make it into a Bole.

In very gross and robust Constitutions this is given preparatory to any Course
of Alteratives; for sometimes it will work with great Violence, insomuch as to
render it unsafe to infirm and weakly Persons.

Bolus Emeticus Mercurialis.
Turpeth. Min. opt. levig. Gr. vij. Cons. Ros. rub. q. s. f. Bol.
An Emetick Mercurial Bole.
Take of Turbith Mineral well levigated, 7 Grains, Conserve of red Roses a
sufficient Quantity to make into a Bole.

This is as rough as the former, but is generally made choice of in Venereal
and Leprous Cases, preparatory to Salivation; and is likewise sometimes
directed where no such Course is intended, particularly in foul Ulcers of long
standing; the cleansing and lasting Cure of which its Operation does much
forward: But this is too churlish to be given but to athletick Constitutions.

Bolus Hydropicus.
Gambog. pulv. Gr. xv. Cremor. Tartari ss. Sir. e Spin. C. q. s. f. Bolus.
An Hydropick Bole.
Take Gamboge 15 Grains, Cream of Tartar half a Scruple, Syrup of Buckthorn a
sufficient Quantity to make them into a Bole.

In a Dropsy, or a flaccid moist Habit tending thereunto, this is a very
common Purge, and a very good one. The Gamboge it self is indeed very rough,
and works sometimes with great Nauseousness, Vomiting and Griping; but the
Tartar much corrects it, by dividing its viscid Parts, and making them less
sensibly velicate the Coats of the Stomach and Bowels, as all resinous Purges
are apt to do. It has sometimes also mixed with it a Drop or two of Oil of
Aniseed, or any other of the carminitive Oils, to render it less griping. This
thoroughly purges off watery and viscous Humors, and greatly promotes the
Discharge by Urine. But to render the Cure of a Dropsy lasting, there is a
Necessity afterward of restoring and strengthening the Tone of the Parts by
proper Medicines for such purposes; else they will soon fill again with as much
Water as this has carried away.

Bolus Mercurialis Purgat.
Elect. Lenitiv. lbss. Pulv. Rad. Jallapi jss. Scammon. vj. Calomel ss. Sir.
Ros. solutiv. q. s. ad Boli consistentiam. Dos. iij. mane.
A Purging Mercurial Bole.
Take of Lenitive Electuary half a Pound, Jallap Root powdered one Ounce and
half, Scammony 6 Drams, Calomel half an Ounce, the solutive Syrup of Roses a
sufficient Quantity to make them into the Consistence of a Bole. The Dose is 3
Drams in a Morning.

This is a sure Purge, and will not fail working in the strongest
Constitutions. It is advisable in all Cases whatsoever, as want such
Evacuation. It must be made pretty stiff, else the Calomel will be apt to fall
by its great weight, whereby it will be unequally mixed; and in hot Weather
also it will be apt to fret and spoil, if made up too thin.

Bolus ad Diarrhaeam.
Rhabarb. opt. pulv. ss. Confect. Fracastorii sine Melle, q. s. ut f. Bolus.
A Bole against a Looseness.
Take Powder of the finest Rhubarb half a Dram, Diascordium without Honey, a
sufficient Quantity to make it into a Bole.

This is to be given in any Fluxes of the Belly that require to be stopped, as
often as the Urgency of the Symptoms indicate; but it is generally directed
only at Night going to Bed; for the Opiate confines the Rhubarb from immediate
Operation, and what Effect that has, is only just to cleanse off so much
Choler, or irritating Humors, as it finds already separated by the Intestinal
Glands; and it then so astringes them, as to prevent any further Flux of that
kind upon them. This Bolus is also frequently given to compose and resettle the
Bowels, after the Operation of such strong Catharticks, as cannot well be born
without such a Restorative.

Bolus Mercurialis cum Gambog.
Elect. Lenitiv. lbj. Calomelan. Gambog. pull. a^ ij. j. Sir. e Spin. C. q. s.
ad Boli consistentiam; Addendo Ol. Anis. jss. Dosis j.
A Mercurial Bole with Gamboge.
Take Lenitive Electuary 1 Pound, Calomel and Gamboge in fine Powder each 2
Ounces and 1 Dram, Syrup of Buckthorn a sufficient Quantity to make them into
the Consistence of a Bole; to which add Oil of Aniseeds 1 Dram and half. The
Dose is 2 Drams.

This is stronger than the foregoing with the Jallap; and is directed
accordingly where the most powerful Catharticks are required, and can be born
without Inconveniency.

Bolus Diureticus. D. M.
Scillae j. Hellenii pulv. ss. Ol. Anis. Chym. ss. Dosis j. bis in die.
Dr. M -- 's Diuretic Bole.
Take Squills 1 Ounce, Powder of Elicampane half an Ounce, Oil of Aniseed half
a Dram. The Dose is one Dram twice in a Day.

In Asthmatick and Dropsical Habits, this is an admirable Medicine; for it
greatly scours away those Viscidities which stuff the Vessels, and hinder due
Circulation, and detaches them off by the Kidneys. But its Use is to be
complied with for some time together; and if so continued, the most obstinate
Obstructions of the small Vessels, that cause both Dropsies and Asthma's, will
give way to its Efficacy.

Cataplasma pro Buhone Pestilen. and Carbunculo.
Coepar. Maj. Allii, a^ iij. Pulv. Cantharid. j. Sem. Senapios pulv. Theriac.
Land. Mithrid. Fimi Columbini, a^ j. Ol. Scorpionum q. s. ut f. Cataplasma
debit. consistent.
A Cataplasm for Bubo's or Carbuncles.
Take of the larger Onions, and of Garlic, each 3 Ounces, Powder of Spanish
Flies 1 Dram, Mustard Seed powdered, London Treacle, Mithridate, and
Pigeons-Dung, each 1 Ounce, Oil of Scorpions a sufficient Quantity to make into
a Poultus.

The Cases this is intended for, happen not frequently in the Hospitals: But
when any Humors are critically discharged in malignant Fevers, which are
sometimes attended with very surprising Symptoms, this is a good Medicine both
to help on their Discharge, and defend the Part against Mortifications and
Gangrenes, which frequently happen in such Cases. In confirmed Dropsies
likewise, where the lower Parts have received more Water than can be carried
off by the common Evacuations, and the Legs are forced to be scarify'd, this is
of good Service both to prevent Mortification, and forward the Drain of such
Humors; insomuch that the Tone of a Part is sometimes retrieved by this means,
which would otherwise from a partial Mortification, induce a total one.

Cataplasma Ischiad. D. W.
Sem. Sinap. lbss. Pip. alb. Rad. ZZ. a^ j. Misc. f. pulvis, Vase vitreo optime

Dr. W -- 's Cataplasm for the Hip-Gout.
Take Mustard Seed powdered half a Pound, white Pepper, and Ginger, each 1
Ounce; mix together in a fine Powder, and keep in a Glass close stopped, and
just at the time of using, make into a Poultus, with a sufficient Quantity of
Oxymel of Squils.

This is a very warm Application, and will therefore sometimes help to break
away those Humors which fix upon the Joints, occasioning there intolerable
Pains, and which will not give way to any other means. It is to be applied as
often as the Symptoms and Urgency of Pain require, and the Part can bear; for
it is so hot as frequently to vesicate the Skin; but it then generally has the
best Effect, the Pain most commonly abating upon drawing out by Perspiration
such Humors as will raise a Dew upon the Skin, and sometimes lift it up into
little Blisters; but in such Cases all the Harm is the Trouble.

Cataplasma pro Inflammatione.
Farinae avenac. lbss. Herb. urtic. Miv. Cerae flavae, lbjss.
Misce super ignem.

A Cataplasm for an Inflammation.
Take of Oatmeal half a Pound, of Nettles 4 Handsful, yellow Wax one Pound and
half; mix them together over the Fire.

This is directed for erysipelous Tumors, and ordinary Inflammations; but is
not frequently called for.

Cerevisia Hydropica. D. W.
Summit. Genist. Sem. Sinap. a^ lbj. Rad. Irrid. nostr. Lapath. acut. a^ xij.
Cort. Winteran. Sambuci. Sem. Dauci sylv. Baccar. Juniperi, a^ lbjss. Mist. f.

Dr. W -- 's Dyet-drink for a Dropsy.
Take of Broom-tops, and Mustard Seed, each 1 Pound, of the Roots of English
Orrice, and sharp-pointed Dock, each 12 Ounces, Winter's Bark, Elder-Bark,
Seeds of wild Carrot, and Juniper Berries, each 1 Pound and half; put them all
together into a Bag, to be steeped in 12 Gallons of unhopp'd Ale, while it
works; half a Pint to be drank 2 or 3 times in a Day.

This is of good use to absorb and dry up the remaining Moistures and watery
Humors, which the ordinary Catharticks leave behind; and will make the Cure
lasting, which otherwise would be but short. In all scorbutic Habits likewise,
especially where the Extremes tend toward too great a Fullness and Corpulency,
this is of real Service, if the Patients are kept to it for some time together.
In all Tendencies likewise toward a Palsy it does much good both by drying
away watery and sloughy Humors, which destroy due Sensation, and giving Warmth
and Briskness to the Juices.

Confectio Fracastorii.
Vt. in Pharmacopoeia Londinensi; sed in loco Mellis praeparand. cum Sir. e
Meconio.
Fracastorius's Confection.
This is the same as the common Diascordium of the College; only instead of
Honey is made use of Syrup of Diacodium in its room.

This is given about a Dram in a Dose in ordinary Fluxes of the Belly, and as
an Opiate to compose the Bowels after strong Purging; or wheresoever Opiates
are requisite, and nothing forbids astringing at the same time.

The White Drink.
Take of the whitest burnt Hartshorn half a Pound, of Gum Arabic 2 Ounces;
reduce them into a Powder, and pour upon them 1 Gallon of boiling Water; to
which add strong Cinnamon Water half a Pint; and if further be added of
Tormentil Roots 4 Ounces, and 2 Ounces of Pomegranate-Bark, in the boiling, it
is then called, The Restringent Decoction.

This is constantly made in large Quantities, and given as a common Drink in
all kinds of Fluxes. It is likewise the common Drink for Persons under
Salivation, especially while the Spitting is raising, and in Fevers, Smallpox,
or Measles, where a Looseness is to be guarded against.

Decoct. Hydropicum.
Infusion. Paralytic. Decoct. Scorbut. a^ lbj.
Misce.

The Hydropick Diet-Drink.
Take of the Paralytick Infusion, and of the Scorbutic Decoction, each 1 Pint,
and mix for use.

The Virtue and Use of this may be known by its Title; but best by the
respective Ingredients, to be met with in their proper Places. The Dose 10
Ounces, twice a Day.

Dr. M -- 's Decoction for the Jaundice.
Take of Turmerick Root, and of Madder Root each 1 Ounce, Leaves of Celandine
with the Flowers, St. John's-wort, each 1 Handful; boil them in Spring Water a
sufficient Quantity to 2 Pints: To the strained Liquor add Syrup of the 5
opening Roots 2 Ounces, and mix for use. The Dose is half a Pint twice in a Day.

This is directed to all in the Jaundice, or in any Scorbutic Habit of Body,
either tending that way, or to Dropsies.

The Carminative Decoction.
Take of Mercury Leaves, Pellitory of the Wall, and Melilot, each 1 Handful,
Linseed and Aniseed bruised each 1 Ounce; Chamomile-Flowers 1 Handful; boil in
a sufficient Quantity of Spring Water to 12 Ounces, and strain out the Liquor
for use.

This is the common Clyster-Decoction, and is used on no other Account.

Decoctum Scorbuticum.

The Scorbutic Decoction.
Take of Common and Roman Wormwood each 1 Handful, Agrimony, Carduus, and the
Tops of Centaury the lesser, of each 2 Handsful, of Gentian Root sliced 1
Ounce, Horseradish 2 Ounces; boil them in a sufficient Quantity of
Spring Water to 6 Pints, and in the strained Liquor infuse 1 Handful of
Chamomel-flowers for use.

This is one of the Ingredients of the Decoctum Hydropicum above; and comes
into use after the Load of Humors has been forced off by Purges, and the more
powerful Diuretics; because it confirms the Tone of the Fibers, and prevents a
Relapse. It also gives such Strength to the Stomach, as to procure a good
Appetite, and help Digestion; whereby so many crude Humors are not supplied to
the Blood, as fill the small Glands, and produce the most remarkable Symptoms
of the Scurvy.

Take of Guajacum-wood, and Bark, each 1 Pound, Liquorice-root 12 Ounces,
Coriander-seed bruised 2 Ounces; boil them in 6 Gallons of Spring Water to 4
Gallons; to the strained Liquor add Mezereon-Root 1 Ounce.

This is used as a common pectoral Drink, and as an ordinary Sweetener in any
Course of Alteratives.

Take of Ground Ivy, Scabious, and Coltsfoot, each 2 Handsful, Hyssop 1
Handful, Elicampane-root 1 Ounce, Liquorice 4 Ounces, Agrimony 4 Handsful; boil
them together in a sufficient Quantity of common Water to 1 Gallon. The Dose is
4 Ounces at Discretion.

This is more pectoral than the former, and is directed in all Distempers and
Decays of the Lungs, or any of the Viscera, and used as a common Drink.

Decoctum Senae. D. W.

Dr. W -- 's Decoction of Sena.
Take of Alexandrian Sena 2 Ounces, Liquorice-root 1 Ounce, Cassia broken 3
Ounces, Cream of Tartar 1 Dram; boil in a sufficient Quantity of Spring Water
to 2 Pints: The Dose is 3 or 4 Ounces, with a sufficient Quantity of Syrup of
Buckthorn.

This is the ordinary Purge for tender Patients, because it works very mildly,
if there be not too much of the Syrup of Buckthorn put to a Dose. Two or three
Drams is generally the Quantity made use of.

Decoctum Amarum. -- Pectorale.

The Bitter and -- Pectoral Decoction.

Both these are made as directed in the London Dispensatory, and are used in
the same manner, as ordered in the common Practice.

Dr. M -- 's Astringent Electuary.

all Decays of Constitution that have been occasioned either by acute
Distempers, or the Severity of Cure from some Chronick Cases. For it greatly
warms the Blood, and gives new Life and Vigor to the Juices. Its Quantity is
about a Dram, or the bigness of a Nutmeg* to be taken 2 or 3 times in a Day.
Exercise, as walking about, is as much ordered as is convenient with the
Condition and Circumstances of a Patient, in the use of it because it greatly
assists its Operation.

which are common to Old Age, and such as have had any Shocks of an Apoplexy. It
greatly warms the Blood, and gives new Spirits to the almost dried Fibers.

Electuarium Febrifugum.
Cortic. Peruvian. pulv. lbj. Rad. Serpent. Virg. j. Sir. Garioph. q. s. ut f.
Elect.
The Febrifuge Electuary.
Take of the Peruvian Bark finely powdered 1 Pound, Snake-root 1 Ounce, Syrup
of Cloves a sufficient Quantity to make into an Electuary.

This is given in the Intervals of an intermitting Fever, and in all Agues,
which it infallibly cures; but they will frequently return, unless this be
repeated for 2 or 3 Days, about 10 Days after the first Cure. But great Care is
necessary, that it be not given till the Fit is clear off, otherwise it will
grievously aggravate the Distemper. It is to be given seldomer or oftener,
according to the Length of the Intervals; so that 4 or 5 Doses may be taken in
that Space, in the Quantity of a Chestnut each Dose.

Electuarium Haemorrhoidale Laxativum.
Elect. Lenitiv. jss. Flor. Sulphur. iij. Sir. Violar. q. s. ut f. Elect.
A Laxative Electuary for the Piles.
Take of Lenitive Electuary 1 Ounce and half, Flowers of Brimstone 3 Drams,
Syrup of Violets a sufficient Quantity to make into an Electuary.

The Quantity of a Nutmeg is to be taken of this every Morning and Night, and
it will keep the Belly moderately lax, and greatly ease the Piles. All the
Sulphur Medicines are of Service in this Complaint; whether by altering the
Quality of the Blood, or by influencing the Secretion, so as to remit its
Quantity, is of too great a length here to be enquired into.

Electuarium Carminativum.
Pulv. Sem. Angel. -- Carui; -- Petrosel. a^ ij. Sir. Caryoph. q. s. ut f.
Elect.
A Carminitive Electuary.
Take of the Powder of Angelico-seeds, Caruway-seeds, and Parsley-seeds, each 2

for such who are much liable to Wind in the Bowels or Stomach.

A Nephritick Electuary.
Take of Electuary Lenitive 1 Pound, Venice-Turpentine 4 Ounces, Cream of
Tartar 1 Ounce; mix them into an Electuary. The Dose 1 Dram twice in a Day.

This gently opens by Stool; but is very forcing by Urine, and is therefore
directed in all Obstructions and Foulnesses of the Kidneys and Ureters; and
even in Gonorrhoea's it is an excellent Remedy, and principally used in the
Hospitals for such Purposes.

Electuarium Terebinthinatum.

Take Powder of the Root of Jallap 4 Ounces, Scammony, and Liquorice, each 2
Ounces, Rezin of Jallap half an Ounce, Salt of Tartar 2 Drams,
Venice-Turpentine a sufficient Quantity to make into an Electuary; The Dose 1
Dram every Morning.

This will purge pretty briskly, and is also sequently directed in a
Gonorrhoea, to be taken till the Matter becomes well-colour'd; when it is left
off for Things more strengthening. But it is however good in all Cases
whatsoever, as an ordinary Purge.

Enema Anticolicum.

Take of the Carminative Decoction 10 Ounces, Honey of Mercury 3 Ounces, Hiera
Picra 2 Drams, Sea Salt 1 Spoonful; mix together for a Clyster.

The Title of this sufficiently shows its Use and Virtues. As also of

Enema Commune.

The Common Clyster.
Take of the Carminative Decoction 10 Ounces, Honey of Mercury 2 Ounces,

A Clyster for the Bloody Flux.
Take of the White Decoction 6 Ounces, Diascordium half an Ounce,
Bole-Armoniack, Venice-Treacle, each 2 Drams; mix together for a Clyster.

This must be well mixed, and carefully administered, else it will not pass the
Pipe: And in Fluxes all Clysters ought to be in as little Quantity as they can
be conveniently given, because they will stay the easier, and consequently have
the greater Effect.

Enema Haemorrhoidale.
Gallor. contus. iij. Coq. in aq. fontan. q. s. ad vj. Colat. f. Enema pro usu.
A Clyster for the Piles.
Take Galls bruised 3 Ounces, boil them in a sufficient Quantity of

Take of the Carminative Decoction, 10 Ounces, Venice-Turpentine (dissolved in
the Yolk of an Egg) half an Ounce, Electuary-Lenitive, and common Honey, each 1
Ounce; mix them together very carefully for a Clyster.

This is generally ordered in such Cholick Pains as proceed from the Stone or
Gravel.

Plaster.

A Plaster for the Side.
Take of Mynsicht's Galbanum with Saffron 6 Drams, Diachylon with the Gum 2
Drams, Cummin-Plaster 3 Drams; melt them together, and add 10 Drops of Oil of
Penniroyal, and 6 Drops of Oil of Lavender.

This is applied in any Pains and Stitches, and is found of good Service; and
also to Children, that have inward Convulsions.

Emplast. Mercuriale. D. W.
Empl. Discutient. simpl. lbiv. Liquat. add Hydrar. Tereb. Venet. q. s. been

Dr. W -- 's Mercurial Plaster.
Take of the above simple Discutient Plaster 4 Pounds, melt it, and add
thereunto 12 Ounces of Quicksilver, that has been well incorporated, with a
sufficient Quantity of Turpentine.

Those are both good to discuss hard Tumors; but the latter with Quicksilver
is much the most efficacious in those which are obstinate, and frequently arise
from venereal and scrophulous Causes. Great Care in making is to be used, to
incorporate the Quicksilver well with Turpentine, else it will not be so mixed,
but that in spreading the Plaster for use, it will separate and run into
Globules. If this be carefully made, it is preferable to the Frog-Plaster with
Quicksilver in the London Dispensatory, although that is vastly more troublesome
to make, being stuffed with many Ingredients, that are of no real Service, but
only to perplex the Compounder, and amuse the Expectations of the Ignorant.

Emplastrum Epispasticum. D. W.
Empl. Discutien. simpl. vel Adhaesiv. Batean. q. s. extend crassius super

Dr. W -- 's Blister-Plaster.
Take of the simple discutient Plaster abovementioned, or of the sticking
Plaster in Bate's, a sufficient Quantity to spread thick upon Leather, over
which sprinkle of the fine Powder of Cantharides as much as will stick.

This is an easy way, and now much used in the common Practice, as well as in
the Hospitals. And it is much more certain, than the common Plasters into which
the Flies are mixed, for it cannot fail of its Intention; but some are
apprehensive that by this means the Flies get more into the Blood, and are more
liable to create Stranguries, and such Inconveniences as make their inward Use
so dangerous. But whether there be any thing in this or not, there is not Room
here to consider. However, those who choose this way are obliged to leave the
Edges of the Plaster uncovered with the Flies, or to stick Strops on it
cross-ways, spread with somewhat sticking, else it will not keep upon the Part
to which it is applied.

Emplast. Lumbare. D. W.

Dr. W -- 's Plaster for the Back.
Take Diachylon simple, or de Minio, half a Pound; to which, when melted, add
of the best Frankincense 2 Ounces, and of Bole-Armoniack 3 Ounces.

This is spread upon Leather pretty thick, and applied to the Small of the
Back, to be continued as long as it will stick, for many Weaknesses of the
Kidneys; in which case it frequently does good Service: But it is more
particularly useful in that Disorder which, amongst the Females, is called the
Whites. But to some it occasions such intolerable Itching, as to make it
difficult to keep it on.

Dr. W -- 's Apolectick Gargle.
Take Pellitory Root, and Ginger sliced, each half an Ounce, white Pepper 2
Drams, boil in a sufficient Quantity of Water to half a Pint, which pour out
upon 3 Drams of bruised Mustard Seed: when it is strained, put to it 3 Ounces
of sharp Vinegar for a Gargle to syringe the Mouth with.

Gargarisma Commune. D. W.

The Emollient Gargle.
Take Pectoral Decoction a Pint, Spirit of Sal Ammoniac 2 Drams; mix them
together.

There needs no Directions concerning the Use of these.

Haustus Purgans Communis.
Decoct. Senae iv. Aq. Epidem. ij. Sir. e Spin. Cerv. j.

The Common Purging Draught.
Take the Decoction of Sena 4 Ounces, Plague-water 2 Drams, Syrup of Buckthorn
1 Ounce; mix into a Draught.

This is a moderate Purge, and commonly directed in ordinary Cases, where
Purging is required.

Haustus Stomachic. D. M.
Aq. Cinnam. Hord. j. Succ. Limon. ss. Sal. Absynth. j.
Misce f. Haustus.

Dr. M -- 's Stomachick Draught.
Take Barley Cinnamon Water 1 Ounce, Juice of Limons half an Ounce, Salt of
Wormwood 1 Scruple; mix for a Draught.

This is given in Vomitings, and is to be repeated after each Vomiting, until
it stops; but it is so effectual to this purpose, as seldom to require many
Repetitions, before it takes place.

Haustus Epilepticus. D. M.
Rad. Valerian. Sylvester Pull. jss. Aq. Pulegii; -- Cerasor. Nigr. a^ jss. Sir.

Dr. M -- 's Epileptick Draught.
Take Powder of wild Valerian Root one Dram and half, Peniroyal Water, and
black Cherry Water, each 1 Ounce and half, Syrup of Pionies 2 Drams; mix into a
Draught.

This is an extraordinary Medicine for the purpose it is prescribed, though it is
not much known in common Practice. The Valerian is also very efficacious in all
Distempers from a Nervous Origin.

Haustus Emeticus Communis.
Infusionis Croc. Metallor. j.

The Common Vomit is,
An Ounce of the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum.

Dr. H -- le's Emetick Draught.
Take of the Juice of Asarabacca 6 Drams, or an Ounce, Oxymel of Squills half
an Ounce, Carduus-water 2 Ounces; mix into a Draught.

This is a very strong Emetick, and is much used at Bedlam, amongst the
Maniacks, for it will operate, when neither the Crocus, nor any of the common
Mercurial Emeticks, will move them. And it has been confirmed by all
Experience, that such Patients are much more difficult to be wrought upon, than
any others, either by Catharticks or Emeticks; insomuch that they will bear
enough at a Dose for 6 or 10 ordinary Persons: their Fibers, and all the Parts
of the Brain, most particularly administering to Sensation, being extremely
clogged with viscid Humors, which this Medicine is very powerful in draining
off; and upon the same Account likewise it is of such good Service as a
Sternutatory; for it greatly drains the Head by the powerful Twitches and
Vellications it gives to the Fibers of the Nose, and Parts adjacent.

Haustus Dysentericus. D. W.
Aq. Cinnam. fort. Menthae, a^ j. Pull. Rhab. ss. Sir. e Meconio j.
Misce.

Dr. W -- 's Draught for a Dysentery.
Take strong Cinnamon Water, and Mint-water, each 1 Ounce, Powder of Rhubarb
half a Scruple, Syrup of Diacodium 1 Ounce, mix into a Draught.

This both astringes and composes, and at the same time, by the Help of the
Rhubarb, helps forward the Ejectment of such Humors, as vellicate the Bowels,
tear off their natural Mucus, and lay open the Capillaries in such manner as to
let out the Blood to flow at every Stool.

Infusio Millipedum. D. W.

xiv. Dosis lbss. bis in die.
Dr. W -- 's Infusion of Millepedes.
Take 4 Pound of live Millepedes, infuse them cold in 8 Pints of White Wine for
14 Days; then strain for Use.

This is an excellent Diuretic, and a most efficacious Medicine in all
Chronick Cases, that are to be relieved by promoting the urinary Discharges, as
are many schrophulous Disorders, and such as frequently are the Forerunners of
scorbutic Dropsies, from a Retention of such Humors as foul the Viscera, and
stuff the whole Habit with Water and Viscidities.

Infusio Paralytica. D. M.
Rad. Raphani rust. tenuit. incis. Sem. Sinapios contus. a^ iv. Infund. in aq.

Dr. M -- 's Paralytick Infusion.
Take Horseradish Root sliced thin, and Mustard Seed bruised, each 4 Ounces;
infuse them in 4 Pints of boiling Water for 24 Hours; then strain for use, and
drink half a Pint twice in a Day.

This is not only Diuretic as the former, but is also much warmer; and is
therefore not only directed to cleanse away by Urine any thing that lodges upon
the Fibers, so as to spoil their Offices, but also to give them due Warmth,
which in Paralytick Cases they are destitute of. It ought to be kept close
stopped, because it otherwise would, by its Volatility, spoil and grow vapid.
In Rheumatisms, this is also frequently given, with great Success; especially
if the Limbs swell with great Pains.

Infusio Pleuretica.
Fimi Equini recent. vj. Aq. Pulegii xij. -- Theriac. iv. Infund. calide.

The Pleuretick Infusion.
Take fresh Horse-dung 6 Ounces, Peniroyal-water 12 Ounces, Treacle-water 4
Ounces; infuse them warm, and to the strained Liquor add Mithridate 2 Drams,
White Sugar a sufficient Quantity to sweeten it; drink half a Pint twice in a
Day.

This is a very good Medicine for the purpose it is intended for, and will
frequently procure Ease, when no other means will take place. If the Dose here
mentioned be too noisome, it may be lessened, and repeated the oftener. This is
likewise ordered in Distempers of the Breast, that are not a true Pleurifie,
wherein it will do great Service, as in a Peripneumony; and in an Asthma, the
common pectoral Drinks are not to be compared to it.

Julapium Camphoratum.
Camph. ij. Incende and saepe extingue in aq. font. lbj. ad totius Camphorae
consumptionem.
The Camphorated Julep.
Take Camphor 2 Drams, set it on fire, and quench it in a Pint of Water; then
light it again and quench it, which repeat till all the Camphor is consumed.

This is ordered in malignant Fevers, and in inflammatory Cases. There are some
peculiar Hysterical Cases, wherein also it is of good Service: but it is not
greatly used.

Take Rue-water, Peniroyal-water, of each 8 Ounces, Bryony-water compound 4
Ounces, Troches of Myrrh powdered 2 Drams, fine Sugar 1 Ounce and half; mix
into a Julep.

This is the ordinary Hysteric Julep, given either as a Diluter of other more
efficacious Medicines in such Cases, or where the Symptoms are not much
aggravated, being well shaked before taking; the Quantity of 5 or 6 Spoonfuls
at a Dose, to be repeated once in 3 or 4 Hours.

Julapium Cardiacum. D. W.
Aq. Scordii comp. viij. -- Theriac. -- Epidem. a^ ij. Sir. Garyoph. q. s. ut

Dr. W -- 's Cordial Julep.
Take compound Scordium-water 8 Ounces, Treacle-water, and Plague-water, each 2
Ounces, Syrup of Cloves a sufficient Quantity to sweeten it.

This is prescribed in all kinds of Fevers, and is much more efficacious than
the Juleps ordinarily prescribed in common Practice: 3 or 4 Spoonfuls may be
repeated every 2 or 3 Hours, till some Crisis appears, and the Distemper abates.

Julapium Mithridaticum. D. W.

Mithridate 2 Drams, White-Sugar 1 Ounce and half; mix into a Julep, to take 4
Spoonfuls every 6 Hours.

This is also directed to the same purpose as the foregoing; but is not quite
so pleasant to take.

Julapium Febrif.

A Julep to be taken in a Fever.
Take Barley-water 3 Pints, Treacle-water 6 Ounces, Syrup of Juice of Limons 4

This is directed for the common Diluter, and is ordered to be drank of
liberally in all inflammatory Fevers.

Linctus Pectoralis.

A Pectoral Linctus.
Take 2 Ounces of Linseed Oil drawn without Fire, and Syrup of Cloves, each 2
Ounces, Sugar 1 Dram; incorporate them together in a Marble Mortar.

This is commonly directed in all Distempers of the Breast, to promote
Expectoration, and smooth the Bronchiae, which are too much vellicated by a
sharp Serum. It is given a Spoonful at Discretion.

Dr. W -- 's Liquid Laudanum.
Take Cloves, Cinnamon, Mace, each half an Ounce, Salt of Tartar 2 Drams, Opium
half a Pound; infuse them all in 6 Pints of Canary for 14 Days; then evaporate
the strained Liquor to 4 Pints. The Dose 30 Drops.

Dr. W -- 's Solid Laudanum.
Take Opium sliced thin 1 Pound, Canary 2 Pints, Salt of Tartar 2 Drams;
dissolve them together, then strain out the Liquor, and evaporate it to the
Consistence of Honey; to which add Long Pepper, and Ginger, each 2 Drams,
Volatile Salt of Hartshorn an Ounce and half, Chemical Oil of Aniseed, of
Cloves, and of Nutmegs, each 2 Drams, and make into a Mass for use; The Dose
from 1 Grain to 2 Grains.

These are both extraordinary Medicines, easily made, and much preferable to
any under the same Title, that are vastly more troublesome and costly to
prepare. Their Use needs no Explanation.

Mixtura Asthmatica.
Oxymel Scillit. Aq. Cinnam. Hord. a^ iij.
Misce.

The Astmatick Mixture.
Take Oxymel of Squills, Barley and Cinnamon Water, each 3 Ounces; mix them
together.

This is given to promote Expectoration; and it is also an excellent Diuretic,
by which means it operates all possible ways to answer the purposes signified
by the Title. It is given a Spoonful at a time, 3 or 4 times in a Day, but
particularly in the Morning.

Mixtura Antiemetica. D. W.

D. W -- 's Antiemetick Mixture.
Take fresh Juice of Limons 6 Ounces, Salt of Wormwood 2 Drams, mix them
together.

If this is not mixed in a very large Vessel, and great Care taken, the
Fermentation will be so violent and sudden, as to throw it over. It is very
good for the purposes its Title expresses, and is directed 3 or 4 Spoonfuls at
a time, to be repeated after every Vomiting, till it stops.

Take Treacle-water above-prescribed, and Mint-water, each 2 Pints, Philon.
Persic. 1 Ounce; mix together, and take 2 Spoonfuls after every Stool.

This is a standing Mixture at the Lock Hospital, which is given to prevent a
Griping, and a Tenesmus, which frequently happen by anointing with Mercurials
to raise Salivation. And if Blood likewise appears with the Stools, the
following Clyster is ordered.

Purified Opium.
Take of the best Opium 4 Ounces, dissolve it and boil it in a sufficient
Quantity of clear Water, till it gives it a very red Color, which strain from
the Faeces; to them put fresh Water, and boil again; which repeat as long as
they will continue to give any Tincture; then evaporate the several Tinctures
together into the Consistence of a Pill.

This is used in the same Cases and Quantities as crude Opium, and by some is
preferred thereunto; but the Difference is not worth disputing, and hardly
worth the Trouble of the latter Process.

A Pectoral Oxymel.
Take of the Roots of Elicampane, Asarabacca, and Ginger, each 6 Ounces, of
Florentine Orrice, and Galangal Roots sliced, and white Pepper a little
bruised, each 3 Ounces, Spring Water 10 Pints, White Wind Vinegar 6 Pints;
steep them together 24 Hours, then boil to 10 Pints; strain, and add Honey 6
Pounds; then boil and clarify; to which add of the Extract of Liquorice half a
Pound, and make into a Syrup.

This is an efficacious Detergent, and does greatly promote Expectoration; for
which purpose it is much given in all Asthmatick Cases, and where the Breast is
clogged with viscid Humors: 2 or 3 Spoonfuls are ordered to be taken at any
time.

the strained Liquor add White Wind Vinegar 1 Pint, Verges 2 Pints, and of the
best Honey 6 Pound; boil up to the Consistence of a Syrup.

This is given to help Expectoration, and is very effectual to break away the
Obstructions of the Breast, which occasion Asthmas and Coughs.

Dr. M -- 's Stiptick Pill.
Take fine Roch Alum 3 Drams; melt it over a clear Fire, and then stir into it
1 Dram of Dragon's-Blood finely powdered; and out of each Dram of the Mass make
10 Pills; 5 of which are to be taken 3 times in a Day.

These are very much restringent, and are directed only in very obstinate
Fluxes.

Opii puris. nostr. gr. j. Extract. Croci gr. iv.

The Anodyne Pill.
Take purified Opium 1 Grain, Extract of Saffron 4 Grains, and mix.

This is a pleasant and a very safe Opiate, and may be given in all Cases where
such Helps are required. But its principal Use is in Catarrhs, and such
Defluxions, as occasion tickling Coughs, which it greatly relieves, and helps
the Discharge of a great deal of Serum by the cutaneous Glands in Perspiration,
and Breathing-Sweats.

Pil. Catarrhales.

F. Pil. hora somni sumend.

Pills for a Catarrh.
Take Pill. Ruffi 1 Scruple, fine Opium 1 Grain; mix into Pills, and take them
at Night going to Bed.

As the former is given to stop the Defluxion of Rheum upon the Glands of the
Throat, and encourage its Discharge by the Skin; these are intended to divert
it by Stool, and are very good for that purpose. They are given to asthmatick
Constitutions, and such as are inclining to Consumptions, from the Injuries
such Defluxions are apt to do to the Lungs.

Pil. Diuretica.
Sapon. Ven. j. Ol. Anis. gut. xxxij. Contunde in Mortario ut f. Pil. No. x. ex

The Diuretic Pills.
Take Venice-Soap 1 Ounce, Oil of Aniseed 32 Drops; beat them into a Mass, and
make 10 Pills out of every Dram, to be rolled up with the Powder of Crab's-eyes.

These are very efficacious in all Obstructions of the Urinary Passages; and
also so very detergent, as to be of great Service in any Foulnesses of the
Viscera; so that they are not only of good Service in the Stone and Gravel, but
in the Jaundice and Astthma's, in the most obstinate Cases of which they are
ordered with the greatest Certainty of Success. They are to be taken from 3 to
5, 2 or 3 times in a Day; the Patient using proper Diluters at the same time.

Pil. Ecphracticae.

The Ecphractick Pills.
Take Hiera Picra 4 Ounces, Salt of Steel half an Ounce, Syrup of Steel a
sufficient Quantity to make into Pills of a moderate Bigness, to take 6 or 7
every Day.

These are directed in gross Habits of Body, that are contracted either from a
slothful Life, or a poor gross Diet, where the Stomach and Viscera begin to be
stuffed with such Viscidities, as create Dropsies, Asthma's, and many other
Chronick Diseases. They purge very gently, and are particularly good in a
Chlorosis, and likewise in Hypochondriacal Affections.

Pil. Stomachicae. D. M.

Dr. M -- 's Stomachic Pills.
Take Hiera Picra 2 Ounces, dried Aron Root half an Ounce, Extract of Gentian 2
Drams, Elixir Proprietatis a sufficient Quantity to make it into a Mass for
Pills; to which add Salt of Wormwood 2 Drams.

These are directed to be taken every Morning, 6 or 7 at a Dose; they gently
purge, and both cleanse away sloughy Humors, which foul the Coats of the
Stomach, and warm the Fibers, whereby Digestion is promoted. They are most
convenient in advanced Age, and full cachectick Habits, which abound with cold
viscid Humors.

Pil. Pectorales.

Pectoral Pills.
Take Elicampane Root powdered 1 Ounce, Powder of Saffron 2 Drams, Balsam of
Sulphur anisated a sufficient Quantity to make into a Mass for Pills, of which
3 is a Dose twice in a Day.

These are given in ordinary Coughs in consumptive Habits, and in all
Distempers of the Breast. They are both cordial and detergent, whereby they not
only raise the Spirits, but cleanse the Vessels, promote Expectoration, and
ease the Breath.

Pil. Hystericae.

The Hysteric Pills.
Take Galbanum, and Assa Foetida, each 1 Ounce, Powder of Castor 1 Dram,
Tincture of Castor a sufficient Quantity to make them into Pills.

These are ordered in all Hysteric Affections, and sometimes in Hypochondriacal
Cases. They are given 5 at a Dose, 2 or 3 times in a Day.

Pil. Mercuriales.

The Mercurial Pill.
Take Pil. e Duobus 1 Ounce, Calomelanos half an Ounce, Syrup of Buckthorn a
sufficient Quantity to make them into a Mass; to which add Oil of Sassafras 20
Drops.

These are powerfully purging, and are generally given in Venereal Cases,
previous to a Salivation, or a Course of Alteratives. If they are made from
each Dram into 10 Pills, 5 are enough for a Dose; and the Patients are
carefully attended, and kept warm during their Operation.

Pills of many Virtues.
Take bright Aloes, and Scammony, each 3 Drams, Troches Alhandulae 2 Drams, the
best Saffron 2 Scruples; let the Aloes and Saffron be powdered separately, and
made into a Mass of the Consistence of Pills, with the best Spirit of Wine;
then mix the Troches and Saffron therewith.

These are used as a common Purge in all Cachectick Habits; the Quantity of
half a Dram made into 5 Pills, are generally directed for 1 Dose.

Pil. Hydragogae. D. W.

Dr. W -- 's Pills to purge Water.
Take Gamboge 2 Ounces, Sena half an Ounce, Cream of Tartar 2 Drams, Oil of
Aniseed 1 Dram and half, Syrup of Buckthorn a sufficient Quantity to make them
into a Mass of a proper Consistence for Pills.

These purge much, and carry off a great Quantity of watery Humors, wherever
they are ordered, particularly for Dropsies, and such Cachectick Habits as
abound with those Humors. Their Dose is from 1 Scruple, to half a Dram, made
into 4 or 5 Pills.

Pil. Ecphracticae. D. W.
Specier. Hierae nostr. ij. Sal. Martis ss. Sir. e quinque Radicibus q. s. ut

Dr. W -- 's Ecphractick Pills.
Take of Species Hiera Picra 2 Ounces, Salt of Steel half an Ounce, Syrup of
the 5 opening Roots a sufficient Quantity to make them into a Mass to be formed
into Pills of a moderate bigness, of which 6 or 7 are to be taken twice in a
Day.

These differ very little from the Pills under the same Title a little before
mentioned, only the Quantity of Steel here is in somewhat a larger Proportion
than in them. They are given to the same purposes as there observed.

Pil. ad Gonorrhoeam. D. W.
Resin. Jallap. ij. Fol. Senae; Gum Guajaci a^ j. Sal. Tartari ij. Balsam.
Peruv. ss. Terebinth. Venet. q. s. ut f. massa. Dosis v. alter. mane.
Dr. W -- 's Pills for a Gonorrhoea.
Take Resin of Jallap 2 Ounces, Leaves of Sena, Gum Guajacum, each 1 Ounce,
Salt of Tartar 2 Drams, Balsam of Peru half an Ounce, Venice-Treacle a
sufficient Quantity to make it into a Mass for Pills of an ordinary Bigness, 5
of which are to be taken for a Dose every other Morning.

These are strongly purgative, and calculated particularly to scour the Genital
Parts, and those Passages as are principally infected by Venereal Taints;
insomuch that they will frequently cleanse away a Gonorrhoea, without the
Assistance of Mercury; though most commonly, a Bole with that is given over Night.

Dr. W -- 's Pills against the Jaundice.
Take of Turmerick Root, Steel with Sulphur prepared, each 2 Ounces, Potashes
half an Ounce, Syrup of the 5 opening Roots a sufficient Quantity to make them
into a due Consistence for Pills; which if made of a middling bigness, 3 are
ordered for a Dose twice in a Day.

They are very opening, and therefore not only of service in the Distemper here
mentioned, but in all Cases from Obstructions; and particularly by Urine, they
operate so powerfully as to carry all before them which lodges in those
Passages. The whole Habit likewise is cleansed by them, and a Cachexy may be
converted into a sound, hale Constitution.

Potio Emetica.
Vin. Benedict. vj. Aq. Pulegii jss. Oxymel. Pectoralis iij.
Misce.

The Emetick Draught.
Take of Vinum Benedictum 6 Drams, Peniroyal-water 1 Ounce and half, and
Pectoral Oxymel 3 Drams; mix together into a Draught.

This is the common Vomit, in most Cases, where such a Medicine is required.

Pil. Ruffi.

Pil. Cinnabar.
Cinnab. nativ. j. Pulv. Antisiphil. ij. -- Castor. vj. Mithridat. q. s. ut f.
massa. Dosis a gr. x. ad xv. vel xx.
The Cinnabar Pills.
Take of native Cinnabar 1 Ounce, of the salivating Powder 2 Ounces, Powder of
Castor 6 Drams, Mithridate a sufficient Quantity to make into a Mass of a due
Consistence for Pills. The Dose from 10 Grains to 15 or 20 Grains, made into
small Pills.

This will work both upwards and downwards, and frequently salivates. It is so
churlish, as not to be given but to robust Constitutions, and in very obstinate
Cases; and in very stubborn Ulcers it frequently promotes their Cure more than
any other Mercurial whatsoever.

Pulvis Antiphisil. seu Salivans.
Mercur. praecip. rub. subtilissime pulv. lbj. inde vase terreo super affunde
Spiritum Vini rectif. ad eminentiam ij. digit. accend. Spiritum, continuo
agitando, dum totus deflagaverit; repete opus ad tertiam vicem. Dosis gr. x.

The Salivating Powder.
Take red Precipitate of Mercury 1 Pound, put it into a glazed Vessel, and pour
upon it rectified Spirit of Wine, so as to stand 2 Fingers above it, which set
on fire, and stir it about all the while it is burning. Let this Operation be
repeated 3 times. The Dose is 10 Grains.

The burning of the Precipitate in this manner, breaks off the Points of those
Salts which join to the Mercury in its Preparation, and makes it operate with a
greater Mildness, it being hardly safe in inward Use, without such Correction.
And with this Salivations are frequently raised by giving 10 Grains for a Dose,
with Conserve of Roses, or any thing of like Substance. This is the Powder
mentioned in the foregoing Prescription.

Pulvis Diureticus.
Sal. Nitri puris. iij. -- Succin. volat. j. Test. ov. pulv. ij. Sachar. albis.
vj. Misce f. Pulvis Dosis j.
The Diuretic Powder.
Take fine Salt of Nitre 3 Ounces, volatile Salt of Amber 1 Dram, Powder of
Eggshells 2 Drams, white Sugar 6 Drams; make into a Powder. Dose 1 Dram.

This is a very forceable Diuretic, and operates with great Quickness, if
given in a proper Quantity of Liquor, as White Wind Whey, or any such Diluter.
For what is drank with it greatly helps its Operation, and makes it pass with
much more Safety, because it is so sharp, as otherwise to rake the Membranes
too much, which will sometimes straiten the Passages, and increase the
Obstruction. A Quantity of Fluid likewise much favors the Operation of
stimulating Diuretics, not only as a Vehicle, but because it presses the
faster by its Weight, through the depending Passages. In all Suspicions of the
Stone and Gravel, this is given once or twice in a Day, and continued according
to the Importance of the Symptoms; but in sloughy and viscid Obstructions, it
is the more particularly fitted to break through. For Oily Medicines are most
suitable to stony Concretions, which stop the Vessels, because they relax and
render slippery the Passages: but in Collections of viscid Matter, they only
increase the Stoppage; and then it is these pungent attenuating Salts are
fittest to cut their way through, by dividing the obstructed Matter, and
carrying it along with them.

Pulvis Sternutatorius.
Fol. Asari siccat. and pulv. q. s.

The Sneezing Powder.
Take Powder of dried Leaves of Asarabacca, as much as is sufficient.

This is the common Snuff used, and it greatly drains the Head of tough, viscid
Humors, which are apt to clog the fine Springs of Life there situated. It is
chiefly given at Night going to Bed, and it will make the Nose run very much
the next Day; though at first taking, it does not irritate so much as the
ordinary Tobacco-Snuffs, and will not so much as cause Sneezing.

Pulvis Aethiopicus. D. C -- de.

Dr. C -- de's Aethiopick Powder.
Take Aethiops Mineral prepared without Fire half a Pound, Crude Antimony 1
Pound, make them into a fine Powder, to take half a Dram 3 times in a Day, with
a Draught of the Decoction Liberans.

This is an admirable Remedy, and of great Efficacy in all cutaneous
Foulnesses; as Scabs, Itch, Leprosy, Herpes, and the like; and especially if
the Eruptions be anointed with the Vnguentum Psoricum, and the Patient be first
bled, and purged with Calomel. This is Dr. C -- de's Method of curing those
Diseases in St. B -- w's Hospital.

Pulvis Haemorrhoidalis.
Flor. Sulph. j. ad ij. Cap. bis in die in Haustu Lactis Vaccini, vel Jusculi

The Powder for the Piles.
Take Flowers of Sulphur 1 Dram to 2 Drams, twice in a Day in a Draught of
Milk, or Water Gruel. See the Pile Electuary.

This is a very easy and cheap Medicine, and very efficacious to the purpose
signified by its Title.

Pulvis ad Vermes.

Misce f. Pulv.

The Worm-Powder.
Take burnt Hartshorn, and Scammony, each 1 Ounce, Calomel 6 Drams, Resin of
Jallap 2 Drams; mix together into a Powder.

This purges very briskly, and is very effectual against Worms, especially in
young Persons. It is best taken in the Pap of an Apple, or any other such
Substance, because the Calomel will sink in any thin Liquor. The Dose from 10
Grains to half a Dram, in a Morning.

Pulv. Synanch.
Sal. Prunell. jss. Piper. alb. iij. Sachar. alb. iv.

Powder for a sore Throat.
Take Salt Prunella 1 Ounce and half, White Pepper 3 Drams, White Sugar 4
Ounces; make into a Powder for the Patient to hold in his Mouth, and swallow
gently.

This is good in all Inflammations in the Throat, and more effectual than most
Gargles contrived for those purposes.

Pulvis Astringens in Diarrhaeam. D. W.
Boli Armeni lbj. Rhab. torrifact. iij.

Dr. W -- 's Astringent Powder.
Take Armenian Bole 1 Pound, Rhubarb toasted 3 Ounces; mix together for Use.

This is given in Loosenesses from half a Dram to 1 Dram at a Dose, in any
convenient Liquor; to be taken as often as the Symptoms require.

4 Ounces, Contragerva Root, Virginia Snake Root, and Angelico Root, each 2
Ounces, Bole-Armeniack 4 Ounces; mix into a Powder to take half a Dram every 6
Hours.

This is the common Prescription in all Cases attended with a Fever, and is
continued till it raises a Diaphoresis, or terminates the Distemper by any
other critical Discharge. This is preferable to many Powders ordered for the
same purpose, though not so costly.

Hiera Picra.
Take Roots of Asarabacca, and Galangal, of Cinnamon, Spicknard, Saffron, and
Myrrh, each 6 Drams, fine Aloes 12 Ounces; make all into a fine Powder.

This is a much better Medicine than the Hiera Picra of the College, because
some Ingredients in that, are not at all to the main Scope of the Medicine; and
this is used to the same purposes.

boil them in 6 Pints of Water to 4 Pints, and when it is almost enough boiled,
put in 4 Ounces of the Heads of Garlic pealed from the outer Skin, of Aniseed
bruised 1 Ounce and half; to the strained Liquor put 4 Pound of Sugar, and boil
up to the Consistence of a Syrup.

This is ordered for all asthmatick Patients, and such as labor with any
Oppression upon the Breast, and Difficulty of Breathing. It is given a Spoonful
at any time; but especially at Night going to Bed, because the Warmth
encourages its Operation, and helps to breath off a great deal through the Skin.

The Diuretic Tincture.
Take of the best Rhubarb 3 Drams, Gum Guajacum 1 Dram and half, Gum Lac 1
Dram, Cantharides bruised 2 Drams, Cochineel half a Dram; infuse them warm for
4 Days in 1 Pint and half of rectified Spirit of Wine; then strain and filter
it for Use. The Dose from 20 to 40 Drops twice in a Day, in White Wind.

This is principally used where the urinary Passages are suspected to be loaded
with slimy and viscid Humors. And to Females, in some Foulnesses of the
Vterus, it is ordered with good Success. And it will breath away Obstructions
that no other Diuretic will take place in.

Tinctura Fracastorii.

Fracastorius's Tincture.
Take Barley-water 10 Ounces, Barley Cinnamon Water 4 Ounces, Aqua Mirabilis 2
Ounces, Diascordium half an Ounce, white Sugar a sufficient Quantity.

This is calculated against all manner of Fluxes of the Belly, and is directed
to be taken 4 or 5 Spoonfuls at a Dose, after every Stool, or oftener, if the
Symptoms are violent. All Malt-Liquors are likewise denied to those Patients,
till the Looseness is perfectly stopped.

Tinctura Emmenagog. D. M.

Dr. M -- 's Emmenagogick Tincture.
Take Roots of black Hellebore 4 Ounces, and pour upon it 12 Ounces of
rectified Spirit of Wine, which let stand in a warm place, till the Tincture is
well drawn. The Dose from 30 to 40 Drops.

This is a most powerful Deobstruent in menstrual Obstructions, and will
prevail many times where Chalybeats are tried in vain. It is good likewise in
many nervous Disorders; but particularly all those which come under the
Appellation of Hypochondriacal Affections; and even in an obstinate Mania, it
is frequently found to have Success. In Rheumatisms likewise, and the Gout, it
will often give great Relief, it being easy, by proper ways of encouraging it,
to raise by it a very great Diaphoresis, so as to breath out much of the
offending Humors. When it is directed only for the Green Sickness, it is
sometimes joined with Elixir Proprietatis, in which manner it is likewise
prescribed against Worms; and, with an equal Quantity of Mynsicht's Elixir of
Vitriol it is sometimes compounded, both in the Green Sickness and the Hypo.

Tinctura Sacra.
Specier. Hierae ij. Cochinel. ss. Infunde septimanam in Vin. alb. genesis lbij.
The Sacred Tincture.
Take 2 Ounces of Hiera Picra, and half a Dram of Cochineel, and infuse them
for a Week in 2 Pints of generous White Wind.

This has twice the Strength of that which is made in the Shops, and is much
the better; for after the common way of making with half this Quantity of
Species, it will hardly operate, unless given in so large a Dose, as affects
the Head from the Quantity of the Wine. It is given as a Stomachick, and
frequently as a Preparatory to Alterative Courses, because it cleanses the
first Passages, and enables the Stomach the better to digest what it receives;
which is as necessary to answer the Ends of a Medicine designed for an
Alterative, as it is to that of common Food to make it into good Nourishment.
This is prescribed from 2 to 3 Ounces over Night, or early in the Morning, and
repeated every other Day, for 3 or 4 times, if not oftener; because its
Operation is too mild to expect any Matters of Moment from one or two Doses.

Dr. W -- 's Cordial Tincture.
Take Root of Tormentil sliced 4 Ounces, Bistort 1 Ounce and half, Angelico 1
Ounce, Gallangal, Cinnamon, and Mace, each 3 Drams, Theban Opium, and
Cochineel, each 1 Dram; infuse them in 4 Pints of Spirit of Wine 14 Days; then
strain, and add to the clear Liquor 6 Ounces of fine Sugar.

This is Cordial and Astringent, and given under any Dejection of Spirits from
what Cause soever; as also where the Stomach and Bowels have lost their due
Tone, and occasion Indigestion, Flatulencies, and Loosnesses. It is generally
given a Spoonful or two at a time, in any convenient Vehicle.

Tinctura Cardiaca and Stomachica.
Aq. Absynth. maj. C. ij. Specier. Diambrae; Terrae Japonic. a^ j.
Digere in B. M.

The Cordial Stomachick Tincture.
Take the greater Composition of Worm-worm Water 2 Ounces, Species Diambrae,
and Japan-Earth, each 1 Dram; digest in a moderate Warmth.

This is pretty much of the same Virtue as the foregoing Cordial Tincture of
Dr. W --, and is directed for the same purposes, especially where the Stomach
has lost its Tone by frequent Debauches; for which purpose, if it be allowed in
Spaw-water a due Quantity, it is much the more likely to succeed. The Dose is
from half a Spoonful, to a Spoonful.

Vinum Scilliticum. D. W.

Dr. W -- 's Squill-Wine.
Take Ginger, Aniseeds, and sweet Fennel Seeds, each half an Ounce,
Liquorice-Root 2 Ounces, Squills prepared 4 Ounces, Cochineel 1 Dram,
White Wind 4 Pints; infuse them together in a close Vessel for a Week; then
strain it, and take 2 Ounces twice in a Day.

This is a good Diuretic, and an admirable Medicine in all Disorders from
Obstructions of the Breast; that there is hardly any one Thing of greater
Efficacy in Astthma's: and in Dropsies, it will do great Service, by inciding
and breaking away by Urine, the pituitous and slimy Humors, which stuff the
whole Habit.

Vnguentum Emolliens.
Unguent. Althaeae iv. Ol. Terebinth. j.
Misce.

The Emollient Ointment.
Take Ointment of Marshmallows 4 Ounces, and Oil of Turpentine 1 Ounce, which
mix together.

This is directed to be rubbed in upon any bruised Part, or that is indurated
by obstructed Humors; because it attenuates and warms the stagnant Matter, and
helps to breath it out, either through the Pores of the Skin, or to be taken up
again by the circulating Blood, and discharged elsewhere.

Vnguentum Tetrapharmacum.
Pici Burgund. lbss. Cerae flavae lbj. Thuris j. Ol. Oliv. lbj.
Misce f. Unguent. S. A.

Ointment of Four Things.
Take Burgundy Pitch half a Pound, Yellow Wax 1 Pound, Frankincense 1 Ounce,
Oil of Olives 1 Pint; melt them together into an Unguent.

This is used as a moderate Digestive.

Vnguentum Nigrum.
Pissolaei Indic. iv. Calophon. vj. Cerae flavae lbss. Ol. Lin. iv.
Misce.

The Black Ointment.
Take Barbados Tar 4 Ounces, Resin 6 Ounces, Yellow Wax half a Pound, and
Linseed Oil 4 Ounces; and melt into an Unguent.

This is also ordered as a Digestive.

Unguent. Epuloticum.
Pulv. Lapid. Calamin. Cerae flavae, a^ iv. Ol. Olivar. vj.
Misce.

The Epulotick Ointment.
Take Calamine, and Yellow Wax, each 4 Ounces, Oil of Olives 6 Ounces; and mix
together into an Unguent.

This is cooling and drying, and ordered in a Herpes, and tetterous Ouzings of
a sharp Serum through the Skin. But in many Cases, such Things are to be used
with great Caution, because they endanger sometimes Mortification, by cooling
the Part too much.

Unguent. Viride.
Aerug. Aeris ss. Unguent. Aegyptiaci ij. Unguent. Sambuc. iv. Colophoniae ij.

The Green Ointment.
Take Verdigrease half an Ounce, Vng. Aegyptiacum 2 Ounces, Ointment of Elder 4
Ounces, Resin 6 Ounces, Oil of Spike 1 Ounce; mix together into an Ointment.

This is a warm Digestive, and a good Detergent, and is used therefore to
cleanse old foul Ulcers, and wear away fungous Flesh from green Wounds.

Unguent. Paralyticum.
Axungiae Porcin. Ol. Lauri, a^ ij. Ol. Vitrioli j.
Misce.

The Palsy Ointment.
Take Hogs-Lard, and Oil of Bays, each 2 Ounces, Oil of Vitriol 1 Ounce; and
mix together into an Unguent.

This is very sharp, insomuch as sometimes to vesicate the Part it is rubbed
into. It is used to paralytick and numbed Limbs, which it helps to restore to
their due Sense and Feeling.

Vnguentum Mercuriale.
Mercur. viv. iv. Tereb. Ven. opt. ij. Misce exquisite dein. add. Axung. Porc.

The Mercurial Ointment.
Take Quicksilver 4 Ounces, the best Venice-Turpentine 2 Ounces; mix them well
together, then adding 1 Pound of Hogs-Lard, make up into an Unguent.

This is used in St. Thomas's Hospital, to raise a Salivation by Unction.

Vnguentum Psoricum.
Axungiae Porcinae lbiv. Flor. Sulphuris; Sulphur. Vivi, a^ lbss.
Misce.

Ointment for the Itch.
Take Hogs-Lard 4 Pound, Flowers of Sulphur, and Sulphur Vive, each half a
Pound; and mix all together into an Ointment.

This is the common Ointment in the Itch, and all cutaneous Foulnesses. It
hardly ever fails of answering its End, if continued long enough, by anointing
every Night the Parts which break out, and wearing the same Linen all the
Time. Two or three Weeks is as little as can be depended upon; but it makes the
Patient smell very strong of it.

Misce S. A.

The Soldier's Ointment.
Take Rue, Marjoram, Rosemary, Thyme, Mint, Tancey, and Bays, each a sufficient
Quantity; cut them small, and mix together: then melt 10 Pound of Hogs-Lard,
and put in as many as possible of those Herbs, and boil till they become crisp;
then press them out hard, and to the strained Ointment add fresh Herbs, and
boil and strain as before; then put to it 1 Pound and half of Oil of
Turpentine, and 12 Ounces of Yellow Wax; which melt together for an Ointment.

This pretty much differs from the Medicine under the same Title in the College
Dispensatory, and is much preferable to it as a Digestive.

The Elder Ointment.
Take Green Elder Leaves, and Houseleek, each 2 Parts, and of the inward Bark
of Elder 1 Part; mix them together, and boil as much as possible in 10 Pound of
Hogs-lard to a crispness; then press it out hard, and boil a fresher Quantity
in the same Lard, and press out again; to the last putting 10 Pound of Yellow
Wax.

This is a good Cooler, and directed in Inflammations, and erysipelatous
Tumors; but it is to be used with Caution, for the Reasons given under the
Epulotick Ointment.

Unguent. ad Lepram.
Vnguenti Psorici lbj. Ol. Sulphuris j.
Misce.

The Leprosy Ointment.
Take of the Itch Ointment 1 Pound, and 1 Ounce of Oil of Sulphur, and mix them
together.

This is very sharp, and will scour off those sordid Incrustations, which
deform the Skin in a Leprosy: but it is not to be depended upon for a Cure by
it self.

Unguent. Pracip. alb.
Vng. Pomat. lbj. Praecipt. alb. ij.
Misce.

The White Precipitate Ointment.
Take Pomatum 1 Pound, and White Precipitate 2 Ounces; and mix them together
into an Ointment.

This is likewise directed for the Itch and Leprosy, and all such obstinate
Deformities of the Skin, and chiefly to the more nice Patients; but it is
hardly so certain as the common Itch Ointments, and is not so safe by much. It
is sometimes liable to raise a Salivation, where it is not expected.
