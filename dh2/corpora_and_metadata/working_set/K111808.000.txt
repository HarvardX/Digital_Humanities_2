Mr. ADDISON's FINE ODE TO Dr. Thomas Burnet, On His SACRED THEORY of the
EARTH. Done into English by the Author of a late TALE called COFFEE.

Nec Verbum Verbo curabis reddere, Fidus
Interpres. --
HOR. LONDON: Printed for T. WARNER, at the Black-Boy in Paternoster Row.
M.DCC.XXVII.

TO THE KING and QUEEN 's MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY'S.
SIR and MADAM!
THE noble System, of which Mr. Addison's incomparable Poem is an exact
Miniature; was graciously received, when formerly addressed to a KING and a
QUEEN, Your Royal Predecessors. Together with which Gentleman's most elegant
Epitome, my faint Copy of it is submissively offered at the Feet of BOTH Your
MAJESTY'S; that ONE in a well-tasted Dead-language, the OTHER in an obliged and
favored Living-one, may take a summary View of the Place of Your SECOND
Coronation; in happy Prelude to a THIRD, which Ye are farther to enjoy, in the
ultimate and beatific Receptacle of the JUST and GOOD. A presumptuous Wish,
that these grand Revolutions may, for your People's intermediate Advantage,
commence Late, must first ask Pardon; and, on that Dependence, is sincerely
professed to be the constant and fervent Prayer, of almost the Privatest amongst

Your MAJESTY'S Most Unfeigned, most Humble, And most Obedient Subjects.

AD INSIGNISSIMUM VIRUM, D. THOMAM BURNETTUM, SACRAE THEORIAE-TELLURIS AUTOREM.
NON usitatum Carminis alitem,
BURNETTE! poscis; non humiles Modos:
Vulgar Plectrum, languidaeque
Respuis officium Camoenae.
Tu mixta rerum Semina, conscius,
Molemque cernis dissociabilem;
Terramque concretam, and latentem
Oceanum Gremio capaci!
Dum, Veritatem quaerere pertinax,
Ignota pandis; Sollicitus parum,
Utcunque stet commune Vulgi
Arbitrium and popularis Error.
Auditur ingens continuo Fragor,
Illapsa Tellus lubrica deserit
Fundamina, and Compage fracta
Suppositas gravis urget Undas.
Impulsus erumpit medius Liquor,
Terras Aquarum effusa Licentia
Claudit vicissim; Has inter, Orbis
Reliquiae fluitant prioris.
Nunc and, recluso Carcere, lucidam
Balaena spectat Solis imaginem;
Stellasque miratur natantes,
Et tremulae simulacra Lunae.
Quae Pompa vocum non imitabilis!
Qualis calescit Spiritus ingeni!
Ut tollis Undas! Ut frementem
Diluvii reprimis Tumultum!
Quis tam valenti Pectore ferreus,
Ut non Tremiscens and timido Pede
Incedat; Orbis dum dolosi
Detegis instabiles Ruinas?
Quin haec cadentum Fragmina montium
Natura, Vultum sumere simplicem,
Coget refingens; in priorem
Mox iterum reditura Formam.
Nimbis rubentem sulphureis Jovem
Cernas! Ut udis saevit atrox Hyems
Incendiis, commune Mundo
Et Populis meditata Bustum!
Nudus liquentes plorat Athos Nives,
Et mox liquescens Ipse adamantinum
Fundit Cacumen; dum per imas
Saxa fluunt resoluta Valles.
Jamque alta Coeli Moenia corruunt:
Et vestra tandem Pagina (proh Nefas!)
BURNETTE, Vestra augebit Ignes;
Heu! socio peritura Mundo.
Mox aequa Tellus, mox subitus Viror
Ubique rident: En teretem Globum!
En laeta vernantis Favoni
Flamina, perpetuosque Flores!
O Pectus ingens! O Animum gravem,
Mundi capacem! Si bonus Auguror;
Te, nostra quo Tellus superbit!
Accipiet renovata Civem.
TO That GREAT-THINKER, Dr. THOMAS BURNET, On His SACRED THEORY of the EARTH.
NO usual Flight of Verse,
BURNET! no soft-strung Lyre,
No slack Neap-tide of Wit,
Thy high Demands require:
Thy Physiologic-Ken,
With Justice, may refuse
The insufficient Homage,
Of my Demi-Muse.
Thy curious Eye discerns
Seeds justling Seeds for Room,
The Mud-built Shell, and Seas
Within its spacious Womb.
In generous Search of Truth, Thou feel'st
No mean-soul'd Terror;
Scornful of Doctoral-Device,
Or Vulgar-Error.
But, Hark! the crumbling Crust,
Ill-propp'd, cracks loud asunder:
Mark next! Earth's headlong Plunge,
Amidst the Fluids under.
Imprisoned Waves, disturbed,
Start from their midland Bed;
And, with impetuous Rage,
Over their Oppressor spread.
Huge Fragments, shapeless Lumps,
Immanely float around;
Vast, hideous, Shatters
Of primigenial Ground!
The now free-wallowing Whale,
With all the finny Race;
Stare at the Sun, astonished
By his golden Face:
The silver Moon and Stars
Then gild the Watry-way,
And on its curling Surface
Tremulously play.
How strong thy Words! What must we
Thy Large-Genius call?
No Copy can come Up,
To thy Original.
Whence was the first Discov'ry,
Of thy Nostrum, made?
To bar again such Floodgates,
When once Open laid!
What Fears, what Jealousies,
Distract the thoughtful Head?
Since taught by Thee! our Feet
On faithless Ruins tread.
But still! this Rubbish, rescued
From Diluvian-Fate;
Kind Providence restores,
To it is primeval State.
Lo! the Grand-Architect,
In secondary Ire;
With altered Scheme refines
A Globe relapsed, by Fire.
From His consuming Torch;
This just Vindictive brings,
Inclusively, one Fun'ral-Pile
To Men and Things.
The lofty'st Alp, at first,
Grieved for it is dripping Ice;
Gutt'ring, at last, Itself
A molten Quarry lies.
And Now pour ratling-down,
In furious Career!
The sympathizing Rampires
Of the Atmosphere:
Thunder, and Lightning, Lambents,
Hail, Wind, Rain, and Snow;
With all the aspiring Train,
Of Meteors from below.
Into the common Blaze,
Then will thy TOMES be hurled;
Impossible to fail,
Till jointly with the World!
Here shifts the Scene; Now cease
All sublunary Toils;
On a re-level'd Orb,
A sudden Verdure smiles!
A constant Equinox maintains
Perpetual Spring,
And virtuous Minds Ideas
Of Contentment sing.
The Architect well-pleased,
While West-winds balm the Air,
Desists; and lastly says: Behold!
The Work is Fair.
What now, Immense Cosmographer!
To Thee is due?
Distanc'd I stop; -- But, if
My Prophecy be true:
There Paradise-regain'd,
Unknowing Care or Want;
Shall, like our Earth, be proud
Of Thee it is Habitant.
And may Thou there in pure Devotions join,
With glorious GEORGE, and beauteous CAROLINE!
WHO, far as the Materials will bear,
Labor to constitute an EDEN here;
By steadily bestowing their Commands,
On best-computing Heads, and best-performing Hands.
FINIS.
