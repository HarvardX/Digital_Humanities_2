ESTHER, AN ORATORIO, OR, SACRED DRAMA.
ACT I.
SCENE I.
ESTHER, MORDECAI, and CHORUS of ISRAELITES. RECITATIVE, accompanied.

And heavenly Peace reside in Esther's Soul.
AIR.
Watchful Angels, let her share
Your indulgent, daily Care.
RECITATIVE.

Whose Works our Admiration raise,
With Rapture shall my Lips record,
Thy Majesty's immortal Praise.
Hallelujah.
SCENE II.
HAMAN, HABDONAH, and OFFICERS. RECITATIVE.


All the Jewish Race shall bleed.
Hear and obey, what Haman's Voice commands;
Has not the Lord of all the East,
Given all his Power into my Hands?
Hear all ye Nations far and wide,
Which own our Monarch's Sway,
Hear and obey:
AIR.
Pluck Root and Branch from out the Land,
Shall I the God of Israel fear?
Let Jewish Blood dye every Hand,
Nor Age, nor Sex I Will spare.
Raze, raze, their Temples to the Ground,
And let their place no more be found.
Our Souls with Ardour glow,
To execute the Blow.
CHORUS.
Shall we the God of Israel fear?
Nor Age, nor Sex we'll spare.
Pluck Root and Branch from out the Land.
SCENE III.
Jerusalem no more shall mourn,
In sad Captivity forlorn:
The righteous God, in whom we trust,
Will be propitious to the Just.
To rapture then your Voices raise,
And change your Sighs to Songs of Praise.
AIR.
Tune your Harps to cheerful Strains,
Moulder idols into Dust;
Great Jehovah lives and reigns,
We in great Jehovah trust.
DA CAPO. AIR.
Praise the Lord with cheerful Noise,
Wake my Glory, wake my Lyre;
Praise the Lord each mortal Voice;
Praise the Lord ye heavenly Choir.
Zion now her Head shall raise,
Tune your Harps to Songs of praise.
DA CAPO. CHORUS.
Shall we of Servitude complain,
The heavy Yoke and galling Chain?
SCENE IV.
RECITATIVE.

Wild persecution has unsheathed the Sword,
Haman has sent forth his Decree;
The Sons of Israel all
Shall in one Ruin fall.
Methinks I hear the Mother' s Groans,
While Babes are dashed against the Stones.
I hear the Infant's shriller Screams,
Stabbed at the Mother's Breast,
Blood stains the Murderer's Vest,
And through the City flows in Streams.
AIR.
O Jordan, Jordan, sacred Tide!
Shall we no more behold thee glide
The fertile Vales along,
As in our great forefather's Days?
Shall not thy Hills resound thy Praise,
And learn our holy Song.
DA CAPO. CHORUS.
Ye Sons of Israel mourn,
Ye never to your Country shall return.
END of the First ACT.
ACT II.
SCENE I.
ESTHER and CHORUS of ISRAELITES. CHORUS.
TYRANTS may a while presume,
They never shall receive their Doom;
But they soon shall trembling know,
Stern Justice strikes the surest Blow.
SCENE II.
MORDECAI, ESTHER. RECITATIVE.

Why is thy reverend Head
With mournful Ashes spread?
Why is that humble Sackcloth worn;
Speak, Mordecai, my Kinsman, Friend;
Speak, and let Esther know
Why all this solemn Woe.

Haman's Decree,
To strike at me,
Has said, that every Jew shall fall:
Go stand before the King with weeping Eye.


Trust to the Almighty, and be brave.
Why were thou raised to Persia's Throne?
Not for thy Sake alone.
Dread not righteous Queen the Danger,
Love will pacify his Anger;
Fear is due to God alone:
Follow great Jehovah's calling,
For thy Kindred's Safety falling;
Death is better than a Throne.
DA CAPO. RECITATIVE.

O! may that Grief Compassion move.
AIR.
Tears assist me, Pity moving,
Justice cruel Fraud reproving;
Hear, O God! thy Servant's Prayer:
Is it Blood that must atone?
Take, O take my Life alone,
And thy chosen People spare!
CHORUS.
ANTHEM.
As Pants the Heart for cooling Streams,
So longs my Soul for thee O God!
SOLO.
Tears are my daily Food,
While thus they say,
Where is now thy God.
SOLO.
Now, when I think thereupon, I pour out my Heart by myself;
For I went with the Multitude, and brought them forth into the House of God.
CHORUS.
In the Voice of Praise and Thanksgiving, among such as keep Holy Day.
DUET.
Why so full of Grief, O my Soul: why so disquieted within me?
CHORUS.
Put thy Trust in God, for I will Praise him.
SCENE IV.
AHASUERUS, ESTHER, and CHORUS of Israelites.
Without our Leave!
It is decreed,
He dies for this audacious Deed.
Hah! Esther there!
The Law condemns, but Love will spare.


Esther awake, thou fairest of thy Race;
Awake and live, it is my Command,
Behold the golden Scepter in my Hand!
Sure Sign of Grace;
The bloody stern Decree
Was never meant, my Queen, to strike at thee.
DUET.
Who calls my parting Soul from Death?
Awake, my Soul, my Life, my Breath,
Hear my Suit, or else I die.
Ask my Queen, can I deny?
SONG.
O beauteous Queen, unclose those Eyes,
My fairest shall not bleed:
Hear Love's soft Voice that bids thee rise,
And bids thy Suit succeed.
Ask, and it is granted from this Hour,
Who shares our Heart, shall share our Power.
RECITATIVE.

May the great Monarch of the East
Honor my Feast,
And deign to be his Servant's Guest;
The King and Haman I invite.
AIR.
How can I stay when Love invites!
I come my Queen to chaste Delights.
With Joy, with Pleasure, I obey;
To thee I give the Day.
DA CAPO. Exeunt. SCENE IV.
Manent ISRAELITES.
He to the Queen's Apartment goes.
Beauty has his Fury charmed,
And all his Wrath disarmed.
AIR.
Heaven has lent her every Charm
Rising Fury to disarm
And the Monarch's Breast will prove,
That each Passion yields to Love.
CHORUS.
ANTHEM.
The King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord!
Exceeding glad shall he be of thy Salvation.
DUET and CHORUS.
His Honor is great in thy Salvation:
Glory and great Worship shall thou lay upon him.
CHORUS.
We will rejoice in thy Salvation, and triumph
In the Name of the Lord our God.
Hallelujah.
END of the Second ACT.
ACT III.
SCENE I.
MORDECAI and CHORUS of ISRAELITES. RECITATIVE.

Surrounded with eternal Light,
Whose Ministers are Flames of Fire,
Arise and execute thine Ire.
CHORUS.
He comes! he comes to end our Woes,
And pour his Vengeance on our Foes.
Earth trembles, lofty Mountains nod;
Jacob arise and meet thy God.
SCENE III.

Ask half my Empire, and it is thine.

For in their Lives, you strike at mine;
Reverse the dire Decree,
The Blow is aimed at Mordecai and Me:
And is the Fate of Mordecai decreed,
Who, when the Ruffian's Sword
Sought to destroy my royal Lord,
Brought forth to Light the desperate Deed!

I owe my Life and Throne:
Say then, my Queen, who dares pursue
The Life to which Reward is due.
Haman's Hate
That signed his Fate.

Which rules the Day,
That Haman's Sight
Shall never more behold the golden Ray!
AIR.
Turn not, O Queen, thy Face away,
Behold me prostrate on the Ground!
O speak, his glowing Fury stay,
Let Mercy in thy Sight be found.
AIR.
Flattering Tongue, no more I Will hear thee,
Vain are all thy cruel Wiles:
Bloody Wretch, no more I fear thee,
Vain thy Frowns, and vain thy Smiles.
Tyrant, when of Power possessed;
Now thou tremblest when distressed.
DA CAPO. RECITATIVE.

Death shall Reward the dire Offense;
To Mordecai be Honor paid;
The Royal Garment bring.
My Diadem shall grace his Head;
Let him in Triumph through the Streets be led,
Who saved the King.
AIR.
Through the Nation he shall be
Next in Dignity to me;
All my People shall revere
Merit to their Prince so dear.
Daily to his honored Name,
Incense shall on Altars flame.
CHORUS.
All applauding Crowds around
Shall his deathless Fame resound.
AIR.
How art thou fallen from thy Height!
Tremble Ambition at the Sight,
In Power let Mercy sway.
When adverse Fortune is thy Lot,
Lest thou by Mercy be forgot,
And perish in that Day.
DA CAPO. AIR and DUET.
I Will proclaim the wondrous story,
Of the mercies I receive:
From the Day spring's dawning glory,
'Till the fading Day of Eve.
All the blessings Heaven is lending,
We'll defend, our grateful lays
To his radiant Throne ascending,
Wasted on the wings of Praise.
In exalted raptures joining,
We'll employ our happy days;
All our grateful powers combining,
To declare his endless praise.
SCENE III.
ISRAELITES with MORDECAI in Triumph. GRAND CHORUS.
The Lord our Enemy has slain;
Hallelujah, Solo.
Ye Sons of Jacob sing a cheerful Strain.
Hallelujah.
Sing Songs of Praise, bow down the Knee,
Hallelujah.
The Worship of our God is free.
Hallelujah.
For ever blessed be his holy Name,
Let Heaven and Earth his Praise proclaim.
Hallelujah.
FINIS.
