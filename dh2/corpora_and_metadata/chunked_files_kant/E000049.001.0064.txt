that can be so called and not a thing however then men may laugh at the stoic who in the severest paroxysms of gout cried out pain however thou tormentest me i will never admit that thou art an evil κακόν malum he was right a bad thing it certainly was and his cry betrayed that but that any evil attached to him thereby this he had no reason whatever to admit for pain did not in the least diminish the worth of his person but only that of his condition if he had been conscious of a single lie it would have lowered his pride but pain served only to raise it when he was conscious that he had not deserved it by any unrighteous action by which he had rendered himself worthy of punishment what we call good must be an object of desire in the judgment of every rational man and evil an object of aversion in the eyes of everyone therefore in addition to sense this judgment requires reason so it is with truthfulness as opposed to lying so with justice as opposed to violence c but we may call a thing a bad or ill thing which yet everyone must at the same time acknowledge to be good sometimes directly sometimes indirectly the man who submits to a surgical operation feels it no doubt as a bad ill thing but by their reason he and everyone acknowledge it to be good if a man who delights in annoying and vexing peaceable people at last receives a right good beating this is no doubt a bad ill thing but everyone approves it and regards it as a good thing even though nothing else resulted from it nay even the man who receives it must in his reason acknowledge that he has met justice because he sees the proportion between good conduct and good fortune which reason inevitably places before him here put into practice no doubt our weal and woe are of very great importance in the estimation of our practical reason and as far as our nature as sensible beings is concerned our happiness is the only thing of consequence provided it is estimated as reason especially requires not by the transitory sensation but by the influence that this has on our whole existence and on our satisfaction therewith but it is not absolutely the only thing of consequence man is a being who as belonging to the world of sense has wants and so far his reason has an office which it can not refuse namely to attend to the interest of his sensible nature and to form practical maxims even with a view to the happiness of this life and if possible even to that of a future but he is not so completely an animal as to be indifferent to what reason says on its own account and to use it merely as an instrument for the satisfaction of his wants as a sensible being for the possession of reason would not raise his worth above that of the brutes if it is observe serve him only for the same purpose that instinct serves in them it would in that case be only a particular method which nature had employed to equip man for the same ends for which it has qualified brutes without qualifying him for any higher purpose no doubt once this arrangement of nature has been made for him he requires reason in order to take into consideration his weal and woe but besides this he possesses it for a higher purpose also namely not only to take into consideration what is good or evil in itself about which only pure reason uninfluenced by any sensible interest can judge but also to distinguish this estimate thoroughly from the former and to make it the supreme condition thereof in estimating what is good or evil in itself as distinguished from what can be so called only relatively the following points are to be considered either a rational principle is already conceived as of itself the determining principle of the will without regard to possible objects of desire and therefore by the mere legislative form of the maxim and in that case that principle is a practical à priori law and pure reason is supposed to be practical of itself the law in that case determines the will directly the action conformed to it is good in itself a will whose maxim always conforms to this law is good absolutely in every respect and is the supreme condition of all good or the maxim of the will is consequent on a determining principle of desire which presupposes an object of pleasure or pain something therefore that pleases or displeases and the maxim of reason that we should pursue the former and avoid the latter determines our actions as good relatively to our inclination that is good indirectly i e relatively to a different end to which they are means and in that case these maxims can never be called laws but may be called rational practical precepts the end itself the pleasure that we seek is in the latter case not a good but a welfare not a concept of reason but an empirical concept of an object of sensation but the use of the means thereto that is the action is nevertheless called good because rational deliberation is required for it not however good absolutely but only relatively to our sensuous nature with regard to its feelings of pleasure and displeasure but the will whose maxim is affected thereby is not a pure will this is directed only to that in which pure reason by itself can be practical this is the proper place to explain the paradox of method in a critique of practical reason namely that the concept of good and evil must not be determined before the moral law of which it seems as if it must
