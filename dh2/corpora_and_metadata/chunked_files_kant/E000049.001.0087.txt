the action is to contain morality and not merely legality inclination is blind and slavish whether it be of a good sort or not and when morality is in question reason must not play the part merely of guardian to inclination but disregarding it altogether must attend simply to its own interest as pure practical reason this very feeling of compassion and tender sympathy if it precedes the deliberation on the question of duty and becomes a determining principle is even annoying to rightthinking persons brings their deliberate maxims into confusion and makes them wish to be delivered from it and to be subject to lawgiving reason alone from this we can understand how the consciousness of this faculty of a pure practical reason produces by action virtue a consciousness of mastery over ones inclinations and therefore of independence on them and consequently also on the discontent that always accompanies them and thus a negative satisfaction with ones state i e contentment which is primarily contentment with ones own person freedom itself becomes in this way namely indirectly capable of an enjoyment which can not be called happiness because it does not depend on the positive concurrence of a feeling nor is it strictly speaking bliss since it does not include complete independence on inclinations and wants but it resembles bliss in so far as the determination of ones will at least can hold itself free from their influence and thus at least in its origin this enjoyment is analogous to the selfsufficiency which we can ascribe only to the supreme being from this solution of the antinomy of pure practical reason it follows that in practical principles we may at least conceive as possible a natural and necessary connexion between the consciousness of morality and the expectation of a proportionate happiness as its result though it does not follow that we can know or perceive this connexion that on the other hand principles of the pursuit of happiness can not possibly produce morality that therefore morality is the supreme good as the first condition of the summum bonum while happiness constitutes its second element but only in such a way that it is the morally conditioned but necessary consequence of the former only with this subordination is the summum bonum the whole object of pure practical reason which must necessarily conceive it as possible since it commands us to contribute to the utmost of our power to its realization but since the possibility of such connexion of the conditioned with its condition belongs wholly to the supersensual relation of things and can not be given according to the laws of the world of sense although the practical consequences of the idea belong to the world of sense namely the actions that aim at realizing the summum bonum we will therefore endeavour to set forth the grounds of that possibility first in respect of what is immediately in our power and then secondly in that which is not in our power but which reason presents to us as the supplement of our impotence for the realization of the summum bonum which by practical principles is necessary iii —of the primacy of pure practical reason in its union with the speculative reason by primacy between two or more things connected by reason i understand the prerogative belonging to one of being the first determining principle in the connexion with all the rest in a narrower practical sense it means the prerogative of the interest of one in so far as the interest of the other is subordinated to it while it is not postponed to any other to every faculty of the mind we can attribute an interest that is a principle that contains the condition on which alone the former is called into exercise reason as the faculty of principles determines 0 the interest of all the powers of the mind and is determined by its own the interest of its speculative employment consists in the cognition of the object pushed to the highest à priori principles that of its practical employment in the determination of the will in respect of the final and complete end as to what is necessary for the possibility of any employment of reason at all namely that its principles and affirmations should not contradict one another this constitutes no part of its interest but is the condition of having reason at all it is only its development not mere consistency with itself that is reckoned as its interest if practical reason could not assume or think as given anything further than what speculative reason of itself could offer it from its own insight the latter would have the primacy but supposing that it had of itself original à priori principles with which certain theoretical positions were inseparably connected while these were withdrawn from any possible insight of speculative reason which however they must not contradict then the question is which interest is the superior not which must give way for they are not necessarily conflicting whether speculative reason which knows nothing of all that the practical offers for its acceptance should take up these propositions and although they transcend it try to unite them with its own concepts as a foreign possession handed over to it or whether it is justified in obstinately following its own separate interest and according to the canonic of epicurus rejecting as vain subtlety everything that can not accredit its objective reality by manifest examples to be shown in experience even though it should be never so much interwoven with the interest of the practical pure use of reason and in itself not contradictory to the theoretical merely because it infringes on the interest of the speculative reason to this extent that it removes the bounds which this latter had set to itself and gives it up to every nonsense or delusion of imagination in fact so far as practical reason is taken as dependent on pathological conditions that
