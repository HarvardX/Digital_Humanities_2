in this idea of the absolute value of the mere will in which no account is taken of its utility that notwithstanding the thorough assent of even common reason to the idea yet a suspicion must arise that it may perhaps really be the product of mere highflown fancy and that we may have misunderstood the purpose of nature in assigning reason as the governor of our will therefore we will examine this idea from this point of view in the physical constitution of an organized being that is a being adapted suitably to the purposes of life we assume it as a fundamental principle that no organ for any purpose will be found but what is also the fittest and best adapted for that purpose now in a being which has reason and a will if the proper object of nature were its conservation its welfare in a word its happiness then nature would have hit upon a very bad arrangement in selecting the reason of the creature to carry out this purpose for all the actions which the creature has to perform with a view to this purpose and the whole rule of its conduct would be far more surely prescribed to it by instinct and that end would have been attained thereby much more certainly than it ever can be by reason should reason have been communicated to this favoured creature over and above it must only have served it to contemplate the happy constitution of its nature to admire it to congratulate itself thereon and to feel thankful for it to the beneficent cause but not that it should subject its desires to that weak and delusive guidance and meddle bunglingly with the purpose of nature in a word nature would have taken care that reason should not break forth into practical exercise nor have the presumption with its weak insight to think out for itself the plan of happiness and of the means of attaining it nature would not only have taken on herself the choice of the ends but also of the means and with wise foresight would have entrusted both to instinct and in fact we find that the more a cultivated reason applies itself with deliberate purpose to the enjoyment of life and happiness so much the more does the man fail of true satisfaction and from this circumstance there arises in many if they are candid enough to confess it a certain degree of misology that is hatred of reason especially in the case of those who are most experienced in the use of it because after calculating all the advantages they derive i do not say from the invention of all the arts of common luxury but even from the sciences which seem to them to be after all only a luxury of the understanding they find that they have in fact only brought more trouble on their shoulders rather than gained in happiness and they end by envying rather than despising the more common stamp of men who keep closer to the guidance of mere instinct and do not allow their reason much influence on their conduct and this we must admit that the judgment of those who would very much lower the lofty eulogies of the advantages which reason gives us in regard to the happiness and satisfaction of life or who would even reduce them below zero is by no means morose or ungrateful to the goodness with which the world is governed but that there lies at the root of these judgments the idea that our existence has a different and far nobler end for which and not for happiness reason is properly intended and which must therefore be regarded as the supreme condition to which the private ends of man must for the most part be postponed for as reason is not competent to guide the will with certainty in regard to its objects and the satisfaction of all our wants which it to some extent even multiplies this being an end to which an implanted instinct would have led with much greater certainty and since nevertheless reason is imparted to us as a practical faculty ie as one which is to have influence on the will therefore admitting that nature generally in the distribution of her capacities has adapted the means to the end its true destination must be to produce a will not merely good as a means to something else but good in itself for which reason was absolutely necessary this will then though not indeed the sole and complete good must be the supreme good and the condition of every other even of the desire of happiness under these circumstances there is nothing inconsistent with the wisdom of nature in the fact that the cultivation of the reason which is requisite for the first and unconditional purpose does in many ways interfere at least in this life with the attainment of the second which is always conditional namely happiness nay it may even reduce it to nothing without nature thereby failing of her purpose for reason recognises the establishment of a good will as its highest practical destination and in attaining this purpose is capable only of a satisfaction of its own proper kind namely that from the attainment of an end which end again is determined by reason only notwithstanding that this may involve many a disappointment to the ends of inclination we have then to develop the notion of a will which deserves to be highly esteemed for itself and is good without a view to anything further a notion which exists already in the sound natural understanding requiring rather to be cleared up than to be taught and which in estimating the value of our actions always takes the first place and constitutes the condition of all the rest in order to do this we will take the notion of duty which includes that of a good will
