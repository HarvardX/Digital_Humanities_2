will to the law yet combined with an inevitable constraint put upon all inclinations though only by our own reason is respect for the law the law that demands this respect and inspires it is clearly no other than the moral for no other precludes all inclinations from exercising any direct influence on the will an action which is objectively practical according to this law to the exclusion of every determining principle of inclination is duty and this by reason of that exclusion includes in its concept practical obligation that is a determination to actions however reluctantly they may be done the feeling that arises from the consciousness of this obligation is not pathological as would be a feeling produced by an object of the senses but practical only that is it is made possible by a preceding 0 objective determination of the will and a causality of the reason as submission to the law therefore that is as a command announcing constraint for the sensibly affected subject it contains in it no pleasure but on the contrary so far pain in the action on the other hand however as this constraint is exercised merely by the legislation of our own reason it also contains something elevating and this subjective effect on feeling inasmuch as pure practical reason is the sole cause of it may be called in this respect selfapprobation since we recognize ourselves as determined thereto solely by the law without any interest and are now conscious of a quite different interest subjectively produced thereby and which is purely practical and free and our taking this interest in an action of duty is not suggested by any inclination but is commanded and actually brought about by reason through the practical law whence this feeling obtains a special name that of respect the notion of duty therefore requires in the action objectively agreement with the law and subjectively in its maxim that respect for the law shall be the sole mode in which the will is determined thereby and on this rests the distinction between the consciousness of having acted according to duty and from duty that is from respect for the law the former legality is possible even if inclinations have been the determining principles of the will but the latter morality moral worth can be placed only in this that the action is done from duty that is simply for the sake of the law 0 it is of the greatest importance to attend with the utmost exactness in all moral judgments to the subjective principle of all maxims that all the morality of actions may be placed in the necessity of acting from duty and from respect for the law not from love and inclination for that which the actions are to produce for men and all created rational beings moral necessity is constraint that is obligation and every action based on it is to be conceived as a duty not as a proceeding previously pleasing or likely to be pleasing to us of our own accord as if indeed we could ever bring it about that without respect for the law which implies fear or at least apprehension of transgression we of ourselves like the independent deity could ever come into possession of holiness of will by the coincidence of our will with the pure moral law becoming as it were part of our nature never to be shaken in which case the law would cease to be a command for us as we could never be tempted to be untrue to it the moral law is in fact for the will of a perfect being a law of holiness but for the will of every finite rational being a law of duty of moral constraint and of the determination of its actions by respect for this law and reverence for its duty no other subjective principle must be assumed as a motive else while the action might chance to be such as the law prescribes yet as it does not proceed from duty the intention which is the thing properly in question in this legislation is not moral 0 it is a very beautiful thing to do good to men from love to them and from sympathetic good will or to be just from love of order but this is not yet the true moral maxim of our conduct which is suitable to our position amongst rational beings as men when we pretend with fanciful pride to set ourselves above the thought of duty like volunteers and as if we were independent on the command to want to do of our own good pleasure what we think we need no command to do we stand under a discipline of reason and in all our maxims must not forget our subjection to it nor withdraw anything therefrom or by an egotistic presumption diminish aught of the authority of the law although our own reason gives it so as to set the determining principle of our will even though the law be conformed to anywhere else but in the law itself and in respect for this law duty and obligation are the only names that we must give to our relation to the moral law we are indeed legislative members of a moral kingdom rendered possible by freedom and presented to us by reason as an object of respect but yet we are subjects in it not the sovereign and to mistake our inferior position as creatures and presumptuously to reject the authority of the moral law is already to revolt from it in spirit even though the letter of it is fulfilled with this agrees very well the possibility of such a command as love god above everything and thy neighbour as thyself for as a command it requires respect for a law 0 which commands love and does not leave it to our own arbitrary choice to make this our principle love to god
