forced by the mere idea of duty so much the freer he is the man for example who is of sufficiently firm resolution and strong mind not to give up an enjoyment which he has resolved on however much loss is shown as resulting therefrom and who yet desists from his purpose unhesitatingly though very reluctantly when he finds that it would cause him to neglect an official duty or a sick father this man proves his freedom in the highest degree by this very thing that he can not resist the voice of duty leonhard cochius court preacher who obtained the prize of the berlin academy for his essay über die neigungen berlin object first ed usage gives it a strong meaning perhaps from euphemism whatever i judge reasonable or unreasonable for another to do for me that by the same judgment i declare reasonable or unreasonable that i in the like case do for him—clarkes discourse etc p editor illegible number ed this agrees with dr adams definition of virtue which he says implies trial and conflict he defines it the conformity of imperfect beings to the dictates of reason other english moralists use virtue in the sense of aristotles ἀρετή hence a difference more verbal than real as to the relation of virtue to selfdenial kant here and elsewhere uses deduction in a technical legal sense there is deductio facti and deductio juris kants deduction is exclusively the latter the supreme principle of jurisprudence is act externally so that the free use of thy elective will may not interfere with the freedom of any man so far as it agrees with universal law—rechtslehre p so that one might vary two wellknown lines of haller thus— with all his failings man is still better than angels void of will hallers lines occur in the poem ueber den urfprung bes uebels— dann gott liebt seinen zwang die welt mit ihren mangeln ift besser als ein reich von willenlofen engeln on conscience compare the note at the end of this introduction the common classical formulæ of ethics—medio tutissimus ibis omne nimium vertitur in vitium est modus in rebus c medium tenuere beati virtus est medium vitiorum et utrinque reductum—contain a poor sort of wisdom which has no definite principles for this mean between two extremes who will assign it for me avarice as a vice is not distinguished from frugality as a virtue by merely being the latter pushed too far but has a quite different principle maxim namely placing the end of economy not in the enjoyment of ones means but in the mere possession of them renouncing enjoyment just as the vice of prodigality is not to be sought in the excessive enjoyment of ones means but in the bad maxim which makes the use of them without regard to their maintenance the sole end the assertion that we should do nothing either too little or too much means nothing for it is tautological what is it to do too much answer—more than is right what is it to do too little answer—to do less than is right what is the meaning of i ought to do something or leave it undone answer—it is not right against duty to do more or less than is right if that is the wisdom for which we must go back to the ancients to aristotle as if they were nearer the source we have chosen ill in turning to their oracle between truth and falsehood which are contradictories there is no mean there may be however between frankness and reserve which are contraries in the case of the man who declares his opinion all that he says is true but he does not say all the truth now it is very natural to ask the moral teacher to point out to me this mean this however he can not do for both duties have a certain latitude in their application and the right thing to do can only be decided by the judgment according to rules of prudence pragmatical rules not those of morality moral rules that is to say not as strict duty officium strictum but as indeterminate officium latum hence the man who follows the principles of virtue may indeed commit a fault peccatum in his practice in doing more or less than prudence prescribes but adhering strictly to these principles he does not commit a vice vitium and the verse of horace— insani sapiens nomen ferat æquus iniqui ultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam— literally understood is fundamentally false but perhaps sapiens here means only a prudent man who does not form a chimerical notion of virtuous perfection this perfection being an ideal demands approximation to this end but not the complete attainment of it which surpasses human powers and introduces absurdity chimerical imagination into its principle for to be quite too virtuous that is to be quite too devoted to duty would be about the same as to speak of making a circle quite too round or a straight line quite too straight—tugendlehre p note in a footnote kant explains this double personality of a man as both the accuser and the judge by reference to the homo noumenon and its specific difference from the rationally endowed homo sensibilis aetas parentum pejor avis tulit nos nequiores mox daturos progeniem vitiosiorem horatius one of rousseaus earliest literary efforts was on this subject which had been proposed for discussion by the academy of dijon he defended the thesis that the advance in science and arts was not favourable to morals kants own view is stated thus in the treatise das mag in der theorie u s w publ in he is commenting on mendelssohn who had treated lessings hypothesis of a divine education of mankind as a delusion saying that the human race never made a few steps forward without presently after slipping back with redoubled velocity into its former position this says kant is like the
