making their happiness his own we might call it the sweet merit the consciousness of which creates a moral 0 enjoyment in which men are by sympathy inclined to rerel whereas the bitter merit of promoting the true welfare of other men even though they should not recognize it as such in the case of the unthankful and ungrateful has commonly no such reaction but only produces a satisfaction with ones self although in the latter case this would be even greater viii —exposition of the duties of virtue as indeterminate duties our own perfection as an end which is also a duty a physical perfection that is cultivation of all our faculties generally for the promotion of the ends set before us by reason that this is a duty and therefore an end in itself and that the effort to effect this even without regard to the advantage that it secures us is based not on a conditional pragmatic but an unconditional moral imperative may be seen from the following consideration the power of proposing to ourselves an end is the characteristic of humanity as distinguished from the brutes with the end of humanity in our own person is therefore combined the rational will vernunftwille and consequently the duty of deserving well of humanity by culture generally by acquiring or advancing the power to carry out all sorts of possible ends so far as this power is to be found in man that is it is a duty to cultivate the crude capacities of our nature since it is by that cultivation that the animal is raised to man therefore it is a duty in itself this duty however is merely ethical that is of indeterminate obligation no principle of reason prescribes how far one must go in this effort in enlarging or correcting his faculty of understanding that is in acquisition of knowledge or technical capacity and besides the difference in the circumstances into which men may come makes the choice of the kind of employment for which he should cultivate his talent very arbitrary here therefore there is no law of reason for actions but only for the maxim of actions viz cultivate thy faculties of mind and body so as to be effective for all ends that may come in thy way uncertain which of them may become thy own 0 b cultivation of morality in ourselves the greatest moral perfection of man is to do his duty and that from duty that the law be not only the rule but also the spring of his actions now at first sight this seems to be a strict obligation and as if the principle of duty commanded not merely the legality of every action but also the morality i e the mental disposition with the exactness and strictness of a law but in fact the law commands even here only the maxim of the action namely that we should seek the ground of obligation not in the sensible impulses advantage or disadvantage but wholly in the law so that the action itself is not commanded for it is not possible to man to see so far into the depth of his own heart that he could ever be thoroughly certain of the purity of his moral purpose and the sincerity of his mind even in one single action although he has no doubt about the legality of it nay often the weakness which deters a man from the risk of a crime is regarded by him as virtue which gives the notion of strength and how many there are who may have led a long blameless life who are only fortunate in having escaped so many temptations how much of the element of pure morality in their mental disposition may have belonged to each deed remains hidden even from themselves accordingly this duty to estimate the worth of ones actions not merely by their legality but also by their morality mental disposition is only of indeterminate obligation the law does not command this internal action in the human mind itself but only the maxim of the action namely that we should strive with all our power that for all dutiful actions the thought of duty should be of itself an adequate spring happiness of others as an end which is also a duty a physical welfare—benevolent wishes may be unlimited for they do not imply doing anything but the case is more difficult with benevolent action especially when this is to be done not from friendly inclination love to others but from duty at the expense of the sacrifice and mortification of many of our appetites that this beneficence is a duty results from 0 this that since our selflove can not be separated from the need to be loved by others to obtain help from them in case of necessity 0 we therefore make ourselves an end for others and this maxim can never be obligatory except by having the specific character of a universal law and consequently by means of a will that we should also make others our ends hence the happiness of others is an end that is also a duty i am only bound then to sacrifice to others a part of my welfare without hope of recompense because it is my duty and it is impossible to assign definite limits how far that may go much depends on what would be the true want of each according to his own feelings and it must be left to each to determine this for himself for that one should sacrifice his own happiness his true wants in order to promote that of others would be a selfcontradictory maxim if made a universal law this duty therefore is only indeterminate it has a certain latitude within which one may do more or less without our being able to assign its limits definitely the law holds only for the maxims not for definite actions b
