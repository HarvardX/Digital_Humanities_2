in the smallest degree then rather to adopt the method of making this a separate inquiry as pure practical philosophy or if one may use a name so decried as metaphysic of morals to bring it by itself to completeness and to require the public which wishes for popular treatment to await the issue of this undertaking such a metaphysic of morals completely isolated not mixed with any anthropology theology physics or hyperphysics and still less with occult qualities which we might call hypophysical is not only an indispensable substratum of all sound theoretical knowledge of duties but is at the same time a desideratum of the highest importance to the actual fulfilment of their precepts for the pure conception of duty unmixed with any foreign addition of empirical attractions and in a word the conception of the moral law exercises on the human heart by way of reason alone which first becomes aware with this that it can of itself be practical an influence so much more powerful than all other springs which may be derived from the field of experience that in the consciousness of its worth it despises the latter and can by degrees become their master whereas a mixed ethics compounded partly of motives drawn from feelings and inclinations and partly also of conceptions of reason must make the mind waver between motives which can not be brought under any principle which lead to good only by mere accident and very often also to evil from what has been said it is clear that all moral conceptions have their seat and origin completely Ã  priori in the reason and that moreover in the commonest reason just as truly as in that which is in the highest degree speculative that they can not be obtained by abstraction from any empirical and therefore merely contingent knowledge that it is just this purity of their origin that makes them worthy to serve as our supreme practical principle and that just in proportion as we add anything empirical we detract from their genuine influence and from the absolute value of actions that it is not only of the greatest necessity in a purely speculative point of view but is also of the greatest practical importance to derive these notions and laws from pure reason to present them pure and unmixed and even to determine the compass of this practical or pure rational knowledge i e to determine the whole faculty of pure practical reason and in doing so we must not make its principles dependent on the particular nature of human reason though in speculative philosophy this may be permitted or may even at times be necessary but since moral laws ought to hold good for every rational creature we must derive them from the general concept of a rational being in this way although for its application to man morality has need of anthropology yet in the first instance we must treat it independently as pure philosophy i e as metaphysic complete in itself a thing which in such distinct branches of science is easily done knowing well that unless we are in possession of this it would not only be vain to determine the moral element of duty in right actions for purposes of speculative criticism but it would be impossible to base morals on their genuine principles even for common practical purposes especially of moral instruction so as to produce pure moral dispositions and to engraft them on mens minds to the promotion of the greatest possible good in the world but in order that in this study we may not merely advance by the natural steps from the common moral judgment in this case very worthy of respect to the philosophical as has been already done but also from a popular philosophy which goes no further than it can reach by groping with the help of examples to metaphysic which does not allow itself to be checked by anything empirical and as it must measure the whole extent of this kind of rational knowledge goes as far as ideal conceptions where even examples fail us we must follow and clearly describe the practical faculty of reason from the general rules of its determination to the point where the notion of duty springs from it everything in nature works according to laws rational beings alone have the faculty of acting according to the conception of laws that is according to principles i e have a will since the deduction of actions from principles requires reason the will is nothing but practical reason if reason infallibly determines the will then the actions of such a being which are recognised as objectively necessary are subjectively necessary also i e the will is a faculty to choose that only which reason independent on inclination recognises as practically necessary i e as good but if reason of itself does not sufficiently determine the will if the latter is subject also to subjective conditions particular impulses which do not always coincide with the objective conditions in a word if the will does not in itself completely accord with reason which is actually the case with men then the actions which objectively are recognised as necessary are subjectively contingent and the determination of such a will 0 according to objective laws is obligation that is to say the relation of the objective laws to a will that is not thoroughly good is conceived as the determination of the will of a rational being by principles of reason but which the will from its nature does not of necessity follow the conception of an objective principle in so far as it is obligatory for a will is called a command of reason and the formula of the command is called an imperative all imperatives are expressed by the word ought or shall and thereby indicate the relation of an objective law of reason to a will which from its subjective constitution is not necessarily
