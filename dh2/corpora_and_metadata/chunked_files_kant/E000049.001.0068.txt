only so far as it is inseparably implied in that law and moreover all supersensible objects to which reason might lead us following the guidance of that law have still no reality for us except for the purpose of that law and for the use of mere practical reason and as reason is authorized and even compelled to use physical nature in its pure form as an object of the understanding as the type of the judgment hence the present remark will serve to guard against reckoning amongst concepts themselves that which belongs only to the typic of concepts this namely as a typic of the judgment guards against the empiricism of practical reason which founds the practical notions of good and evil merely on experienced consequences so called happiness no doubt happiness and the infinite advantages which would result from a will determined by selflove if this will at the same time erected itself into a universal law of nature may certainly serve as a perfectly suitable type for the morally good but it is not identical with it the same typic guards also against the mysticism of practical reason which turns what served only as a symbol into a schema that is proposes to provide for the moral concepts actual intuitions which however are not sensible intuitions of an invisible kingdom of god and thus plunges into the transcendent what is befitting the use of the moral concepts is only the rationalism of the judgment which takes from the sensible system of nature only what pure reason can also conceive of itself that is conformity to law and transfers into the supersensible nothing but what can conversely be actually exhibited by actions in the world of sense according to the formal rule of a law of nature however the caution against empiricism of practical reason is much more important for mysticism is quite reconcilable with the purity and sublimity of the moral law and besides it is not very natural or agreeable to common habits of thought to strain ones imagination to supersensible intuitions and hence the danger on this side is not so general empiricism on the contrary cuts up at the roots the morality of intentions in which and not in actions only consists the high worth that men can and ought to give to themselves and substitutes for duty something quite different namely an empirical interest with which the inclinations generally are secretly leagued and empiricism moreover being on this account allied with all the inclinations which no matter what fashion they put on degrade humanity when they are raised to the dignity of a supreme practical principle and as these nevertheless are so favourable to everyones feelings it is for that reason much more dangerous than mysticism which can never constitute a lasting condition of any great number of persons chapter iii of the motives of pure practical reason what is essential in the moral worth of actions is that the moral law should directly determine the will if the determination of the will takes place in conformity indeed to the moral law but only by means of a feeling no matter of what kind which has to be presupposed in order that the law may be sufficient to determine the will and therefore not for the sake of the law then the action will possess legality but not morality now if we understand by motive or spring elater animi the subjective ground of determination of the will of a being whose reason does not necessarily conform to the objective law by virtue of its own nature then it will follow first that no motives can be attributed to the divine will and that the motives of the human will as well as that of every created rational being can never be anything else than the moral law and consequently that the objective principle of determination must always and alone be also the subjectively sufficient determining principle of the action if this is not merely to fulfil the letter of the law without containing its spirit since then for the purpose of giving the moral law influence over the will we must not seek for any other motives that might enable us to dispense with the motive of the law itself because that would produce mere hypocrisy without consistency and it is even dangerous to allow other motives for instance that of interest even to cooperate along with the moral law hence nothing is left us but to determine carefully in what way the moral law becomes a motive and what effect this has upon the faculty of desire for as to the question how a law can be directly and of itself a determining principle of the will which is the essence of morality this is for human reason an insoluble problem and identical with the question how a free will is possible therefore what we have to show à priori is not why the moral law in itself supplies a motive but what effect it as such produces or more correctly speaking must produce on the mind the essential point in every determination of the will by the moral law is that being a free will it is determined simply by the moral law not only without the cooperation of sensible impulses but even to the rejection of all such and to the checking of all inclinations so far as they might be opposed to that law so far then the effect of the moral law as a motive is only negative and this motive can be known à priori to be such for all inclination and every sensible impulse is founded on feeling and the negative effect produced on feeling by the check on the inclinations is itself feeling consequently we can see à priori that the moral law as a determining principle of the will must by thwarting all our inclinations produce a feeling which may be called pain and
