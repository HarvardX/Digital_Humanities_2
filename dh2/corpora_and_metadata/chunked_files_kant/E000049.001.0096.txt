effect of this law namely the mental disposition conformed to it and made necessary by it to promote the practically possible summum bonum this presupposes at least that the latter is possible for it would be practically impossible to strive after the object of a conception which at bottom was empty and had no object now the abovementioned postulates concern only the physical or metaphysical conditions of the possibility of the summum bonum in a word those which lie in the nature of things not however for the sake of an arbitrary speculative purpose but of a practically necessary end of a pure rational will which in this case does not choose but obeys an inexorable command of reason the foundation of which is objective in the constitution of things as they must be universally judged by pure reason and is not based on inclination for we are in nowise justified in assuming on account of what we wish on merely subjective grounds that the means thereto are possible or that its object is real this then is an absolutely necessary requirement and what it presupposes is not merely justified as an allowable hypothesis but as a postulate in a practical point of view and admitting that the pure moral law inexorably binds every man as a command not as a rule of prudence the righteous man may say i will that there be a god that my existence in this world be also an existence outside the chain of physical causes and in a pure world of the understanding and lastly that my duration be endless i firmly abide by this and will not let this faith be taken from me for in this instance alone my interest because i must not relax anything of it inevitably determines my judgment without regarding sophistries however unable i may be to answer them or to oppose them with others more plausible 0 in order to prevent misconception in the use of a notion as yet so unusual as that of a faith of pure practical reason let me be permitted to add one more remark it might almost seem as if this rational faith were here announced as itself a command namely that we should assume the summum bonum as possible but a faith that is commanded is nonsense let the preceding analysis however be remembered of what is required to be supposed in the conception of the summum bonum and it will be seen that it can not be commanded to assume this possibility and no practical disposition of mind is required to admit it but that speculative reason must concede it without being asked for no one can affirm that it is impossible in itself that rational beings in the world should at the same time be worthy of happiness in conformity with the moral law and also possess this happiness proportionately now in respect of the first element of the summum bonum namely that which concerns morality the moral law gives merely a command and to doubt the possibility of that element would be the same as to call in question the moral law itself but as regards the second element of that object namely happiness perfectly proportioned to that worthiness it is true that there is no need of a command to admit its possibility in general for theoretical reason has nothing to say against it but the manner in which we have to conceive this harmony of the laws of nature with those of freedom has in it something in respect of which we have a choice because theoretical reason decides nothing with apodictic certainty about it and in respect of this there may be a moral interest which turns the scale i had said above that in a mere course of nature in the world an accurate correspondence between happiness and moral worth is not to be expected and must be regarded as impossible and that therefore the possibility of the summum bonum can not be admitted from this side except on the supposition of a moral author of the world i purposely reserved the restriction of this judgment to the subjective conditions of our reason in order not to make use of it until the manner of this belief should be defined more precisely the fact is that the impossibility referred to is merely subjective that is our reason finds it impossible for it to render conceivable in the way of a mere course of nature a connexion so exactly proportioned and so thoroughly adapted to an end between two sets of events happening according to such distinct laws although as with everything else in nature that is adapted to an end it can not prove that is show by sufficient objective reasons that it is not possible by universal laws of nature now however a deciding principle of a different kind comes into play to turn the scale in this uncertainty of speculative reason the command to promote the summum bonum is established on an objective basis in practical reason the possibility of the same in general is likewise established on an objective basis in theoretical reason which has nothing to say against it but reason can not decide objectively in what way we are to conceive this possibility whether by universal laws of nature without a wise author presiding over nature or only on supposition of such an author now here there comes in a subjective condition of reason the only way theoretically possible for it of conceiving the exact harmony of the kingdom of nature with the kingdom of morals which is the condition of the possibility of the summum bonum and at the same time the only one conducive to morality which depends on an objective law of reason now since the promotion of this summum bonum and therefore the supposition of its possibility are objectively necessary though only as a result of practical reason while at the same time
