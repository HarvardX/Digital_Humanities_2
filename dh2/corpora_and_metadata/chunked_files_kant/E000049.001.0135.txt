attracted no attention and dalembert in his reflections on the causes of the winds which obtained the prize offered by the berlin academy rejects the heat of the sun as a cause and makes all the phenomena depend on the attraction of the sun and moon in the french encyclopédie nine years after kants paper thirty after hadleys this is combined with halleys theory and it is suggested further that the monsoons may be due to the melting of snow the exhalations from mountains c not of mathematics as is sometimes stated the chair of mathematics was offered to kant but buck the professor of logic and metaphysics desired it and kant himself preferred the latter chair buck therefore became professor of mathematics and kant took his place it may perhaps be interesting to note that both berkeley and hume produced their greatest philosophical works before the age of thirty fichte wrote his wissenschaftslehre at thirtythree on the other hand locke and reid whose object was like kants to raise a barrier against scepticism and to ascertain the extent and limits of the powers of the mind both published their first philosophical treatises after fifty translated by mr bax in bohns library before reading this work of kants i had made a remark to the same effect in sight and touch p with reference to the statement of hamilton and others that sight is a modification of touch contact is usually understood to mean the approach of two bodies so that no space intervenes between them but in this sense there is probably no such thing as contact in nature physically speaking bodies in contact are only at such a distance that there is a sensible resistance to nearer approach sensation by contact then is sensation by resistance to say then that sight is a modification of touch is to say that the antecedent of vision is the exercise or feeling of the same repulsive force which is a physical hypothesis and considered as such is in fact absurd between ponderable substances and light contact in the sense just specified is either impossible or is the normal condition translated by mr semple edinburgh reissued luthers translation an interesting account of the last days of kant taken from wasianski may be found in de quinceys works vol iii five german feet would be less than five feet two inches english afterwards included in the streit der facultäten this essay has had a circulation of over 0000 in germany and a new edition has lately appeared see an amusing book by george catlin shut your mouth london some of his critical biographers thought he ate too much forgetting that this was his only meal in the twentyfour hours it is believed says de quincey that his critics ate their way from morn to dewy eve through the following course of meals— st breakfast early in the morning nd breakfast à la fourchette about 0 am rd dinner at or th vesper brod th abend brod all which does seem a very fair allowance for a man who means to lecture on abstinence at night yet some of his biographers state that he never gave alms to beggars the reader will be reminded of the similar story of dr johnson and the boots sidgwick method of ethics page rd ed page 0 in his third edition mr sidgwick appeals in defence of his view to kants statements in pp of the present book the passage on p was he remarks written ten years later but i think it will be found that in each of his hypothetical cases he does not deduce the maxim from the imperative what he does is to test the maxim by the imperative just as he might test an argument by the rules of syllogism discourse on the attributes c ed p 00 sidgwick method of ethics page 0 rd ed page mr sidgwicks argument involves the assumption that the sum of human happiness is certainly known to exceed that of human misery even on his own statement a man who doubted or disbelieved this would be justified in adopting celibacy nay in the latter case he might regard it as a duty kant appears to recognise this in the passage quoted p for instance cicero de legibus argues that there is communio juris inter deos et homines dr adams in his celebrated sermon on the obligation of virtue like kant remarks that to found the obligation of virtue on any good affections or on a moral sense as this is generally understood is to make its nature wholly precarious to suppose that men might have been intelligent beings without such sentiments or with the very reverse so clarke had insisted that the eternal relations of things with their consequent fitnesses must appear the same to the understandings of all intelligent beings in fact this is a commonplace of english moralists religion p 0 this has been recognised by philosophers of all periods who have not begun with a particular theory as to the origin of the idea and the principle thus to take only nonmetaphysical writers sir j herschel says it is our own immediate consciousness of effort which we exert to put matter in motion or to oppose and neutralize force which gives us this internal conviction of power and causation so far as it refers to the material world and compels us to believe that whenever we see material objects put in motion it is in consequence of such an effort somehow exerted though not accompanied with our consciousness astronomy 0th ed sec dubois reymond makes a similar statement deriving the principle from an irresistible tendency to personify it is somewhat singular that the philosophers who most strenuously deny that the principle of causality has any basis other than our observation of the phenomena of passive matter yet insist most strongly on extending it to those of active will the word law is here used
