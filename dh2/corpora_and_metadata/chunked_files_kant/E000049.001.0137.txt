to combine all these purposes for his own lasting benefit this latter is properly that to which the value even of the former is reduced and when a man is prudent in the former sense but not in the latter we might better say of him that he is clever and cunning but on the whole imprudent compare on the difference between klug and gescheu here alluded to anthropologie § ed schubert p 0 it seems to me that the proper signification of the word pragmatic may be most accurately defined in this way for sanctions see cr of pract reas p are called pragmatic which flow properly not from the law of the states as necessary enactments but from precaution for the general welfare a history is composed pragmatically when it teaches prudence i e instructs the world how it can provide for its interests better or at least as well as the men of former time i connect the act with the will without presupposing any condition resulting from any inclination but à priori and therefore necessarily though only objectively i e assuming the idea of a reason possessing full power over all subjective motives this is accordingly a practical proposition which does not deduce the willing of an action by mere analysis from another already presupposed for we have not such a perfect will but connects it immediately with the conception of the will of a rational being as something not contained in it a maxim is a subjective principle of action and must be distinguished from the objective principle namely practical law the former contains the practical rule set by reason according to the conditions of the subject often its ignorance or its inclinations so that it is the principle on which the subject acts but the law is the objective principle valid for every rational being and is the principle on which it ought to act that is an imperative i have no doubt that den in the original before imperativ is a misprint for der and have translated accordingly mr semple has done the same the editions that i have seen agree in reading den and m barni so translates with this reading it is the conformity that presents the imperative as necessary it must be noted here that i reserve the division of duties for a future metaphysic of morals so that i give it here only as an arbitrary one in order to arrange my examples for the rest i understand by a perfect duty one that admits no exception in favour of inclination and then i have not merely external but also internal perfect duties this is contrary to the use of the word adopted in the schools but i do not intend to justify it here as it is all one for my purpose whether it is admitted or not perfect duties are usually understood to be those which can be enforced by external law imperfect those which can not be enforced they are also called respectively determinate and indeterminate officia juris and officia virtutis on suicide cf further metaphysik der sitten p kant distinguishes hang propensio from neigung inclinatio as follows—hang is a predisposition to the desire of some enjoyment in other words it is the subjective possibility of excitement of a certain desire which precedes the conception of its object when the enjoyment has been experienced it produces a neigung inclination to it which accordingly is defined habitual sensible desire—anthropologie §§ religion p to behold virtue in her proper form is nothing else but to contemplate morality stripped of all admixture of sensible things and of every spurious ornament of reward or selflove how much she then eclipses everything else that appears charming to the affections every one may readily perceive with the least exertion of his reason if it be not wholly spoiled for abstraction this proposition is here stated as a postulate the grounds of it will be found in the concluding section let it not be thought that the common quod tibi non vis fieri c could serve here as the rule or principle for it is only a deduction from the former though with several limitations it can not be a universal law for it does not contain the principle of duties to oneself nor of the duties of benevolence to others for many a one would gladly consent that others should not benefit him provided only that he might be excused from showing benevolence to them nor finally that of duties of strict obligation to one another for on this principle the criminal might argue against the judge who punishes him and so on i may be excused from adducing examples to elucidate this principle as those which have already been used to elucidate the categorical imperative and its formula would all serve for the like purpose here cp critical examination of practical reason p the reading maxime which is that both of rosenkranz and hartenstein is obviously an error for materie teleology considers nature as a kingdom of ends ethics regards a possible kingdom of ends as a kingdom of nature in the first case the kingdom of ends is a theoretical idea adopted to explain what actually is in the latter it is a practical idea adopted to bring about that which is not yet but which can be realised by our conduct namely if it conforms to this idea i read allgemeines instead of allgemeinem i class the principle of moral feeling under that of happiness because every empirical interest promises to contribute to our wellbeing by the agreeableness that a thing affords whether it be immediately and without a view to profit or whether profit be regarded we must likewise with hutcheson class the principle of sympathy with the happiness of others under his assumed moral sense
