me she opened my heart to the impressions of nature she awoke and enlarged my thoughts and her teaching has always had an enduring and wholesome influence on my life she died when he was only thirteen and even in his later years he could scarcely restrain his emotion when he related to his intimate friends how she had sacrificed her own life through her devotion to a friend kant strongly resembled his mother in features and in his singularly contracted chest xv at ten years of age kant was sent to the collegium fridericianum where he continued for seven years here he applied himself chiefly to classical studies and learned to write latin with ease and fluency of greek he does not seem to have ever read much amongst his schoolfellows was david ruhnken and these two with a third named kunde read their favourite authors together and laid their plans for the future all three proposing to devote themselves to classical literature ruhnken actually attained high distinction in this field at the age of sixteen kant passed to the university where he applied himself chiefly to mathematics and philosophy the instruction in his favourite subject the ancient classics being inadequate he had entered himself as a theological student and as was then the practice with such students in prussia he occasionally preached in the neighbouring churches indeed he had completed his theological course when he finally gave up that line of study no doubt his tastes had been long turning in a different direction but the immediate cause of his decision seems to have been the failure of his application for a subordinate post in a school such posts being usually the first step to ecclesiastical appointments during the latter part of his residence at the university he had been obliged to eke out his scanty means by giving instruction in classics mathematics and natural philosophy to some of his fellowstudents for whom the lectures of the professors were too difficult but the little that he could earn in this way was insufficient for his support when by his fathers death he was thrown altogether on his own resources xvi he therefore sought and obtained employment as a resident tutor in families of distinction he was thus engaged for nine years and according to his own candid confession in later years there was hardly ever a tutor with a better theory or a worse practice however that may be he certainly gained the affection of his pupils and the respect of their parents at the beginning of this period he published his first work—an essay on the estimation of vis viva and towards the end of it his second—a brief discussion of the question whether the length of the day has undergone any change a question which had been proposed by the berlin academy as the subject for a prize essay kant argues that the tides must have the effect of retarding the earths rotation and he enters into a rough calculation of the amount of this retardation his first step to a conjectural approximation being an estimate of the effect of the impulse of the water on the whole east coast of the american continent his suggestion was sound and sagacious but he overrated vastly the amount of the effect he inferred that the day had lengthened by about ½s in two thousand years according to delaunay the actual amount of retardation is s in 00000 years this result is based on historical facts the record of eclipses kants was a purely physical calculation and for this he did not xvii possess sufficient data on account of this inevitable lack of precision he did not offer his essay in competition for the prize the same essay contained another very remarkable suggestion in explanation of the fact that the moon always presents the same face to the earth in fact if the moon were originally in a fluid state the tides produced in it by the earth which would be very great would similarly retard its rotation until the fluid surface attained a position of equilibrium relatively to the earth i e until the moon rotated round its axis in the same time that it revolved round the earth this speculation has been recently brought forward as novel the conjecture as to the moons original fluidity was no isolated one in kants mind on the contrary he speaks of it as part of a general theory of the heavens which he was about to publish in the following year accordingly he published anonymously an important work of about 00 pages entitled a general theory of the heavens or essay on the mechanical origin of the structure of the universe on the principles of newton this work is an elaborate exposition of the nebular theory commonly called by the name of laplace although laplaces système du monde was not published till forty years later the only considerable differences are first that laplace supposes the condensation of the diffused matter to be the result of cooling and secondly that he postulates an original movement of rotation whereas kant thought he could account for both condensation and rotation from the two elementary forces of attraction and repulsion it is not easy to say whether laplace xviii was aware of kants priority he asserts indeed that he was not aware of any theory except buffons a rather extravagant one but then laplace never did acknowledge that he borrowed anything from anybody else even when he used the mathematical discoveries of contemporary frenchmen he introduces them as if they were his own how much more if he adopted a suggestion of an anonymous german philosopher if he really did calculate on the ignorance of his reader the event has justified his expectation for even those writers who mention kants priority speak as if kant had merely thrown out a hint while laplace had developed a theory whereas in fact kant wrote a treatise
