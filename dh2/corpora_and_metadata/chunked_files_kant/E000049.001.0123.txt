law into his maxim in which case he is a bad man it follows that his disposition in respect of the moral law is never indifferent is always one of the two good or bad nor can he be partly good and partly bad at the same time for if he is in part good he has taken the moral law into his maxim if then he were at the same time in another part bad then since the moral law of obedience to duty is one and universal the maxim referring to it would be universal and at the same time only particular which is a contradiction when it is said that a man has the one or the other disposition as an innate natural quality it is not meant that it is not acquired by him that is that he is not the author of it but only that it is not acquired in time that from youth up he has been always the one or the other the disposition that is the primary subjective source of the adoption of maxims can be but one and applies generally to the whole use of freedom but it must have been itself adopted by free elective will for otherwise it could not be imputed now the subjective ground or cause of its adoption can not be further known although we can not help asking for it since otherwise another maxim would have to be adduced into which this disposition has been adopted and this again must have its reason since then we can not deduce this disposition or rather its ultimate source from any first act of the elective will in time we call it a characteristic of the elective will attaching to it by nature although in fact it is founded in freedom now that when we say of a man that he is by nature good or bad we are justified in applying this not to the individual in which case one might be assumed to be by nature good another bad but to the whole race this can only be proved when it has been shown in the anthropological inquiry that the reasons which justify us in ascribing one of the two characters to a man as innate are such that there is no reason to except any man from them and that therefore it holds of the race i of the original incapacity for good in human nature we may conveniently regard this capacity anlage under three heads divided in reference to their end as elements in the purpose for which man exists— the capacities belonging to the animal nature of man as a living being to his humanity as a living and at the same time rational being to his personality as a rational and at the same time responsible being capable of imputation the capacities belonging to the animal nature of man may be brought under the general title of physical and merely mechanical selflove that is such as does not require reason it is threefold—first for the maintenance of himself secondly for the propagation of his kind and the maintenance of his offspring thirdly for communion with other men that is the impulse to society all sorts of vices may be grafted on it but they do not proceed from that capacity itself as a root they may be called vices of coarseness of nature and in their extreme deviation from the end of nature become brutal vices intemperance sensuality and wild lawlessness in relation to other men the capacities belonging to his humanity may be brought under the general title of comparative though physical selflove which requires reason namely estimating ones self as happy or unhappy only in comparison with others from this is derived the inclination to obtain a worth in the opinion of others and primarily only that of equality to allow no one a superiority over ones self joined with a constant apprehension that others might strive to attain it and from this there ultimately arises an unjust desire to gain superiority for ourselves over others on this namely jealousy and rivalry the greatest vices may be grafted secret and open hostilities against all whom we look upon as not belonging to us these however do not properly spring of themselves from nature as their root but apprehending that others endeavour to gain a hated superiority over us these are inclinations to secure this superiority for ourselves as a defensive measure whereas nature would use the idea of such competition which in itself does not exclude mutual love only as a motive to culture the vices that are grafted on this inclination may therefore be called vices of culture and in their highest degree of malignancy in which they are merely the idea of a maximum of badness surpassing humanity ex gr in envy in ingratitude malice c are called devilish vices the capacity belonging to personality is the capability of respect for the moral law as a spring of the elective will adequate in itself the capability of mere respect for the moral law in us would be moral feeling which does not of itself constitute an end of the natural capacity but only so far as it is a spring of the elective will now as this is only possible by free will adopting it into its maxim hence the character of such an elective will is the good character which like every character of free elective will is something that can only be acquired the possibility of which however requires the presence of a capacity in our nature on which absolutely nothing bad can be grafted the idea of the moral law alone with the respect inseparable from it can not properly be called a capacity belonging to personality 0 it is personality itself the idea of humanity considered altogether intellectually but that we adopt this respect into our maxims as a spring this seems to
