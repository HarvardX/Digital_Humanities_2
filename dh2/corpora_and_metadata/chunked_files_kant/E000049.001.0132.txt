cooperation consists 0 perhaps it is even inevitable that if the way in which it happens had been revealed at a certain time different men at another time should form different conceptions of it and that with all honesty but then the principle holds good it is not essential and therefore not necessary for everyone to know what god does or has done for his salvation but it is essential to know what he himself has to do in order to be worthy of this assistance appendix i —on a supposed right to tell lies from benevolent motives in the work called france for the year part vi no on political reactions by benjamin constant the following passage occurs p — the moral principle that it is ones duty to speak the truth if it were taken singly and unconditionally would make all society impossible we have the proof of this in the very direct consequences which have been drawn from this principle by a german philosopher who goes so far as to affirm that to tell a falsehood to a murderer who asked us whether our friend of whom he was in pursuit had not taken refuge in our house would be a crime the french philosopher opposes this principle in the following manner p —it is a duty to tell the truth the notion of duty is inseparable from the notion of right a duty is what in one being corresponds to the right of another where there are no rights there are no duties to tell the truth then is a duty but only towards him who has a right to the truth but no man has a right to a truth that injures others the πρωˆτον ψενˆδος here lies in the statement that to tell the truth is a duty but only towards him who has a right to the truth it is to be remarked first that the expression to have a right to the truth is unmeaning we should rather say a man has a right to his own truthfulness veracitas that is to subjective truth in his own person for to have a right objectively to truth would mean that as in meum and tuum generally it depends on his will whether a given statement shall be true or false which would produce a singular logic now the first question is whether a man—in cases where he can not avoid answering yes or no—has the right to be untruthful the second question is whether in order to prevent a misdeed that threatens him or some one else he is not actually bound to be untruthful in a certain statement to which an unjust compulsion forces him truth in utterances that can not be avoided is the formal duty of a man to everyone however great the disadvantage that may arise from it to him or any other and although by making a false statement i do no wrong to him who unjustly compels me to speak yet i do wrong to men in general in the most essential point of duty so that it may be called a lie though not in the jurists sense that is so far as in me lies i cause that declarations in general find no credit and hence that all rights founded on contract should lose their force and this is a wrong which is done to mankind if then we define a lie merely as an intentionally false declaration towards another man we need not add that it must injure another as the jurists think proper to put in their definition mendacium est falsiloquium in præjudicium alterius for it always injures another if not another individual yet mankind generally since it vitiates the source of justice this benevolent lie may however by accident casus become punishable even by civil laws and that which escapes liability to punishment only by accident may be condemned as a wrong even by external laws for instance if you have by a lie hindered a man who is even now planning a murder you are legally responsible for all the consequences but if you have strictly adhered to the truth public justice can find no fault with you be the unforeseen consequence what it may it is possible that whilst you have honestly answered yes to the murderers question whether his intended victim is in the house the latter may have gone out unobserved and so not have come in the way of the murderer and the deed therefore have not been done whereas if you lied and said he was not in the house and he had really gone out though unknown to you so that the murderer met him as he went and executed his purpose on him then you might with justice be accused as the cause of his death for if you had spoken the truth as well as you knew it perhaps the murderer while seeking for his enemy in the house might have been caught by neighbours coming up and the deed been prevented whoever then tells a lie however good his intentions may be must answer for the consequences of it even before the civil tribunal and must pay the penalty for them however unforeseen they may have been because truthfulness is a duty that must be regarded as the basis of all duties founded on contract the laws of which would be rendered uncertain and useless if even the least exception to them were admitted to be truthful honest in all declarations is therefore a sacred unconditional command of reason and not to be limited by any expediency m constant makes a thoughtful and sound remark on the decrying of such strict principles which it is alleged lose themselves in impracticable ideas and are therefore to be rejected p —in every case in which a principle proved to be true seems to be inapplicable it is because we do not know the middle
