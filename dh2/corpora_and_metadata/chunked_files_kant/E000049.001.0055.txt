realise a desired object a command that everyone should try to make himself happy would be foolish for one never commands anyone to do what he of himself infallibly wishes to do we must only command the means or rather supply them since he can not do everything that he wishes but to command morality under the name of duty is quite rational for in the first place not everyone is willing to obey its precepts if they oppose his inclinations and as to the means of obeying this law these need not in this case be taught for in this respect whatever he wishes to do he can do he who has lost at play may be vexed at himself and his folly but if he is conscious of having cheated at play although he has gained thereby he must despise himself as soon as he compares himself with the moral law this must therefore be something different from the principle of private happiness for a man must have a different criterion when he is compelled to say to himself i am a worthless fellow though i have filled my purse and when he approves himself and says i am a prudent man for i have enriched my treasure finally there is something further in the idea of our practical reason which accompanies the transgression of a moral lawâ€”namely its ill desert now the notion of punishment as such can not be united with that of becoming a partaker of happiness for although he who inflicts the punishment may at the same time have the benevolent purpose of directing this punishment to this end yet it must first be justified in itself as punishment i e as mere harm so that if it stopped there and the person punished could get no glimpse of kindness hidden behind this harshness he must yet admit that justice was done him and that his reward was perfectly suitable to his conduct in every punishment as such there must first be justice and this constitutes the essence of the notion benevolence may indeed be united with it but the man who has deserved punishment has not the least reason to reckon upon this punishment then is a physical evil which though it be not connected with moral evil as a natural consequence ought to be connected with it as a consequence by the principles of a moral legislation now if every crime even without regarding the physical consequence with respect to the actor is in itself punishable that is forfeits happiness at least partially it is obviously absurd to say that the crime consisted just in this that he has drawn punishment on himself thereby injuring his private happiness which on the principle of selflove must be the proper notion of all crime according to this view the punishment would be the reason for calling anything a crime and justice would on the contrary consist in omitting all punishment and even preventing that which naturally follows for if this were done there would no longer be any evil in the action since the harm which otherwise followed it and on account of which alone the action was called evil would now be prevented to look however on all rewards and punishments as merely the machinery in the hand of a higher power which is to serve only to set rational creatures striving after their final end happiness this is to reduce the will to a mechanism destructive of freedom this is so evident that it need not detain us more refined though equally false is the theory of those who suppose a certain special moral sense which sense and not reason determines the moral law and in consequence of which the consciousness of virtue is supposed to be directly connected with contentment and pleasure that of vice with mental dissatisfaction and pain thus reducing the whole to the desire of private happiness without repeating what has been said above i will here only remark the fallacy they fall into in order to imagine the vicious man as tormented with mental dissatisfaction by the consciousness of his transgressions they must first represent him as in the main basis of his character at least in some degree morally good just as he who is pleased with the consciousness of right conduct must be conceived as already virtuous the notion of morality and duty must therefore have preceded any regard to this satisfaction and can not be derived from it a man must first appreciate the importance of what we call duty the authority of the moral law and the immediate dignity which the following of it gives to the person in his own eyes in order to feel that satisfaction in the consciousness of his conformity to it and the bitter remorse that accompanies the consciousness of its transgression it is therefore impossible to feel this satisfaction or dissatisfaction prior to the knowledge of obligation or to make it the basis of the latter a man must be at least half honest in order even to be able to form a conception of these feelings i do not deny that as the human will is by virtue of liberty capable of being immediately determined by the moral law so frequent practice in accordance with this principle of determination can at last produce subjectively a feeling of satisfaction on the contrary it is a duty to establish and to cultivate this which alone deserves to be called properly the moral feeling but the notion of duty can not be derived from it else we should have to suppose a feeling for the law as such and thus make that an object of sensation which can only be thought by the reason and this if it is not to be a flat contradiction would destroy all notion of duty and put in its place a mere mechanical play of refined inclinations sometimes contending with the coarser
