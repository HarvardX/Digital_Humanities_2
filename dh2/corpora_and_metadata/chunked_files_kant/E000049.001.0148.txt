law that he is called a good man the tree is then absolutely a good tree words that admit of two totally different senses often retard conviction for a long time when the principles are perfectly clear love in general and selflove in particular may be divided into that of good will and that of complacency benevolentiœ et complacentiœ and both as is evident must be rational it is natural to adopt the former into ones maxim for who would not wish that it should always fare well with himself it is rational inasmuch as in the first place in respect of the end only that is chosen which is consistent with the greatest and most lasting welfare and in the next as the most fitting means are chosen for each of these elements of happiness reason here occupies the place of a minister to natural inclination and the maxim which is assumed on that account has no reference whatever to morality if however it is made the unconditional principle of choice then it is the source of an immeasurably great conflict with morality now a rational love of complacency in ones self may either be understood thus that we have complacency in the abovementioned maxims directed to the satisfaction of natural inclinations so far as that end is attained by following them and then it is the same thing as complacency towards ones self one is pleased with ones self as a merchant whose trading speculations succeed and who congratulates himself on his insight in respect of the maxims he has adopted but the maxim of selflove of unconditional complacency in ones self not depending on gain or loss as the results of the action would be the inward principle of a satisfaction which is only possible to us on condition of the subordination of our maxims to the moral law no man to whom morality is not indifferent can have complacency in himself or indeed can be free from a bitter dissatisfaction with himself who is conscious of maxims that do not agree with the moral law within we might call this rational selflove which prevents him from mixing with the springs of his will any other causes of satisfaction drawn from the consequences of his actions under the name of happiness to be procured thereby now as the latter indicates unconditional respect for the law why should a difficulty be put in the way of the clear understanding of the principle by using the expression a rational selflove which is moral only on the condition just mentioned whereby we are involved in a circle for a man can love himself in a moral way only so far as he is conscious that his maxim is to make respect for the law the supreme spring of his will for us as beings dependent on objects of the sensibility happiness is by our physical nature the first and unconditional object of our desire but if we give the name of nature in general to all that is innate in us then as beings endowed with reason and freedom happiness is by our nature far from being the first or unconditional object of our maxims this character belongs to worthiness of happiness that is the coincidence of all our maxims with the moral law herein consists the whole precept of morality that this is the objective condition under which alone the wish for the former can coincide with the legislation of reason and the moral character consists in the state of mind which admits only such a conditional wish that the conception of freedom of the elective will does not precede the consciousness of the moral law in us but is only inferred from the determinability of our will by this law as an unconditional command anyone may readily be convinced by asking himself whether he is immediately certain of a faculty enabling him by firmness of purpose to overcome every motive to transgression however powerful phalaris licet imperet ut sis falsus et admoto dictet perjuria tauro everyone must confess that he does not know whether in such a case he would not be shaken in his purpose nevertheless duty commands him unconditionally thou shalt remain true to it and hence he justly concludes that he must also be able and that accordingly his will is free those who fullaciously represent this inscrutable property as quite comprehensible create an illusion by the word determinism the thesis that the elective will is determined by internal sufficient reasons as if the difficulty consisted in reconciling this with freedom which no one supposes the difficulty is how predeterminism by which voluntary actions as events have their determining causes in preceding time which with what it contains is no longer in our power can be consistent with freedom by which both the action itself and its opposite must be in the power of the subject at the moment of its taking place this is what men want to discern and never will be able to discern there is no difficulty in reconciling the conception of freedom with the idea of god as a necessary being for freedom does not consist in the contingency of the action that it is not determined by reasons at all that is not in indeterminism that it must be equally possible for god to do good or evil if his action is to be called free but in absolute spontaneity which alone is endangered by predeterminism which places the determining principle of the action in preceding time so that the action is now no longer in my power but in the hands of nature and i am irresistibly determined and since succession in time is not to be conceived in god this difficulty disappears there is appended in the original a long note first added in the second edition on the relation between the preceding general remark and the corresponding remarks appended to the other three sections of the
