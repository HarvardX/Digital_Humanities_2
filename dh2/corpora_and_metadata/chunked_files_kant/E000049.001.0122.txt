sound in soul so that nature itself helps us to develop this moral capacity for good within us sanabilibus ægrotamus malis nosque in rectum genitos natura si sanari velimus adjuvat says seneca but since it may well be that there is error in the supposed experience on both sides the question is whether a mean is not at least possible namely that man as a species may be neither good nor bad or at all events that he is as much one as the other partly good partly bad we call a man bad however not because he performs actions that are bad violating law but because these are of such a kind that we may infer from them bad maxims in him now although we can in experience observe that actions violate laws and even at least in ourselves that they do so consciously yet we can not observe the maxims themselves not even always in ourselves consequently the judgment that the doer of them is a bad man can not with certainty be founded on experience in order then to call a man bad it should be possible to argue à priori from some actions or from a single consciously bad action to a bad maxim as its foundation and from this to a general source in the actor of all particular morally bad maxims this source again being itself a maxim lest any difficulty should be found in the expression nature which if it meant as usual the opposite of the source of actions from freedom would be directly contradictory to the predicates morally good or evil it is to be observed that by the nature of man we mean here only the subjective ground of the use of his freedom in general under objective moral laws which precedes every act that falls under the senses wherever this ground lies this subjective ground however must itself again be always an act of freedom else the use or abuse of mans elective will in respect of the moral law could not be imputed to him nor the good or bad in him be called moral consequently the source of the bad can not lie in any object that determines the elective will through inclination or in any natural impulse but only in a rule that the elective will makes for itself for the use of its freedom that is in a maxim now we can not go on to ask concerning this what is the subjective ground why it is adopted and not the opposite maxim for if this ground were ultimately not now a maxim but a mere natural impulse then the use of freedom would be reduced to determination by natural causes which is contradictory to its conception when we say then man is by nature good or he is by nature bad this only means that he contains a primary source to us inscrutable of the adoption of good or of the adoption of bad law violating maxims and this generally as man and consequently so that by this he expresses the character of his species we shall say then of one of these characters which distinguishes man from other possible rational beings it is innate and yet we must always remember that nature is not to bear the blame of it if it is bad or the credit if it is good but that the man himself is the author of it but since the primary source of the adoption of our maxims which itself must again always lie in the free elective will can not be a fact of experience hence the good or bad in man as the subjective primary source of the adoption of this or that maxim in respect of the moral law is innate merely in this sense that it is in force before any use of freedom is experienced in the earliest childhood back to birth so that it is conceived as being present in man at birth not that birth is the cause of it remark the conflict between the two abovementioned hypotheses rests on a disjunctive proposition man is by nature either morally good or morally bad but it readily occurs to every one to ask whether this disjunction is correct and whether one might not affirm that man is by nature neither or another that he is both at once namely in some parts good in others bad experience seems even to confirm this mean between the two extremes it is in general however important for ethics to admit as far as possible no intermediates either in actions adiaphora or in human characters since with such ambiguity all maxims would run the risk of losing all definiteness and firmness those who are attached to this strict view are commonly called rigourists a name that is meant as a reproach but which is really praise and their antipodes may be called latitudinarians the latter are either latitudinarians of neutrality who may be called indifferentists or of compromise who may be called syncretists 0 the answer given to the above question by the rigourists is founded on the important consideration that freedom of elective will has the peculiar characteristic that it can not be determined to action by any spring except only so far as the man has taken it up into his maxim has made it the universal rule of his conduct only in his way can a spring whatever it may be coexist with the absolute spontaneity of the elective will freedom only the moral law is of itself in the judgment of reason a spring and whoever makes it his maxim is morally good now if the law does not determine a mans elective will in respect of an action which has reference to it an opposite spring must have influence on his elective will and since by hypothesis this can only occur by the man taking it and consequently deviation from the moral
