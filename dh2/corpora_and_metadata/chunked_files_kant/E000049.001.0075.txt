sight or to dread the inward glance of selfexamination this consolation is not happiness it is not even the smallest part of it for no one would wish to have occasion for it or would perhaps even desire a life in such circumstances but he lives and he can not endure that he should be in his own eyes unworthy of life this inward peace is therefore merely negative as regards what can make life pleasant it is in fact only the escaping the danger of sinking in personal worth after everything else that is valuable has been lost it is the effect of a respect for something quite different from life something in comparison and contrast with which life with all its enjoyment has no value he still lives only because it is his duty not because he finds anything pleasant in life such is the nature of the true motive of pure practical reason it is no other than the pure moral law itself inasmuch as it makes us conscious of the sublimity of our own supersensible existence and subjectively produces respect for their higher nature in men who are also conscious of their sensible existence and of the consequent dependence of their pathologically very susceptible nature now with this motive may be combined so many charms and satisfactions of life that even on this account alone the most prudent choice of a rational epicurean reflecting on the greatest advantage of life would declare itself on the side of moral conduct and it may even be advisable to join this prospect of a cheerful enjoyment of life with that supreme motive which is already sufficient of itself but only as a counterpoise to the attractions which vice does not fail to exhibit on the opposite side and not so as even in the smallest degree to place in this the proper moving power when duty is in question for that would be just the same as to wish to taint the purity of the moral disposition in its source the majesty of duty has nothing to do with enjoyment of life it has its special law and its special tribunal and though the two should be never so well shaken together to be given well mixed like medicine to the sick soul yet they will soon separate of themselves and if they do not the former will not act and although physical life might gain somewhat in force the moral life would fade away irrecoverably critical examination of the analytic of pure practical reason by the critical examination of a science or of a portion of it which constitutes a system by itself i understand the inquiry and proof why it must have this and no other systematic form when we compare it with another system which is based on a similar faculty of knowledge now practical and speculative reason are based on the same faculty so far as both are pure reason therefore the difference in their systematic form must be determined by the comparison of both and the ground of this must be assigned the analytic of pure theoretic reason had to do with the knowledge of such objects as may have been given to the understanding and was obliged therefore to begin from intuition and consequently as this is always sensible from sensibility and only after that could advance to concepts of the objects of this intuition and could only end with principles after both these had preceded on the contrary since practical reason has not to do with objects so as to know them but with its own faculty of realizing them in accordance with the knowledge of them that is with a will which is a causality inasmuch as reason contains its determining principle since consequently it has not to furnish an object of intuition but as practical reason has to furnish only a law because the notion of causality always implies the reference to a law which determines the existence of the many in relation to one another hence a critical examination of the analytic of reason if this is to be practical reason and this is properly the problem must begin with the possibility of practical principles à priori only after that can it proceed to concepts of the objects of a practical reason namely those of absolute good and evil in order to assign them in accordance with those principles for prior to those principles they can not possibly be given as good and evil by any faculty of knowledge and only then could the section be concluded with the last chapter that namely which treats of the relation of the pure practical reason to the sensibility and of its necessary influence thereon which is à priori cognisable that is of the moral sentiment thus the analytic of the practical pure reason has the whole extent of the conditions of its use in common with the theoretical but in reverse order the analytic of pure theoretic reason was divided into transcendental aesthetic and transcendental logic that of the practical reversely into logic and aesthetic of pure practical reason if i may for the sake of analogy merely use these designations which are not quite suitable this logic again was there divided into the analytic of concepts and that of principles here into that of principles and concepts the aesthetic also had in the former case two parts on account of the two kinds of sensible intuition here the sensibility is not considered as a capacity of intuition at all but merely as feeling which can be a subjective ground of desire and in regard to it pure practical reason admits no further division it is also easy to see the reason why this division into two parts with its subdivision was not actually adopted here as one might have been induced to attempt by the example of the former critique for since it is pure reason that is here considered
