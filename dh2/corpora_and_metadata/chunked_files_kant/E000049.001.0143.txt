this rational knowledge their object must be specifically distinct otherwise they would not justify a division which always presupposes a contrast of the principles of the rational knowledge belonging to the different parts of a science now there are only two kinds of concepts and these admit as many distinct principles of possibility of their object namely physical concepts and the concept of freedom now as the former make possible a theoretical knowledge on à priori principles whereas in respect of these the latter only conveys in its concept a negative principle that of mere contrast while on the other hand it establishes principles for the determination of the will which therefore are called practical hence philosophy is rightly divided into two parts with quite distinct principles—the theoretical which is natural philosophy and the practical which is moral philosophy for so we name the practical legislation of reason according to the concept of freedom hitherto however there has prevailed a gross misuse of these expressions in the division of the different principles and consequently also of philosophy inasmuch as what is practical according to physical concepts has been assumed to be of the same kind as what is practical according to the concept of freedom and thus with the same denominations of theoretical and practical philosophy a division is made by which nothing is really divided since both parts might have principles of the same kind—kritik der urtheilskraft einl p the deduction of the division of a system that is the proof of its completeness as well as of its continuity namely that the transition from the notion divided to each member of the division in the whole series of subdivisions does not take place per saltum is one of the most difficult tasks of the constructor of a system it is even difficult to say what is the ultimate notion of which right and wrong fas aut nefas are divisions it is the act of free choice in general so teachers of ontology begin with the notions of something and nothing without being aware that these are already members of a division of a higher notion which is not given but which in fact can only be the notion of an object in general the original has natural the emendation which is clearly necessary was suggested to me by mr philip sandford one who is acquainted with practical philosophy is not therefore a practical philosopher the latter is he who makes the rational end the principle of his actions while at the same time he joins with this the necessary knowledge which as it aims at action must not be spun out into the most subtle threads of metaphysic unless a legal duty is in question in which case meum and tuum must be accurately determined in the balance of justice on the principle of equality of action and reaction which requires something like mathematical proportion but not in the case of a mere ethical duty for in this case the question is not only to know what it is a duty to do a thing which on account of the ends that all men naturally have can be easily decided but the chief point is the inner principle of the will namely that the consciousness of this duty be also the spring of action in order that we may be able to say of the man who joins to his knowledge this principle of wisdom that he is a practical philosopher compare the remarks of dr adams the pleasures of selfapprobation and esteem which follow virtue certainly arise from a conscious sense of having made virtue and not pleasure our choice not from preferring one interest or pleasure to another but from acting according to right without any other consideration whatsoever it seems essential to this pleasure that no motive of interest have any part in the choice or intention of the agent and to make this pleasure an object to the mind the virtue whose principle we are seeking after must be already formed for let it be observed that the pleasures we are speaking of are themselves virtuous pleasures such as none but virtuous minds are capable of proposing to themselves or of enjoying to the sensual or voluptuous the pleasures that arise from denying our appetites or passions have no existence these can not therefore be the motive to that virtue which is already presupposed it is the same love of virtue which makes it first the object of our pursuit and when acquired the subject of our triumph and joy to do a virtuous action for the sake of these virtuous pleasures is to choose virtue for the sake of being virtuous which is to rest in it as an end or to pursue it without regard to any other object or interest—sermon on the obligation of virtue note the essay referred to is that on the radical evil in human nature man however as at the same time a moral being when he considers himself objectively which he is qualified to do by his pure practical reason ie according to humanity in his own person finds himself holy enough to transgress the law only unwillingly for there is no man so depraved who in this transgression would not feel a resistance and an abhorrence of himself so that he must put a force on himself it is impossible to explain the phenomenon that at this parting of the ways where the beautiful fable places hercules between virtue and sensuality man shows more propensity to obey inclination than the law for we can only explain what happens by tracing it to a cause according to physical laws but then we should not be able to conceive the elective will as free now this mutually opposed selfconstraint and the inevitability of it makes us recognize the incomprehensible property of freedom the less a man can be physically forced and the more he can be morally
