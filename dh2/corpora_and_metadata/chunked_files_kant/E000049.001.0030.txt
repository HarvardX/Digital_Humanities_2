it belongs to ethics proper to define this principle more precisely so as to avoid all misunderstanding eg as to the amputation of the limbs in order to preserve myself as to exposing my life to danger with a view to preserve it c this question is therefore omitted here secondly as regards necessary duties or those of strict obligation towards others he who is thinking of making a lying promise to others will see at once that he would be using another man merely as a mean without the latter containing at the same time the end in himself for he whom i propose by such a promise to use for my own purposes can not possibly assent to my mode of acting towards him and therefore can not himself contain the end of this action this violation of the principle of humanity in other men is more obvious if we take in examples of attacks on the freedom and property of others for then it is clear that he who transgresses the rights of men intends to use the person of others merely as means without considering that as rational beings they ought always to be esteemed also as ends that is as beings who must be capable of containing in themselves the end of the very same action thirdly as regards contingent meritorious duties to oneself is not enough that the action does not violate humanity in our own person as an end in itself it must also harmonise with it now there are in humanity capacities of greater perfection which belong to the end that nature has in view in regard to humanity in ourselves as the subject to neglect these might perhaps be consistent with the maintenance of humanity as an end in itself but not with the advancement of this end fourthly as regards meritorious duties towards others the natural end which all men have is their own happiness now humanity might indeed subsist although no one should contribute anything to the happiness of others provided he did not intentionally withdraw anything from it but after all this would only harmonise negatively not positively with humanity as an end in itself if every one does not also endeavour as far as in him lies to forward the ends of others for the ends of any subject which is an end in himself ought as far as possible to be my ends also if that conception is to have its full effect with me this principle that humanity and generally every rational nature is an end in itself which is the supreme limiting condition of every mans freedom of action is not borrowed from experience firstly because it is universal applying as it does to all rational beings whatever and experience is not capable of determining anything about them secondly because it does not present humanity as an end to men subjectively that is as an object which men do of themselves actually adopt as an end but as an objective end which must as a law constitute the supreme limiting condition of all our subjective ends let them be what we will it must therefore spring from pure reason in fact the objective principle of all practical legislation lies according to the first principle in the rule and its form of universality which makes it capable of being a law say e g a law of nature but the subjective principle is in the end now by the second principle the subject of all ends is each rational being 0 inasmuch as it is an end in itself hence follows the third practical principle of the will which is the ultimate condition of its harmony with the universal practical reason viz the idea of the will of every rational being as a universally legislative will on this principle all maxims are rejected which are inconsistent with the will being itself universal legislator thus the will is not subject simply to the law but so subject that it must be regarded as itself giving the law and on this ground only subject to the law of which it can regard itself as the author in the previous imperatives namely that based on the conception of the conformity of actions to general laws as in a physical system of nature and that based on the universal prerogative of rational beings as ends in themselvesâ€”these imperatives just because they were conceived as categorical excluded 0 from any share in their authority all admixture of any interest as a spring of action they were however only assumed to be categorical because such an assumption was necessary to explain the conception of duty but we could not prove independently that there are practical propositions which command categorically nor can it be proved in this section one thing however could be done namely to indicate in the imperative itself by some determinate expression that in the case of volition from duty all interest is renounced which is the specific criterion of categorical as distinguished from hypothetical imperatives this is done in the present third formula of the principle namely in the idea of the will of every rational being as a universally legislating will for although a will which is subject to laws may be attached to this law by means of an interest yet a will which is itself a supreme lawgiver so far as it is such can not possibly depend on any interest since a will so dependent would itself still need another law restricting the interest of its selflove by the condition that it should be valid as universal law thus the principle that every human will is a will which in all its maxims gives universal laws provided it be otherwise justified would be very well adapted to be the categorical imperative in this respect namely that just because of the idea of universal legislation it is not based on any interest and therefore it
