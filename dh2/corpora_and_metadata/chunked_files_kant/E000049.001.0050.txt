nothing specifically whereas this is what alone we are concerned with in this practical problem which can not be solved at all without such specific determination for it is every mans own special feeling of pleasure and pain that decides in what he is to place his happiness and even in the same subject this will vary with the difference of his wants according as this feeling changes and thus a law which is subjectively necessary as a law of nature is objectively a very contingent practical principle which can and must be very different in different subjects and therefore can never furnish a law since in the desire for happiness it is not the form of conformity to law that is decisive but simply the matter namely whether i am to expect pleasure in following the law and how much principles of selflove may indeed contain universal precepts of skill how to find means to accomplish ones purposes but in that case they are merely theoretical principles as for example how he who would like to eat bread should contrive a mill but practical precepts founded on them can never be universal for the determining principle of the desire is based on the feeling of pleasure and pain which can never be supposed to be universally directed to the same objects even supposing however that all finite rational beings were thoroughly agreed as to what were the objects of their feelings of pleasure and pain and also as to the means which they must employ to attain the one and avoid the other still they could by no means set up the principle of selflove as a practical law for this unanimity itself would be only contingent the principle of determination would still be only subjectively valid and merely empirical and would not possess the necessity which is conceived in every law namely an objective necessity arising from à priori grounds unless indeed we hold this necessity to be not at all practical but merely physical viz that our action is as inevitably determined by our inclination as yawning when we see others yawn it would be better to maintain that there are no practical laws at all but only counsels for the service of our desires than to raise merely subjective principles to the rank of practical laws which have objective necessity and not merely subjective and which must be known by reason à priori not by experience however empirically universal this may be even the rules of corresponding phenomena are only called laws of nature e g the mechanical laws when we either know them really à priori or as in the case of chemical laws suppose that they would be known à priori from objective grounds if our insight reached further but in the case of merely subjective practical principles it is expressly made a condition that they rest not on objective but on subjective conditions of choice and hence that they must always be represented as mere maxims never as practical laws this second remark seems at first sight to be mere verbal refinement but it defines the terms of the most important distinction which can come into consideration in practical investigations § iv — theorem iii a rational being can not regard his maxims as practical universal laws unless he conceives them as principles which determine the will not by their matter but by their form only by the matter of a practical principle i mean the object of the will this object is either the determining ground of the will or it is not in the former case the rule of the will is subjected to an empirical condition viz the relation of the determining idea to the feeling of pleasure and pain consequently it can not be a practical law now when we abstract from a law all matter i e every object of the will as a determining principle nothing is left but the mere form of a universal legislation therefore either a rational being can not conceive his subjective practical principles that is his maxims as being at the same time universal laws or he must suppose that their mere form by which they are fitted for universal legislation is alone what makes them practical laws remark the commonest understanding can distinguish without instruction what form of maxim is adapted for universal legislation and what is not suppose for example that i have made it my maxim to increase my fortune by every safe means now i have a deposit in my hands the owner of which is dead and has left no writing about it this is just the case for my maxim i desire then to know whether that maxim can also hold good as a universal practical law i apply it therefore to the present case and ask whether it could take the form of a law and consequently whether i can by my maxim at the same time give such a law as this that everyone may deny a deposit of which no one can produce a proof i at once become aware that such a principle viewed as a law would annihilate itself because the result would be that there would be no deposits a practical law which i recognize as such must be qualified for universal legislation this is an identical proposition and therefore selfevident now if i say that my will is subject to a practical law i can not adduce my inclination e g in the present case my avarice as a principle of determination fitted to be a universal practical law for this is so far from being fitted for a universal legislation that if put in the form of a universal law it would destroy itself it is therefore surprising that intelligent men could have thought of calling the desire of happiness a universal practical law on the ground that the desire is universal and therefore also the maxim by
