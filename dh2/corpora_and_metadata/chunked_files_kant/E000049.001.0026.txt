it is given as however both only ordain the means to that which we suppose to be willed as an end it follows that the imperative which ordains the willing of the means to him who wills the end is in both cases analytical thus there is no difficulty in regard to the possibility of an imperative of this kind either on the other hand the question how the imperative of morality is possible is undoubtedly one the only one demanding a solution as this is not at all hypothetical and the objective necessity which it presents can not rest on any hypothesis as is the case with the hypothetical imperatives only here we must never leave out of consideration that we can not make out by any example in other words empirically whether there is such an imperative at all but it is rather to be feared that all those which seem to be categorical may yet be at bottom hypothetical for instance when the precept is thou shalt not promise deceitfully and it is assumed that the necessity of this is not a mere counsel to avoid some other evil so that it should mean thou shalt not make a lying promise lest if it become known thou shouldst destroy thy credit but that an action of this kind must be regarded as evil in itself so that the imperative of the prohibition is categorical then we can not show with certainty in any example that the will was determined merely by the law without any other spring of action although it may appear to be so for it is always possible that fear of disgrace perhaps also obscure dread of other dangers may have a secret influence on the will who can prove by experience the nonexistence of a cause when all that experience tells us is that we do not perceive it but in such a case the socalled moral imperative which as such appears to be categorical and unconditional would in reality be only a pragmatic precept drawing our attention to our own interests and merely teaching us to take these into consideration we shall therefore have to investigate à priori the possibility of a categorical imperative as we have not in this case the advantage of its reality being given in experience so that the elucidation of its possibility should be requisite only for its explanation not for its establishment in the meantime it may be discerned beforehand that the categorical imperative alone has the purport of a practical law all the rest may indeed be called principles of the will but not laws since whatever is only necessary for the attainment of some arbitrary purpose may be considered as in itself contingent and we can at any time be free from the precept if we give up the purpose on the contrary the unconditional command leaves the will no liberty to choose the opposite consequently it alone carries with it that necessity which we require in a law secondly in the case of this categorical imperative or law of morality the difficulty of discerning its possibility is a very profound one it is an à priori synthetical practical proposition and as there is so much difficulty in discerning the possibility of speculative propositions of this kind it may readily be supposed that the difficulty will be no less with the practical in this problem we will first inquire whether the mere conception of a categorical imperative may not perhaps supply us also with the formula of it containing the proposition which alone can be a categorical imperative for even if we know the tenor of such an absolute command yet how it is possible will require further special and laborious study which we postpone to the last section when i conceive a hypothetical imperative in general i do not know beforehand what it will contain until i am given the condition but when i conceive a categorical imperative i know at once what it contains for as the imperative contains besides the law only the necessity that the maxims shall conform to this law while the law contains no conditions restricting it there remains nothing but the general statement that the maxim of the action should conform to a universal law and it is this conformity alone that the imperative properly represents as necessary there is therefore but one categorical imperative namely this act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law now if all imperatives of duty can be deduced from this one imperative as from their principle then although it should remain undecided whether what is called duty is not merely a vain notion yet at least we shall be able to show what we understand by it and what this notion means since the universality of the law according to which effects are produced constitutes what is properly called nature in the most general sense as to form that is the existence of things so far as it is determined by general laws the imperative of duty may be expressed thus act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy will a universal law of nature we will now enumerate a few duties adopting the usual division of them into duties to ourselves and to others and into perfect and imperfect duties a man reduced to despair by a series of misfortunes feels wearied of life but is still so far in possession of his reason that he can ask himself whether it would not be contrary to his duty to himself to take his own life now he inquires whether the maxim of his action could become a universal law of nature his maxim is from selflove i adopt it as a principle to shorten my life when its longer duration is likely to bring more evil than satisfaction it is asked then simply
