be confessed that without it the statement is not selfevident i adopt this method of assuming freedom merely as an idea which rational beings suppose in their actions in order to avoid the necessity of proving it in its theoretical aspect also the former is sufficient for my purpose for even though the speculative proof should not be made out yet a being that can not act except with the idea of freedom is bound by the same laws that would oblige a being who was actually free thus we can escape here from the onus which presses on the theory compare butlers treatment of the question of liberty in his analogy part i ch vi interest means a spring of the will in so far as this spring is presented by reason see note p 0 the common understanding being here spoken of i use the word idea in its popular sense the verb is wanting in the original the punctuation of the original gives the following sense submits his causality as regards its external determination to laws of nature i have ventured to make what appears to be a necessary correction by simply removing a comma m barni translates as if he read desselben instead of derselben the causality of this will so also mr semple interest is that by which reason becomes practical ie a cause determining the will hence we say of rational beings only that they take an interest in a thing irrational beings only feel sensual appetites reason takes a direct interest in action then only when the universal validity of its maxims is alone sufficient to determine the will such an interest alone is pure but if it can determine the will only by means of another object of desire or on the suggestion of a particular feeling of the subject then reason takes only an indirect interest in the action and as reason by itself without experience can not discover either objects of the will or a special feeling actuating it this latter interest would only be empirical and not a pure rational interest the logical interest of reason namely to extend its insight is never direct but presupposes purposes for which reason is employed reading einer for seiner lest any one should imagine that he finds an inconsistency here when i call freedom the condition of the moral law and hereafter maintain in the treatise itself that the moral law is the condition under which we can first become conscious of freedom i will merely remark that freedom is the ratio essendi of the moral law while the moral law is the ratio cognoscendi of freedom for had not the moral law been previously distinctly thought in our reason we should never consider ourselves justified in assuming such a thing as freedom although it be not contradictory but were there no freedom it would be impossible to trace the moral law in ourselves at all the union of causality as freedom with causality as rational mechanism the former established by the moral law the latter by the law of nature in the same subject namely man is impossible unless we conceive him with reference to the former as a being in himself and with reference to the latter as a phenomenonâ€”the former in pure consciousness the latter in empirical consciousness otherwise reason inevitably contradicts itself a reviewer who wanted to find some fault with this work has hit the truth better perhaps than he thought when he says that no new principle of morality is set forth in it but only a new formula but who would think of introducing a new principle of all morality and making himself as it were the first discoverer of it just as if all the world before him were ignorant what duty was or had been in thoroughgoing error but whoever knows of what importance to a mathematician a formula is which defines accurately what is to be done to work a problem will not think that a formula is insignificant and useless which does the same for all duty in general probably professor garve see kants das mag in der theorie richtig seyn etc werke vol vii p it might also have been objected to me that i have not first defined the notion of the faculty of desire or of the feeling of pleasure although this reproach would be unfair because this definition might reasonably be presupposed as given in psychology however the definition there given might be such as to found the determination of the faculty of desire on the feeling of pleasure as is commonly done and thus the supreme principle of practical philosophy would be necessarily made empirical which however remains to be proved and in this critique is altogether refuted i will therefore give this definition here in such a manner as it ought to be given in order to leave this contested point open at the beginning as it should be life is the faculty a being has of acting according to laws of the faculty of desire the faculty of desire is the beings faculty of becoming by means of its ideas the cause of the actual existence of the objects of these ideas pleasure is the idea of the agreement of the object or the action with the subjective conditions of life ie with the faculty of causality of an idea in respect of the actuality of its object or with the determination of the forces of the subject to the action which produces it i have no further need for the purposes of this critique of notions borrowed from psychology the critique itself supplies the rest it is easily seen that the question whether the faculty of desire is always based on pleasure or whether under certain conditions pleasure only follows the determination of desire is by this definition left undecided for it is composed only of terms belonging to the pure understanding ie
