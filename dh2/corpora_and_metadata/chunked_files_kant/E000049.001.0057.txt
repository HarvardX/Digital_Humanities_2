of the sensible world and the whole compass of our theoretical use of reason a fact which points to a pure world of the understanding nay even defines it positively and enables us to know something of it namely a law this law as far as rational beings are concerned gives to the world of sense which is a sensible system of nature the form of a world of the understanding that is of a supersensible system of nature without interfering with its mechanism now a system of nature in the most general sense is the existence of things under laws the sensible nature of rational beings in general is their existence under laws empirically conditioned which from the point of view of reason is heteronomy the supersensible nature of the same beings on the other hand is their existence according to laws which are independent on every empirical condition and therefore belong to the autonomy of pure reason and since the laws by which the existence of things depends on cognition are practical supersensible nature so far as we can form any notion of it is nothing else than a system of nature under the autonomy of pure practical reason now the law of this autonomy is the moral law which therefore is the fundamental law of a supersensible nature and of a pure world of understanding whose counterpart must exist in the world of sense but without interfering with its laws we might call the former the archetypal world natura archetypa which we only know in the reason and the latter the ectypal world natura ectypa because it contains the possible effect of the idea of the former which is the determining principle of the will for the moral law in fact transfers us ideally into a system in which pure reason if it were accompanied with adequate physical power would produce the summum bonum and it determines our will to give the sensible world the form of a system of rational beings the least attention to oneself proves that this idea really serves as the model for the determinations of our will when the maxim which i am disposed to follow in giving testimony is tested by the practical reason i always consider what it would be if it were to hold as a universal law of nature it is manifest that in this view it would oblige everyone to speak the truth for it can not hold as a universal law of nature that statements should be allowed to have the force of proof and yet to be purposely untrue similarly the maxim which i adopt with respect to disposing freely of my life is at once determined when i ask myself what it should be in order that a system of which it is the law should maintain itself it is obvious that in such a system no one could arbitrarily put an end to his own life for such an arrangement would not be a permanent order of things and so in all similar cases now in nature as it actually is an object of experience the free will is not of itself determined to maxims which could of themselves be the foundation of a natural system of universal laws or which could even be adapted to a system so constituted on the contrary its maxims are private inclinations which constitute indeed a natural whole in conformity with pathological physical laws but could not form part of a system of nature which would only be possible through our will acting in accordance with pure practical laws yet we are through reason conscious of a law to which all our maxims are subject as though a natural order must be originated from our will this law therefore must be the idea of a natural system not given in experience and yet possible through freedom a system therefore which is supersensible and to which we give objective reality at least in a practical point of view since we look on it as an object of our will as pure rational beings hence the distinction between the laws of a natural system to which the will is subject and of a natural system which is subject to a will as far as its relation to its free actions is concerned 0 rests on this that in the former the objects must be causes of the ideas which determine the will whereas in the latter the will is the cause of the objects so that its causality has its determining principle solely in the pure faculty of reason which may therefore be called a pure practical reason there are therefore two very distinct problems how on the one side pure reason can cognise objects à priori and how on the other side it can be an immediate determining principle of the will that is of the causality of the rational being with respect to the reality of objects through the mere thought of the universal validity of its own maxims as laws the former which belongs to the critique of the pure speculative reason requires a previous explanation how intuitions without which no object can be given and therefore none known synthetically are possible à priori and its solution turns out to be that these are all only sensible and therefore do not render possible any speculative knowledge which goes further than possible experience reaches and that therefore all the principles of that pure speculative reason avail only to make experience possible either experience of given objects or of those that may be given ad infinitum but never are completely given the latter which belongs to the critique of practical reason requires no explanation how the objects of the faculty of desire are possible for that being a problem of the theoretical knowledge of nature is left to the critique of the speculative reason but only how reason can determine the maxims of the will whether this takes
