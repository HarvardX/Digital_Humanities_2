and the moral law within i have not to search for them and conjecture them as though they were veiled in darkness or were in the transcendent region beyond my horizon i see them before me and connect them directly with the consciousness of my existence the former begins from the place i occupy in the external world of sense and enlarges my connexion therein to an unbounded extent with worlds upon worlds and systems of systems and moreover into limitless times of their periodic motion its beginning and continuance the second begins from my invisible self my personality and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which is traceable only by the understanding and with which i discern that i am not in a merely contingent but in a universal and necessary connexion as i am also thereby with all those visible worlds the former view of a countless multitude of worlds annihilates as it were my importance as an animal creature which after it has been for a short time provided with vital power one knows not how must again give back the matter of which it was formed to the planet it inhabits a mere speck in the universe the second on the contrary infinitely elevates my worth as an intelligence by my personality in which the moral law reveals to me a life independent on animality and even on the whole sensible world—at least so far as may be inferred from the destination assigned to my existence by this law a destination not restricted to conditions and limits of this life but reaching into the infinite but though admiration and respect may excite to inquiry they can not supply the want of it what then is to be done in order to enter on this in a useful manner and one adapted to the loftiness of the subject examples may serve in this as a warning and also for imitation the contemplation of the world began from the noblest spectacle that the human senses present to us and that our understanding can bear to follow in their vast reach and it ended—in astrology morality began with the noblest attribute of human nature the development and cultivation of which give a prospect of infinite utility and ended—in fanaticism or superstition so it is with all crude attempts where the principal part of the business depends on the use of reason a use which does not come of itself like the use of the feet by frequent exercise especially when attributes are in question which can not be directly exhibited in common experience but after the maxim had come into vogue though late to examine carefully beforehand all the steps that reason purposes to take and not to let it proceed otherwise than in the track of a previously wellconsidered method then the study of the structure of the universe took quite a different direction and thereby attained an incomparably happier result the fall of a stone the motion of a sling resolved into their elements and the forces that are manifested in them and treated mathematically produced at last that clear and henceforward unchangeable insight into the system of the world which as observation is continued may hope always to extend itself but need never fear to be compelled to retreat this example may suggest to us to enter on the same path in treating of the moral capacities of our nature and may give us hope of a like good result we have at hand the instances of the moral judgment of reason by analysing these into their elementary conceptions and in default of mathematics adopting a process similar to that of chemistry the separation of the empirical from the rational elements that may be found in them by repeated experiments on common sense we may exhibit both pure and learn with certainty what each part can accomplish of itself so as to prevent on the one hand the errors of a still crude untrained judgment and on the other hand what is far more necessary the extravagances of genius by which as by the adepts of the philosophers stone without any methodical study or knowledge of nature visionary treasures are promised and the true are thrown away in one word science critically undertaken and methodically directed is the narrow gate that leads to the true doctrine of practical wisdom if we understand by this not merely what one ought to do but what ought to serve teachers as a guide to construct well and clearly the road to wisdom which everyone should travel and to secure others from going astray philosophy must always continue to be the guardian of this science and although the public does not take any interest in its subtle investigations it must take an interest in the resulting doctrines which such an examination first puts in a clear light introduction to the metaphysic of morals and preface to the metaphysical elements of ethics introduction to the metaphysic of morals i of the relation of the faculties of the human mind to the moral laws the appetitive faculty is the faculty of being by means of ones ideas the cause of the objects of these ideas the faculty which a being has of acting according to its ideas is life firstly—desire or aversion has always connected with it pleasure or displeasure the susceptibility to which is called feeling but the converse does not always hold for a pleasure may exist which is not connected with any desire of the object but with the mere idea which one frames to ones self of an object no matter whether its object exists or not secondly—the pleasure or displeasure in the object of the desire does not always precede the desire and can not always be regarded as its cause but must sometimes be looked on as the effect thereof now the capability of having pleasure or displeasure in an idea is
