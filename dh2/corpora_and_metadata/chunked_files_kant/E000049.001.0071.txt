the same thing as admiration but if we look closer we shall observe that it is always uncertain how much of the ability is due to native talent and how much to diligence in cultivating it reason represents it to us as probably the fruit of cultivation and therefore as meritorious and this notably reduces our selfconceit and either casts a reproach on us or urges us to follow such an example in the way that is suitable to us this respect then which we show to such a person properly speaking to the law that his example exhibits is not mere admiration and this is confirmed also by the fact that when the common run of admirers think they have learned from any source the badness of such a mans character for instance voltaires they give up all respect for him whereas the true scholar still feels it at least with regard to his talents because he is himself engaged in a business and a vocation 0 which make imitation of such a man in some degree a law respect for the moral law is therefore the only and the undoubted moral motive and this feeling is directed to no object except on the ground of this law the moral law first determines the will objectively and directly in the judgment of reason and freedom whose causality can be determined only by the law consists just in this that it restricts all inclinations and consequently selfesteem by the condition of obedience to its pure law this restriction now has an effect on feeling and produces the impression of displeasure which can be known à priori from the moral law since it is so far only a negative effect which arising from the influence of pure practical reason checks the activity of the subject so far as it is determined by inclinations and hence checks the opinion of his personal worth which in the absence of agreement with the moral law is reduced to nothing hence the effect of this law on feeling is merely humiliation we can therefore perceive this à priori but can not know by it the force of the pure practical law as a motive but only the resistance to motives of the sensibility but since the same law is objectively that is in the conception of pure reason an immediate principle of determination of the will and consequently this humiliation takes place only relatively to the purity of the law hence the lowering of the pretensions of moral selfesteem that is humiliation on the sensible side is an elevation of the moral i e practical esteem for the law itself on the intellectual side in a word it is respect for the law and therefore as its cause is intellectual a positive feeling which can be known à priori for whatever diminishes the obstacles to an activity furthers this activity itself 0 now the recognition of the moral law is the consciousness of an activity of practical reason from objective principles which only fails to reveal its effect in actions because subjective pathological causes hinder it respect for the moral law then must be regarded as a positive though indirect effect of it on feeling inasmuch as this respect weakens the impeding influence of inclinations by humiliating selfesteem and hence also as a subjective principle of activity that is as a motive to obedience to the law and as a principle of the maxims of a life conformable to it from the notion of a motive arises that of an interest which can never be attributed to any being unless it possesses reason and which signifies a motive of the will in so far as it is conceived by the reason since in a morally good will the law itself must be the motive the moral interest is a pure interest of practical reason alone independent on sense on the notion of an interest is based that of a maxim this therefore is morally good only in case it rests simply on the interest taken in obedience to the law all three notions however that of a motive of an interest and of a maxim can be applied only to finite beings for they all suppose a limitation of the nature of the being in that the subjective character of his choice does not of itself agree with the objective law of a practical reason they suppose that the being requires to be impelled to action by something because an internal obstacle opposes itself therefore they can not be applied to the divine will there is something so singular in the unbounded esteem for the pure moral law apart from all advantage as it is presented for our obedience by practical reason the voice of which makes even the boldest sinner tremble and compels him to hide himself from it 0 that we can not wonder if we find this influence of a mere intellectual idea on the feelings quite incomprehensible to speculative reason and have to be satisfied with seeing so much of this à priori that such a feeling is inseparably connected with the conception of the moral law in every finite rational being if this feeling of respect were pathological and therefore were a feeling of pleasure based on the inner sense it would be in vain to try to discover a connexion of it with any idea à priori but it is a feeling that applies merely to what is practical and depends on the conception of a law simply as to its form not on account of any object and therefore can not be reckoned either as pleasure or pain and yet produces an interest in obedience to the law which we call the moral interest just as the capacity of taking such an interest in the law or respect for the moral law itself is properly the moral feeling or sentiment the consciousness of a free submission of the
