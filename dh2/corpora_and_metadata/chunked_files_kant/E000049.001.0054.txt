selflove to the happiness of others remark ii the direct opposite of the principle of morality is when the principle of private happiness is made the determining principle of the will and with this is to be reckoned as i have shown above everything that places the determining principle which is to serve as a law anywhere but in the legislative form of the maxim this contradiction however is not merely logical like that which would arise between rules empirically conditioned if they were raised to the rank of necessary principles of cognition but is practical and would ruin morality altogether were not the voice of reason in reference to the will so clear so irrepressible so distinctly audible even to the commonest men it can only indeed be maintained in the perplexing speculations of the schools which are bold enough to shut their ears against that heavenly voice in order to support a theory that costs no trouble suppose that an acquaintance whom you otherwise liked were to attempt to justify himself to you for having borne false witness first by alleging the in his view sacred duty of consulting his own happiness then by enumerating the advantages which he had gained thereby pointing out the prudence he had shown in securing himself against detection even by yourself to whom he now reveals the secret only in order that he may be able to deny it at any time and suppose he were then to affirm in all seriousness that he has fulfilled a true human duty you would either laugh in his face or shrink back from him with disgust and yet if a man has regulated his principles of action solely with a view to his own advantage you would have nothing whatever to object against this mode of proceeding or suppose some one recommends you a man as steward as a man to whom you can blindly trust all your affairs and in order to inspire you with confidence extols him as a prudent man who thoroughly understands his own interest and is so indefatigably active that he lets slip no opportunity of advancing it lastly lest you should be afraid of finding a vulgar selfishness in him praises the good taste with which he lives not seeking his pleasure in moneymaking or in coarse wantonness but in the enlargement of his knowledge in instructive intercourse with a select circle and even in relieving the needy while as to the means which of course derive all their value from the end he is not particular and is ready to use other peoples money for the purpose as if it were his own provided only he knows that he can do so safely and without discovery you would either believe that the recommender was mocking you or that he had lost his senses so sharply and clearly marked are the boundaries of morality and selflove that even the commonest eye can not fail to distinguish whether a thing belongs to the one or the other the few remarks that follow may appear superfluous where the truth is so plain but at least they may serve to give a little more distinctness to the judgment of common sense the principle of happiness may indeed furnish maxims but never such as would be competent to be laws of the will even if universal happiness were made the object for since the knowledge of this rests on mere empirical data since every mans judgment on it depends very much on his particular point of view which is itself moreover very variable it can supply only general rules not universal that is it can give rules which on the average will most frequently fit but not rules which must hold good always and necessarily hence no practical laws can be founded on it just because in this case an object of choice is the foundation of the rule and must therefore precede it the rule can refer to nothing but what is felt and therefore it refers to experience and is founded on it and then the variety of judgment must be endless this principle therefore does not prescribe the same practical rules to all rational beings although the rules are all included under a common title namely that of happiness the moral law however is conceived as objectively necessary only because it holds for everyone that has reason and will the maxim of selflove prudence only advises the law of morality commands now there is a great difference between that which we are advised to do and that to which we are obliged the commonest intelligence can easily and without hesitation see what on the principle of autonomy of the will requires to be done but on supposition of heteronomy of the will it is hard and requires knowledge of the world to see what is to be done that is to say what duty is in plain of itself to everyone but what is to bring true durable advantage such as will extend to the whole of ones existence 0 is always veiled in impenetrable obscurity and much prudence is required to adapt the practical rule founded on it to the ends of life even tolerably by making proper exceptions but the moral law commands the most punctual obedience from everyone it must therefore not be so difficult to judge what it requires to be done that the commonest unpractised understanding even without worldly prudence should fail to apply it rightly it is always in everyones power to satisfy the categorical command of morality whereas it is but seldom possible and by no means so to everyone to satisfy the empirically conditioned precept of happiness even with regard to a single purpose the reason is that in the former case there is question only of the maxim which must be genuine and pure but in the latter case there is question also of ones capacity and physical power to
