undetermined namely the law for a causality the concept of which in the latter was only negative and therefore for the first time gives this concept objective reality this sort of credential of the moral law viz that it is set forth as a principle of the deduction of freedom which is a causality of pure reason is a sufficient substitute for all à priori justification since theoretic reason was compelled to assume at least the possibility of freedom in order to satisfy a want of its own for the moral law proves its reality so as even to satisfy the critique of the speculative reason by the fact that it adds a positive definition to a causality previously conceived only negatively the possibility of which was incomprehensible to speculative reason which yet was compelled to suppose it for it adds the notion of a reason that directly determines the will by imposing on its maxims the condition of a universal legislative form and thus it is able for the first time to give objective though only practical reality to reason which always became transcendent when it sought to proceed speculatively with its ideas it thus changes the transcendent use of reason into an immanent use so that reason is itself by means of ideas an efficient cause in the field of experience the determination of the causality of beings in the world of sense as such can never be unconditioned and yet for every series of conditions there must be something unconditioned and therefore there must be a causality which is determined wholly by itself hence the idea of freedom as a faculty of absolute spontaneity was not found to be a want but as far as its possibility is concerned an analytic principle of pure speculative reason but as it is absolutely impossible to find in experience any example in accordance with this idea because amongst the causes of things as phenomena it would be impossible to meet with any absolutely unconditioned determination of causality we were only able to defend our supposition that a freely acting cause might be a being in the world of sense in so far as it is considered in the other point of view as a noumenon showing that there is no contradiction in regarding all its actions as subject to physical conditions so far as they are phenomena and yet regarding its causality as physically unconditioned in so far as the acting being belongs to the world of understanding and in thus making the concept of freedom the regulative principle of reason by this principle i do not indeed learn what the object is to which that sort of causality is attributed but i remove the difficulty for on the one side in the explanation of events in the world and consequently also of the actions of rational beings i leave to the mechanism of physical necessity the right of ascending from conditioned to condition ad infinitum while on the other side i keep open for speculative reason the place which for it is vacant namely the intelligible in order to transfer the unconditioned thither but i was not able to verify this supposition that is to change it into the knowledge of a being so acting not even into the knowledge of the possibility of such a being this vacant place is now filled by pure practical reason with a definite law of causality in an intelligible world causality with freedom namely the moral law speculative reason does not hereby gain anything as regards its insight but only as regards the certainty of its problematical notion of freedom which here obtains objective reality which though only practical is nevertheless undoubted even the notion of causality—the application and consequently the signification of which holds properly only in relation to phenomena so as to connect them into experiences as is shown by the critique of pure reason—is not so enlarged as to extend its use beyond these limits for if reason sought to do this it would have to show how the logical relation of principle and consequence can be used synthetically in a different sort of intuition from the sensible that is how a causa noumenon is possible this it can never do and as practical reason it does not even concern itself with it since it only places the determining principle of causality of man as a sensible creature which is given in pure reason which is therefore called practical and therefore it employs the notion of cause not in order to know objects but to determine causality in relation to objects in general it can abstract altogether from the application of this notion to objects with a view to theoretical knowledge since this concept is always found à priori in the understanding even independently on any intuition reason then employs it only for a practical purpose and hence we can transfer the determining principle of the will into the intelligible order of things admitting at the same time that we can not understand how the notion of cause can determine the knowledge of these things but reason must cognise causality with respect to the actions of the will in the sensible world in a definite manner otherwise practical reason could not really produce any action but as to the notion which it forms of its own causality as noumenon it need not determine it theoretically with a view to the cognition of its 0 supersensible existence so as to give it significance in this way for it acquires significance apart from this though only for practical use namely through the moral law theoretically viewed it remains always a pure à priori concept of the understanding which can be applied to objects whether they have been given sensibly or not although in the latter case it has no definite theoretical significance or application but is only a formal though essential conception of the understanding relating to an object in general
