make its rule a tyranny remark virtue is always in progress and yet always begins from the beginning the former follows from the fact that objectively considered it is an ideal and unattainable and yet it is a duty constantly to approximate to it the second characteristic is founded subjectively on the nature of man which is affected by inclinations under the influence of which virtue with its maxims adopted once for all can never settle in a position of rest but if it is not rising inevitably falls because moral maxims can not like technical be based on custom for this belongs to the physical character of the determination of will but even if the practice of them become a custom the agent would thereby lose the freedom in the choice of his maxims which freedom is the character of an action done from duty the two remaining sections discuss the proper division of ethics and have no interest apart from the treatise to which they are introductory they are therefore not translated i add some remarks on conscience taken from the tugendlehre itself on conscience the consciousness of an internal tribunal in man before which his thoughts accuse or excuse one another is conscience every man has a conscience and finds himself observed by an inward judge which threatens and keeps him in awe reverence combined with fear and this power which watches over the laws within him is not something which he himself arbitrarily makes but it is incorporated in his being it follows him like his shadow when he thinks to escape he may indeed stupefy himself with pleasures and distractions but can not avoid now and then coming to himself or awaking and then he at once perceives its awful voice in his utmost depravity he may indeed pay no attention to it but he can not avoid hearing it now this original intellectual and as a conception of duty moral capacity called conscience has this peculiarity in it that although its business is a business of man with himself yet he finds himself compelled by his reason to transact it as if at the command of another person for the transaction here is the conduct of a trial causa before a tribunal but that he who is accused by his conscience should be conceived as one and the same person with the judge is an absurd conception of a judicial court for then the complainant would always lose his case therefore in all duties the conscience of the man must regard another than himself as the judge of his actions if it is to avoid selfcontradiction now this other may be an actual or a merely ideal person which reason frames to itself such an idealized person the authorized judge of conscience must be one who knows the heart for the tribunal is set up in the inward part of man at the same time he must also be allobliging that is must be or be conceived as a person in respect of whom all duties are to be regarded as his commands since conscience is the inward judge of all free actions now since such a moral being must at the same time possess all power in heaven and earth since otherwise he could not give his commands their proper effect which the office of judge necessarily requires and since such a moral being possessing power over all is called god hence conscience must be conceived as the subjective principle of a responsibility for ones deeds before god nay this latter concept is contained though it be only obscurely in every moral selfconsciousnessâ€”tugendlehre p ff first part of the philosophical theory of religion of the indwelling of the bad principle along with the good or on the radical evil in human nature 0 that the world lieth in wickedness is a complaint as old as history even as what is still older poetry indeed as old as the oldest of all poems sacerdotal religion all alike nevertheless make the world begin from good with the golden age with life in paradise or one still more happy in communion with heavenly beings but they represent this happy state as soon vanishing like a dream and then they fall into badness moral badness which is always accompanied by physical as hastening to worse and worse with accelerated steps so that we are now living this now being however as old as history in the last times the last day and the destruction of the world are at the door and in some parts of hindostan 0 the judge and destroyer of the world rudra otherwise called siva is already worshipped as the god that is at present in power the preserver of the world namely vishnu having centuries ago laid down his office of which he was weary and which he had received from the creator of the world brahma later but much less general is the opposite heroic opinion which has perhaps obtained currency only amongst philosophers and in our times chiefly amongst instructors of youth that the world is constantly advancing in precisely the reverse direction namely from worse to better though almost insensibly at least that the capacity for such advance exists in human nature this opinion however is certainly not founded on experience if what is meant is moral good or evil not civilization for the history of all times speaks too powerfully against it but it is probably a goodnatured hypothesis of moralists from seneca to rousseau so as to urge man to the unwearied cultivation of the germ of good that perhaps lies in us if one can reckon on such a natural foundation in man there is also the consideration that as we must assume that man is by nature that is as he is usually born sound in body there is thought to be no reason why we should not assume that he is also by nature
