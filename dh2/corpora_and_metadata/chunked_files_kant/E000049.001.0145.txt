stone of sisyphus and this view makes the earth a sort of purgatory for old and forgotten sins he proceeds thus i shall venture to assume that as the human race is constantly advancing in respect of culture as it is designed to do so also as regards the moral end of its existence it is constantly progressing and this progress is never broken off although it may be sometimes interrupted it is not necessary for me to prove this it is for those who take the opposite view to prove their case viz because it is my duty to strive to promote this improvement p many proofs too may be given that the human race on the whole especially in our own as compared with all preceding times has made considerable advances morally for the better temporary checks do not prove anything against this and that the cry of the continuallyincreasing degradation of the race arises just from this that when one stands on a higher step of morality he sees further before him and his judgment on what men are as compared with what they ought to be is more strict our selfblame is consequently more severe the more steps of morality we have already ascended in the whole course of the worlds history as known to us p that the primary subjective source of the adoption of moral maxims is inscrutable may be seen even from this that as this adoption is free its source the reason why ex gr i have adopted a bad and not rather a good maxim must not be looked for in any natural impulse but always again in a maxim and as this also must have its ground and maxims are the only determining principles of the free elective will that can or ought to be adduced we are always driven further back ad infinitum in the series of subjective determining principles without being able to reach the primary source if good a its contradictory is the notgood this is the result either of the mere absence of a principle of good 0 or of a positive principle of the opposite a in the latter case the notgood may be called the positively bad in respect of pleasure and pain there is a mean of this kind so that pleasure a pain a and the state of absence of both is indifference 0 now if the moral law were not a spring of the elective will in us then moral good harmony of the will with the law would a notgood 0 and the latter would be merely the result of the absence of a moral spring a 0 but the law is in us as a spring a therefore the want of harmony of the elective will with it 0 is only possible as a result of a really opposite determination of elective will that is a resistance to it a that is to say only by a bad elective will there is therefore no mean between a bad and a good disposition inner principle of maxims by which the morality of the action must be determined a morally indifferent action adiaphoron morale would be an action resulting merely from natural laws and standing therefore in no relation to the moral law which is a law of freedom inasmuch as it is not a deed and in respect of it neither command nor prohibition nor even legal permission has any place or is necessary professor schiller in his masterly treatise thalia pt on pleasantness grace and dignity in morals finds fault with this way of presenting obligation as if it implied a carthusian spirit but as we are agreed in the most important principles i can not admit that there is any disagreement in this if we could only come to a mutual understanding i admit that i can not associate any pleasantness with the conception of duty just because of its dignity for it involves unconditional obligation which is directly contrary to pleasantness the majesty of the law like that on sinai inspires not dread which repels nor yet a charm which invites to familiarity but awe which awakes respect of the subject for his lawgiver and in the present case the latter being within ourselves a feeling of the sublimity of our own destiny which attracts us more than any beauty but virtue i e the firmlyrooted disposition to fulfil our duty punctually is in its results beneficent also more than anything in the world that can be done by nature or art and the noble picture of humanity exhibited in this form admits very well the accompaniments of the graces but as long as duty alone is in question they keep at a respectful distance if however we regard the pleasant results which virtue would spread in the world if it found access everywhere then morallydirected reason draws the sensibility into play by means of the imagination it is only after vanquishing monsters that hercules becomes musagetes before which labour those good sisters draw back these companions of venus urania are lewd followers of venus dione as soon as they interfere in the business of the determination of duty and want to supply the springs thereof if it is now asked of what sort is the emotional characteristic the temperament as it were of virtue is it spirited and cheerful or anxiously depressed and dejected an answer is hardly necessary the latter slavish spirit can never exist without a secret hatred of the law and cheerfulness of heart in the performance of ones duty not complacency in the recognition of it is a mark of the genuineness of the virtuous disposition even in devoutness which does not consist in the selftormenting of the penitent sinner which is very ambiguous and commonly is only an inward reproach for having offended against the rules of prudence but in the firm purpose to do better in the future which animated
