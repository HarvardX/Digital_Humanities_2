in its practical use and consequently as proceeding from à priori principles and not from empirical principles of determination hence the division of the analytic of pure practical reason must resemble that of a syllogism namely proceeding from the universal in the major premiss the moral principle through a minor premiss containing a subsumption of possible actions as good or evil under the former to the conclusion namely the subjective determination of the will an interest in the possible practical good and in the maxim founded on it he who has been able to convince himself of the truth of the positions occurring in the analytic 0 will take pleasure in such comparisons for they justly suggest the expectation that we may perhaps some day be able to discern the unity of the whole faculty of reason theoretical as well as practical and be able to derive all from one principle which is what human reason inevitably demands as it finds complete satisfaction only in a perfectly systematic unity of its knowledge if now we consider also the contents of the knowledge that we can have of a pure practical reason and by means of it as shown by the analytic we find along with a remarkable analogy between it and the theoretical no less remarkable differences as regards the theoretical the faculty of a pure rational cognition à priori could be easily and evidently proved by examples from sciences in which as they put their principles to the test in so many ways by methodical use there is not so much reason as in common knowledge to fear a secret mixture of empirical principles of cognition but that pure reason without the admixture of any empirical principle is practical of itself this could only be shown from the commonest practical use of reason by verifying the fact that every mans natural reason acknowledges the supreme practical principle as the supreme law of his will a law completely à priori and not depending on any sensible data it was necessary first to establish and verify the purity of its origin even in the judgment of this common reason before science could take it in hand to make use of it as a fact that is prior to all disputation about its possibility and all the consequences that may be drawn from it but this circumstance may be readily explained from what has just been said because practical pure reason must necessarily begin with principles which therefore must be the first data the foundation of all science and can not be derived from it it was possible to effect this verification of moral principles as principles of a pure reason quite well and with sufficient certainty by a single appeal to the judgment of common sense for this reason that anything empirical which might slip into our maxims as a determining principle of the will can be detected at once by the feeling of pleasure or pain which necessarily attaches to it as exciting desire whereas pure practical reason positively refuses to admit this feeling into its principle as a condition the heterogeneity of the determining principles the empirical and rational is clearly detected by this resistance of a practically legislating reason against every admixture of inclination and by a peculiar kind of sentiment which however does not precede the legislation of the practical reason but on the contrary is produced by this as a constraint namely by the feeling of a respect such as no man has for inclinations of whatever kind but for the law only and it is detected in so marked and prominent a manner that even the most uninstructed can not fail to see at once in an example presented to him that empirical principles of volition may indeed urge him to follow their attractions but that he can never be expected to obey anything but the pure practical law of reason alone the distinction between the doctrine of happiness and the doctrine of morality ethics in the former of which empirical principles constitute the entire foundation while in the second they do not form the smallest part of it is the first and most important office of the analytic of pure practical reason and it must proceed in it with as much exactness and so to speak scrupulousness as any geometer in his work the philosopher however has greater difficulties to contend with here as always in rational cognition by means of concepts merely without construction because he can not take any intuition as a foundation for a pure noumenon he has however this advantage that like the chemist he can at any time make an experiment with every mans practical reason for the purpose of distinguishing the moral pure principle of determination from the empirical namely by adding the moral law as a determining principle to the empirically affected will eg that of the man who would be ready to lie because he can gain something thereby it is as if the analyst added alkali to a solution of lime in hydrochloric acid the acid at once forsakes the lime combines with the alkali and the lime is precipitated just in the same way if to a man who is otherwise honest or who for this occasion places himself only in thought in the position of an honest man we present the moral law by which he recognizes the worthlessness of the liar his practical reason in forming a judgment of what ought to be done at once forsakes the advantage combines with that which maintains in him respect for his own person truthfulness and the advantage after it has been separated and washed from every particle of reason which is altogether on the side of duty is easily weighed by everyone so that it can enter into combination with reason in other cases only not where it could be opposed to the moral law which reason never forsakes but most closely unites itself
