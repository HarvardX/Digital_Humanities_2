to the surrounding space and in amount one degree if the bodies are unequal and have unequal velocities we have only to divide the velocities in the inverse proportion of the masses and assign to the space the motion which we take from one to add to the other and the result will again be mutual rest which is equivalent to a motion of the bodies in contact with a velocity equal and opposite to what we have assigned to the space we can in this way banish altogether the notion of vis inertiœ matter could not exist unless there were both a repulsive force and an attractive force if attraction only existed matter would be condensed into a point xxxviii if repulsion only it would be dispersed infinitely the relative incompressibility of matter is nothing but the repulsive force emanating from points which increases as the distance diminishes perhaps inversely as the cube and would therefore require an infinite pressure to overcome it altogether physical contact is the immediate action and reaction of incompressibility the action of matter on matter without contact is what is called actio in distans and the attraction of gravitation is of this kind both attraction and repulsion being elementary forces are inexplicable but the force of attraction is not a whit more incomprehensible than the original repulsive force incompressibility appears more comprehensible solely because it is immediately presented to the senses whereas attraction is only inferred it seems at first sight a contradiction to say that a body can act where it is not but in fact we might rather say that everything in space acts where it is not for to act where it is it should occupy the very same space as the thing acted on to say that there can be no action without physical contact is as much as to say that matter can act only by the force of incompressibility in other words that repulsive forces are either the only forces of matter or the conditions of all its action which is a groundless assertion the ground of the mistake is a confusion between mathematical contact and physical contact that bodies attract one another without contact means that they approach one another according to a certain law without any force of repulsion being required as a condition and this is just as conceivable as that they should separate from xxxix one another without an attractive force being supposed as a condition kant however thought it conceivable that in the case of chemical solution there might be complete interpenetration or intussusception on this view of matter we may he remarks regard matter as infinitely divisible the fundamental principles of the metaphysic of morals had appeared the year before the lastmentioned work and was followed in by the critical examination of practical reason both these are translated in the present volume the few remarks i have to offer on them will be found at the end of the memoir in 0 was published the critical examination of the faculty of judgment the essay on the corruption of human nature which forms the third part of this volume appeared in in a berlin magazine four years before this an edict had been issued limiting the freedom of the press and appointing special censors whose xl business was to examine as to the orthodoxy not only of books but of professors lecturers and theological candidates the magazine in question was printed in jena but in order to avoid any appearance of underhand dealing kant expressly desired that his essay should be submitted to the berlin licensing authority who gave his imprimatur on the ground that only deep thinkers read kants works the second part of the work on the theory of religion was referred to the theological censor who refused his imprimatur kant accordingly submitted his essay to the censorship of the theological faculty of königsberg and this unanimously sanctioned the publication which reached a second edition in the following year the berlin censors were naturally annoyed at this way of escaping their decision and the severe remarks in the preface did not tend to conciliate them a few months afterwards kant received an order from the king frederick william ii forbidding him to teach or write anything further in this manner kant did not mention the order even to his intimate friends a slip of paper found after his death contained this reflection to deny ones inner conviction is mean but in such a case as this silence is the duty of a subject and although a man must say only what is true it is not always a duty to say all the truth publicly he therefore in his reply to the king declared that to avoid all suspicion he as his majestys most loyal subject solemnly engaged to refrain from writing or lecturing on religion natural or revealed the words as your majestys most loyal subject were inserted with the intention of limiting his engagement to the life of xli the king and on the death of frederick william in kant regarded himself as free and published his contest of the faculties i e of the academical faculties in kant ceased to lecture publicly in the same year he published his metaphysical elements of morals which treats of the several virtues and vices in detail and metaphysical elements of law after the publication of these he seems to have been regarded as a counsellor to be consulted in all difficulties and an authority in all questions of conscience the pains he took to give real assistance in such cases both by his own reflection and by inquiring from his colleagues are attested by his written and often corrected memoranda as an example may be mentioned the question whether inoculation was morally allowable or not this question was addressed to him at the same time by a professor of medicine in halle and by a young nobleman who was going to
