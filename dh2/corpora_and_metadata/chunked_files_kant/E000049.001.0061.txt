much farther and embraced the whole field of pure theoretical reason in its synthetic use and consequently the field of what is called metaphysics in general i proceeded in the following manner with respect to the doubts raised by the scottish philosopher touching the notion of causality if hume took the objects of experience for things in themselves as is almost always done he was quite right in declaring the notion of cause to be a deception and false illusion for as to things in themselves and their attributes as such it is impossible to see why because a is given b which is different must necessarily be also given and therefore he could by no means admit such an à priori knowledge of things in themselves still less could this acute writer allow an empirical origin of this concept since this is directly contradictory to the necessity of connexion which constitutes the essence of the notion of causality hence the notion was proscribed and in its place was put custom in the observation of the course of perceptions it resulted however from my inquiries that the objects with which we have to do in experience are by no means things in themselves but merely phenomena and that although in the case of things in themselves it is impossible to see how if a is supposed it should be contradictory that b which is quite different from a should not also be supposed i e to see the necessity of the connexion between a as cause and b as effect yet it can very well be conceived that as phenomena they may be necessarily connected in one experience in a certain way e g with regard to timerelations so that they could not be separated without contradicting that connexion by means of which this experience is possible in which they are objects and in which alone they are cognisable by us and so it was found to be in fact so that i was able not only to prove the objective reality of the concept of cause in regard to objects of experience but also to deduce it as an à priori concept by reason of the necessity of the connexion it implied that is to show the possibility of its origin from pure understanding without any empirical sources and thus after removing the source of empiricism i was able also to overthrow the inevitable consequence of this namely scepticism first with regard to physical science and then with regard to mathematics in which empiricism has just the same grounds both being sciences which have reference to objects of possible experience herewith overthrowing the thorough doubt of whatever theoretic reason professes to discern but how is it with the application of this category of causality and all the others for without them there can be no knowledge of anything existing to things which are not objects of possible experience but lie beyond its bounds for i was able to deduce the objective reality of these concepts only with regard to objects of possible experience but even this very fact that i have saved them only in case i have proved that objects may by means of them be thought though not determined à priori this it is that gives them a place in the pure understanding by which they are referred to objects in general sensible or not sensible if anything is still wanting it is that which is the condition of the application of these categories and especially that of causality to objects namely intuition for where this is not given the application with a view to theoretic knowledge of the object as a noumenon is impossible and therefore if anyone ventures on it is as in the critique of the pure reason absolutely forbidden still the objective reality of the concept of causality remains and it can be used even of noumena but without our being able in the least to define the concept theoretically so as to produce knowledge for that this concept even in reference to an object contains nothing impossible was shown by this that even while applied to objects of sense its seat was certainly fixed in the pure understanding and although when referred to things in themselves which can not be objects of experience it is not capable of being determined so as to represent a definite object for the purpose of theoretic knowledge yet for any other purpose for instance a practical it might be capable of being determined so as to have such application this could not be the case if as hume maintained this concept of causality contained something absolutely impossible to be thought in order now to discover this condition of the application of the said concept to noumena we need only recall why we are not content with its application to objects of experience but desire also to apply it to things in themselves it will appear then that it is not a theoretic but a practical purpose that makes this a necessity in speculation even if we were successful in it we should not really gain anything in the knowledge of nature or generally with regard to such objects as are given but we should make a wide step from the sensibly conditioned in which we have already enough to do to maintain ourselves and to follow carefully the chain of causes to the supersensible in order to complete our knowledge of principles and to fix its limits whereas there always remains an infinite chasm unfilled between those limits and what we know and we should have hearkened to a vain curiosity rather than a solid desire of knowledge but besides the relation in which the understanding stands to objects in theoretical knowledge it has also a relation to the faculty of desire which is therefore called the will and the pure will inasmuch as pure understanding in this case called reason is practical through the mere
