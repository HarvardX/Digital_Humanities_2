be married and whose bride wished to be inoculated kants reply is not known although some memoranda for it exist after this time he began to feel the burden of age and his powers mental and bodily gradually failed he was quite aware of his condition and resigned gentlemen said he one day i do not fear to die i assure you as in the presence of god that if on this very night suddenly the summons to death were to reach me i should bear it with calmness should raise my hands to heaven and say blessed be god were it indeed possible that such a whisper as this xlii could reach my ear—fourscore years thou hast lived in which time thou hast inflicted much evil upon thy fellowmen the case would be otherwise this was spoken says wasianski in a tone of earnest sincerity two days after his seventyninth birthday he wrote in his memoranda according to the bible our life lasts seventy years and if very long fourscore years and though it was pleasant it has been labour and sorrow up to this time he was able to read the smallest print without spectacles although he had lost the sight of one eye nearly twenty years before but soon after he had written this memorandum his sight also failed and he died in february 0 in his eightieth year his body was so dried up that the physicians said they had hardly ever seen so wasted a body indeed he had himself said jestingly some years before that he thought he had reached the minimum of muscular substance kant was of weak frame and still weaker muscular power he was barely five feet in height his chest was flat almost concave the right shoulder slightly crooked his complexion fresh his forehead high square and broad while his piercing blue eyes made so lively an impression that it was long remembered by some of his pupils even after he had lost the sight of one eye the defect was not visible to a stranger in consequence of his contracted chest he suffered from a feeling of oppression which early in life caused a tendency to hypochondria to such an xliii extent as even to make him feel weary of life this however he overcame by force of thought when engaged on the kritik in he speaks of his health being seriously impaired and some years later he says that it is unceasingly broken yet by dint of careful attention and great regularity he was able without medical aid to maintain such good health on the whole that at a later period he used to say to himself on going to bed is it possible to conceive any human being enjoying better health than i do his maxim for preserving health was sustine et abstine his practice illustrated this the two indulgences of which he was found were tobacco and coffee but of the former he limited himself to a single pipe in the morning whilst he altogether abstained from the latter until far advanced in life thinking it injurious to health at the age of seventy he wrote an essay on the power of the mind to master the feeling of illness by force of resolution the essay was originally addressed to hufeland the celebrated author of the treatise on the art of prolonging life and the principles contained in it are exemplified from kants own experience he attached great importance to the habit of breathing through the nostrils instead of through the mouth and asserted that he had by this means overcome a tendency to cough and cold in the head there is more truth in this than is perhaps generally thought kant however is said to have xliv regarded it as of so much importance that he did not like to have a companion in his daily walk lest he should have to open his mouth the true reason of this preference in later life only for solitary walks was beyond doubt that which is mentioned in this essay that it is undesirable to exercise the limbs and the brain or the brain and the stomach at the same time his punctilious attention to health is amusingly illustrated by the artifice he used for suspending his stockings thinking that garters injuriously impeded the circulation he had a couple of bands attached to each stocking and passing through a hole in the pocket of his breeches inside the pocket they were connected with a spring enclosed in a box and this spring regulated the tension that he might not be without some exercise in his study he habitually left his handkerchief at the other side of the room so that now and then he should have to get up and walk to it on the same principle his hours of sleep c were adhered to with the utmost regularity he went to bed punctually at ten and rose punctually at five his servant had orders not to let him sleep longer on any account and on being asked once by kant in presence of guests testified that for thirty years his master had never once indulged beyond the appointed hour on rising he took a cup indefinite cups of tea but no solid food the early hours were devoted to preparation for his lectures which in his earlier years occupied four or five hours but subsequently only two at seven oclock precisely or eight as the case might be he entered his lectureroom lectures ended at nine or ten he returned to his study and applied himself to preparing his books for the press xlv he worked thus without interruption until one oclock the hour for dinner this was his only meal and he liked to have pleasant company and to prolong the meal ducere cœnam with lively sometimes brilliant conversation for three or four hours kant had no boswell and nothing is preserved of these conversations
