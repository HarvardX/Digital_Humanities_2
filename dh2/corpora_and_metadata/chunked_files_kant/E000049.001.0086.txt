the most intimate delight and his scheme of pleasure by which he meant constant cheerfulness of mind included the moderation and control of the inclinations such as the strictest moral philosopher might require he differed from the stoics chiefly in making this pleasure the motive which they very rightly refused to do for on the one hand the virtuous epicurus like many wellintentioned men of this day who do not reflect deeply enough on their principles fell into the error of presupposing the virtuous disposition in the persons for whom he wished to provide the springs to virtue and indeed the upright man can not be happy if he is not first conscious of his uprightness since with such a character the reproach that his habit of thought would oblige him to make against himself in case of transgression and his moral selfcondemnation would rob him of all enjoyment of the pleasantness which his condition might otherwise contain but the question is how is such a disposition possible in the first instance and such a habit of thought in estimating the worth of ones existence since prior to it there can be in the subject no feeling at all for moral worth if a man is virtuous without being conscious of his integrity in every action he will certainly not enjoy life however favourable fortune may be to him in its physical circumstances but can we make him virtuous in the first instance in other words before he esteems the moral worth of his existence so highly by praising to him the peace of mind that would result from the consciousness of an integrity for which he has no sense on the other hand however there is here an occasion of a vitium subreptionis and as it were of an optical illusion in the selfconsciousness of what one does as distinguished from what one feels an illusion which even the most experienced can not altogether avoid the moral disposition of mind is necessarily combined with a consciousness that the will is determined directly by the law now the consciousness of a determination of the faculty of desire is always the source of a satisfaction in the resulting action but this pleasure this satisfaction in oneself is not the determining principle of the action on the contrary the determination of the will directly by reason is the source of the feeling of pleasure and this remains a pure practical not sensible determination of the faculty of desire now as this determination has exactly the same effect within in impelling to activity that a feeling of the pleasure to be expected from the desired action would have had we easily look on what we ourselves do as something which we merely passively feel and take the moral spring for a sensible impulse just as it happens in the socalled illusion of the senses in this case the inner sense it is a sublime thing in human nature to be determined to actions immediately by a purely rational law sublime even is the illusion that regards the subjective side of this capacity of intellectual determination as something sensible and the effect of a special sensible feeling for an intellectual feeling would be a contradiction it is also of great importance to attend to this property of our personality and as much as possible to cultivate the effect of reason on this feeling but we must beware lest by falsely extolling this moral determining principle as a spring making its source lie in particular feelings of pleasure which are in fact only results we degrade and disfigure the true genuine spring the law itself by putting as it were a false foil upon it respect not pleasure or enjoyment of happiness is something for which it is not possible that reason should have any antecedent feeling as its foundation for this would always be sensible and pathological and consciousness of immediate obligation of the will by the law is by no means analogous to the feeling of pleasure although in relation to the faculty of desire it produces the same effect but from different sources it is only by this mode of conception however that we can attain what we are seeking namely that actions be done not merely in accordance with duty as a result of pleasant feelings but from duty which must be the true end of all moral cultivation have we not however a word which does not express enjoyment as happiness does but indicates a satisfaction in ones existence an analogue of the happiness which must necessarily accompany the consciousness of virtue yes this word is selfcontentment which in its proper signification always designates only a negative satisfaction in ones existence in which one is conscious of needing nothing freedom and the consciousness of it as a faculty of following the moral law with unyielding resolution is independence on inclinations at least as motives determining though not as affecting our desire and so far as i am conscious of this freedom in following my moral maxims it is the only source of an unaltered contentment which is necessarily connected with it and rests on no special feeling this may be called intellectual contentment the sensible contentment improperly socalled which rests on the satisfaction of the inclinations however delicate they may be imagined to be can never be adequate to the conception of it for the inclinations change they grow with the indulgence shown them and always leave behind a still greater void than we had thought to fill hence they are always burdensome to a rational being and although he can not lay them aside they wrest from him the wish to be rid of them even an inclination to what is right e g to beneficence though it may much facilitate the efficacy of the moral maxims can not produce any for in these all must be directed to the conception of the law as a determining principle if
