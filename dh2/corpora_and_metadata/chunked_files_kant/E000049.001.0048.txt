that he should never make a deceitful promise this is a rule which only concerns his will whether the purposes he may have can be attained thereby or not it is the volition only which is to be determined à priori by that rule if now it is found that this rule is practically right then it is a law because it is a categorical imperative thus practical laws refer to the will only without considering what is attained by its causality and we may disregard this latter as belonging to the world of sense in order to have them quite pure § ii — theorem i all practical principles which presuppose an object matter of the faculty of desire as the ground of determination of the will are empirical and can furnish no practical laws by the matter of the faculty of desire i mean an object the realization of which is desired now if the desire for this object precedes the practical rule and is the condition of our making it a principle then i say in the first place this principle 0 is in that case wholly empirical for then what determines the choice is the idea of an object and that relation of this idea to the subject by which its faculty of desire is determined to its realization such a relation to the subject is called the pleasure in the realization of an object this then must be presupposed as a condition of the possibility of determination of the will but it is impossible to know à priori of any idea of an object whether it will be connected with pleasure or pain or be indifferent in such cases therefore the determining principle of the choice must be empirical and therefore also the practical material principle which presupposes it as a condition in the second place since susceptibility to a pleasure or pain can be known only empirically and can not hold in the same degree for all rational beings a principle which is based on this subjective condition may serve indeed as a maxim for the subject which possesses this susceptibility but not as a law even to him because it is wanting in objective necessity which must be recognised à priori it follows therefore that such a principle can never furnish a practical law § iii — theorem ii all material practical principles as such are of one and the same kind and come under the general principle of selflove or private happiness pleasure arising from the idea of the existence of a thing in so far as it is to determine the desire of this thing is founded on the susceptibility of the subject since it depends on the presence of an object hence it belongs to sense feeling and not to understanding which expresses a relation of the idea to an object according to concepts not to the subject according to feelings it is then practical only in so far as the faculty of desire is determined by the sensation of agreeableness which the subject expects from the actual existence of the object now a rational beings consciousness of the pleasantness of life uninterruptedly accompanying his whole existence is happiness and the principle which makes this the supreme ground 0 of determination of the will is the principle of selflove all material principles then which place the determining ground of the will in the pleasure or pain to be received from the existence of any object are all of the same kind 0 inasmuch as they all belong to the principle of selflove or private happiness corollary all material practical rules place the determining principle of the will in the lower desires and if there were no purely formal laws of the will adequate to determine it then we could not admit any higher desire at all remark i it is surprising that men otherwise acute can think it possible to distinguish between higher and lower desires according as the ideas which are connected with the feeling of pleasure have their origin in the senses or in the understanding for when we inquire what are the determining grounds of desire and place them in some expected pleasantness it is of no consequence whence the idea of this pleasing object is derived but only how much it pleases whether an idea has its seat and source in the understanding or not if it can only determine the choice by presupposing a feeling of pleasure in the subject it follows that its capability of determining the choice depends altogether on the nature of the inner sense namely that this can be agreeably affected by it however dissimilar ideas of objects may be though they be ideas of the understanding or even of the reason in contrast to ideas of sense yet the feeling of pleasure by means of which they constitute the determining principle of the will the expected satisfaction which impels the activity to the production of the object is of one and the same kind not only inasmuch as it can be only known empirically but also inasmuch as it affects one and the same vital force which manifests itself in the faculty of desire and in this respect can only differ in degree from every other ground of determination otherwise how could we compare in respect of 0 magnitude two principles of determination the ideas of which depend upon different faculties so as to prefer that which affects the faculty of desire in the highest degree the same man may return unread an instructive book which he can not again obtain in order not to miss a hunt he may depart in the midst of a fine speech in order not to be late for dinner he may leave a rational conversation such as he otherwise values highly to take his place at the gamingtable he may even repulse a poor man whom he at other times takes pleasure in
