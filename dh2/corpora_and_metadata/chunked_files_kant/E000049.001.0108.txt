this principle is also objectively valid can only be recognized by this that when your reason puts it to the test of conceiving yourself as giving therein a universal law it is found to be adapted to this universal legislation the simplicity of this law compared with the great and manifold requirements which can be drawn from it must at first appear surprising as must also the authoritative dignity it presents without carrying with it perceptibly any motive but when in this astonishment at the power of our reason to determine choice by the mere idea of the fitness of a maxim for the universality of a practical law we learn that it is just these practical moral laws that first make known a property of the will which speculative reason could never have arrived at either from à priori grounds or from experience—and if it did arrive at it could by no means prove its possibility whereas those practical laws incontestably prove this property namely freedom—then we shall be less surprised to find these laws like mathematical axioms undemonstrable and yet apodictic and at the same time to see a whole field of practical cognitions opened before us in which reason in its theoretic exercise with the same idea of freedom nay with any other of its supersensible ideas must find everything absolutely closed to it the agreement of an action with the law of duty is its legality legalitas that of the maxim with the law is its morality moralitas maxim is the subjective principle of action which the subject makes a rule to itself namely how he chooses to act on the contrary the principle of duty is that which reason commands him absolutely and therefore objectively how he ought to act the supreme principle of the order is therefore act on a maxim which can also hold good as a universal law every maxim which is not capable of being so is contrary to morality laws proceed from the rational will maxims from the elective will the latter is in man a free elective will the rational will which is directed to nothing but the law only can not be called either free or unfree because it is not directed to actions but immediately to the legislation for the maxims of actions and is therefore practical reason itself consequently it is absolutely necessary and is even incapable of constraint it is therefore only the elective will that can be called free freedom of elective will however can not be defined as the power of choosing to act for or against the law libertas indifferentiæ as some have attempted to define it although the elective will as a phenomenon gives many examples of this in experience for freedom as it becomes known to us first through the moral law is known to us only as a negative property in us namely the property of not being constrained to action by any sensible motives considered as a noumenon however that is as to the faculty of man merely as an intelligence we are quite unable to explain theoretically how it has a constraining power in respect of the sensible elective will—that is we can not explain it in its positive character only this we can very readily understand that although experience tells us that man as an object in the sensible world shows a power of choosing not only according to the law but also in opposition to it nevertheless his freedom as a being in the intelligible world can not be thus defined since phenomena can never enable us to comprehend any supersensible object such as free elective will is we can see also that freedom can never be placed in this that the rational subject is able to choose in opposition to his legislative reason even though experience proves often enough that this does happen a thing however the possibility of which we can not comprehend for it is one thing to admit a fact of experience it is another to make it the principle of a definition in the present case of the concept of free elective will and the universal criterion between this and arbitrium brutum seu servum since in the former case we do not assert that the mark necessarily belongs to the concept which we must do in the latter case freedom in relation to the inner legislation of the reason is alone properly a power the possibility of deviating from this is an impotence how then can the former be defined from the latter a definition which over and above the practical concept adds the exercise of it as learned from experience is a bastard definition definitio hybrida which puts the notion in a false light a law a moral practical law is a proposition which contains a categorical imperative a command he who gives commands by a law imperans is the lawgiver legislator he is the author auctor of the obligation imposed by the law but not always author of the law if he were so the law would be positive contingent and arbitrary the law which binds us à priori and unconditionally by our own reason may also be expressed as proceeding from the will of a supreme lawgiver that is of one who has only rights and no duties namely from the divine will but this only involves the idea of a moral being whose will is law for all without his being conceived as the author of it imputation imputatio in the moral sense is the judgment by which any one is regarded as the author causa libera of an action which is then called a deed factum and to which laws are applicable and if this judgment brings with it the legal consequences of this deed it is a judicial imputation imputatio judiciaria s valida otherwise it is only discriminating imputation imputatio dijudicatoria the person whether physical or moral who has right to exercise judicial imputation
