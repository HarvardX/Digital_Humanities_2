in two different senses on which see whatelys logic appendix art law johann christian von wolf was the author of treatises on philosophy mathematics c which were for a long time the standard textbooks in the german universities his philosophy was founded on that of leibnitz the first proposition was that to have moral worth an action must be done from duty a maxim is the subjective principle of volition the objective principle ie that which would also serve subjectively as a practical principle to all rational beings if reason had full power over the faculty of desire is the practical law it might be here objected to me that i take refuge behind the word respect in an obscure feeling instead of giving a distinct solution of the question by a concept of the reason but although respect is a feeling it is not a feeling received through influence but is selfwrought by a rational concept and therefore is specifically distinct from all feelings of the former kind which may be referred either to inclination or fear what i recognise immediately as a law for me i recognise with respect this merely signifies the consciousness that my will is subordinate to a law without the intervention of other influences on my sense the immediate determination of the will by the law and the consciousness of this is called respect so that this is regarded as an effect of the law on the subject and not as the cause of it respect is properly the conception of a worth which thwarts my selflove accordingly it is something which is considered neither as an object of inclination nor of fear although it has something analogous to both the object of respect is the law only and that the law which we impose on ourselves and yet recognise as necessary in itself as a law we are subjected to it without consulting selflove as imposed by us on ourselves it is a result of our will in the former aspect it has an analogy to fear in the latter to inclination respect for a person is properly only respect for the law of honesty c of which he gives us an example since we also look on the improvement of our talents as a duty we consider that we see in a person of talents as it were the example of a law viz to become like him in this by exercise and this constitutes our respect all socalled moral interest consists simply in respect for the law compare the note to the preface to the critique of the practical reason p a specimen of kants proposed application of the socratic method may be found in mr semples translation of the metaphysic of ethics p 0 just as pure mathematics are distinguished from applied pure logic from applied so if we choose we may also distinguish pure philosophy of morals metaphysic from applied viz applied to human nature by this designation we are also at once reminded that moral principles are not based on properties of human nature but must subsist Ã  priori of themselves while from such principles practical rules must be capable of being deduced for every rational nature and accordingly for that of man i have a letter from the late excellent sulzer in which he asks me what can be the reason that moral instruction although containing much that is convincing for the reason yet accomplishes so little my answer was postponed in order that i might make it complete but it is simply this that the teachers themselves have not got their own notions clear and when they endeavour to make up for this by raking up motives of moral goodness from every quarter trying to make their physic right strong they spoil it for the commonest understanding shows that if we imagine on the one hand an act of honesty done with steadfast mind apart from every view to advantage of any kind in this world or another and even under the greatest temptations of necessity or allurement and on the other hand a similar act which was affected in however low a degree by a foreign motive the former leaves far behind and eclipses the second it elevates the soul and inspires the wish to be able to act in like manner oneself even moderately young children feel this impression and one should never represent duties to them in any other light the dependence of the desires on sensations is called inclination and this accordingly always indicates a want the dependence of a contingently determinable will on principles of reason is called an interest this therefore is found only in the case of a dependent will which does not always of itself conform to reason in the divine will we can not conceive any interest but the human will can also take an interest in a thing without therefore acting from interest the former signifies the practical interest in the action the latter the pathological in the object of the action the former indicates only dependence of the will on principles of reason in themselves the second dependence on principles of reason for the sake of inclination reason supplying only the practical rules how the requirement of the inclination may be satisfied in the first case the action interests me in the second the object of the action because it is pleasant to me we have seen in the first section that in an action done from duty we must look not to the interest in the object but only to that in the action itself and in its rational principle viz the law the word prudence is taken in two senses in the one it may bear the name of knowledge of the world in the other that of private prudence the former is a mans ability to influence others so as to use them for his own purposes the latter is the sagacity
