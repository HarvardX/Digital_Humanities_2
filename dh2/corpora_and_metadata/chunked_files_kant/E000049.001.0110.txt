reduce it again to a doctrine of happiness—in such a way however that a certain moral happiness not resting on empirical causes was ultimately arrived at a selfcontradictory nonentity in fact when the thinking man has conquered the temptations to vice and is conscious of having done his often hard duty he finds himself in a state of peace and satisfaction which may well be called happiness in which virtue is her own reward now says the eudaemonist this delight this happiness is the real motive of his acting virtuously the notion of duty says he does not immediately determine his will it is only by means of the happiness in prospect that he is moved to do his duty now on the other hand since he can promise himself this reward of virtue only from the consciousness of having done his duty it is clear that the latter must have preceded that is he must feel himself bound to do his duty before he thinks and without thinking that happiness will be the consequence of obedience to duty he is thus involved in a circle in his assignment of cause and effect he can only hope to be happy if he is conscious of his obedience to duty and he can only be moved to obedience to duty if he foresees that he will thereby become happy but in this reasoning there is also a contradiction for on the one side he must obey his duty without asking what effect this will have on his happiness consequently from a moral principle on the other side he can only recognize something as his duty when he can reckon on happiness which will accrue to him thereby and consequently on a pathological principle which is the direct opposite of the former i have in another place the berlin monatsschrift reduced as i believe to the simplest expressions the distinction between pathological and moral pleasure the pleasure namely which must precede the obedience to the law in order that one may act according to the law is pathological and the process follows the physical order of nature that which must be preceded by the law in order that it may be felt is in the moral order if this distinction is not observed if eudaemonism the principle of happiness is adopted as the principle instead of eleutheronomy the principle of freedom of the inner legislation the consequence is the euthanasia quiet death of all morality the cause of these mistakes is no other than the following those who are accustomed only to physiological explanations will not admit into their heads the categorical imperative from which these laws dictatorially proceed notwithstanding that they feel themselves irresistibly forced by it dissatisfied at not being able to explain what lies wholly beyond that sphere namely freedom of the elective will elevating as is this privilege that man has of being capable of such an idea they are stirred up by the proud claims of speculative reason which feels its power so strongly in other fields just as if they were allies leagued in defence of the omnipotence of theoretical reason and roused by a general call to arms to resist that idea and thus at present and perhaps for a long time to come though ultimately in vain to attack the moral concept of freedom and if possible render it doubtful introduction to ethics ethics in ancient times signified moral philosophy philosophia moralis sittenlehre generally which was also called the doctrine of duties deontology subsequently it was found advisable to confine this name to a part of moral philosophy namely to the doctrine of duties which are not subject to external laws for which in german the name tugendlehre was found suitable thus the system of general deontology is divided into that of jurisprudence jurisprudentia which is capable of external laws and of ethics which is not thus capable and we may let this division stand 0 i —exposition of the conception of ethics the notion of duty is in itself already the notion of a constraint of the free elective will by the law whether this constraint be an external one or be selfconstraint the moral imperative by its categorical the unconditional ought announces this constraint which therefore does not apply to all rational beings for there may also be holy beings but applies to men as rational physical beings who are unholy enough to be seduced by pleasure to the transgression of the moral law although they themselves recognize its authority and when they do obey it to obey it unwillingly with resistance of their inclination and it is in this that the constraint properly consists now as man is a free moral being the notion of duty can contain only selfconstraint by the idea of the law itself when we look to the internal determination of the will the spring for thus only is it possible to combine that constraint even if it were external with the freedom of the elective will the notion of duty then must be an ethical one the impulses of nature then contain hindrances to the fulfilment of duty in the mind of man and resisting forces some of them powerful and he must judge himself able to combat these and to conquer them by means of reason not in the future but in the present simultaneously with the thought he must judge that he can do what the law unconditionally commands that he ought now the power and resolved purpose to resist a strong but unjust opponent is called fortitude fortitudo and when concerned with the opponent of the moral character within us it is virtue virtus fortitudo moralis accordingly general deontology in that part which brings not external but internal freedom under laws is the doctrine of virtue ethics jurisprudence had to do only with the formal condition of external freedom the condition of consistency with itself if its maxim became a universal law that
