the significance which reason gives it through the moral law is merely practical inasmuch as the idea of the law of causality of the will has self causality or is its determining principle ii —of the right that pure reason in its practical use has to an extension which is not possible to it in its speculative use we have in the moral principle set forth a law of causality the determining principle of which is set above all the conditions of the sensible world we have it conceived how the will as belonging to the intelligible world is determinable and therefore we have its subject man not merely conceived as belonging to a world of pure understanding and in this respect unknown which the critique of speculative reason enabled us to do but also defined as regards his causality by means of a law which can not be reduced to any physical law of the sensible world and therefore our knowledge is extended beyond the limits of that world a pretension which the critique of the pure reason declared to be futile in all speculation now how is the practical use of pure reason here to be reconciled with the theoretical as to the determination of the limits of its faculty david hume of whom we may say that he commenced the assault on the claims of pure reason which made a thorough investigation of it necessary argued thus the notion of cause is a notion that involves the necessity of the connexion of the existence of different things and that in so far as they are different so that given a i know that something quite distinct therefrom namely b must necessarily also exist now necessity can be attributed to a connexion only in so far as it is known à priori for experience would only enable us to know of such a connexion that it exists not that it necessarily exists now it is impossible says he to know à priori and as necessary the connexion between one thing and another or between one attribute and another quite distinct when they have not been given in experience therefore the notion of a cause is fictitious and delusive and to speak in the mildest way is an illusion only excusable inasmuch as the custom a subjective necessity of perceiving certain things or their attributes as often associated in existence along with or in succession to one another is insensibly taken for an objective necessity of supposing such a connexion in the objects themselves and thus the notion of a cause has been acquired surreptitiously and not legitimately nay it can never be so acquired or authenticated since it demands a connexion in itself vain chimerical and untenable in presence of reason and to which no object can ever correspond in this way was empiricism first introduced as the sole source of principles as far as all knowledge of the existence of things is concerned mathematics therefore remaining excepted and with empiricism the most thorough scepticism even with regard to the whole science of nature as philosophy for on such principles we can never conclude from giving attributes of things as existing to a consequence for this would require the notion of cause which involves the necessity of such a connexion we can only guided by imagination except similar cases—an expectation which is never certain however often it has been fulfilled of no event could we say a certain thing must have preceded it on which it necessarily followed that is it must have a cause and therefore however frequent the cases we have known in which there was such an antecedent so that a rule could be derived from them yet we never could suppose it as always and necessarily so happening we should therefore be obliged to leave its share to blind chance with which all use of reason comes to an end and this firmly establishes scepticism in reference to arguments ascending from effects to causes and makes it impregnable mathematics escaped well so far because hume thought that its propositions were analytical that is proceeded from one property to another by virtue of identity and consequently according to the principle of contradiction this however is not the case since on the contrary they are synthetical and although geometry for example has not to do with the existence of things but only with their à priori properties in a possible intuition yet it proceeds just as in the case of the causal notion from one property a to another wholly distinct b as necessarily connected with the former nevertheless mathematical science so highly vaunted for its apodictic certainty must at last fall under this empiricism for the same reason for which hume put custom in the place of objective necessity in the notion of cause and in spite of all its pride must consent to lower its bold pretention of claiming assent à priori and depend for assent to the universality of its propositions on the kindness of observers who when called as witnesses would surely not hesitate to admit that what the geometer propounds as a theorem they have always perceived to be the fact and consequently although it be not necessarily true yet they would permit us to expect it to be true in the future in this manner humes empiricism leads inevitably to scepticism even with regard 0 to mathematics and consequently in every scientific theoretical use of reason for this belongs either to philosophy or mathematics whether with such a terrible overthrow of the chief branches of knowledge common reason will escape better and will not rather become irrecoverably involved in this destruction of all knowledge so that from the same principles a universal scepticism should follow affecting indeed only the learned this i will leave everyone to judge for himself as regards my own labours in the critical examination of pure reason which were occasioned by humes sceptical teaching but went
