although implying certain subjective restrictions and hindrances these however far from concealing it or rendering it unrecognisable rather bring it out by contrast and make it shine forth so much the brighter i omit here all actions which are already recognised as inconsistent with duty although they may be useful for this or that purpose for with these the question whether they are done from duty can not arise at all since they even conflict with it i also set aside those actions which really conform to duty but to which men have no direct inclination performing them because they are impelled thereto by some other inclination for in this case we can readily distinguish whether the action which agrees with duty is done from duty or from a selfish view it is much harder to make this distinction when the action accords with duty and the subject has besides a direct inclination to it for example it is always a matter of duty that a dealer should not overcharge an inexperienced purchaser and wherever there is much commerce the prudent tradesman does not overcharge but keeps a fixed price for everyone so that a child buys of him as well as any other men are thus honestly served but this is not enough to make us believe that the tradesman has so acted from duty and from principles of honesty his own advantage required it it is out of the question in this case to suppose that he might besides have a direct inclination in favour of the buyers so that as it were from love he should give no advantage to one over another accordingly the action was done neither from duty nor from direct inclination but merely with a selfish view on the other hand it is a duty to maintain ones life and in addition every one has also a direct inclination to do so but on this account the often anxious care which most men take for it has no intrinsic worth and their maxim has no moral import they preserve their life as duty requires no doubt but not because duty requires on the other hand if adversity and hopeless sorrow have completely taken away the relish for life if the unfortunate one strong in mind indignant at his fate rather than desponding or dejected wishes for death and yet preserves his life without loving it—not from inclination or fear but from duty—then his maxim has a moral worth to be beneficent when we can is a duty and besides this there are many minds so sympathetically constituted that without any other motive of vanity or selfinterest they find a pleasure in spreading joy around them and can take delight in the satisfaction of others so far as it is their own work but i maintain that in such a case an action of this kind however proper however amiable it may be has nevertheless no true moral worth but is on a level with other inclinations e g the inclination to honour which if it is happily directed to that which is in fact of public utility and accordant with duty and consequently honourable deserves praise and encouragement but not esteem for the maxim lacks the moral import namely that such actions be done from duty not from inclination put the case that the mind of that philanthropist were clouded by sorrow of his own extinguishing all sympathy with the lot of others and that while he still has the power to benefit others in distress he is not touched by their trouble because he is absorbed with his own and now suppose that he tears himself out of this dead insensibility and performs the action without any inclination to it but simply from duty then first has his action its genuine moral worth further still if nature has put little sympathy in the heart of this or that man if he supposed to be an upright man is by temperament cold and indifferent to the sufferings of others perhaps because in respect of his own he is provided with the special gift of patience and fortitude and supposes or even requires that others should have the same—and such a man would certainly not be the meanest product of nature—but if nature had not specially framed him for a philanthropist would he not still find in himself a source from whence to give himself a far higher worth than that of a goodnatured temperament could be unquestionably it is just in this that the moral worth of the character is brought out which is incomparably the highest of all namely that he is beneficent not from inclination but from duty to secure ones own happiness is a duty at least indirectly for discontent with ones condition under a pressure of many anxieties and amidst unsatisfied wants might easily become a great temptation to transgression of duty but here again without looking to duty all men have already the strongest and most intimate inclination to happiness because it is just in this idea that all inclinations are combined in one total but the precept of happiness is often of such a sort that it greatly interferes with some inclinations and yet a man can not form any definite and certain conception of the sum of satisfaction of all of them which is called happiness it is not then to be wondered at that a single inclination definite both as to what it promises and as to the time within which it can be gratified is often able to overcome such a fluctuating idea and that a gouty patient for instance can choose to enjoy what he likes and to suffer what he may since according to his calculation on this occasion at least he has only not sacrificed the enjoyment of the present moment to a possibly mistaken expectation of a happiness which is supposed to be found in health but even in this
