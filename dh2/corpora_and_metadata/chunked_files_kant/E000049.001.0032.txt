to a satisfaction in the mere purposeless play of our faculties has a fancy value but that which constitutes the condition under which alone anything can be an end in itself this has not merely a relative worth ie value but an intrinsic worth that is dignity now morality is the condition under which alone a rational being can be an end in himself since by this alone is it possible that he should be a legislating member in the kingdom of ends thus morality and humanity as capable of it is that which alone has dignity skill and diligence in labour have a market value wit lively imagination and humour have fancy value on the other hand fidelity to promises benevolence from principle not from instinct have an intrinsic worth neither nature nor art contains anything which in default of these it could put in their place for their worth consists not in the effects which spring from them not in the use and advantage which they secure but in the disposition of mind that is the maxims of the will which are ready to manifest themselves in such actions even though they should not have the desired effect these actions also need no recommendation from any subjective taste or sentiment that they may be looked on with immediate favour and satisfaction they need no immediate propension or feeling for them they exhibit the will that performs them as an object of an immediate respect and nothing but reason is required to impose them on the will not to flatter it into them which in the case of duties would be a contradiction this estimation therefore shows that the worth of such a disposition is dignity and places it infinitely above all value with which it can not for a moment be brought into comparison or competition without as it were violating its sanctity what then is it which justifies virtue or the morally good disposition in making such lofty claims it is nothing less than the privilege it secures to the rational being of participating in the giving of universal laws by which it qualifies him to be a member of a possible kingdom of ends a privilege to which he was already destined by his own nature as being an end in himself and on that account legislating in the kingdom of ends free as regards all laws of physical nature and obeying those only which he himself gives and by which his maxims can belong to a system of universal law to which at the same time he submits himself for nothing has any worth except what the law assigns it now the legislation itself which assigns the worth of everything must for that very reason possess dignity that is an unconditional incomparable worth and the word respect alone supplies a becoming expression for the esteem which a rational being must have for it autonomy then is the basis of the dignity of human and of every rational nature the three modes of presenting the principle of morality that have been adduced are at bottom only so many formulæ of the very same law and each of itself involves the other two there is however a difference in them but it is rather subjectively than objectively practical intended namely to bring an idea of the reason nearer to intuition by means of a certain analogy and thereby nearer to feeling all maxims in fact have— a form consisting in universality and in this view the formula of the moral imperative is expressed thus that the maxims must be so chosen as if they were to serve as universal laws of nature a matter namely an end and here the formula says that the rational being as it is an end by its own nature and therefore an end in itself must in every maxim serve as the condition limiting all merely relative and arbitrary ends a complete characterisation of all maxims by means of that formula namely that all maxims ought by their own legislation to harmonise with a possible kingdom of ends as with a kingdom of nature there is a progress here in the order of the categories of unity of the form of the will its universality plurality of the matter the objects ie the ends and totality of the system of these in forming our moral judgment of actions it is better to proceed always on the strict method and start from the general formula of the categorical imperative act according to a maxim which can at the same time make itself a universal law if however we wish to gain an entrance for the moral law it is very useful to bring one and the same action under the three specified conceptions and thereby as far as possible to bring it nearer to intuition we can now end where we started at the beginning namely with the conception of a will unconditionally good that will is absolutely good which can not be evil in other words whose maxim if made a universal law could never contradict itself this principle then is its supreme law act always on such a maxim as thou canst at the same time will to be a universal law this is the sole condition under which a will can never contradict itself and such an imperative is categorical since the validity of the will as a universal law for possible actions is analogous to the universal connexion of the existence of things by general laws which is the formal notion of nature in general the categorical imperative can also be expressed thus act on maxims which can at the same time have for their object themselves as universal laws of nature such then is the formula of an absolutely good will rational nature is distinguished from the rest of nature by this that it sets before itself an end this end would be the matter of every
