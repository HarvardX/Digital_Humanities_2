the ideality of time as a mere form of sensible intuition and consequently as a mere manner of representation which is proper to the subject as belonging to the world of sense and therefore it only requires that this view be reconciled with this idea of freedom the difficulty is as follows—even if it is admitted that the supersensible subject can be free with respect to a given action although as a subject also belonging to the world of sense he is under mechanical conditions with respect to the same action still as soon as we allow that god as universal first cause is also the cause of the existence of substance a proposition which can never be given up without at the same time giving up the notion of god as the being of all beings and therewith giving up his all sufficiency on which everything in theology depends it seems as if we must admit that a mans actions have their determining principle in something which is wholly out of his power namely in the causality of a supreme being distinct from himself and on whom his own existence and the whole determination of his causality are absolutely dependent in point of fact if a mans actions as belonging to his modifications in time were not merely modifications of him as appearance but as a thing in itself freedom could not be saved man would be a marionette or an automaton like vaucansons prepared and wound up by the supreme artist selfconsciousness would indeed make him a thinking automaton but the consciousness of his own spontaneity would be mere delusion if this were mistaken for freedom and it would deserve this name only in a comparative sense since although the proximate determining causes of its motion and a long series of their determining causes are internal yet the last and highest is found in a foreign hand therefore i do not see how those who still insist on regarding time and space as attributes belonging to the existence of things in themselves can avoid admitting the fatality of actions or if like the otherwise acute mendelssohn they allow them to be conditions necessarily belonging to the existence of finite and derived beings but not to that of the infinite supreme being i do not see on what ground they can justify such a distinction or indeed how they can avoid the contradiction that meets them when they hold that existence in time is an attribute necessarily belonging to finite things in themselves whereas god is the cause of this existence but can not be the cause of time or space itself since this must on this hypothesis be presupposed as a necessary à priori condition of the existence of things and consequently as regards the existence of these things his causality must be subject to conditions and even to the condition of time and this would inevitably bring in everything contradictory to the notions of his infinity and independence on the other hand it is quite easy for us to draw the distinction between the attribute of the divine existence of being independent on all timeconditions and that of a being of the world of sense the distinction being that between the existence of a being in itself and that of a thing in appearance hence if this ideality of time and space is not adopted nothing remains but spinozism in which space and time are essential attributes of the supreme being himself and the things dependent on him ourselves therefore included are not substances but merely accidents inhering in him since if these things as his effects exist in time only this being the condition of their existence in themselves then the actions of these beings must be simply his actions which he performs in some place and time thus spinozism in spite of the absurdity of its fundamental idea argues more consistently than the creation theory can when beings assumed to be substances and beings in themselves existing in time are regarded as effects of a supreme cause and yet as not belonging to him and his action but as separate substances the abovementioned difficulty is resolved briefly and clearly as follows—if existence in time is a mere sensible mode of representation belonging to thinking beings in the world and consequently does not apply to them as things in themselves then the creation of these beings is a creation of things in themselves since the notion of creation does not belong to the sensible form of representation of existence or to causality but can only be referred to noumena consequently when i say of beings in the world of sense that they are created i so far regard them as noumena as it would be a contradiction therefore to say that god is a creator of appearances so also it is a contradiction to say that as creator he is the cause of actions in the world of sense and therefore as appearances although he is the cause of the existence of the acting beings which are noumena if now it is possible to affirm freedom in spite of the natural mechanism of actions as appearances by regarding existence in time as something that belongs only to appearances not to things in themselves then the circumstance that the acting beings are creatures can not make the slightest difference since creation concerns their supersensible and not their sensible existence and therefore can not be regarded as the determining principle of the appearances it would be quite different if the beings in the world as things in themselves existed in time since in that case the creator of substance would be at the same time the author of the whole mechanism of this substance of so great importance is the separation of time as well as space from the existence of things in themselves which was effected in the critique of the pure speculative reason it may be
