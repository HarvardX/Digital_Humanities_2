view from which the whole can be rightly sketched it presupposes indeed the fundamental principles of the metaphysic of morals but only in so far as this gives a preliminary acquaintance with the principle of duty and assigns and justifies a definite formula thereof in other respects it is independent it results from the nature of this practical faculty itself that the complete classification of all practical sciences can not be added as in the critique of the speculative reason for it is not possible to define duties specially as human duties with a view to their classification until the subject of this definition viz man is known according to his actual nature at least so far as is necessary with respect to duty this however does not belong to a critical examination of the practical reason the business of which is only to assign in a complete manner the principles of its possibility extent and limits without special reference to human nature the classification then belongs to the system of science not to the system of criticism in the second part of the analytic i have given as i trust a sufficient answer to the objection of a truthloving and acute critic of the fundamental principles of the metaphysic of morals—a critic always worthy of respect—the objection namely that the notion of good was not established before the moral principle as he thinks it ought to have been i have also had regard to many of the objections which have reached me from men who show that they have at heart the discovery of the truth and i shall continue to do so for those who have only their old system before their eyes and who have already settled what is to be approved or disapproved do not desire any explanation which might stand in the way of their own private opinion when we have to study a particular faculty of the human mind in its sources its content and its limits then from the nature of human knowledge we must begin with its parts with an accurate and complete exposition of them complete namely so far as is possible in the present state of our knowledge of its elements but there is another thing to be attended to which is of a more philosophical and architectonic character namely to grasp correctly the idea of the whole and from thence to get a view of all those parts as mutually related by the aid of pure reason and by means of their derivation from the concept of the whole this is only possible through the most intimate acquaintance with the system and those who find the first inquiry too troublesome and do not think it worth their while to attain such an acquaintance can not reach the second stage namely the general view which is a synthetical return to that which had previously been given analytically it is no wonder then if they find inconsistencies everywhere although the gaps which these indicate are not in the system itself but in their own incoherent train of thought i have no fear as regards this treatise of the reproach that i wish to introduce a new language since the sort of knowledge here in question has itself somewhat of an everyday character nor even in the case of the former critique could this reproach occur to any one who had thought it through and not merely turned over the leaves to invent new words where the language has no lack of expressions for given notions is a childish effort to distinguish oneself from the crowd if not by new and true thoughts yet by new patches on the old garment if therefore the readers of that work know any more familiar expressions which are as suitable to the thought as those seem to me to be or if they think they can show the futility of these thoughts themselves and hence that of the expression they would in the first case very much oblige me for i only desire to be understood and in the second case they would deserve well of philosophy but as long as these thoughts stand i very much doubt that suitable and yet more common expressions for them can be found in this manner then the à priori principles of two faculties of the mind the faculty of cognition and that of desire would be found and determined as to the conditions extent and limits of their use and thus a sure foundation be laid for a scientific system of philosophy both theoretic and practical nothing worse could happen to these labourers than that anyone should make the unexpected discovery that there neither is nor can be any à priori knowledge at all but there is no danger of this this would be the same thing as if one sought to prove by reason that there is no reason for we only say that we know something by reason when we are conscious that we could have known it even if it had not been given to us in experience hence rational knowledge and knowledge à priori are one and the same it is a clear contradiction to try to extract necessity from a principle of experience ex pumice aquam and to try by this to give a judgment true universality without which there is no rational inference not even inference from analogy which is at least a presumed universality and objective necessity to substitute subjective necessity that is custom for objective which exists only in à priori judgments is to deny to reason the power of judging about the object ie of knowing it and what belongs to it it implies for example that we must not say of something which often or always follows a certain antecedent state that we can conclude from this to that for this would imply objective necessity and the notion of an à priori connexion but only that we
