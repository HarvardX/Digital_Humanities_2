published his theory of the heavens he issued his first metaphysical treatise principiorum primorum cognitionis metaphysicœ nova dilucidatio and publicly defended it as an exercise prior to his obtaining permission to deliver lectures in the university as a privatdocent he forthwith commenced lecturing on mathematics and physics to these subjects he afterwards added lectures on philosophy natural theology physical geography anthropology and fortification he had already so great a reputation that at his first lecture the room in his own house was filled literally to overflowing the students crowding even on the stairs his lectures are thus described by the celebrated herder who attended them in the years i have had the good fortune to know a philosopher who was my teacher he had the happy sprightliness of a youth and this i believe he retains even in old age his open thoughtful brow was the seat of unruffled calmness and joy discourse full of thought flowed from his lips jest and wit and humour were at his command and his lecture was the most entertaining conversation with the same genius with which he criticised leibnitz wolf crusius hume and expounded the laws of newton and kepler he would also take up the writings of rousseau or any recent discovery in nature give his estimate of them and come back again to the knowledge of nature and xxxi to the moral worth of man natural history natural philosophy the history of nations and human nature mathematics and experience—these were the sources from which he enlivened his lecture and his conversation nothing worth knowing was indifferent to him no party no sect no desire of fame or profit had the smallest charm for him compared with the advancement and elucidation of the truth he encouraged and urged to independent thought and was far from wishing to dominate this man whom i name with the greatest gratitude and reverence is immanuel kant his image stands pleasantly before me his lectures attracted many hearers of mature age and visitors to königsberg even prolonged their stay for the purpose of attending them at the same time he continued to act as tutor to young men specially entrusted to his care who lived with him he had to wait fifteen years in the position of privatdocent before obtaining a professorship he had indeed been offered a professorship by the government before this but it was almost the only chair which he felt he could not worthily fill—the chair of poetry this involved not only the censorship of new poems but the composition of poems for academic celebrations and kant declined the office in the following year he was appointed sublibrarian at the modest salary of thalers this was his first official appointment œt four years later he was nominated to the professorship of logic and metaphysics with an income from all sources of xxxii 00 thalers this was ultimately increased to 0 this was of course exclusive of fees from students he inaugurated his professorship by defending his essay de mundi sensibilis atque intelligibilis forma et principiis in this he distinguishes the sensible apprehension of phenomena from the concept of the understanding just as in the critique of pure reason he shows precisely as in the latter work that space and time are forms of the intuitions of sense as professor he continued to lecture in the same wide circle of subjects as before the lectures on physical geography and anthropology were especially popular he was fond of studying nature but especially human nature in all its phases and took great pleasure in reading books of travel although he never travelled having an excellent memory and a lively power of imagination he could distinctly picture to himself even in minute detail the several objects described on one occasion he described westminster bridge its form dimensions c with such detail and distinctness that an englishman who was present thought he was an architect and had spent some years in london at another time he spoke of italy as if he had known it from long personal acquaintance so popular were his lectures that we find von zedlitz the prussian minister writing from berlin to say that he is reading with pleasure an imperfect manuscript report of the lectures on physical geography and requesting kant to favour him with a xxxiii correct copy these lectures were published in 0 the lectures on anthropology had appeared in both works are written in an extremely interesting and popular style and those on anthropology are full of entertaining remarks and illustrative anecdotes not without humour thus speaking of the emotions that nature employs for the promotion of health which are chiefly laughing and weeping he remarks that anger also conduces to health if one can indulge in a good scolding without fear of opposition and in fact many a housewife gets no hearty exercise except in scolding her children and servants and provided these take it patiently a pleasant feeling of fatigue spreads itself through the organism this sort of exercise however he adds is not without danger as the objects of the scolding may possibly resist even when lecturing on metaphysics kant is said to have been lucid and interesting when the difficulty of his writings was complained of he used to say that he wrote for thinkers by profession and with these technical expressions had the advantage of brevity besides said he it flatters the vanity of the reader to find perplexities and obscurities here and there which he can solve by his own acuteness but in his lectures he endeavoured to be clear and intelligible he sought as he expressed it to teach not philosophy but to philosophize in one of his letters he states that he was unceasingly observant of phenomena and their laws even in common life so that from first to last his hearers should not have to listen to a dry exposition but be interested by being led to compare his remarks with
