by good progress must produce a cheerful spirit without which one is never certain that he has taken a liking to good that is to say adopted it into his maxim the ancient moral philosophers who nearly exhausted all that can be said about virtue have not omitted to consider the two questions above mentioned the first they expressed thus whether virtue must be learned so that man is by nature indifferent to it and vice the second was whether there is more than one virtue in other words whether it is possible that a man should be partly virtuous and partly vicious to both they replied with rigorous decision in the negative and justly for they contemplated virtue in itself as an idea of the reason as man ought to be but if we are to form a moral judgment of this moral being man in appearance that is as we learn to know him by experience then we may answer both questions in the affirmative for then he is estimated not by the balance of pure reason before a divine tribunal but by an empirical standard before a human judge we shall treat further of this in the sequel this must not be considered as contained in the conception of the preceding but must necessarily be regarded as a special capacity for it does not follow that because a being has reason this includes a faculty of determining the elective will unconditionally by the mere conception of the qualification of its maxims to be universal laws so as to be of itself practical at least so far as we can see the most rational being in the world might still have need of certain springs coming to him from objects of inclination to determine his elective will and might apply to these the most rational calculation both as regards the greatest sum of the springs and also as to the means of attaining the object determined thereby without every suspecting the possibility of anything like the moral law issuing its commands absolutely and which announces itself as a spring and that the highest were this law not given in us we should not be able to find it out as such by reason or to talk the elective will into it and yet this law is the only one that makes us conscious of the independence of our elective will on determination by any other springs our freedom and at the same time of the imputability of our actions propensity hang is properly only the predisposition to the desire of an enjoyment which when the subject has had experience of it produces an inclination to it thus all uncivilized men have a propensity to intoxicating things for although many of them are not acquainted with intoxication so that they can not have any desire for things that produce it one need only let them once try such things to produce an almost inextinguishable desire for them between propensity and inclination which presupposes acquaintance with the object is instinct which is a felt want to do or enjoy something of which one has as yet no conception such as the mechanical instinct in animals or the sexual impulse there is a still further step in the faculty of desire beyond inclination namely passions not affections for these belong to the feeling of pleasure and displeasure which are inclinations that exclude selfcontrol hearnes journey from prince of wales fort in hudsons bay to the northern ocean in london as the perpetual war between the athapescaw and the dog rib indians which has no other object than slaughter bravery in war is the highest virtue of savages in their opinion even in a state of civilization it is an object of admiration and a ground of the peculiar respect demanded by that profession in which this is the only merit and this not altogether without good reason for that a man can have something that he values more than life and which he can make his object namely honour renouncing all selfinterest proves a certain sublimity in his nature but we see by the complacency with which conquerors extol their achievements massacre unsparing butchery c that it is only their own superiority and the destruction they can effect without any other object in which they properly take satisfaction compare stewart active and moral powers bk i ch iii sec who gives an optimist explanation of this saying if we look at the history of these merely as a phenomenon of the inner nature of man which is in great part concealed from us we may become aware of a certain mechanical process of nature directed to ends which are not those of the nations but of nature as long as any state has another near it which it can hope to subdue it endeavours to aggrandize itself by the conquest striving thus to attain universal monarchyâ€”a constitution in which all freedom would be extinguished and with it virtue taste and sciences which are its consequences but this monster in which all laws gradually lose their force after it has swallowed up its neighbours finally dissolves of itself and by rebellion and discord is divided into several smaller states which instead of endeavouring to form a statesunion a republic of free united nations begin the same game over again each for itself so that war that scourge of the human race may not be allowed to cease war indeed is not so incurably bad as the deadness of a universal monarchy or even a union of nations to ensure that despotism shall not be discontinued in any state yet as an ancient observed it makes more bad men
