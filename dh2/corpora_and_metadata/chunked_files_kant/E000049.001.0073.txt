however considered as an inclination pathological love is impossible for he is not an object of the senses the same affection towards men is possible no doubt but can not be commanded for it is not in the power of any man to love anyone at command therefore it is only practical love that is meant in that pith of all laws to love god means in this sense to like to do his commandments to love ones neighbour means to like to practise all duties towards him but the command that makes this a rule can not command us to have this disposition in actions conformed to duty but only to endeavour after it for a command to like to do a thing is in itself contradictory because if we already know of ourselves what we are bound to do and if further we are conscious of liking to do it a command would be quite needless and if we do it not willingly but only out of respect for the law a command that makes this respect the motive of our maxim would directly counteract the disposition commanded that law of all laws therefore like all the moral precepts of the gospel exhibits the moral disposition in all its perfection in which viewed as an ideal of holiness it is not attainable by any creature but yet is the pattern which we should strive to approach and in an uninterrupted but infinite progress become like to in fact if a rational creature could ever reach this point that he thoroughly likes to do all moral laws this would mean that there does not exist in him even the possibility of a desire that would tempt him to deviate from them for to overcome such a desire always costs the subject some sacrifice and therefore requires selfcompulsion that is inward constraint to something that one does not quite like to do and no creature can ever reach this stage of moral disposition for being a creature and therefore always dependent with respect to what he requires for complete satisfaction he can never be quite free from desires and inclinations and as these rest on physical causes they can never of themselves coincide with the moral law the sources of which are quite different and therefore they make it necessary to found the mental disposition of ones maxims on moral obligation not on ready inclination but on respect which demands obedience to the law even though one may not like it not on love which apprehends no inward reluctance of the will towards the law nevertheless this latter namely love to the law which would then cease to be a command and then morality which would have passed subjectively into holiness would cease to be virtue must be the constant though unattainable goal of his endeavours for in the case of what we highly esteem but yet on account of the consciousness of our weakness dread the increased facility of satisfying it changes the most reverential awe into inclination and respect into love at least this would be the perfection of a disposition devoted to the law if it were possible for a creature to attain it this reflection is intended not so much to clear up the evangelical command just cited in order to prevent religious fanaticism in regard to love of god but to define accurately the moral disposition with regard directly to our duties towards men and to check or if possible prevent a merely moral fanaticism which infects many persons the stage of morality on which man and as far as we can see every rational creature stands is respect for the moral law the disposition that he ought to have in obeying this is to obey it from duty not from spontaneous inclination or from an endeavour taken up from liking and unbidden and this proper moral condition in which he can always be is virtue that is moral disposition militant and not holiness in the fancied possession of a perfect purity of the disposition of the will it is nothing but moral fanaticism and exaggerated selfconceit that is infused into the mind by exhortation to actions as noble sublime and magnanimous by which men are led into the delusion that it is not duty that is respect for the law whose yoke an easy yoke indeed because reason itself imposes it on us they must bear whether they like it or not that constitutes the determining principle of their actions and which always humbles them while they obey it fancying that those actions are expected from them not from duty but as pure merit for not only would they in imitating such deeds from such a principle not have fulfilled the spirit of the law in the least which consists not in the legality of the action without regard to principle but in the subjection of the mind to the law not only do they make the motives pathological seated in sympathy or selflove not moral in the law but they produce in this way a vain highflying fantastic way of thinking flattering themselves with a spontaneous goodness of heart that needs neither spur nor bridle for which no command is needed and thereby forgetting their obligation which they ought to think of rather than merit indeed actions of others which are done with great sacrifice and merely for the sake of duty may be praised as noble and sublime but only so far as there are traces which suggest that they were done wholly out of respect for duty and not from excited feelings if these however are set before anyone as examples to be imitated respect for duty which is the only true moral feeling must be employed as the motiveâ€”this severe holy precept which never allows our vain selflove to dally with pathological impulses however analogous they may be to morality and to take a pride in meritorious worth now if
