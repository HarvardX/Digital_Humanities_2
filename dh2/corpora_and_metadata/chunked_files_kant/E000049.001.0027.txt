whether this principle founded on selflove can become a universal law of nature now we see at once that a system of nature of which it should be a law to destroy life by means of the very feeling whose special nature it is to impel to the improvement of life would contradict itself and therefore could not exist as a system of nature hence that maxim can not possibly exist as a universal law of nature and consequently 0 would be wholly inconsistent with the supreme principle of all duty another finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money he knows that he will not be able to repay it but sees also that nothing will be lent to him unless he promises stoutly to repay it in a definite time he desires to make this promise but he has still so much conscience as to ask himself is it not unlawful and inconsistent with duty to get out of a difficulty in this way suppose however that he resolves to do so then the maxim of his action would be expressed thus when i think myself in want of money i will borrow money and promise to repay it although i know that i never can do so now this principle of selflove or of ones own advantage may perhaps be consistent with my whole future welfare but the question now is is it right i change then the suggestion of selflove into a universal law and state the question thus how would it be if my maxim were a universal law then i see at once that it could never hold as a universal law of nature but would necessarily contradict itself for supposing it to be a universal law that everyone when he thinks himself in a difficulty should be able to promise whatever he pleases with the purpose of not keeping his promise the promise itself would become impossible as well as the end that one might have in view in it since no one would consider that anything was promised to him but would ridicule all such statements as vain pretences a third finds in himself a talent which with the help of some culture might make him a useful man in many respects but he finds himself in comfortable circumstances and prefers to indulge in pleasure rather than to take pains in enlarging and improving his happy natural capacities he asks however whether his maxim of neglect of his natural gifts besides agreeing with his inclination to indulgence agrees also with what is called duty he sees then that a system of nature could indeed subsist with such a universal law although men like the south sea islanders should let their talents rust and resolve to devote their lives merely to idleness amusement and propagation of their speciesâ€”in a word to enjoyment but he can not possibly will that this should be a universal law of nature or be implanted in us as such by a natural instinct for as a rational being he necessarily wills that his faculties be developed since they serve him and have been given him for all sorts of possible purposes a fourth who is in prosperity while he sees that others have to contend with great wretchedness and that he could help them thinks what concern is it of mine let everyone be as happy 0 as heaven pleases or as he can make himself i will take nothing from him nor even envy him only i do not wish to contribute anything to his welfare or to his assistance in distress now no doubt if such a mode of thinking were a universal law the human race might very well subsist and doubtless even better than in a state in which everyone talks of sympathy and goodwill or even takes care occasionally to put it into practice but on the other side also cheats when he can betrays the rights of men or otherwise violates them but although it is possible that a universal law of nature might exist in accordance with that maxim it is impossible to will that such a principle should have the universal validity of a law of nature for a will which resolved this would contradict itself inasmuch as many cases might occur in which one would have need of the love and sympathy of others and in which by such a law of nature sprung from his own will he would deprive himself of all hope of the aid he desires these are a few of the many actual duties or at least what we regard as such which obviously fall into two classes on the one principle that we have laid down we must be able to will that a maxim of our action should be a universal law this is the canon of the moral appreciation of the action generally some actions are of such a character that their maxim can not without contradiction be even conceived as a universal law of nature far from it being possible that we should will that it should be so in others this intrinsic impossibility is not found but still it is impossible to will that their maxim should be raised to the universality of a law of nature since such a will would contradict itself it is easily seen that the former violate strict or rigorous inflexible duty the latter only laxer meritorious duty thus it has been completely shown by these examples how all duties depend as regards the nature of the obligation not the object of the action on the same principle if now we attend to ourselves on occasion of any transgression of duty we shall find that we in fact do not will that our maxim should be a universal law for that is impossible for us on the contrary we will that the opposite should remain a universal law only we assume the liberty of
