to extricate myself from a present difficulty by means of this subterfuge but it must be well considered whether there may not hereafter spring from this lie much greater inconvenience than that from which i now free myself and as with all my supposed cunning the consequences can not be so easily foreseen but that credit once lost may be much more injurious to me than any mischief which i seek to avoid at present it should be considered whether it would not be more prudent to act herein according to a universal maxim and to make it a habit to promise nothing except with the intention of keeping it but it is soon clear to me that such a maxim will still only be based on the fear of consequences now it is a wholly different thing to be truthful from duty and to be so from apprehension of injurious consequences in the first case the very notion of the action already implies a law for me in the second case i must first look about elsewhere to see what results may be combined with it which would affect myself for to deviate from the principle of duty is beyond all doubt wicked but to be unfaithful to my maxim of prudence may often be very advantageous to me although to abide by it is certainly safer the shortest way however and an unerring one to discover the answer to this question whether a lying promise is consistent with duty is to ask myself should i be content that my maxim to extricate myself from difficulty by a false promise should hold good as a universal law for myself as well as for others and should i be able to say to myself every one may make a deceitful promise when he finds himself in a difficulty from which he can not otherwise extricate himself then i presently become aware that while i can will the lie i can by no means will that lying should be a universal law for with such a law there would be no promises at all since it would be in vain to allege my intention in regard to my future actions to those who would not believe this allegation or if they overhastily did so would pay me back in my own coin hence my maxim as soon as it should be made a universal law would necessarily destory itself i do not therefore need any farreaching penetration to discern what i have to do in order that my will may be morally good inexperienced in the course of the world incapable of being prepared for all its contingencies i only ask myself canst thou also will that thy maxim should be a universal law if not then it must be rejected and that not because of a disadvantage accruing from it to myself or even to others but 0 because it can not enter as a principle into a possible universal legislation and reason extorts from me immediate respect for such legislation i do not indeed as yet discern on what this respect is based this the philosopher may inquire but at least i understand this that it is an estimation of the worth which far outweighs all worth of what is recommended by inclination and that the necessity of acting from pure respect for the practical law is what constitutes duty to which every other motive must give place because it is the condition of a will being good in itself and the worth of such a will is above everything thus then without quitting the moral knowledge of common human reason we have arrived at its principle and although no doubt common men do not conceive it in such an abstract and universal form yet they always have it really before their eyes and use it as the standard of their decision here it would be easy to show how with this compass in hand men are well able to distinguish in every case that occurs what is good what bad conformably to duty or inconsistent with it if without in the least teaching them anything new we only like socrates direct their attention to the principle they themselves employ and that therefore we do not need science and philosophy to know what we should do to be honest and good yea even wise and virtuous indeed we might well have conjectured beforehand that the knowledge of what every man is bound to do and therefore also to know would be within the reach of every man even the commonest here we can not forbear admiration when we see how great an advantage the practical judgment has over the theoretical in the common understanding of men in the latter if common reason ventures to depart from the laws of experience and from the perceptions of the senses it falls into mere inconceivabilities and selfcontradictions at least into a chaos of uncertainty obscurity and instability but in the practical sphere it is just when the common understanding excludes all sensible springs from practical laws that its power of judgment begins to show itself to advantage it then becomes even subtle whether it be that it chicanes with its own conscience or with other claims respecting what is to be called right or whether it desires for its own instruction to determine honestly the worth of actions and in the latter case it may even have as good a hope of hitting the mark as any philosopher whatever can promise himself nay it is almost more sure of doing so because the philosopher can not have any other principle while he may easily perplex his judgment by a multitude of considerations foreign to the matter and so turn aside from the right way would it not therefore be wiser in moral concerns to acquiesce in the judgment of common reason or at most only to call in philosophy for the purpose
