legality agreement with the latter the morality of the action the freedom to which the former laws relate can only be freedom in its external exercise but the freedom to which the latter refer is freedom both in the internal and external exercise of the elective will in as far namely as this elective will is determined by laws of reason similarly in theoretic philosophy we say that only the objects of the outer senses are in space while the objects both of the external and of the internal sense are in time because the ideas of both are still ideas and for this reason all belong to the inner sense just so whether we regard freedom in the external or the internal exercise of the elective will in either case its laws being pure practical laws of reason governing free elective will generally must be also its internal grounds of determination although they need not always be considered in this point of view 0 ii of the conception and the necessity of a metaphysic of ethics it has been shown elsewhere that for physical science which has to do with the objects of the external senses we must have à priori principles and that it is possible—nay even necessary—to prefix a system of these principles under the name of metaphysical principles of natural philosophy to physics which is natural philosophy applied to special phenomena of experience the latter however at least when the question is to guard its propositions from error may assume many principles as universal on the testimony of experience although the former if it is to be in the strict sense universal must be deduced from à priori grounds just as newton adopted the principle of the equality of action and reaction as based on experience and yet extended it to all material nature the chemists go still further and base their most universal laws of combination and dissociation of substances by their own forces entirely on experience and yet they have such confidence in their universality and necessity that in the experiments they make with them they have no apprehension of error it is otherwise with the moral laws these are valid as laws only so far as they have an à priori basis and can be seen to be necessary nay the concepts and judgments about ourselves and our actions and omissions have no moral significance at all if they contain only what can be learned from experience and should one be so misled as to make into a moral principle anything derived from this source he would be in danger of the grossest and most pernicious errors if the science of morals were nothing but the science of happiness it would be unsuitable to look out for à priori principles on which to rest it for however plausible it may sound to say that reason could discern even before experience by what means one might attain a lasting enjoyment of the true pleasures of life yet everything which is taught on this subject à priori is either tautological or assumed without any foundation it is experience alone that can teach us what gives us pleasure the natural impulses to nutrition to the propagation of the species the desire of rest of motion and in the development of our natural capacities the desire of honour of knowledge c can alone teach and moreover teach each individual in his own special way in what to place those pleasures and it is these also that can teach him the means by which he must seek them all plausible à priori reasoning is here at bottom nothing but experience raised to generality by induction a generality too so meagre that everyone must be allowed many exceptions in order to make the choice of his mode of life suitable to his special inclination and his susceptibility for pleasure so that after all he must become wise only by his own or others loss it is not so with the doctrines of morality they are imperative for everyone without regard to his inclinations solely because and so far as he is free and has practical reason instruction in its laws is not drawn from observation of himself and his animal part not from perception of the course of the world from that which happens and from the way in which men act although the german word sitten like the latin mores signifies only manners and mode of life but reason commands how men should act even although no instance of such action could be found moreover it pays no regard to the advantage which we may hereby attain which certainly can only be learned by experience for although it allows us to seek our advantage in every way that we can and in addition pointing to the testimony of experience can promise us probably and on the whole greater advantages from following its commands than from transgression of them especially if obedience is accompanied by prudence yet the authority of its precepts as commands does not rest on this reason uses such facts only by way of counsel as a counterpoise to the temptations to the opposite in order first of all to compensate the error of an unfair balance so that it may then assure a due preponderance to the à priori grounds of a pure practical reason if therefore we give the name metaphysic to a system of à priori knowledge derived from mere concepts then a practical philosophy which has for its object not nature but freedom of choice will presuppose and require a metaphysic of morals that is to have it is itself a duty and moreover every man has it in himself though commonly only in an obscure way for without à priori principles how could he believe that he has in him a universal lawgiving moreover just as in the metaphysic of natural philosophy there must be principles touching the application to objects
