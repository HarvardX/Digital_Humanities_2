and still sin is clear from what has preceded only that in us an innate propensity to sin is presupposed in time but in the first man on the contrary innocence so that in him the transgression is called a fall whereas in us it is conceived as following from the innate depravity of our nature what is meant however by this propensity is no more than this that if we wish to apply ourselves to the explanation of evil as to its beginning in time we must in the case of every intentional transgression pursue its causes in a previous period of our life going backwards till we reach a time when the use of reason was not yet developed in other words we must trace the source of evil to a propensity towards it as a foundation in nature which on this account is called innate in the case of the first man who is represented as already possessing the full power of using his reason this is not necessary nor indeed possible since otherwise that natural foundation the evil propensity must have been created in him therefore his sin is represented as produced directly from a state of innocence but we must not seek for an origin in time of a moral character for which we are to be accountable however inevitable this is when we try to explain its contingent existence hence scripture may have so represented it to us in accommodation to this our weakness the rational origin however of this perversion of our elective will in respect of the way in which it adopts subordinate springs into its maxims as supreme i e the origin of this propensity to evil remains inscrutable to us for it must itself be imputed to us and consequently that ultimate ground of all maxims would again require the assumption of a bad maxim what is bad could only have sprung from what is morally bad not the mere limits of our nature and yet the original constitution is adapted to good nor could it be corrupted by any other than man himself if he is to be accountable for this corruption there is not then any source conceivable to us from which moral evil could have first come into us scripture in its historical narrative expresses this inconceivability at the same time that it defines the depravity of our race more precisely 0 by representing evil as preexisting at the beginning of the world not however in man but in a spirit originally destined for a lofty condition the first beginning of all evil in general is thus represented as inconceivable to us for whence came the evil in that spirit and man as having fallen into evil only by seduction and therefore as not fundamentally corrupt i e even in his primary capacity for good but as still capable of an improvement in contrast to a seducing spirit that is a being in whom the temptation of the flesh can not be reckoned as alleviating his guilt so that the former who notwithstanding his corrupt heart continues to have a good rational will wille has still left the hope of a return to the good from which he has gone astray general remark on the restoration of the original capacity for good to its full power what man is or ought to be in a moral sense he must make or must have made himself both must be the effect of his free elective will otherwise it could not be imputed to him and consequently he would be morally neither good nor bad when it is said he is created good that can only mean that he is created for good and the original constitution in man is good but this does not yet make the man himself good but according as he does or does not adopt into his maxim the springs which this constitution contains which must be left altogether to his own free choice he makes himself become good or bad supposing that a supernatural cooperation is also necessary to make a man good or better whether this consists only in the diminution of the obstacles or in a positive assistance the man must previously make himself worthy to receive it and to accept this aid which is no small thing that is to adopt into his maxim the positive increase of power in which way alone it is possible that the good should be imputed to him and that he should be recognised as a good man now how it is possible that a man naturally bad should make himself a good man transcends all our conceptions for how can a bad tree bring forth good fruit but since it is already admitted that a tree originally good as to its capacities has brought forth bad fruit and the fall from good to bad when it is considered that it arises from freedom is not more conceivable than a rising again from bad to good the possibility of the latter can not be disputed for notwithstanding that fall the command we ought to become better men resounds with undiminished force in our soul consequently we must be able to do so even though what we ourselves can do should be insufficient of itself and though we should thereby only make ourselves susceptible of an inscrutable higher assistance it must however be presupposed that a germ of good has remained in its complete purity which could not be destroyed or corruptedâ€” a germ that certainly can not be selflove which when taken as the principle of all our maxims is in fact the source of all evil the restoration of the original capacity for good in us is then not the acquisition of a lost spring towards good for this which consists in respect for the moral law we could never lose and were it possible to do so we could never recover it
