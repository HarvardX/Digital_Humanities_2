of one and the same theorem because in intuition à priori there may be several properties of an object all of which lead back to the very same principle if for instance to prove the duty of veracity an argument is drawn first from the harm that a lie causes to other men another from the worthlessness of a liar and the violation of his own selfrespect what is proved in the former argument is a duty of benevolence not of veracity that is to say not the duty which required to be proved but a different one now if in giving a variety of proofs for one and the same theorem we flatter ourselves that the multitude of reasons will compensate the lack of weight in each taken separately this is a very unphilosophical resource since it betrays trickery and dishonesty for several insufficient proofs placed beside one another do not produce certainty nor even probability they should advance as reason and consequence in a series up to the sufficient reason and it is only in this way that they can have the force of proof yet the former is the usual device of the rhetorician secondly the difference between virtue and vice can not be sought in the degree in which certain maxims are followed but only in the specific quality of the maxims their relation to the law in other words the vaunted principle of aristotle that virtue is the mean between two vices is false for instance suppose that good management is given as the mean between two vices prodigality and avarice then its origin as a virtue can neither be defined as the gradual diminution of the former vice by saving nor as the increase of the expenses of the miserly these vices in fact can not be viewed as if they proceeding as it were in opposite directions met together in good management but each of them has its own maxim which necessarily contradicts that of the other for the same reason no vice can be defined as an excess in the practice of certain actions beyond what is proper e g prodigalitas est excessus in consumendis opibus or as a less exercise of them than is fitting avaritia est defectus c for since in this way the degree is left quite undefined and the question whether conduct accords with duty or not turns wholly on this such an account is of no use as a definition thirdly ethical virtue must not be estimated by the power we attribute to man of fulfilling the law but conversely the moral power must be estimated by the law which commands categorically not therefore by the empirical knowledge that we have of men as they are but by the rational knowledge how according to the idea of humanity they ought to be these three maxims of the scientific treatment of ethics are opposed to the older apophthegms— there is only one virtue and only one vice virtue is the observance of the mean path between two opposite vices virtue like prudence must be learned from experience xiv —of virtue in general virtue signifies a moral strength of will wille but this does not exhaust the notion for such strength might also belong to a holy superhuman being in whom no opposing impulse counteracts the law of his rational will who therefore willingly does everything in accordance with the law virtue then is the moral strength of a mans will wille in his obedience to duty and this is a moral necessitation by his own law giving reason inasmuch as this constitutes itself a power executing the law it is not itself a duty nor is it a duty to possess it otherwise we should be in duty bound to have a duty but it commands and accompanies its command with a moral constraint one possible by laws of internal freedom but since this should be irresistible strength is requisite and the degree of this strength can be estimated only by the magnitude of the hindrances which man creates for himself by his inclinations vices the brood of unlawful dispositions are the monsters that he has to combat wherefore this moral strength as fortitude fortitudo moralis constitutes the greatest and only true martial glory of man it is also called the true wisdom namely the practical because it makes the ultimate end final cause of the existence of man on earth its own end its possession alone makes man free healthy rich a king c nor can either chance or fate deprive him of this since he possesses himself and the virtuous can not lose his virtue all the enconiums bestowed on the ideal of humanity in its moral perfection can lose nothing of their practical reality by the examples of what men now are have been or will probably be hereafter anthropology which proceeds from mere empirical knowledge can not impair anthroponomy which is erected by the unconditionally legislating reason and although virtue may now and then be called meritorious in relation to men not to the law and be worthy of reward yet in itself as it is its own end so also it must be regarded as its own reward virtue considered in its complete perfection is therefore regarded not as if man possessed virtue but as if virtue possessed the man since in the former case it would appear as though he had still had the choice for which he would then require another virtue in order to select virtue from all other wares offered to him to conceive a plurality of virtues as we unavoidably must is nothing else but to conceive various moral objects to which the rational will is led by the single principle of virtue and it is the same with the opposite vices the expression which personifies both is a contrivance for affecting the sensibility pointing however to a moral sense hence it follows that an aesthetic of morals
