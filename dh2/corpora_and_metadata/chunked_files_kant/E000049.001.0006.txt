their own observations it was his custom to keep his eyes fixed on some xxxiv particular student sitting near him perhaps in order to judge from the hearers countenance whether he was making himself understood so arago in his popular lectures used to select for the same purpose the most stupidlooking person in the audience continuing his explanations until the person fixed showed signs of intelligence with kant however the consequences were disastrous if the student happened to have any peculiarity or defect either in person or dress one day the student thus selected happened to have lost a button from his coat kants glance recurred to the vacant spot and during the whole lecture his thoughts were distracted and even confused in a manner inexplicable to those who were not in the secret he did not like to see his hearers taking notes but would say put up your pencils gentlemen and would not begin until they had done so the reason of this was that he thought such attempts at reporting interfered with their attention to the matter of the lecture by fixing it on the words some of his hearers took full notes nevertheless in he formed the design of writing a critical examination of pure reason theoretical and practical the former part of which he hoped to complete in three months the months grew to years six years later he writes that he expects it to appear this summer and that it would not be a large volume it did not see the light however until nine years after he had announced that it would be ready in three months when this masterwork was produced kant was fiftyseven years of age he states himself that it was hume that roused xxxv him from his dogmatic slumber and compelled him to seek a solid barrier against scepticism it is stated on kants own authority that he did not commit to writing a single sentence in this work on which he had not first asked the judgment of his friend green a man to whom kant showed such deference deserves a brief notice he was an english merchant and during the american war of independence happened to be present when kant who sympathized with the americans denounced the conduct of england in strong terms green sprang up in a rage declared that kants words were a personal insult to him as an englishman and demanded satisfaction kant replied so calmly and persuasively that green shook hands with him and they became fast friends and continued so until the death of green in a loss which kant deeply felt of the critique of pure reason i need not here speak suffice it to say that as lockes attempt to keep the mind from going beyond its tether was followed at no long interval by the idealism of berkeley and the annihilating scepticism of hume so kants analogous attempt led in a still shorter space to the most complete idealism and transcendentalism indeed his reviewers not unnaturally mistook him for an idealist and hamann called him the prussian hume xxxvi the work excited a lively controversy in the philosophical world but most of the publications to which it gave rise have been long forgotten kants fame however rose to the highest and königsberg became a shrine to which students and tourists made pilgrimages the critique of pure reason was to be followed by the metaphysical elements of natural philosophy and of moral philosophy the former appeared in under the title metaphysische anfangsgründe der naturwissenschaft the views respecting motion with which this treatise commences had however already been published as a programme of lectures in motion is only relative to the surrounding space while i sit with a ball on the table before me in the cabin of a ship moored in a river i say that the ball is at rest i look out and see that the ship has been unmoored and is drifting westward the ball then is moving but i reflect that the earth is rotating with greater velocity eastward the ball then is moving eastward nay for the earth in its orbit is moving westward with still higher speed the orbit itself is moving i can not tell how rapidly nor do i know in what direction in any case then it is the same thing whether i regard a point as moving in its space or regard the space as moving and the point as at rest hence the law of the composition of motions results directly for if a be a point having a motion of one foot per second westward and two feet per second southward i can regard it as having only the southward motion while the space in which it is is moving one foot per second eastward at the end therefore xxxvii of one second the point will be found two feet to the south and as its space in moving east has left it one foot behind it will also be one foot west relatively to its surrounding space this is the same as if it had moved in the diagonal of the parallelogram kant claimed as an advantage of this proof that it represented the resultant motion not as an effect of the two motions but as actually including them it is incomparably simpler and more philosophical than the proof given by dalembert and other contemporary mathematicians when we treat of collision of bodies this mode of viewing the matter becomes absolutely indispensable if the body a is approaching the body b equal to it with a velocity of two degrees we regard a as moving with a speed of one degree while b and its space move one degree in the opposite direction the motions being equal and opposite the result of their contact is mutual rest but as the space is moving this rest is equivalent to a motion of the two bodies in contact relative
