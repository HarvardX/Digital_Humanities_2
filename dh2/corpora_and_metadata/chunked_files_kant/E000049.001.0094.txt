they can never be used for a theory of supersensible beings so that on this side they are quite incapable of being the foundation of a speculative knowledge and their use is limited simply to the practice of the moral law this last is so obvious and can be proved so clearly by fact that we may confidently challenge all pretended natural theologians a singular name to specify over and above the merely ontological predicates one single attribute whether of the understanding or of the will determining this object of theirs of which we could not show incontrovertibly that if we abstract from it everything anthropomorphic nothing would remain to us but the mere word without our being able to connect with it the smallest notion by which we could hope for an extension of theoretical knowledge but as to the practical there still remains to us of the attributes of understanding and will the conception of a relation to which objective reality is given by the practical law which determines à priori precisely this relation of the understanding to the will when once this is done then reality is given to the conception of the object of a will morally determined the conception of the summum bonum and with it to the conditions of its possibility the ideas of god freedom and immortality but always only relatively to the practice of the moral law and not for any speculative purpose according to these remarks it is now easy to find the answer to the weighty question whether the notion of god is one belonging to physics and therefore also to metaphysics which contains the pure à priori principles of the former in their universal import or to morals if we have recourse to god as the author of all things in order to explain the arrangements of nature or its changes this is at least not a physical explanation and is a complete confession that our philosophy has come to an end since we are obliged to assume something of which in itself we have otherwise no conception in order to be able to frame a conception of the possibility of what we see before our eyes metaphysics however can not enable us to attain by certain inference from the knowledge of this world to the conception of god and to the proof of his existence for this reason that in order to say that this world could be produced only by a god according to the conception implied by this word we should know this world as the most perfect whole possible and for this purpose should also know all possible worlds in order to be able to compare them with this in other words we should be omniscient it is absolutely impossible however to know the existence of this being from mere concepts because every existential proposition that is every proposition that affirms the existence of a being of which i frame a concept is a synthetic proposition that is one by which i go beyond that conception and affirm of it more than was thought in the conception itself namely that this concept in the understanding has an object corresponding to it outside the understanding and this it is obviously impossible to elicit by any reasoning there remains therefore only one single process possible for reason to attain this knowledge namely to start from the supreme principle of its pure practical use which in every case is directed simply to the existence of something as a consequence of reason and thus determine its object then its inevitable problem namely the necessary direction of the will to the summum bonum discovers to us not only the necessity of assuming such a first being in reference to the possibility of this good in the world but what is most remarkable something which reason in its progress on the path of physical nature altogether failed to find namely an accurately defined conception of this first being as we can know only a small part of this world and can still less compare it with all possible worlds we may indeed from its order design and greatness infer a wise good powerful c author of it but not that he is allwise allgood allpowerful c it may indeed very well be granted that we should be justified in supplying this inevitable defect by a legitimate and reasonable hypothesis namely that when wisdom goodness c are displayed in all the parts that offer themselves to our nearer knowledge it is just the same in all the rest and that it would therefore be reasonable to ascribe all possible perfections to the author of the world but these are not strict logical inferences in which we can pride ourselves on our insight but only permitted conclusions in which we may be indulged and which require further recommendation before we can make use of them on the path of empirical inquiry then physics the conception of god remains always a conception of the perfection of the first being not accurately enough determined to be held adequate to the conception of deity with metaphysic in its transcendental part nothing whatever can be accomplished when i now try to test this conception by reference to the object of practical reason i find that the moral principle admits as possible only the conception of an author of the world possessed of the highest perfection he must be omniscient in order to know my conduct up to the inmost root of my mental state in all possible cases and into all future time omnipotent in order to allot to it its fitting consequences similarly he must be omnipresent eternal c thus the moral law by means of the conception of the summum bonum as the object of a pure practical reason determines the concept of the first being as the supreme being a thing which the physical and in its higher development the metaphysical in other words
