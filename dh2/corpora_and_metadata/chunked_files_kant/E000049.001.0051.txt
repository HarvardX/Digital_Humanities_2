which everyone makes this desire determine his will for whereas in other cases a universal law of nature makes everything harmonious here on the contrary if we attribute to the maxim the universality of a law the extreme opposite of harmony will follow the greatest opposition and the complete destruction of the maxim itself and its purpose for in that case the will of all has not one and the same object but everyone has his own his private welfare which may accidentally accord with the purposes of others which are equally selfish but it is far from sufficing for a law because the occasional exceptions which one is permitted to make are endless and can not be definitely embraced in one universal rule in this manner then results a harmony like that which a certain satirical poem depicts as existing between a married couple bent on going to ruin o marvellous harmony what he wishes she wishes also or like what is said of the pledge of francis i to the emperor charles v what my brother charles wishes that i wish also viz milan empirical principles of determination are not fit for any universal external legislation but just as little for internal for each man makes his own subject the foundation of his inclination and in the same subject sometimes one inclination sometimes another has the preponderance to discover a law which would govern them all under this condition namely bringing them all into harmony is quite impossible § v — problem i supposing that the mere legislative form of maxims is alone the sufficient determining principle of a will to find the nature of the will which can be determined by it alone since the bare form of the law can only be conceived by reason and is therefore not an object of the senses and consequently does not belong to the class of phenomena it follows that the idea of it which determines the will is distinct from all the principles that determine events in nature according to the law of causality because in their case the determining principles must themselves be phenomena now if no other determining principle can serve as a law for the will except that universal legislative form such a will must be conceived as quite independent on the natural law of phenomena in their mutual relation namely the law of causality such independence is called freedom in the strictest that is in the transcendental sense consequently a will which can have its law in nothing but the mere legislative form of the maxim is a free will § vi — problem ii supposing that a will is free to find the law which alone is competent to determine it necessarily since the matter of the practical law i e an object of the maxim can never be given otherwise than empirically and the free will is independent on empirical conditions that is conditions belonging to the world of sense and yet is determinable consequently a free will must find its principle of determination in the law and yet independently of the matter of the law but besides the matter of the law nothing is contained in it except the legislative form it is the legislative form then contained in the maxim which can alone constitute a principle of determination of the free will remark 0 thus freedom and an unconditional practical law reciprocally imply each other now i do not ask here whether they are in fact distinct or whether an unconditioned law is not rather merely the consciousness of a pure practical reason and the latter identical with the positive concept of freedom i only ask whence begins our knowledge of the unconditionally practical whether it is from freedom or from the practical law now it can not begin from freedom for of this we can not be immediately conscious since the first concept of it is negative nor can we infer it from experience for experience gives us the knowledge only of the law of phenomena and hence of the mechanism of nature the direct opposite of freedom it is therefore the moral law of which we become directly conscious as soon as we trace for ourselves maxims of the will that first presents itself to us and leads directly to the concept of freedom inasmuch as reason presents it as a principle of determination not to be outweighed by any sensible conditions nay wholly independent of them but how is the consciousness of that moral law possible we can become conscious of pure practical laws just as we are conscious of pure theoretical principles by attending to the necessity with which reason prescribes them and to the elimination of all empirical conditions which it directs the concept of a pure will arises out of the former as that of a pure understanding arises out of the latter that this is the true subordination of our concepts and that it is morality that first discovers to us the notion of freedom hence that it is practical reason which with this concept first proposes to speculative reason the most insoluble problem thereby placing it in the greatest perplexity is evident from the following consideration—since nothing in phenomena can be explained by the concept of freedom but the mechanism of nature must constitute the only clue moreover when pure reason tries to ascend in the series of causes to the unconditioned it falls into an antinomy which is entangled in incomprehensibilities on the one side as much as the other whilst the latter namely mechanism is at least useful in the explanation of phenomena therefore no one would ever have been so rash as to introduce freedom into science had not the moral law and with it practical reason come in and forced this notion upon us experience however confirms this order of notions suppose some one asserts of his lustful appetite that when the desired object and the opportunity are
