in this respect that it is morally possible to be externally compelled to the latter whereas the former rests on free selfconstraint only for finite holy beings which can not even be tempted to the violation of duty there is no doctrine of virtue but only moral philosophy the latter being an autonomy of practical reason whereas the former is also an autocracy of it that is it includes a consciousness—not indeed immediately perceived but rightly concluded from the moral categorical imperative—of the power to become master of ones inclinations which resist the law so that human morality in its highest stage can yet be nothing more than virtue even if it were quite pure perfectly free from the influence of a spring foreign to duty a state which is poetically personified under the name of the wise man as an ideal to which one should continually approximate virtue however is not to be defined and esteemed merely as habit and as it is expressed in the prize essay of cochius as a long custom acquired by practice of morally good actions for if this is not an effect of well resolved and firm principles ever more and more purified then like any other mechanical arrangement brought about by technical practical reason it is neither armed for all circumstances nor adequately secured against the change that may be wrought by new allurements remark to virtue a is opposed as its logical contradictory contradictorie oppositum the negative lack of virtue moral weakness 0 but vice a is its contrary contrarie s realiter oppositum and it is not merely a needless question but an offensive one to ask whether great crimes do not perhaps demand more strength of mind than great virtues for by strength of mind we understand the strength of purpose of a man as a being endowed with freedom and consequently so far as he is master of himself in his senses and therefore in a healthy condition of mind but great crimes are paroxysms the very sight of which makes the man of healthy mind shudder the question would therefore be something like this whether a man in a fit of madness can have more physical strength than if he is in his senses and we may admit this without on that account ascribing to him more strength of mind if by mind we understand the vital principle of man in the free use of his powers for since those crimes have their ground merely in the power of the inclinations that weaken reason which does not prove strength of mind this question would be nearly the same as the question whether a man in a fit of illness can show more strength than in a healthy condition and this may be directly denied since the want of health which consists in the proper balance of all the bodily forces of the man is a weakness in the system of these forces by which system alone we can estimate absolute health iii —of the reason for conceiving an end which is also a duty an end is an object of the free elective will the idea of which determines this will to an action by which the object is produced accordingly every action has its end and as no one can have an end without himself making the object of his elective will his end hence to have some end of actions is an act of the freedom of the agent not an effect of physical nature now since this act which determines an end is a practical principle which commands not the means therefore not conditionally but the end itself therefore unconditionally hence it is a categorical imperative of pure practical reason and one therefore which combines a concept of duty with that of an end in general now there must be such an end and a categorical imperative corresponding to it for since there are free actions there must also be ends to which as an object those actions are directed amongst these ends there must also be some which are at the same time that is by their very notion duties for if there were none such then since no actions can be without an end all ends which practical reason might have would be valid only as means to other ends and a categorical imperative would be impossible a supposition which destroys all moral philosophy 0 here therefore we treat not of ends which man actually makes to himself in accordance with the sensible impulses of his nature but of objects of the free elective will under its own laws objects which he ought to make his end we may call the former technical subjective properly pragmatical including the rules of prudence in the choice of its ends but the latter we must call the moral objective doctrine of ends this distinction is however superfluous here since moral philosophy already by its very notion is clearly separated from the doctrine of physical nature in the present instance anthropology the latter resting on empirical principles whereas the moral doctrine of ends which treats of duties rests on principles given à priori in pure practical reason iv —what are the ends which are also duties they are—our own perfection the happiness of others we can not invert these and make on one side our own happiness and on the other the perfection of others ends which should be in themselves duties for the same person for ones own happiness is no doubt an end that all men have by virtue of the impulse of their nature but this end can not without contradiction be regarded as a duty what a man of himself inevitably wills does not come under the notion of duty for this is a constraint to an end reluctantly adopted it is therefore a contradiction to say that a man is in duty bound to advance his own happiness with all his power
