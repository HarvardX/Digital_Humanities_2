our conduct hence it is just as impossible for the subtlest philosophy as for the commonest reason of men to argue away freedom philosophy must then assume that no real contradiction will be found between freedom and physical necessity of the same human actions for it can not give up the conception of nature any more than that of freedom nevertheless even though we should never be able to comprehend how freedom is possible we must at least remove this apparent contradiction in a convincing manner for if the thought of freedom contradicts either itself or nature which is equally necessary it must in competition with physical necessity be entirely given up it would however be impossible to escape this contradiction if the thinking subject which seems to itself free conceived itself in the same sense or in the very same relation when it calls itself free as when in respect of the same action it assumes itself to be subject to the law of nature hence it is an indispensable problem of speculative philosophy to show that its illusion respecting the contradiction rests on this that we think of man in a different sense and relation when we call him free and when we regard him as subject to the laws of nature as being part and parcel of nature it must therefore show that not only can both these very well coexist but that both must be thought as necessarily united in the same subject since otherwise no reason could be given why we should burden reason with an idea which though it may possibly without contradiction be reconciled with another that is sufficiently established yet entangles us in a perplexity which sorely embarrasses reason in its theoretic employment this duty however belongs only to speculative philosophy in order that it may clear the way for practical philosophy the philosopher then has no option whether he will remove the apparent contradiction or leave it untouched for in the latter case the theory respecting this would be bonum vacans into the possession of which the fatalist would have a right to enter and chase all morality out of its supposed domain as occupying it without title we can not however as yet say that we are touching the bounds of practical philosophy for the settlement of that controversy does not belong to it it only demands from speculative reason that it should put an end to the discord in which it entangles itself in theoretical questions so that practical reason may have rest and security from external attacks which might make the ground debatable on which it desires to build the claims to freedom of will made even by common reason are founded on the consciousness and the admitted supposition that reason is independent on merely subjectively determined causes which together constitute what belongs to sensation only and which consequently come under the general designation of sensibility man considering himself in this way as an intelligence places himself thereby in a different order of things and in a relation to determining grounds of a wholly different kind when on the one hand he thinks of himself as an intelligence endowed with a will and consequently with causality and when on the other he perceives himself as a phenomenon in the world of sense as he really is also and affirms that his causality is subject to external determination according to laws of nature now he soon becomes aware that both can hold good nay must hold good at the same time for there is not the smallest contradiction in saying that a thing in appearance belonging to the world of sense is subject to certain laws on which the very same as a thing or being in itself is independent and that he must conceive and think of himself in this twofold way rests as to the first on the consciousness of himself as an object affected through the senses and as to the second on the consciousness of himself as an intelligence i e as independent on sensible impressions in the employment of his reason in other words as belonging to the world of understanding hence it comes to pass that man claims the possession of a will which takes no account of anything that comes under the head of desires and inclinations and on the contrary conceives actions as possible to him nay even as necessary which can only be done by disregarding all desires and sensible inclinations the causality of such actions lies in him as an intelligence and in the laws of effects and actions which depend on the principles of an intelligible world of which indeed he knows nothing more than that in it pure reason alone independent on sensibility gives the law moreover since it is only in that world as an intelligence that he is his proper self being as man only the appearance of himself those laws apply to him directly and categorically so that the incitements of inclinations and appetites in other words the whole nature of the world of sense can not impair the laws of his volition as an intelligence nay he does not even hold himself responsible for the former or ascribe them to his proper self i e his will he only ascribes to his will any indulgence which he might yield them if he allowed them to influence his maxims to the prejudice of the rational laws of the will when practical reason thinks itself into a world of understanding it does not thereby transcend its own limits as it would if it tried to enter it by intuition or sensation the former is only a negative thought in respect of the world of sense which does not give any laws to reason in determining the will and is positive only in this single point that this freedom as a negative characteristic is at the same time conjoined with a positive faculty and even with
