all moral worth in the person is in this case opposed to the law and while the mans acts are all good he is nevertheless bad the following explanation is necessary in order to define the conception of this propensity every propensity is either physical that is it appertains to mans will as a physical being or it is moral that is appertaining to his elective will as a moral being in the first sense there is no propensity to moral evil for this must spring from freedom and a physical propensity founded on sensible impulses to any particular use of freedom whether for good or evil is a contradiction a propensity to evil then can only attach to the elective will as a moral faculty now nothing is morally bad that is capable of being imputed but what is our own act on the other hand by the notion of a propensity we understand a subjective ground of determination of the elective will antecedent to any act and which is consequently not itself an act hence there would be a contradiction in the notion of a mere propensity to evil unless indeed this word act could be taken in two distinct senses both reconcilable with the notion of freedom now the term act in general applies to that use of freedom by which the supreme maxim is adopted into ones elective will conformably or contrary to the law as well as to that in which actions themselves as to their matter that is the objects of the elective will are performed in accordance with that maxim the propensity to evil is an act in the former sense peccatum originarium and is at the same time the formal source of every act in the second sense which in its matter violates the law and is called vice peccatum derivativum and the first fault remains even though the second may be often avoided from motives other than the law itself the former is an intelligible act only cognizable by reason apart from any condition of time the latter sensible empirical given in time factum phœnomenon the former is especially called in comparison with the second a mere propensity and innate because it can not be extirpated since this would require that the supreme maxim should be good whereas by virtue of that propensity itself it is supposed to be bad and especially because although the corruption of our supreme maxim is our own act we can not assign any further cause for it any more than for any fundamental attribute of our nature what has just been said will show the reason why we have at the beginning of this section sought the three sources of moral evil simply in that which by laws of freedom affects the ultimate ground of our adopting or obeying this or that maxim not in what affects the sensibility as receptivity iii man is by nature bad vitiis nemo sine nascitur —horat according to what has been said above the proposition man is bad can only mean he is conscious of the moral law and yet has adopted into his maxim occasional deviation therefrom he is by nature bad is equivalent to saying this holds of him considered as a species not as if such a quality could be inferred from the specific conception of man that of man in general for then it would be necessary but by what is known of him through experience he can not be otherwise judged or it may be presupposed as subjectively necessary in every man even the best now this propensity itself must be considered as morally bad and consequently not as a natural property but as something that can be imputed to the man and consequently must consist in maxims of the elective will which are opposed to the law but on account of freedom these must be looked upon as in themselves contingent which is inconsistent with the universality of this badness unless the ultimate subjective ground of all maxims is by whatever means interwoven with humanity and as it were rooted in it hence we call this a natural propensity to evil and as the man must nevertheless always incur the blame of it it may be called even a radical badness in human nature innate but not the less drawn upon us by ourselves now that there must be such a corrupt propensity rooted in men need not be formally proved in the face of the multitude of crying examples which experience sets before ones eyes in the acts of man if examples are desired from that state in which many philosophers hoped to find preeminently the natural goodness of human nature namely the socalled state of nature we need only look at the instances of unprovoked cruelty in the scenes of murder in tofoa new zealand the navigator 0 islands and the neverceasing instances in the wide wastes of northwest america mentioned by captain hearne where no one has even the least advantage from it and comparing these with that hypothesis we have vices of savage life more than enough to make us abandon that opinion on the other hand if one is disposed to think that human nature can be better known in a civilized condition in which its characteristic properties can be more perfectly developed then one must listen to a long melancholy litany of complaints of humanity of secret falsehood even in the most intimate friendship so that it is reckoned a general maxim of prudence that even the best friends should restrain their confidence in their mutual intercourse of a propensity to hate the man to whom one is under an obligation for which a benefactor must always be prepared of a hearty goodwill which nevertheless admits the remark that in the misfortunes of our best friends there is something which is not altogether displeasing to us and of many other vices concealed under the appearance of virtue
