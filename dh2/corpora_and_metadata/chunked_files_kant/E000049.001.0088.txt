is as merely regulating the inclinations under the sensible principle of happiness we could not require speculative reason to take its principles from such a source mohammeds paradise or the absorption into the deity of the theosophists and mystics would press their monstrosities on the reason according to the taste of each and one might as well have no reason as surrender it in such fashion to all sorts of dreams but if pure reason of itself can be practical and is actually so as the consciousness of the moral law proves then it is still only one and the same reason which whether in a theoretical or a practical point of view judges according to à priori principles and then it is clear that although it is in the first point of view incompetent to establish certain propositions positively which however do not contradict it then as soon as these propositions are inseparably attached to the practical interest of pure reason then it must accept them though it be as something offered to it from a foreign source something that has not grown on its own ground but yet is sufficiently authenticated and it must try to compare and connect them with everything that it has in its power as speculative reason it must remember however that these are not additions to its insight but yet are extensions of its employment in another namely a practical aspect and this is not in the least opposed to its interest which consists in the restriction of wild speculation thus when pure speculative and pure practical reason are combined in one cognition the latter has the primacy provided namely that this combination is not contingent and arbitrary but founded à priori on reason itself and therefore necessary for without this subordination there would arise a conflict of reason with itself since if they were merely coordinate the former would close its boundaries strictly and admit nothing from the latter into its domain while the latter would extend its bounds over everything and when its needs required would seek to embrace the former within them nor could we reverse the order and require pure practical reason to be subordinate to the speculative since all interest is ultimately practical and even that of speculative reason is conditional and it is only in the practical employment of reason that it is complete iv —the immortality of the soul as a postulate of pure practical reason the realization of the summum bonum in the world is the necessary object of a will determinable by the moral law but in this will the perfect accordance of the mind with the moral law is the supreme condition of the summum bonum this then must be possible as well as its object since it is contained in the command to promote the latter now the perfect accordance of the will with the moral law is holiness a perfection of which no rational being of the sensible world is capable at any moment of his existence since nevertheless it is required as practically necessary it can only be found in a progress in infinitum towards that perfect accordance and on the principles of pure practical reason it is necessary to assume such a practical progress as the real object of our will now this endless progress is only possible on the supposition of an endless duration of the existence and personality of the same rational being which is called the immortality of the soul the summum bonum then practically is only possible on the supposition of the immortality of the soul consequently this immortality being inseparably connected with the moral law is a postulate of pure practical reason by which i mean a theoretical proposition not demonstrable as such but which is an inseparable result of an unconditional à priori practical law this principle of the moral destination of our nature namely that it is only in an endless progress that we can attain perfect accordance with the moral law is of the greatest use not merely for the present purpose of supplementing the impotence of speculative reason but also with respect to religion in default of it either the moral law is quite degraded from its holiness being made out to be indulgent and conformable to our convenience or else men strain their notions of their vocation and their expectation to an unattainable goal hoping to acquire complete holiness of will and so they lose themselves in fanatical theosophic dreams which wholly contradict selfknowledge in both cases the unceasing effort to obey punctually and thoroughly a strict and inflexible command of reason which yet is not ideal but real is only hindered for a rational but finite being the only thing possible is an endless progress from the lower to higher degrees of moral perfection the infinite being to whom the condition of time is nothing sees in this to us endless succession a whole of accordance with the moral law and the holiness which his command inexorably requires in order to be true to his justice in the share which he assigns to each in the summum bonum is to be found in a single intellectual intuition of the whole existence of rational beings all that can be expected of the creature in respect of the hope of this participation would be the consciousness of his tried character by which from the progress he has hitherto made from the worse to the morally better and the immutability of purpose which has thus become known to him he may hope for a further unbroken continuance of the 0 same however long his existence may last even beyond this life and thus he may hope not indeed here nor at any imaginable point of his future existence but only in the endlessness of his duration which god alone can survey to be perfectly adequate to his will without indulgence or excuse which do not harmonize with justice v —the existence
