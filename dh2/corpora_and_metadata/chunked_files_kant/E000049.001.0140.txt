trans by meiklejohn p adopting hartensteins conjecture gemeinste for reinste purest read weil with hartenstein not womit we may say of every action that conforms to the law but is not done for the sake of the law that it is morally good in the letter not in the spirit the intention jener in rosenkranzs text is an error we must read either jene this respect or jenes this feeling hartenstein adopts jenes the original sentence is incomplete i have completed it in what seems the simplest way if we examine accurately the notion of respect for persons as it has been already laid down we shall perceive that it always rests on the consciousness of a duty which an example shows us and that respect therefore can never have any but a moral ground and that it is very good and even in a psychological point of view very useful for the knowledge of mankind that whenever we use this expression we should attend to this secret and marvellous yet often recurring regard which men in their judgment pay to the moral law this law is in striking contrast with the principle of private happiness which some make the supreme principle of morality this would be expressed thus love thyself above everything and god and thy neighbour for thine own sake compare butler—though we should suppose it impossible for particular affections to be absolutely coincident with the moral principle and consequently should allow that such creatures would for ever remain defectible yet their danger of actually deviating from right may be almost infinitely lessened and they fully fortified against what remains of it—if that may be called danger against which there is an adequate effectual security—analogy fitzgeralds ed p 00 what renders this discussion not irrelevant is the fact that the german language like the english possesses but oneword to express ϕιλεɩ̂ν ἀγαπα̂ν and ἐρα̂ν the first ϕιλεɩ̂ν expresses the love of affection the general goodwill due from man to man had no name in classical greek it is described in one aspect of it by aristotle as ϕιλία ἄνεν πἀτους καὶ τονˆ στέργειν eth nic iv elsewhere however he calls it simply ϕιλία viii the verb ἀγαπάω was used by the lxx in the precept quoted in the text though elsewhere they employed it as ἐρα̂ν but in the new test the verb and with it the noun ἀγάπη which is not found in classical writers were appropriated to this state of mind aristotle it may be observed uses ἀγαπάω of love to ones own better part ix ἐρα̂ν does not occur in the new test at all butlers sermons on love of our neighbour and love of god may be usefully

verstandesbegriff i am satisfied that it refers to vernunftbegriff for it is not the understanding but the reason that seeks the unconditioned compare kritik der r v p the transcendental concept of

and musste for müsste the original has not und but als which does not give any satisfactory sense i have therefore adopted hartensteins emendation which seems at least to give the meaning intended see preface p note it seems nevertheless impossible for a creature to have the conviction of his unwavering firmness of mind in the progress towards goodness on this account the christian religion makes it come only from the same spirit that works sanctification that is this firm purpose and with it the consciousness of steadfastness in the moral progress but naturally one who is conscious that he has persevered through a long portion of his life up to the end in the progress to the better and this from genuine moral motives may well have the comforting hope though not the certainty that even in an existence prolonged beyond this life he will continue steadfast in these principles and although he is never justified here in his own eyes nor can ever hope to be so in the increased perfection of his nature to which he looks forward together with an increase of duties nevertheless in this progress which though it is directed to a goal infinitely remote yet is in gods sight regarded as equivalent to possession he may have a prospect of a blessed future for this is the word that reason employs to designate perfect wellbeing independent on all contingent causes of the world and which like holiness is an idea that can be contained only in an endless progress and its totality and consequently is never fully attained by a creature the ὐπομονή of the n t the original has a supreme
