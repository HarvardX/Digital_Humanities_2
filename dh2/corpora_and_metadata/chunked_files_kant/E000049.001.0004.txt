time as he believed he gave the true account of the trade winds and monsoons halley had shown that the effect of the sun in heating the atmosphere at the equator would be to cause an indraught towards the equator from north and south this indraught according to him naturally followed the daily course of the sun and hence the easting kant showed that this theory was untenable in fact the wind would tend rather to meet the sun the region to the west being the cooler nor could a wind from such a cause extend with nearly equal force all round the earth kant showed further that owing to the difference in the velocity of rotation between the parts near the equator and those near the poles all winds that move from the poles towards the equator tend to become more and more easterly and those that move from the equator towards the poles become more and more xxvii westerly hence in the northern hemisphere every north wind tends to become a northeast and every south wind a southwest wind in the southern hemisphere on the contrary south winds tend to become southeast and north winds northwest he follows out in some detail the general principles of this circulation of the atmosphere we can thus explain for instance the monsoons of the indian ocean c which blow from april to september from the southwest for when the sun is north of the equator the wind blows from the equator towards these parts and therefore takes a southwesterly direction again the current from the poles towards the equator is balanced by a counter current the heated air in the upper strata at the equator overflowing as it were towards the poles when this descends or overcomes the weaker motion of the lower strata it becomes in the northern hemisphere a westerly wind such as prevail between the th and 0th degrees of latitude kant subsequently introduced this theory into his course of lectures on physical geography which was very numerously attended laplace propounded the same theory forty years later xxviii in kant published his essay on the only possible demonstrative proof of the existence of god the proof developed in this essay is founded on the principle that every possibility of existence presupposes an actually existing thing on which it depends this he characterizes as a more thoroughly à priori argument than any other that has been proposed since it does not assume any actual fact of existence i need not explain how he develops step by step the attributes of unity intelligence c at a later period he himself abandoned this line of argument however the greater part of the essay is occupied with remarks on design in the constitution of nature and with an exposition of the theory developed in the abovementioned treatise on the structure of the heavens we may he observes argue from design either as exhibited in a contingent arrangement for example in the body of an animal or in a plant or we may argue from the necessary results of the constitution of matter the laws of motion c the latter method has the great advantage of presenting the first cause not merely as an architect but as a creator from this point of view he instances first the simplicity and harmony resulting from the geometrical conditions of space e g that if we seek all the paths which a falling body would traverse either to or from the same point in the same time they are found to be chords of the same circle again he takes the manifold and harmonious benefits resulting by necessary laws from the mere fact of the existence of an atmosphere there may be many reasons for its existence if we suppose its primary purpose to be that it should serve for respiration we find that its existence leads to other xxix important beneficial results it makes clouds possible which intercept excessive heat prevents too rapid cooling and drying and keeps the land supplied with the necessary moisture from the great reservoir of the sea by causing twilight it prevents the strain on the eyes which would be caused by the sudden change from day to night its existence prevents rain from dropping with too great force and its pressure makes sucking possible if it occurs to anyone to say—oh these are all the necessary results of the nature of matter c he answers yes it is just this that shows that they proceed from a wise creator he treats of the laws of motion from the same point of view and then takes occasion to show how the laws of the planetary motions result from the simplest laws of matter attraction and repulsion in conclusion he remarks that while it is of the greatest consequence to be convinced of the existence of god it is by no means necessary to have a demonstration of it and those who can not grasp the demonstrative proof are advised to hold fast by the more easily apprehended proof from design hardly indeed he observes would anyone stake his whole happiness on the correctness of a metaphysical proof especially if it were opposed to the convictions of sense the argument from design is more striking and vivid as well as easy to the common understanding and more natural than any other it also gives an idea of the wisdom and providence c of god which comes home and has the greatest effect in producing awe and humility and it is in fine more practical than any other even in the view of a philosopher it does not indeed give a definite abstract idea of xxx divinity nor does it claim mathematical certainty but so many proofs each of great force take possession of the soul and the speculation may calmly follow since conviction has preceded—a conviction far above the force of any subtile objections in the same year in which kant
