mistakes first they suppose that they have before them a complete system instead of a portion only and secondly they mistake lxiv the attitude of suspense with regard to the supersensible reality for a dogmatic negation of all knowledge thereof when they come to the practical works they find the impression thus formed respecting kants attitude towards the supersensible contradicted but the inconsistency is not between the two parts of kants system but between his system as a whole and the impression derived from a partial view of it that he limits his affirmation of the supersensible to its practical aspect is quite in accordance with the spirit of his philosophy nor is this limitation so very unlike that of the commonsense philosopher locke who in speaking of the limits of our faculties says that men have reason to be well satisfied since god hath given them whatever is necessary for the conveniences of life and the information of virtue adding how short soever their knowledge may come of an universal or perfect comprehension of whatsoever is it yet secures their great concernments that they have light enough to lead them to the knowledge of their maker and the sight of their own duties essay bk ch i § fundamental principles of the metaphysics of morals preface ancient greek philosophy was divided into three sciences physics ethics and logic this division is perfectly suitable to the nature of the thing and the only improvement that can be made in it is to add the principle on which it is based so that we may both satisfy ourselves of its completeness and also be able to determine correctly the necessary subdivisions all rational knowledge is either material or formal the former considers some object the latter is concerned only with the form of the understanding and of the reason itself and with the universal laws of thought in general without distinction of its objects formal philosophy is called logic material philosophy however which has to do with determinate objects and the laws to which they are subject is again twofold for these laws are either laws of nature or of freedom the science of the former is physics that of the latter ethics they are also called natural philosophy and moral philosophy respectively logic can not have any empirical part that is a part in which the universal and necessary laws of thought should rest on grounds taken from experience otherwise it would not be logic ie a canon for the understanding or the reason valid for all thought and capable of demonstration natural and moral philosophy on the contrary can each have their empirical part since the former has to determine the laws of nature as an object of experience the latter the laws of the human will so far as it is affected by nature the former however being laws according to which everything does happen the latter laws according to which everything ought to happen ethics however must also consider the conditions under which what ought to happen frequently does not we may call all philosophy empirical so far as it is based on grounds of experience on the other hand that which delivers its doctrines from à priori principles alone we may call pure philosophy when the latter is merely formal it is logic if it is restricted to definite objects of the understanding it is metaphysic in this way there arises the idea of a twofold metaphysic—a metaphysic of nature and a metaphysic of morals physics will thus have an empirical and also a rational part it is the same with ethics but here the empirical part might have the special name of practical anthropology the name morality being appropriated to the rational part all trades arts and handiworks have gained by division of labour namely when instead of one man doing everything each confines himself to a certain kind of work distinct from others in the treatment it requires so as to be able to perform it with greater facility and in the greatest perfection where the different kinds of work are not so distinguished and divided where everyone is a jackofalltrades there manufactures remain still in the greatest barbarism it might deserve to be considered whether pure philosophy in all its parts does not require a man specially devoted to it and whether it would not be better for the whole business of science if those who to please the tastes of the public are wont to blend the rational and empirical elements together mixed in all sorts of proportions unknown to themselves and who call themselves independent thinkers giving the name of minute philosophers to those who apply themselves to the rational part only—if these i say were warned not to carry on two employments together which differ widely in the treatment they demand for each of which perhaps a special talent is required and the combination of which in one person only produces bunglers but i only ask here whether the nature of science does not require that we should always carefully separate the empirical from the rational part and prefix to physics proper or empirical physics a metaphysic of nature and to practical anthropology a metaphysic of morals which must be carefully cleared of everything empirical so that we may know how much can be accomplished by pure reason in both cases and from what sources it draws this its à priori teaching and that whether the latter inquiry is conducted by all moralists whose name is legion or only by some who feel a calling thereto as my concern here is with moral philosophy i limit the question suggested to this whether it is not of the utmost necessity to construct a pure moral philosophy perfectly cleared of everything which is only empirical and which belongs to anthropology for that such a philosophy must be possible is evident from the common idea of duty and of the moral laws everyone
