who can not think believe that feeling will help them out even in what concerns general laws and besides feelings which naturally differ infinitely in degree can not furnish a uniform standard of good and evil nor has any one a right to form judgments for others by his own feelings nevertheless this moral feeling is nearer to morality and its dignity in this respect that it pays virtue the honour of ascribing to her immediately the satisfaction and esteem we have for her and does not as it were tell her to her face that we are not attached to her by her beauty but by profit amongst the rational principles of morality the ontological conception of perfection notwithstanding its defects is better than the theological conception which derives morality from a divine absolutely perfect will the former is no doubt empty and indefinite and consequently useless for finding in the boundless field of possible reality the greatest amount suitable for us moreover in attempting to distinguish specifically the reality of which we are now speaking from every other it inevitably tends to turn in a circle and can not avoid tacitly presupposing the morality which it is to explain it is nevertheless preferable to the theological view first because we have no intuition of the divine perfection and can only deduce it from our own conceptions the most important of which is that of morality and our explanation would thus be involved in a gross circle and in the next place if we avoid this the only notion of the divine will remaining to us is a conception made up of the attributes of desire of glory and dominion combined with the awful conceptions of might and vengeance and any system of morals erected on this foundation would be directly opposed to morality however if i had to choose between the notion of the moral sense and that of perfection in general two systems which at least do not weaken morality although they are totally incapable of serving as its foundation then i should decide for the latter because it at least withdraws the decision of the question from the sensibility and brings it to the court of pure reason and although even here it decides nothing it at all events preserves the indefinite idea of a will good in itself free from corruption until it shall be more precisely defined for the rest i think i may be excused here from a detailed refutation of all these doctrines that would only be superfluous labour since it is so easy and is probably so well seen even by those whose office requires them to decide for one of these theories because their hearers would not tolerate suspension of judgment but what interests us more here is to know that the prime foundation of morality laid down by all these principles is nothing but heteronomy of the will and for this reason they must necessarily miss their aim in every case where an object of the will has to be supposed in order that the rule may be prescribed which is to determine the will there the rule is simply heteronomy the imperative is conditional namely if or because one wishes for this object one should act so and so hence it can never command morally that is categorically whether the object determines the will by means of inclination as in the principle of private happiness or by means of reason directed to objects of our possible volition generally as in the principle of perfection in either case the will never determines itself immediately by the conception of the action but only by the influence which the foreseen effect of the action has on the will i ought to do something on this account because i wish for something else and here there must be yet another law assumed in me as its subject by which i necessarily will this other thing and this law again requires an imperative to restrict this maxim for the influence which the conception of an object within the reach of our faculties can exercise on the will of the subject in consequence of its natural properties depends on the nature of the subject either the sensibility inclination and taste or the understanding and reason the employment of which is by the peculiar constitution of their nature attended with satisfaction it follows that the law would be properly speaking given by nature and as such it must be known and proved by experience and would consequently be contingent and therefore incapable of being an apodictic practical rule such as the moral rule must be not only so but it is inevitably only heteronomy the will does not give itself the law but it is given by a foreign impulse by means of a particular natural constitution of the subject adapted to receive it an absolutely good will then the principle of which must be a categorical imperative will be indeterminate as regards all objects and will contain merely the form of volition generally and that as autonomy that is to say the capability of the maxims of every good will to make themselves a universal law is itself the only law which the will of every rational being imposes on itself without needing to assume any spring or interest as a foundation how such a synthetical practical Ã  priori proposition is possible and why it is necessary is a problem whose solution does not lie within the bounds of the metaphysic of morals and we have not here affirmed its truth much less professed to have a proof of it in our power we simply showed by the development of the universally received notion of morality that an autonomy of the will is inevitably connected with it or rather is its foundation whoever then holds morality to be anything real and not a chimerical idea without any truth must likewise admit the principle of
