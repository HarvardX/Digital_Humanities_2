sufficiently determined in the past and in this respect is absolutely necessary for it with all the past which determines it belongs to the one single phenomenon of his character which he makes for himself in consequence of which he imputes the causality of those appearances to himself as a cause independent on sensibility with this agree perfectly the judicial sentences of that wonderful faculty in us which we call conscience a man may use as much art as he likes in order to paint to himself an unlawful act that he remembers as an unintentional error a mere oversight such as one can never altogether avoid and therefore as something in which he was carried away by the stream of physical necessity and thus to make himself out innocent yet he finds that the advocate who speaks in his favour can by no means silence the accuser within if only he is conscious that at the time when he did this wrong he was in his senses that is in possession of his freedom and nevertheless he accounts for his error from some bad habits which by gradual neglect of attention he has allowed to grow upon him to such a degree that he can regard his error as its natural consequence although this can not protect him from the blame and reproach which he casts upon himself this is also the ground of repentance for a long past action at every recollection of it a painful feeling produced by the moral sentiment and which is practically void in so far as it can not serve to undo what has been done hence priestley as a true and consistent fatalist declares it absurd and he deserves to be commended for this candour more than those who while they maintain the mechanism of the will in fact and its freedom in words only 0 yet wish it to be thought that they include it in their system of compromise although they do not explain the possibility of such moral imputation but the pain is quite legitimate because when the law of our intelligible supersensible existence the moral law is in question reason recognizes no distinction of time and only asks whether the event belongs to me as my act and then always morally connects the same feeling with it whether it has happened just now or long ago for in reference to the supersensible consciousness of its existence i e freedom the life of sense is but a single phenomenon which inasmuch as it contains merely manifestations of the mental disposition with regard to the moral law i e of the character must be judged not according to the physical necessity that belongs to it as phenomenon but according to the absolute spontaneity of freedom it may therefore be admitted that if it were possible to have so profound an insight into a mans mental character as shown by internal as well as external actions as to know all its motives even the smallest and likewise all the external occasions that can influence them we could calculate a mans conduct for the future with as great certainty as a lunar or solar eclipse and nevertheless we may maintain that the man is free in fact if we were capable of a further glance namely an intellectual intuition of the same subject which indeed is not granted to us and instead of it we have only the rational concept then we should perceive that this whole chain of appearances in regard to all that concerns the moral laws depends on the spontaneity of the subject as a thing in itself of the determination of which no physical explanation can be given in default of this intuition the moral law assures us of this distinction between the relation of our actions as appearances to our sensible nature and the relation of this sensible nature to the supersensible substratum in us in this view which is natural to our reason though inexplicable we can also justify some judgments which we passed with all conscientiousness and which yet at first sight seem quite opposed to all equity there are cases in which men even with the same education which has been profitable to others yet show such early depravity and so continue to progress in it to years of manhood that they are thought to be born villains and their character altogether incapable of improvement and nevertheless they are judged for what they do or leave undone they are reproached for their faults as guilty nay they themselves the children regard these reproaches as well founded exactly as if in spite of the hopeless natural quality of mind ascribed to them they remained just as responsible as any other man this could not happen if we did not suppose that whatever springs from a mans choice as every action intentionally performed undoubtedly does has as its foundation a free causality which from early youth expresses its character in its manifestations i e actions these on account of the uniformity of conduct exhibit a natural connexion which however does not make the vicious quality of the will necessary but on the contrary is the consequence of the evil principles voluntarily adopted and unchangeable which only make it so much the more culpable and deserving of punishment there still remains a difficulty in the combination of freedom with the mechanism of nature in a being belonging to the world of sense a difficulty which even after all the foregoing is admitted threatens freedom with complete destruction but with this danger there is also a circumstance that offers hope of an issue still favourable to freedom namely that the same difficulty presses much more strongly in fact as we shall presently see presses only on the system that holds the existence determinable in time and space to be the existence of things in themselves it does not therefore oblige us to give up our capital supposition of
