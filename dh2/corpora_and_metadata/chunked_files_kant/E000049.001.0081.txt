said that the solution here proposed involves great difficulty in itself and is scarcely susceptible of a lucid exposition but is any other solution that has been attempted or that may be attempted easier and more intelligible rather might we say that the dogmatic teachers of metaphysics have shown more shrewdness than candour in keeping this difficult point out of sight as much as possible in the hope that if they said nothing about it probably no one would think of it if science is to be advanced all difficulties must be laid open and we must even search for those that are hidden for every difficulty calls forth a remedy which can not be discovered without science gaining either in extent or in exactness and thus even obstacles become means of increasing the thoroughness of science on the other hand if the difficulties are intentionally concealed or merely removed by palliatives then sooner or later they burst out into incurable mischiefs which bring science to ruin in an absolute scepticism since it is properly speaking the notion of freedom alone amongst all the ideas of pure speculative reason that so greatly enlarges our knowledge in the sphere of the supersensible though only of our practical knowledge i ask myself why it exclusively possesses so great fertility whereas the others only designate the vacant space for possible beings of the pure understanding but are unable by any means to define the concept of them i presently find that as i can not think anything without a category i must first look for a category for the rational idea of freedom with which i am now concerned and this is the category of causality and although freedom a concept of the reason being a transcendent concept can not have any intuition corresponding to it yet the concept of the understanding—for the synthesis of which the former demands the unconditioned—namely the concept of causality must have a sensible intuition given by which first its objective reality is assured now the categories are all divided into two classes—the mathematical which concern the unity of synthesis in the conception of objects and the dynamical which refer to the unity of synthesis in the conception of the existence of objects the former those of magnitude and quality always contain a synthesis of the homogeneous and it is not possible to find in this the unconditioned antecedent to what is given in sensible intuition as conditioned in space and time as this would itself have to belong to space and time and therefore be again still conditioned whence it resulted in the dialectic of pure theoretic reason that the opposite methods of attaining the unconditioned and the totality of the conditions were both wrong the categories of the second class those of causality and of the necessity of a thing did not require this homogeneity of the conditioned and the condition in synthesis since here what we have to explain is not how the intuition is compounded from a manifold in it but only how the existence of the conditioned object corresponding to it is added to the existence of the condition added namely in the understanding as connected therewith and in that case it was allowable to suppose in the supersensible world the unconditioned antecedent to the altogether conditioned in the world of sense both as regards the causal connexion and the contingent existence of things themselves although this unconditioned remained indeterminate and to make the synthesis transcendent hence it was found in the dialectic of the pure speculative reason that the two apparently opposite methods of obtaining for the conditioned the unconditioned were not really contradictory e g in the synthesis of causality to conceive for the conditioned in the series of causes and effects of the sensible world a causality which has no sensible condition and that the same action which as belonging to the world of sense is always sensibly conditioned that is mechanically necessary yet at the same time may be derived from a causality not sensibly conditioned—being the causality of the acting being as belonging to the supersensible world—and may consequently be conceived as free now the only point in question was to change this may be into is that is that we should be able to show in an actual case as it were by a fact that certain actions imply such a causality namely the intellectual sensibly unconditioned whether they are actual or only commanded that is objectively necessary in a practical sense we could not hope to find this connexion in actions actually given in experience as events of the sensible world since causality with freedom must always be sought outside the world of sense in the world of intelligence but things of sense are the only things offered to our perception and observation hence nothing remained but to find an inconstestable objective principle of causality which excludes all sensible conditions that is a principle in which reason does not appeal further to something else as a determining ground of its causality but contains this determining ground itself by means of that principle and in which therefore it is itself as pure reason practical now this principle had not to be 00 searched for or discovered it had long been in the reason of all men and incorporated in their nature and is the principle of morality therefore that unconditioned causality with the faculty of it namely freedom is no longer merely indefinitely and problematically thought this speculative reason could prove to be feasible but is even as regards the law of its causality definitely and assertorially known and with it the fact that a being i myself belonging to the world of sense belongs also to the supersensible world this is also positively known and thus the reality of the supersensible world is established and in practical respects definitely given and this definiteness which for theoretical purposes would be transcendent is for practical purposes immanent we
