on the heart i affirm further that even in that admired action if the motive from which it was done was a high regard for duty then it is just this respect for the law that has the greatest influence on the mind of the spectator not any pretension to a supposed inward greatness of mind or noble meritorious sentiments consequently duty not merit must have not only the most definite but when it is represented in the true light of its inviolability the most penetrating influence on the mind it is more necessary than ever to direct attention to this method in our times when men hope to produce more effect on the mind with soft tender feelings or highflown puffingup pretensions which rather wither the heart than strengthen it than by a plain and earnest representation of duty which is more suited to human imperfection and to progress in goodness to set before children as a pattern actions that are called noble magnanimous meritorious with the notion of captivating them by infusing an enthusiam for such actions is to defeat our end 0 for as they are still so backward in the observance of the commonest duty and even in the correct estimation of it this means simply to make them fantastical romancers betimes but even with the instructed and experienced part of mankind this supposed spring has if not an injurious at least no genuine moral effect on the heart which however is what it was desired to produce all feelings especially those that are to produce unwonted exertions must accomplish their effect at the moment they are at their height and before they calm down otherwise they effect nothing for as there was nothing to strengthen the heart but only to excite it it naturally returns to its normal moderate tone and thus falls back into its previous languor principles must be built on conceptions on any other basis there can only be paroxysms which can give the person no moral worth nay not even confidence in himself without which the highest good in man consciousness of the morality of his mind and character can not exist now if these conceptions are to become subjectively practical we must not rest satisfied with admiring the objective law of morality and esteeming it highly in reference to humanity but we must consider the conception of it in relation to man as an individual and then this law appears in a form indeed that is highly deserving of respect but not so pleasant as if it belonged to the element to which he is naturally accustomed but on the contrary as often compelling him to quit this element not without selfdenial and to betake himself to a higher in which he can only maintain himself with trouble and with unceasing apprehension of a relapse in a word the moral law demands 0 obedience from duty not from predilection which can not and ought not to be presupposed at all let us now see in an example whether the conception of an action as a noble and magnanimous one has more subjective moving power than if the action is conceived merely as duty in relation to the solemn law of morality the action by which a man endeavours at the greatest peril of life to rescue people from shipwreck at last losing his life in the attempt is reckoned on one side as duty but on the other and for the most part as a meritorious action but our esteem for it is much weakened by the notion of duty to himself which seems in this case to be somewhat infringed more decisive is the magnanimous sacrifice of life for the safety of ones country and yet there still remains some scruple whether it is a perfect duty to devote ones self to this purpose spontaneously and unbidden and the action has not in itself the full force of a pattern and impulse to imitation but if an indispensable duty be in question the transgression of which violates the moral law itself and without regard to the welfare of mankind and as it were tramples on its holiness such as are usually called duties to god because in him we conceive the ideal of holiness in substance then we give our most perfect esteem to the pursuit of it at the sacrifice of all that can have any value for the dearest inclinations and we find our soul strengthened and elevated by such an example when we convince ourselves by contemplation of it that human nature is capable of so great an elevation above every motive that nature can oppose to it juvenal describes such an example in a climax which makes the reader feel vividly the force of the spring that is contained in the pure law of duty as duty 0 esto bonus miles tutor bonus arbiter idem integer ambiguae si quando citabere testis incertaeque rei phalaris licet imperet ut sis falsus et admoto dictet periuria tauro summum crede nefas animam pr√¶ferre pudori et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas when we can bring any flattering thought of merit into our action then the motive is already somewhat alloyed with selflove and has therefore some assistance from the side of the sensibility but to postpone everything to the holiness of duty alone and to be conscious that we can because our own reason recognises this as its command and says that we ought to do it this is as it were to raise ourselves altogether above the world of sense and there is inseparably involved in the same a consciousness of the law as a spring of a faculty that controls the sensibility and although this is not always attended with effect yet frequent engagement with this spring and the at first minor attempts at using it give hope that this effect may be wrought and that by degrees the greatest and that a purely moral interest in it
