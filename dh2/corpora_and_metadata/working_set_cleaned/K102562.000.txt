the scottish village or pitcairne green  price two shillings  the scottish village or pitcairne green a poem by mrs cowley  london printed for g g j and j robinson in paternoster row mdcclxxxvii  a preface reading the paper lately at breakfast i saw an account of the splendid ceremonies used at pitcairne green in scotland on marking the boundaries of an extensive village to be erected on that spot for the purpose of introducing the lancashire manufactures these ceremonies were assisted by all the persons of consequence of each sex in that part of the kingdom  amongst the ladies were mrs graham lady c graham etc etc as my eye ran it over it dropped a tear on the passage it must have appeared ridiculous enough for there was certainly nothing very moving in it  however i have ventured to give both the tear and the feelings which made it start to the genius of the place i wrote merely to appease my sensations and having written according to the old story my friends advised me to publish and they are obeyed if the public should not find the trifle interesting they will at least do it the justice to let it slide into oblivion and forgive i trust the few hours the composition cost me  the little work has not been without its difficulties my canvas was to hint a landscape  a landscape in a country which i had never seen the accounts presented by travelers might be false or they might be invidious yet they were to govern me notwithstanding i yielded to this images very dissimilar crowded to my pen the prospects of devon  dear native scenes were for ever before me and all my recollection was necessary to prevent the tears of dryades from falling for the loss of their shades and the nightingale from pouring its regrets that its ancient habitations were invaded  had the site of the intended village been in that province description would have had room to range  fancy might have rioted and the most luxuriant imagination sated itself there a poet might have led his readers through verdant lanes for so in other counties devons turnpikes would be named where the high hedges composed of hawthorn sweetbrier myrtle and a thousand flowers effectually screens the traveller from the most sultry sun  there through the breaks a country presents itself all enchantment and where if the cottager did not boast views as delightful as the nabob and the patrician the whole province might be mistaken for one vast artificial pleasureground whilst the ear is filled with all the music poured from the throats of the goldfinch the blackbird and the thrush the eye incessantly wanders over painted meads and roves from hill to dale  rests on the soft foliage of sloping woods and pursues the serpentine of pellucid rivers  beholds fields of burnished corn waving like a golden sea to the tremulous breeze and orchards laden with such fruit as makes the story of the hesperides scarcely seem a fable  this little sketch literal not poetical is for the information of those of my friends in scotland who have not yet crossed the tweed and to suggest to them when they do not to return persuaded of having seen the landscapes of england unless they have traveled through dorsetshire somerset and devon  it has been told to me that this village and doctor goldsmiths will be contrasted  i earnestly deprecate so fatal a comparison goldsmiths is the poem of a politician and soars with a strong wing  mine is a butterfly fluttering over the field and here and there reposing on a cowslip or a daisey that was defended from criticism by its magnitude may this find safety in its littleness  h cowley  to those who may think the measure in which the poem is written needs an excuse the following is offered  the alternate verse of ten syllables has been pronounced by dryden whose knowledge of english meter was not inconsiderable to be the most perfect of all the measures which our language affords doctor johnson the scottish village or pitcairne green why weeps the genius of the arid waste bending thus pensive from her fulgent sky can beings pure like thee of sorrow taste  those next to angel ever breathe a sigh sage yet unlearned it is now thy hour to know that the dear privilege to feel  to sigh  to bid the tear from sacred pity flow is not alone for man or earthformd eye where the preeminence that angels boast if coldly conscious in eternal rest they form a bright insensate vapry host by heavens most precious gift to feel unblest the keenest feelings of the human mind exist more keenly in the angelic frame more elevated poignant and refined  as earths more sordid than ethereal flame wonder not therefore that an angels brows thus drooping should no cheering luster shed but give attention  so thy fate allows whilst i record the woes for which it fled behold this plain stretched by creations hand when each chaotic element arousd sprung forth elastic at the dread command  fled to its home and there obedient housed since that first instant of the youngborn time guiltless the moments of this plain have run each closing year and summers happy prime in sweet simplicity its hours have spun the yellow broom that gilds its farthest bounds and verdant carpet softly spread between mark where light fairies nightly trip their rounds happy to gambol secret and unseen here calmest zephires waft their airy wings and birds of solitude flit musing by and sometimes too the bird that sweetly sings chants forth its pleasures to the lucid sky  whilst in the blushing chambers of the west a thousand tender dies their tints prepare which rapidly the horizon round invest streaming prismatic glories through the air that russet mountain on whose farthest side the modest beams of morn first ever play till from its top the ardent sun looks down and gilds the valley with a bolder ray  owns in its riven base a cavern dank where oozing filtered drops of doubtful green hardened suspended hang like willows lank a sparkling jewelld vegetative scene in that resplendent grove a hermit read mysterious natures laws that never swerve his life the virtues and religion led to sanctify the space you now observe here rapt in second sight he frequent saw the future scene appear and fade away his country groan beneath the feudal law or glut with power the tyrant of the day its neighbor england with irruptive bands watching each turn and shadings of its fate to bind with manacles its warlike hands and make it feodal to her haughtier state at length with pride he saw his scotland give monarchs to wear its rivals splendid crown blessed in the union saw each kingdom live  bound in one empire  tasting one renown sacred to visions grand like these was kept the varied circle this horizon bounds and when with seers long past the hermit slept still shadowy visitants breathed heavenly sounds twas thus when feuds unfilial tore the land and horrid war her crimson flag unfurled and dread rebellion with its sanguine hand midst peaceful swains its sharpest misries hurled  twas thus this hallowed spot misfortune spared nor war nor misery in its precincts dwelt no cry of woe its peaceful boundries scared no mother by her bleeding offspring knelt did turbid clans ever press this mossy heath have rival thanes here proudly clashd the shield twas not with hostile thoughts nor vows of death they came not here to conquer but to yield here has the oath of mutual peace been bound here melting chiefs their melting foes embrace and all the sounds that martial joy breathes round erst have reached heaven from this selected place but rolling years have drawn their veil between nay ages born of ages past away since the soft calm which blessed this modest green knew the loud clamours of a martial day repose and peace have hovered near whilst vice and shame their haunts at distance keep unknown alike to violence and fear here terrors shrink not and no sorrows weep but now approaches fast the hour of change even whilst i speak the scene i vaunt is past here shall no more the feathry fairies range  the late nocturnal revel was their last see quick advance the numerous motley crowd mechanics pedants traders pour along their joy breaks forth in carols rude and loud and beautys presence animates the song the verdant face of this once happy plain the sharptoothd mattock shall deform and tear that evil first and then an endless train follow the footsteps of yon graceful fair they bid the future town submissive to their will rises from earth and spreads its skirts around  oh that the marble in its quarry still unhewn unformed had kept its rest profound with it the social evils all rush in the opposing passions that distract mankind the blazoned crime the sly wellcoverd sin nor will one petty vice remain behind slander and avarice and penry scant the proud mans scorn the rich mans sturdy mien widesquandring luxury and pallid want all haste to form the varied wretched scene and shall the mighty woes of hapless love be here unfelt the heart not here be torn oh no in all their violence they will rove  swains shall betray and maidens feel their scorn already sure the dismal sounds i hear the broken vow accused the rending sigh  ah see the lovelorn stretched upon her bier rent from all joy she only knew to die false friendship too spreads out its closewove net and stabs the trusting with a barbed spear its arrows black ingratitude has set  yonder a robber skulks a murderer here ah can thou wonder sage i mourn the hour thoust heard the cause that swelled my starting tear haste and reflect within thy secret bower  ponder the change and be thy grief sincere here paused the genius age bent low its head its hoary tresses floating on the wind oh bright intelligence then firmly said permit a mortal to unveil his mind sad is your prophecy and oh too sure fate will its utmost latitude fill up each promised ill it is fixed we must endure and drink from sorrows still replenished cup  but not unmixed the bitter draught shall flow not unallayd the hovering misries sting felicities shall blunt the sense of woe and over it joys their downy mantle fling if social evils overspread thy plain the social blessings too will haste along and on the spot where vice shall lead its train illustrious virtues eagerly shall throng yonder rude circuit where the obtrusive fern in sullen vegetation chills the glance a few revolving halcyon months shall turn to an allcheering lucid gay expanse scotlands grand staple there shall glad the sight courting the blanching beams of days bright orb who will give enduring luster to its white and every slight impurity absorb there from the loom the costly web be brought by pallas taught in soft festoons to rise which late from belgia distant kingdoms sought but now it is caledonia grants the prize there the rich damask spread its fruit and flowers for royal tables and for halls of state there the transparent lawn display its powers to soften beauty and new charms create proud manchester will here her fame divide her varied works her fashion and her taste this bind in snowy vest horatios side that flow in graceful folds from chloes waist the stripe so well disposed the glowing bloom which overspreads the whole shall here be seen go manchester and weep thy slighted loom  its arts are cherished now on pitcairne green for these whilst labor chants her jocund song shall foreign prows be pointed to our shores each rival port our ample harbors throng pouring its tribute for our native stores thus blessed this village shall some unborn age behold a city graced with many a dome of note in commerce and of arts the stage where taste industrious never shall want a home if here the craving miser heaps his gold and frowns upon the shivering needy wretch here shall benevolence her charger hold and pity wide her fostring arms outstretch soft elegance shall bid around us rise the spell all feel but never can describe scarce tangible by thought the pen it flies pride cannot catch it nor importance bribe  not sense not loveliness nor wealth nor wit but formed of all the charming phantom rose adorns each time and place with graces fit but in domestic hours supremely glows and who like scotlands daughters so prepared to spread the fascinating sweet around when through the sex great nature beauty shared who knows not here the richest gift was found thus though disastrous love should find a grave or mourn the violated vow of bliss yet here shall faithful love the maiden save and parents cheer her with the nuptial kiss the song of rapture shall the bridegroom pour as often he wanders through the sunny glades and brides shall bless the sacred binding hour whispering their transports in the secret shades for shades shall be where now the thistle red spreads over the heath its slender prickly stalks and where the tangley furze conceals its bed there shall the grove divide its tepid if this word is objected to it may be recollected that though a grove in africa would be cool in scotland it must be warm walks for natures self to commerce ever yields commerce whose power each hemisphere adorns  which bids the dunny heath bloom forth in fields and in the desert pours the naiades urns yes that blessed power will here exert her force and wooing sterile nature to its arms bid stranger rivlets wind their silvry course and native moors conceal with foreign charms but happier still learning shall raise the pile designed the fret of ages to withstand within the classic scholar form his style and pour instruction through the listening land ah from its walls some future sage may burst to charm or awe the centuries to come a thomson in its cells be happily nursed a blair shed splendour over the chosen dome the lawgiver from thence shall draw the seeds of growing honor dignity and fame here shall ensure the future splendid meeds that crown his labors and extend his name a mansfield erskine loughborough shall rise the boast of genius in untasted times spreading our glory round the distant skies and mark us envied by more happy climes philosophys profound disciples too shall in its ails a new lyceum find platonic ethics system plain and true shall there be honored in the tutored mind a hume  a second hume from thence may shine in luster like the first but oh his heart shall humbly melt before religions shrine and prompt his talents to a better part a robertson shall bid the copious stream of longcollected knowledge fill his page dark ages make with light reverted gleam and brightstept freedom trace from stage to stage so a vast reservoirs compacted flood to bless a famished people spends its wealth pours out itself to renovate their blood  by heaven supplied with future stores of health a polished stuart too will then be known to scatter roses over the slandered fair to bind the cypress round the riven crown and steal our tears for miseries so rare his name shall ever tender beauty prize first in the climax of the literate few who from the mold of time still bright arise and every rapid centry keep in view and ah whilst future bays luxuriant spread shall not the myrtle in our gardens glow yes whilst the laurel crowns the manly head the blossoms for the fair shall gladlier blow a scottish seward shall demand the prize  she from whose pensive and mellifluous throat where ever misfortune scowls her cheerless eyes is poured the pitying melancholy note thus the sad nightingale throughout the night her fond complaint rings through the leafy grove and so endears the scene we dread the light  detest the sprightlier note and sorrow love for glowing barbauld shall another isle be found amidst some distant frozen waves which decked in all the fervors of her style shall bloom like that corsica  she from oblivion saves perchance that isle convulsive nature tore wrathful from sad messinas oncefamd port when the proud marbles which adorned its shore were dashed on rocks and made the billows sport when the mad mother and the swallowed child the tottering palace and the tower prone gave at one view ruin so vast and wild as chills the quickened flesh almost to stone then in that laboring moment of the earth midst the norwegian seas an island sprung  let barbauld celebrate the wondrous birth and all its grandeur by her muse be sung she will lift the veil of time and show us how the climate works upon the cindry the island on its emerging about three years since was said to make this appearance and afterward to disgorge flames mass  what the vast prospects of the unborn now and all its figures in her magic glass she will show that land which when beneath the skies of soft italia bloomed in scented flowers painted its surface with the richest dies and burst in hills and gave its shade in bowers  she will show it then divest of every sweet that once endeared it to the eye of taste no flowers no rills the wandering eye shall meet  no soft embroidry over the snowy waste but though not sweet the scenry will be grand not rills but torrents will her muse display that roar when rigid winds become more bland  grow dumb and stiffen in the wintry ray no gentle hill but mountains vast she will show whose cracking pines confess strong boreas arm where wild volcanoes from their summits glow and give the plains beneath an awful charm arcades and temples perhaps her muse will sing but not of marble formed nor part for part  o no nature will here the noble sculpture bring wildly magnificent not cramped by art the arrested cataract a dome will form and rapid torrents bound in pillars rise their capitals be sculptured from a storm  snatched as it is rushing from the zemblian skies on these the polar sun will pour its beams tinting the glacid scene with shifting hues now strong now fading into fainter gleams  and then at once a ruddy blaze infuse these are but outlines  an unskilful sketch a powerful barbauld must the shadings give  no colder genius on its utmost stretch can bid the frigid cheerless landschape live attention tired with fancied scenes like these recoils and wishes for familiar hours pants for the pillowd chair the robe of ease and gladly yields to common life its powers what pen but burneys then can sooth the breast who draw from nature with a skill so true in every varying mode it stands confessed when brought by her before the enquirers view a power peculiar all her portraits fill when lines are bold and strong a vulgar pen may take the sketch it asks no mighty skill misers to paint or mad or wayward men but human nature in its faintest dye burney detects drags it to open day  makes evident what slipped the unmarking eye and bids it glare with truths pervading ray the huddled beings of the common mass who to themselves appear of equal sort must not in unawakend error pass  and sure it is this is keeneyd burneys fort touched by her spear they sudden spring to sight but not new formed  she shows them as they are she molds no character but gives the light which makes them clear as herschel sees a star yes such as these thy plain may one day boast prize  sweet intelligence oh prize the change laurels will then surround our lettered coast and here the muses from parnassus range this vacant wild till now expanse unblest unknown and useless in the general scale slumbering its ages in ignoble rest scorned or unheeded in the historic tale shall hence assume a rank confess a name  nor hid a barren disregarded spot but living in the breath of future fame shall bless its happy though its latedrawn lot thus stopped the sage  the genius paused awhile as though his honied words revolving over first raised her eye with a celestial smile which seemed to promise she would mourn no more then in sweet tone  oh man of snowy years it is truth inspires thee and her force i own it is she has chid away the falling tears and bad my fading joys again be blown yes the creat guardian of the general weal never gives a misery but he sends a cure as herbs their antidotes will ever reveal in the same fields which poisonous herbs endure to thee i leave the bliss which just men know felicities which pious acts attend  over thy white tresses they shall ever flow and cheer the anxious moments of thy end then darting upwards as the sage adored her golden pinions clave the liquid way a blushing radiance marked the path she soared till lost amidst the blaze of azure day the end the dramatic works of mrs cowley consisting of the following pieces
