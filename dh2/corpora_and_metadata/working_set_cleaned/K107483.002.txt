against custom was sinning against right as many make it their tenet that men if they but know a woman loves them will ungratefully shun her and play tricks of an unnatural disdain i doubt not but the gentleman who is concerned in the following excellent letter will give a refutation to these mischievous opinions and show for the honor of one sex and the ease of the other that they ought hereafter to sink among vulgar errors  to the plain dealer october        sir i am an unhappy young woman that want a little of your plain dealing and good advice to help me out in an affair of the utmost consequence to my peace i am in too much pain to make a long introduction therefore hope you will excuse me if i only send a short sketch of my misfortune without staying to pay my grateful thanks for your agreeable weekly entertainments which i can never enough admire i hope you will not think me troublesome if i relate the exact situation of life i at present am in i live in a fine old seat in surrey which wants nothing to render it delightful to a person of my temper our family consists of my father who is a widower an old maiden aunt two sisters and my self my father is a very good man and employs himself mostly in his study my aunt is of a reserved temper therefore suffers us to keep but little company especially with gentlemen there is only one person allowed that fatal liberty whose character i must make you acquainted with but how alas shall i do that yet if there is such a thing as perfection in mankind he certainly is master of it he has so fine an understanding in all arts and sciences allowed by his own sex so great a knowledge in every thing that is polite and agreeable and withal so sweet a disposition that i only wonder i kept my heart so long free from his irresistible charms i have been pretty intimate with him these three years but did not know till within these three months that my happiness or misery depended entirely upon him in short i feel so violent a passion in my breast that unless i have some speedy relief death will soon put a period to my sorrow how often have i sat contemplating his virtues and charms till my soul has almost dissolved away in tenderness and love i sigh i die for him while he views me with cold indifference or at best but lukewarm friendship tyrant custom and innate modesty forbid my tongue to utter the tortures of my heart he sometimes laughs and says i am all charms oh what would i give to have him really think so he behaves exactly alike to my self and sisters and yet i cannot help being jealous if he speaks or looks at them i am all madness and despair i have not the vanity to think i can ever please a man of his sense and judgment and yet i go on to love sometimes i think my constant passion will be rewarded and that he will like me for my good nature which some people flatter me and tell him i have a great share of and as it is a qualification he very much admires i strive every day to improve it and to command all those little passions that are incident to our sex was i suffered to plead for my self i could tell him what an obedient wife i would make him how my duty and inclinations would both concur to please him in all actions of my life when he was absent i would entertain my self with his dear idea and when he returned meet him with inexpressible raptures i could dwell for ever on the enchanting subject but fear i should grow tiresome this opening of my grief has been some relief i almost fear to have this published i wish yet dread he should discover me i dont know what to do therefore rely wholly upon your advice if you print it correct the bad english if you burn it remember and pity  the poor lucinda   what constant companions are merit and humility how does this lady conclude a letter that must charm every reader if you print it correct the bad english it is too good to be corrected sincerity and everlasting tenderness shine forth in every sentence that person who does not plainly perceive that what lucinda has written flowed from her heart must have his own heart ill placed and removed out of the way of nature if men could write thus no woman of sense would be ever courted in vain when she signifies so plainly that she loves him from her heart how cordially does she labor to make that plainness still plainer if possible as she proceeds still farther in her letter these plain phrases are the mastertouches of nature and put art out of countenance this is the natural simplicity that makes the proud scholars ornaments look poor any body that knows what love is will not barely read but feel this ladys letter old as i am my self how am i warmed when she expresses her tenderness and if every unconcerned person be her wellwisher what emotions must this letter be able to raise in the bosom of that happy man whom it concerns will not her prudence her vowed obedience her study to please her humility and being unconscious of the greatest worth in her self her whole pride placed in admiring him her adoration almost of his superior merit her desiring and yet diffiding to deserve him will not all these win over his soul to her where she describes to him how she will behave in his presence and how in his absence what a figure must she make in the imagination of this admired man must she not be as much admired as she admires does she not force him to what she so earnestly wishes the god of love lives breathes and acts in every line of it and nothing less than that very man who as she says if there be such a thing as perfection in mankind is certainly master of it can be a suitable prize for her merit  it has been reported concerning the finest orator of the present age that the lady to whom he was married grew his wife by being his client he had long been acquainted with her patience temper and spirit by her manner of soliciting her own cause he knew her fortune which depended upon it she gave him such full and elegant instructions as few professed lawyers could have penned and as scarce needed his own powerful assistance and amendment he asked her who had drawn them and being informed her self had been the compiler it is no wonder that so much wit in so agreeable a person made that greatest of orators whose addresses no lady could withstand from that moment her suitor and consequently her husband   i have often wished to be fully satisfied of the truth of this little beautiful piece of secret history  but whether it be true in all its circumstances it was not invented by one who meant to malign the fame of that lord or the merit of his lady since a more glorious accident could not well be assigned to have brought about the marriage of so illustrious a pair  the letter which now lies before me is the most exquisite plea that ever my eyes beheld i know some who understand not what love is will be offended at a womans first declaring her passion how sensible is the fair one of this when she cries out tyrant custom and innate modesty forbid my tongue to utter the tortures of my heart  by lucindas leave she herself is too rigid and severe against herself custom indeed does forbid it and a tyrannical custom it is because though pretendedly grounded upon the colors of modesty it is unjust it is unnatural and irreligious at the bottom  is it not modest as well as natural to have an inclination to be honorably married she that has not an inclination before she is asked can hardly with truth declare inclination and if it was an inclination virtuous and honorable from the beginning it must have been equally virtuous and honorable from the beginning to have owned it a dull and obstinate concealment of the truth till it happens to be extorted is a triumph given to folly over nature for the sake of a mistaken modesty both sexes if they will but reflect must agree in this truth   what bachelor of good sense would not be overjoyed to discover a lucinda thus opening in his own favor the man who disliked a woman for declaring her approbation of him would be like one who secking for a silver mine and discovering by chance a golden one should desert it for no other reason but because good fortune had put it in his way   there is a vast deal of delight in contemplating the beauties of a womans mind who could write thus delicately how happy would she make her husband she would sooth any sorrow that could reach him and exalt his pleasures into raptures she would be his comfort in adversity and gild and adorn his prosperity she would gladden his youth and cherish his age give more warmth and joy to the summer of his life and yield gaity and refreshment to his winter she would give wings to his business abroad and divert him at home with her conversation she would fill up the vacuities of solitude with discourse that was preferrable to the company of wits no nights could be tedious by her side and daylight would be made more cheerful by looking upon her  but i draw toward a conclusion as fast as i can for fear of hindering any longer what i would speedily unite i fancy my self to be this minute with my paper in the parlour of that fine old seat in surrey lucinda and her lover have both hold of the plain dealer who tells them his sentiments like the father of them both  i hear him reading i see her wishing and yet dreading to be discovered  i wish the discovery my self  methinks i see it and hear him say  you are lucinda i have often told you you are all charms there wants nothing but your consent to make us the happy couple here described  lucinda trembling holds the paper as she would let it drop  now if i could make my paper speak it should say do drop me from between you join hands over a more sacred writing  it is so promising a match that the plain dealer is to act the father in it  if you have not immediate opportunities  if you apprehend any hindrance  stay not a moment where you are  take a tour to blunthall together  the clergyman of our assembly shall join your hands and bless your wishes and you may keep your wedding at the ancient seat of the blunt s since it will be so happy an example to many maids who have been scared so long by a silly groundless custom from speaking their minds in an affair on which depends all their felicity  the plain dealer no    cur in theatrum cato severe venisti mart monday october         it is the duty of a patriot to mourn for those growing evils which seem to threaten either the safety or the honor of his country and for this reason i have often been irresistably chagrind at the corruption of our public theaters  but i was lately enlivened into hope upon this subject and am glad i can assure my reader that there is a spirit of improvement at work to sustain our sinking taste and set examples for our present stages  there is a generous boldness as well in the design itself as in the time of putting it in execution but nothing is more certain than that it is formed upon a plan which if it meets with the proposed encouragement will go a great way toward keeping the hearts of the gay world from breaking should so dreadful a misfortune happen as that the god of wit revenges himself upon the prostituted theaters in fashion by making people ashamed of appearing where they ought to blush at their entertainment  i am transported to this pitch of joy upon having landed at westminster stairs in my way from barbican to the abbey cloisters where i often muse on subjects which a long time hence may fill plain dealers and met in the kings highway a partycolored younger brother of the justlycelebrated mr lun  he was ushered along in great state with a sounding drum in his front and a trumpet and french horn placed like wings on either flank while the rear was brought up by a body of scattered velites the flying fragments of humanity  the checkered nuntio as i passed him stopped and nodded his loose head at me snatching off his pigmy hat by the rabbits tail which was annexed to it and tripping toward me with a wanton waviness like the curling of a ships long pendant when it dances in a breeze slipped a billet into my hand and retreating with a merry shrugg or two resumed his post as before and gave continuance to the procession  from the ludicrous turn of his figure i opened the paper he gave me with very humble expectation but was struck with no small reverence when i beheld the royal arms magisterially displayed at the head of it and these surprising particulars promulgd under the stamp of such a known authority  by his majestys permission for the better accommodation of gentlemen ladies and others at the whitehart in st margarets lane is to be seen in a manner never performed before the whole play of hero and leander with a live punch performed by a company of artificial actors whose diversions are very changeable and consistivarious  the figures being five foot high perform with that nicety that they can hardly be distinguished from the live players and give an equal satisfaction  likewise you will see the dancing of jigs masquerades and sarabands  likewise the royal court of foreign kings queens and princes every figure dressed according to their own country habits  likewise the rising and setting of the sun also cupids paradise  likewise cupid descending out of the clouds to the front of the stage and speaks the prologue to the play  before the play begins there is a high german artist that takes an empty bag and turns it inside out that you may see there is nothing in it and then conveys showers of gold and eggs out of it  the prices are from two shillings down to sixpence and we begin at the quality hours  there are very good seats for gentlemen and places for coaches and chairs to stand in  note  any gentleman and lady may have a play in private any hour of the day giving notice beforehand  vivat rex i found myself not a little delighted upon perusing this notification to be assured in so authentic a manner that we have his majestys permission to be better accommodated than we have been for from this intentional royal grace i grew sanguine enough to expect a very sudden revocation of certain grants for monopolizing the art of conjuring and of bewitching the kings liege people out of all sober use as well of their money as their senses  i entered therefore with pleasure on the divisions of my printed billet and began with a critical eye to examine what likelihood there was that hero and leander should be too hard for the devil and his double favorites  the live punch though they seem to build much upon him i could consider as no great rarity  not that i would derogate in the least from that respect which is due to his character but he has brothers upon both stages as much alive as himself with the advantage of being more incomprehensible  punch will be understood with so little difficulty that our people of polite taste will never be able to bear him  but when i had read about half a line lower and came to that part of the declaration which promises that the actors of this new company shall be artificial i was presently at ease again for in that case i saw most certainly that there must be novelty in their design since nothing is more generally allowed with regard to the other companies than that for one of their actors who is artificial six are absolutely naturals  i gathered much consolation too from that other welcome assurance that the diversions of this royal company are to be very changeable and consistivarious the town has annually for some years past been dieted by the playhouse doctors and gone through a regular course of bitters with a most laudable spirit of meekness and true christian resignation  their wit was fallen sick and submitted to quack potions because mountebank stages by being licensed had the reputation of college practice and to poison by authority has the good fortune to be no felony  so that nothing is more certain than that the wooden company will have the advantage of our brazen ones in this important point the changeable  but as for the consistivarious the old workmen i am afraid will be more than a match for the new ones  i am not indeed so able a critic in the language of these wooden orators as to decide with any absolute sufficiency the signification of a word so derivative and complex as consistivarious but if i am fortunate enough to have rightly broke in upon so impregnable a decomposite then i am sure i may safely affirm that our stages conduct ever since i can remember it has been truly consistivarious in the most remarkable and surprising manner  nay a triumvir of that detached administration the accomplished author of a tragedy which we are to be admitted to the honor of admiring in the front of this happy season is i am sure so renowned for his consistivariousness that one would almost be induced to swear that the very word was of his own making and coined on purpose for his new tragedy  but here let me correct a false report which this great writer suffers under by the means of some who envy him the honors which are due to his undoubting genius  it is said the name of his new tragedy is to be caesar in egypt but i assure all christian people that though caesar may stand in capitals on the title page yet that should only be considered as an error of the press which the buyer may correct with ease by reading cibber in egypt instead of caesar and with that small alteration every thing in this tragedy will be found extremely natural and stand directly as it should be  the spirit however of our new undertakers at the whitehart is inflamed into an enterprizing and smart emulation and i was very much taken with the turn of this brisk defiance  that though they may pass for nobodies because they are made of wood yet since they have the good luck to be five foot high they see no reason to suppose their adversaries to be more than their match and will therefore perform with such nicety as not to be distinguished from them and doubt not in the least to give an equal satisfaction  as for the next paragraph i fear it was purposely embroidered over with those likewises and alsos for no other reason in the world but to cover a conscious deficiency in the sense by the eloquent glare of the expression  for who does not observe that dancing of jigs masquerades and sarabands are improvements in learning which the happy genius of our nobility and the vast encouragement they give to wit have brought already to their full perfection  i cannot see therefore what novelty can be expected in this particular unless when they give notice that all their performers are to be wooden ones they would have us understand it that by aid of some third faustus their fiddles are to fall a dancing and keep time to their own music  the rising and setting of the sun i have very little to say for with regard to its newness  cupids paradise may please at first but will flatten if they show it often  the court of foreign kings is no such rarity as they think it  but for every figure to be dressed according to their own country fashion  that indeed is a stroke of decorum which outsoars at one flight patent license and charter and it will be reasonable to hope after the public taste has been so refined by these chips of a new block that we shall see no more intermixture of the ancient with the modern dresses where the order of things is so capriciously reversed that the courtiers of an english monarch shall stand round him like beaux of yesterday and the sovereign himself strut about in trunk breeches and be dressed as old as a patriarch  there is in the next article an odd kind of mystery which i own i could not fathom and i frankly confess i was once afraid there might be a plot in it  i puzzled my imagination till i was weary of imagining  but the more i mused upon it the less i was able to make of that strange highgerman artist who was to shake an empty bag inside out that we might see there was nothing in it and then rain gold and eggs out of it  it was easily to be discerned that the scene was shifted in this place  the play houses could have nothing to do with the paragraph none of their bags for some years past having been empty enough to turn inside outward so that i was greatly perplexed by the knottiness of this difficulty till i luckily bethought myself of a friend of mine a decypherer whose surprising dexterity levelled every rub in his way and made it as plain as a demonstration that the empty bag was the south sea scheme  that the golden showers were the sudden sallies of that stock and that the eggs were the sucking bubbles that were hatched under the warmth of it  i should have been lost in this desert if i had not returned to make a remark concerning the modesty of our new comedians  how praiseworthy is their generosity and the disinterestedness of their spirit who after putting themselves to the twofold charge of building both their stage and their performers propose to act notwithstanding at lower rates than their rivals which last go on to demolish as fast as their competitors can build up and yet have the courage to raise their prices because they fall their entertainments  then how just and how sympathetical is another care of our wooden reformers  being perfectly acquainted with the talents of a modish audience they have judiciously determined to provide room for the coaches and chairs in the same paragraph with the gentlemen  their thoughts were more upon merit than upon good breeding  and since they knew that their kindred vehicles were as able judges as their owners and which is of more consequence as welldressd too they therefore thought it but reasonable to treat em with equal reverence  what kind of play that may be which any gentleman and lady who give notice beforehand are to be diverted with in private i must make a personal search into before i undertake to consider it  but upon the whole i believe there can be no manner of doubt but that the whitehart in st margarets lane may bid as fair for fine audiences as any of the rest of our theaters where though the actors are not of wood they have usurped the province of wooden actors  the plain dealer no  0  pictoribus atque poetis hor friday october         when i read with admiration the great actions of an alexander a caesar or a tamerlane or an charmed by the more powerful writings of a homer a virgil or a cicero i am fired with an impatient longing to conceive their turn of person air and features and when my fancy forced to travel without a guide has tired itself with vain endeavors to grasp ideas that are thin and fleeting i lament that the materials of the painters noble art are not as lasting as the painters fame is for in that case two sister arts uniting their different powers the one transmitting souls the other bodies or the outward form of bodies their combining influence would be of force to frustrate death itself and all the ages of the world would seem to be cotemporaries  but here the poet triumphs his works outlive the painters though the painter begins much sooner to be famous than the poet does and has also commonly the advantage over him with relation to fortune the strongest reasons of which difference i have lately read with pleasure in the following letter from an excellent and learned critic whom i spoke of in a late paper and whose encouragement i am afraid is to the future reproach of our age most shamefully disproportioned to his merit  there is something extremely new in the subject as well as the sentiments of this letter and i will therefore take the liberty to publish it for my readers entertainment though the author when he writ it meant it only for the private satisfaction of a gentleman of his acquaintance  october the  th      sir i know not whether i should return you thanks for your last visit or not because i know not whether i am indebted to fortune or to you for it but i am obliged to take notice in a particular manner of the desire you expressed during our being together that i would have my picture drawn  after i have omitted it so many years i would not have it drawn at last by a bungler and i am not in a condition at present to satisfy one who is a master nor do i know whether we have any master who would make me a present of it though a painter is much more able to give than a poet to buy which has put me upon considering what are the reasons which make the painter so successful and the poet so unfortunate that make the art of poetry and the art of painting which are sisters so very resembling by nature so very different by fortune  a great poet for the most part neglects and affronts fortune by making his court to fame but fame and fortune are rivals that contend with each other which shall heap most favors upon the deserving painter all the great painters that have appeared among us have had justice done to their merit while they lived and no signpostpainter has ever yet passed for a great master all the painters whom our kings have delighted to employ have been masters as holbin rubens vandyck leeley ryley kneller and thornhill  but the contrary of this has happened with regard to poets several good ones nay several of the best have been neglected during their lifetime as spencer milton butler otway among ourselves and among the ancients homer while the most contemptible of all scriblers have been esteemed and honored our kings themselves have more than once had such vile scriblers for their poets and have like fortune taken a pleasure in exalting fools but though a king can give a man title and place only god can give him genius it is the prerogative of a king to make a knight but only god can make a poet  the reasons of the difference which we sometimes find in the fortunes of great poets and painters appear to me to be chiefly these which follow  the first is that the great painter for each of his masterpieces has but one original and no copy can come up to the easy grace and the natural force of a beautiful original whereas of masterly poems there are as many originals as there are true copies and all of them have equal force and equal grace and beauty and this is none of the least things that render the works of the painter so precious and the artist himself so fortunate a man may buy the works of homer or virgil for a very trifle whereas those of raphael are above any value but this multiplying of originals gives the great poet at least one advantage over the famous painter which is that it renders what he writes perpetual homer and virgil are immortal in their works but zeuxis and apelles are only so in their fame  another reason of this difference is the universality of the language in which the painter delivers his art the great painter speaks to all countries as intelligibly as to his own nay more intelligibly more gracefully and more forcibly to those countries which are polite and therefore his fame keeps equal pace with his merit and wherever he goes both fortune and fame attend him the more his pieces are known the more they are desired and the more dearly purchased the greatest of kings are ambitious to be masters of them and ambitious to possess the painters as well as their works what modern poet during his lifetime was ever read by so many sovereign princes as were drawn by the hand of titian what prince ever heaped those honors on a poet that charles the fifth did on titian did the renowned augustus himself with all his capacity and all his greatness of mind so honor horace or virgil now while the painters fame and fortune are unconfined those of the greatest of our english poets are restrained to the islands of great britain and ireland that is to less than twenty millions of people of which perhaps there are hardly five hundred which have a fine taste of poetry  another reason of the difference in the fortunes of great painters and poets with regard to painting after the life is the darling interest and the darling passion of both sexes and especially of the women no motive is generally so predominant as that of selfinterest no passion so vehement and so ardent as selflove now the generality of both sexes look upon their persons as their very selves it is their persons then which they ardently desire should be advantageously known and fairly distinguished and should remain after them this the great painter alone can perform who is sure to draw the best likeness and yet at the same time to distinguish a face from all other faces whatever which it is impossible that the greatest poet in the world can ever do by description  another reason of the foresaid difference is that few persons pretend to decide sovereignly in painting but they who are acquainted with the rules of the art and who besides the reading ancient and modern history understand geometry perspective and anatomy whereas the rabble of mankind pretending to judge of poetry sovereignly and without appeal wretched poetasters have been often applauded and excellent poets neglected because the former write most to the capacity of the rabble and there is one thing which i have formerly mentioned and which i have often observed and always with fresh surprise that the rabble by their noise their clamours and their obstinacy have often drawn in men who have passed for men of sense to affirm their unrighteous decrees whereas the men of sense with all their judgment and with all their perseverance have never been able to draw in the rabble without the assistance of time  there is still another reason of the foresaid difference in the fortunes of great poets and painters which is this most men are very sensual and pleasure of sense affects them more than pleasure merely intellectual they love to have their understandings informed by their senses because that instruction gives them pleasure without any mixture of pain which always in some measure accompanies labor and great attention and of all the senses they love chiefly to be instructed by the sight because the instruction that comes that way is attended with the least labor and if it be true that there are no innate ideas if it be true that there is nothing in the understanding but what was in the external sense before then the method of instruction used by the painter is the very method which god and nature have taken to instruct us and this is the cause of that extraordinary pleasure which men receive from painting as aristotle has observed in the fourth chapter of his art of poetry and in this the painter has infinitely the advantage of the poet the painter informs the understanding and warms the imagination by striking the sight strongly and giving it the height of pleasure while all that can be done of that kind by the greatest poet that ever lived is to make us vainly imagine that he sets things before our eyes  thus have i laid before you some of the chief reasons of the difference that is found in the fortunes of great poets and painters and now to end with the business with which i began if he whom you propose to draw my picture is not a master i shall be unwilling to give him any trouble if he is a master he is rich as cercertainly as i am not so i therefore expect that he shall do it entirely gratis for as painter and poet we are sisters children and he is worse than a jew who being rich himself will take money of a poor relation  i am sir your most humble faithful servant a b   the plain dealer no    labor improbus omnia vincit virg otium cum dignitate  cicero monday october         there is not a more delightful way of conveying useful knowledge into the mind than copying the allegories of the ancients the following genealogy of labor and pleasure is a modern performance of this kind which shows the author a person of lively fancy and sound judgment  it was sent me in a wellwritten letter subscribed j f which when i suppress i must own i give my self some mortification  saturn the son of coelum after having made a separation of body and goods with his wife cybele married necessity the daughter of destiny and fortune  old father destiny gave this poor girl of his her education among the muses and trained her up in the company of poets and philosophers she was blessed from a very child with a strong and enterprizing genius quick and ready at invention fruitful of mighty projects and ever intent upon proper ways and means to give a finishing stroke to her undertakings but though she was ingenious she was homely in her person she poor thing had none of those charms to boast of which might draw the eyes of lovers upon her her mien carried with it as little temptation as her face and her fortune was low and still less inviting than either so that she was no bodys taste and not any individual breatheing had the least thought of her for a wife the muses found the charge grow heavy upon them and sensible of their inability to go through with the expense of keeping her much longer the begged destiny by all means to take her out of their hands and think of making proper provision for her in some other way this put destiny on trying to bring about a match between his daughter and his old friend saturn whom he persuaded that since he was so far gone in years and parted from his wife without any appearance of their coming together again it was not possible for him to do better than marry some honest careful body who would be tender in looking after him and then he took occasion to name his own daughter as a person well qualified for that office assuring the old gentleman at the same time of her inclinations to do every thing that would be most pleasing in his eyes  the truth is necessity was a good toward girl and followed her fathers counsel so well and behaved herself with so much docility humility and diligence that she entirely won the old mans heart that which prevailed with him most of all to come to this resolution arose from this consideration that all the uneasiness between him and cybele was occasioned by her too great riches which made her presumptuous enough to slight and despise him and use him so ill as to carry on a secret affair with pluto a commerce the most displeasing in nature to him and which he could never forgive hence he became persuaded it would be doing very wisely to marry a woman of birth who having nothing of her own would think of no other enjoyments but those which she shared in common with him which he knew to be sufficient to render her eternally happy  preliminaries were all settled the treaty concluded and the marriage consummated between old saturn and his poor spouse necessity whose whole portion consisted in her vigilance her obedience and humility  the only issue of this marriage was virtue who from her cradle gave promises of her beauty as soon as she grew up the mature virgin drew gazing crowds after her and the eyes of the admiring world was fixed upon this object there was not that single god in olympus but was fond of her acquaintance however as she happened to be of a high and overruling temper and would take the liberty of telling people their faults very plainly to their faces she was not overwelcome to many where she went  then again her mother necessity whose company she was seldom out of was by nature bashful and little used to frequent the palaces of the great she went always very plainly and simply clothed after the old fashion which made her not a little timorous of visiting the modish gods of quality  this manner of life becoming troublesome to them they went often to pay their respects to the muses and to see the poets and philosophers their old friends with whom they always found a more friendly and grateful reception this made them think of returning to the muses and there to live for ever and this necessity got her husband to consent to who approved of this retreat the more willingly because he very justly judged that the good qualities of his daughter virtue might help a great deal in that place toward correcting the vices and reforming the errors of mankind  accordingly they returned to parnassus and the muses obliged them with fine apartments where virtue made herself known more and more and was admired by every eye that could get a sight of her the muses did all they could to exalt the merit of their new tenant they left nothing unsaid that might enlarge her reputation they had a mighty mind to captivate some suitable person and engage his affections to her but all in vain there was not one ear rightly open to these repeated praises and admonitions whole crowds indeed would throng to gaze at her every spectator admired her and even every hearer when she spoke was forced to allow that she had reason for the reprimands she made but not one of them would have any concern with her or join themselves for ever with a person whose manner of living was so extraordinary and uncommon  thus she remained a long time unprovided for till a venerable sort of gentleman oldish but not very far in years who had the reputation of great capacity observation and experience and whose name was wisdom happened to light upon her to him this tart humor of hers which was always as just as it was severe was not at all distasteful on the contrary he liked her for it he made his court to her and having addressed her father and mother for their consent and obtained it married her to the universal joy of parnassus  this excellent couple had issue but one child named labor who in his infancy gave them trouble enough in all conscience to rear him as soon as he approached the age of manhood he gave the most apparent signs of a working head and appeared never easy but when in action  one day above the rest having closely employed himself upon an undertaking of great moment a task which his mother virtue had been pleased to set him he saw recompense the daughter of merit and of reason and became passionately in love with her her youth was blooming her beauty exquisitely charming her humor powerfully bewitching her whole person irresistably ravishing all she looked or said or did was so engaging that it was natural in her to please and there was nobody but loved her nobody but longed to possess her  labor who was nearly touched with so many agreeable qualities resolved with himself to do every thing that should be requisite to gain her and as she did not want lovers he judged he should meet with many difficulties before he could attain his desired end but having received some joyful assurance that the figure he made in the world did not displease her he resolved to omit nothing that might make him still more grateful in the eye of his mistress after infinite pains innumerable hopes and disappointments the treaty was at length concluded with merit and reason the parents of recompense who gave their consent with great alacrity and the more for that virtue herself did very heartily interest herself in that affair nay farthermore advices came to the parents of recompense that the marriage was approved and desired by coelum the greatgrandfather to labor  in effect labor and recompense were so exactly matched that one may say they were born one for the other their marriage was perfectly happy by the good understanding in which they lived for labor continuing toward his wife the same affection desired to be everlastingly in her company he could not bear her a moment out of his sight by his good will and would scarce be persuaded at times that he had seen her when he really had his wife was no less fond on her side she observed a conduct so regular and so judicious that she never gave him reason of complaint and would favor nobody with her presence where her husband was absent  this marriage was rendered still more prosperous by its fruitfulness for they had issue three children two girls and a boy the boy who was the youngest was called rest he was well made in his person agreeable insinuating welcome wherever he went his noble birth and engaging qualities made him regarded and coveted by all the world and chiefly by the rich he was not of so high a spirit as his sisters he visited none but persons that were peaceful and little enterprizing his father was angry at it and did all he could to render him more active but he fled out of his sight because continual soliciting him to do something disturbed his quiet and interrupted his beloved repose  these repeated solicitations grew at last so insupportable to rest that his humor being no longer able to bear that of his father which was so opposite he harbored malice against him and joining in an association with idleness with whom he had contracted a strict friendship they plotted together to take away the life of the parent of rest but honest father labor being vigilant was not long without discovering this conspiracy of which being but too certain he drove this unnatural son from him nor would ever see him more rest touched with repentance or pushed by some other motive retired to the service of the gods where he has ever since taken up his residence  the two daughters of labor were glory and pleasure both of them fine persons entirely like their mother so very like her that they were often taken for her which made her extremely fond of them labor loved them dearly too as well on account of their merit as for that near resemblance of features which made him remember when his heart was first smitten with love  the children on their side dutifully answered this affection and hardly ever quitted their father and mother wherever they went whether to private people or princes where they most delighted to make their abode and where they were very welcome being significant persons in war and peace and shining as well in the cabinet as the field  it is true that pleasure was not so lofty and proud of heart as glory her sister for whereas glory thought of nothing but great things and would frequent none but people of great genius despising all other considerations pleasure on the contrary could amuse herself with any thing loving as well business of little account as that of importance the people of a midling as well as of the sublimest genius low as well as high life caressing all alike which won her the hearts of all the world as she was by nature very curious she diverted herself with making little particular journies to people who were glad to have her in their company provided she was not with her father and her sister the austerity of whom put them under too great a restraint  these little sallies gave a stain to her reputation it not being possible to see so fine a girl familiarly visit so many people without speaking of it but what had like to have ruined her entirely was that at the same time a debauched girl who had something of the air of pleasure but much affectation took it in her head to go by the same name in order to find the easier access in all places she was the daughter of leisure and debauch despicable people and as she had neither birth nor honor she mingled indifferently with all sorts of persons leading an infamous life and so disorderly that she passed for one lost  this identity of names made them attribute to the true pleasure all the disorders of the false which obliged her to clear up the matter with her father labor who was deceived like the rest of the world by this appearance but above all things her conscious innocence which they accused her to have violated gave her great confidence in her own justification she made known to her father that the greatest part of those she frequented were the best friends of him and his ancestors virtue and wisdom that she was cherished by a whole sect of philosophers and in short that she saw none but people whose manners were praiseworthy  the plain dealer no     nos animorum impulsu and caeca magnaque cupidine ducti conjugium petimus partumque uxoris at illis notum qui pueri qualisque futura sit uxor juv friday october         i who pride my self in nothing more than when i can be personating the good old man that is to say acting the part of a father toward the youth of either sex must naturally have a singular regard for those worthy matrons my cotemporaries whose approved wisdom and virtue induce prudent parents to consign children to their guardianship  the truth is that whenever i light upon the least commerce with this beneficial set of people i am willing to improve it both for their sakes and my own that we pick out of one another sometimes a lucky hint that has been useful in conducting one child to its welfare and by pushing it in the education of another make it the happier its whole life after  for this reason i was resolved to dispatch the request of the following letter as early as possible and because as the careful writer of it has young ladies under her tuition i not only consider her as a common correspondent but have for her that fraternal regard which is felt by an affectionate brother  october         sir having the charge of two young ladies of fortune lately devolved upon me i cannot but think it needful to call in the assiststance of the plain dealer to enable me to perform this important task with that justice and prudence which i am convinced it requires  i therefore beg you will give me some rules for education and that they may the better adapted to my present necessity i must tell you as concisely as i can the different dispositions i have to deal with  the eldest is about fifteen very bookish but her chief study has hitherto been in romances and novels i think it not proper to discourage this taste of reading in her but would rather lead her insensibly into the perusal of books really useful which to such a one ought to be entertaining too what they must be i submit to your judgment who i hope will recommend some authors that may be safely put into their hands  my younger charge not quite fourteen is so far from reading romances that i can fix her to nothing she promises fair to be the very counterpart of your patty amble and i believe has been a coquette from her cradle she is goodnatured but giddy and i fear it will be a difficult matter to make her a reasonable woman though she certainly has good sense  this will be no paradox when we consider how many people loose the benefit of a fine understanding for want of fixing it upon a proper basis  your thoughts upon this subject will be a public benefit and a particular favor to  sir your constant reader and humble servant aspasia   it is nobly and generously observed by an excellent poet of the present age that to do one good actio is preferable to the writing however sublimely the most glorious deeds of others but methinks on the other hand it gives an unspeakable pleasure to deliver in writing what may give occasion to good actions the honest inclination of aspasia and her earnest desire that i would give her a word of advice concur to raise in me this expectation and therefore while i shall lay down some cursory observations which may be of service to young people i am not ashamed to own that the little entertainment which i offer to that class of my readers is a kind of feast to my self  aspasia very well knows the first and most important point which consists in studying their tempers and the bent of their inclinations the knowledge once obtained the next step is to improve and heighten their good qualities and artificially to transform the defects and errors of their nature into graces and ornaments as we must naturally love those whom we desire to instruct and as it is natural not to love those who obtrude instruction upon us but to listen with attention to those whom we love and to gather instruction from them as it were without their knowledge it is for these reasons methinks necessary that the method generally observed in these cases should be reversed that is to say the instruction of the child should be the consequence of a tutresss love toward it and not her love be the consequence of its taking her instructions these directresses of youth should begin where they generally end they give their advices plainly and bluntly and as those happen to take root direct their affections or resentments but they should first practice upon the affections of their wards gain their hearts and make their own love seen and afterward steal their admonitions into them under the covert of art keeping them as much as possible unseen instruction thus politically couched will have a power that is irresistible and make an amazing progress in tender minds advice not seen by will be sure to be seen in them  to descend to particulars in our present case looking over those romances and novels which her eldest ward delights in too much aspasia will certainly find some heroic examples of virtue these she would relate to some friend in the secret with very great applauses so as to be overheard by her fair pupil who will be prejudiced for a judgment that seems to favor her own and that she would be glad should do so she will be charmed to hear this and remaining as it were perdue listen greedily to it as the commendation of her self when her mind is thus strongly prejudiced in behalf of her guardian when it is warmed and just ready to take the impression then just then the guardian has an opportunity of pressing down the seal of virtue a little proper female oratory in commendation of the like passages still more beautifully expressed in such books as she would have her read will make her long and beg of her own accord to see them as for example aspasia might say such a noble quality is eminently conspicuous in the hero of this romance but then he appears defective in such other points the hero of such a novel revere for such a part of his conduct but he is greatly to blame in other respects the principal character in such a book of memoirs would be a favorite and a shining character but for such and such blemishes and imperfections such a gallant in such a play behaves himself well throughout the whole action and makes me love him at my very heart but such a gallant has a villainous design at bottom upon his mistresss honor and is my mortal aversion after having thus remarked upon texts out of the ladys own scripture it is inexpressible what an effect it might have if growing into a sudden rapture aspasia should go on as follows how does it charm and transport one to find all these virtues and none of the opposite vices all these beauties without deformities united in that one favorite character of mine the christian hero described with all the force with which virtue can be described and painted with all the beauties with which beauty can be painted  this method or such a method as this would prompt the listening bookish ward to a desire of seeing that tract she would long for it she would enquire after it she would beg to read it she would set to reading it already prejudiced in its favor it would gain upon her in the reading till she gained what her guardian would wish from reading it as she has true taste this just picture would beget in her a contempt of those coarse daubings of a novelists grosser hand the same may be said of the heroines celebrated in her favorite romances how much more charmingly is the fine lady described in the marquess of hallifax his advice to a daughter and so of others  what fruit may not be hoped and expected  reading that little book called the advice to a daughter and the ladys library is enough to make young women learn to know themselves steel s christian hero and the gentleman instructed teach them abundantly to know men a knowledge of themselves will be the preservative of their honor and a true knowledge of men will fortify them against the treacheries that are used by artful deceivers of that sex which is almost sure one time or other to be either their ruin or their ornament  n b there not being room in this paper some hints upon education shall be occasionally added wherein aspasias elder charge shall be further considered not forgetting the younger who may be a fine woman bred notwithstanding she is born a coquet  the plain dealer no     aliena negotia centum per caput and circumsaliunt latus hor monday october         i intended in this paper to have proceeded upon some hints concerning education but i am forced to break off the thread and defer it to another day i have many entertaining letters by me from edinburgh and bath and two that i must particularly mention from covent garden with relation to my late discourse on the playhouse management one is written by mr sock in a sad and lamentable style and the other by mr buskin filled with such heroic rants that however they excite no terror will as well answer the end of being exhibited to public view and move diversion like some modern tragedies with all these i should be glad to oblige the public as soon as possible but the following epistle seems intended to redress in some measure an injured person and i think it a part of duty to quit other speculations though never so inviting where it lies in my power to assist toward rescuing an honest man out of real or even imaginary distress since the latter is often equally painful with the former  to the plain dealer sir in one of your papers concerning detraction you justly observed that persons guilty of it in a great city ought to have some distinguishing signs to discover them as crosses are placed on the doors of the diseased in the time of a pestilence  that happy way of reasoning inseparable from truth which shines in all your writings on whatsoever subject employed carries conviction in every line that gives the good man pleasure and the envious and detracting pain  then to whom shall i apply for redress but to the plain dealer who though above flattering the great thinks it not unworthy him to do justice even to the lowest degree of merit  was i to draw the man i mean in the character of husband father or friend in each he would please and satisfy but as those distinguishing characters are private though undisputed i will beg leave to tell you he has in active life a fame that gives uneasiness to some malignant people while it does good more widely than they would wish him able to extend it  if an indefatigable industry with his allowed skill and humanity crowned by the blessing of the almighty with uninterrupted success can recommend a man to esteem in the useful profession of of surgery you will allow me to name mr coltheart methinks i see him as i have often seen him going to the relief of some miserable object with his usual cheerfulness and smiles with that regard however to the cause which the greatest could wish for the unhappy seldom find as if he was going to some great man whose cure must make his fortune though he is certain to have no other recompense than the thanks and prayers of his unfriended patient  innumerable instances of this kind the grateful many he has served would give who though willing are not allowed to do him the justice he deserves which induces me to believe if ever man took pleasure in doing good he does as also to think him a proper subject and excuse for my troubling you with this who am  sir your most obedient humble servant z y   when i reflect upon the many advantages arising to mankind from the skill of a true professor of the surgeons art he appears so useful a member of the commonwealth that he makes no inconsiderable figure among the most considerable like machaon among the heroes in homer the person this letter relates to far from meriting to be spoken ill of deserves that respect which the best of all books requires to be paid to the physician if it was for nothing else but having not long since preserved the life of a member of a very noble family in which wisdom and eloquence have been a long time hereditary  as i am brought once more unwillingly to touch upon that hated subject detraction i think i cannot do better in order to deter people from it than to place before their eyes a picture of its deformity as it was drawn by that great master apelles and described by an excellent old author  at the right hand was drawn sitting a man with long ears putting forth his hand to detraction who seemed from afar off to come toward him about this man stood two women that is to say ignorance and suspicion on the other side came detraction a woman dressed in great pomp and magnificence but in a mighty passion of anger having her aspect like fire in her left hand she held a burning torch and with her other she drew by the hair of his head a young man who held up his hands toward heaven calling god to witness his innocence with her came a woman pale and evilfavoured beholding the the young man attentively like one that had been consumed with long sickness whom you might easily conjecture to be envy  there followed two other women who made it their business to adorn detraction one was treason the other fraud after followed a woman in mourning black and ragged called repentance who turning her back and sore ashamed beheld truth who then came forward  it is thus apelles described detraction by which he himself was brought into extreme danger having been falsely accused to king ptolomy of egypt who upon his refuting the accusation ordered him as many talents as would amount to twelve thousand pounds sterling and that his accuser should be his perpetual bondsman  if some curious engraver would form a plate upon this model the best method would be for persons this way injured to purchase a ptint and fix it like a playbill at the door of any noted offender after which it should be a rule for the neighborhood never to believe a report that came from that quarter whether in praise or dispraise of any body  by this means the tongues of evilspeakers and the pens of evilwriters would become useless and unregarded and innocence having nothing to fear might look untrembling upon slander  the plain dealer no    quid enim sors est idem

extraordinary than the subject of the following letter which i therefore publish in honor of the advance of feminine learning though when i consider the force of the sexs natural magic i observe with some jealousy their pretensions to the art of conjuring  a common council man of this great city writes to me with much impatience to be informed whether there is no statute in force against the study of the black art i was at a loss what art he meant till he went on to inform me that he can never make his visits to a certain lady of his acquaintance but his wife knows where he has been and shows him for proof of it a man and a woman in a china cup discovered closer than they should be by means of certain telltale hieroglyphics in the settling of her coffeegrounds  application has been also made to me by the husbands of some foreseeing ladies who go to bed to take counsel and are as wise when asleep as waking  one poor gentleman in particular has been kept at home these six days upon a dream which his wife had that an owl flew out of her bosom and met with a jackdaw that picked his eyes out this has absolutely convinced her that her spouse will receive some mischief the first time he ventures out of her company  in fine our women are become a nation of sages and men must shortly be dependant on them not for delight only but instruction  sir you were pleased in a late plain dealer to threaten the maleworld with an inundation of femalewit before we are so happy as to have this comfortable tide break in upon us i conceive it to be the duty of every married christian who is honesty conscious of his wifes superiority to furnish you with fit materials by confessing as far as in him lies the blessing that has befallen him  i think it a wise mans part to be humble in the midst of preferment and would therefore be understood to speak without boasting when i inform you that i am able to read my own name among the worshipful the commissioners for conservation of his majestys peace  but i have a wife who not to praise her more than she really deserves would have made a better justice than i am  her understanding blazes out to the admiration of all who know her only like wood that is too vigorous she is apt to snap a little in her flaming for which in order to be even with her i have given her the name of snubsy  the worst of it is she confines her talent to one science and so her qualities which if divided might have adorned a hundred arts are all profusely lavished for improvement of that single purpose  my spouse good sir to be plain with you is far gone in palmestry but greek and she being intimate acquaintance her own name for it is chiromancy  if longitude lay in her palm she could not fail to discover it and be paid for her peeping  my brothers of the bench you know are not without some wit their way and most of them can crack a joke when we meet over a bottle  i venture now and then to push a pun upon these occasions and they all know as well as i do that i have no closefisted wife though she makes a good hand of me  i allow her a study to herself at the end of a long gallery where when i walk and take my pipe i am sure if i but peep through the keyhole to see her thumbs as high as her eyes and half a score reverend philosophers who treat on this deep mystery lying spread on a table before her  she has fortune at her fingers ends and never sybil prophesied with such unwearied application  it gives me no small delight to observe how busy she will be in looking over my line of life and really sometimes she hits things strangely one would almost believe she has more help than she should have  my cephalica which you are to know is my head line has it seems a forkey figure in the midst of it that points with both horns against my linea vitalis  i dont know why it is but she always laughs when she sees this mark and says she is sure some good will come of it because the butend of the fork points from the dragons tail to the mount of venus  though i believe her at my heart yet i pretend to make a doubt of it because there can be no prettier diversion than to see how she frets and what a deal of goodnaturd pains she will take to convince me of it  i must own i stand amazed at the improvement of her natural parts by the benefit of frequent practice upon secrets i am utterly a stranger to  we have a new minister in our parish and the first time he came to dine at our house i shall never forget how he stard when snubsy began to show her learning  she no sooner looked in his hand than she told him he would be made a bishop he is counted a man of letters and yet he was not able to disprove it though he owned indeed it was unlikely for she reduced it to a demonstration little less than mathematical by squares trines circles stars spots tokens signs lines and figures of a thousand different sorts direct transverse and parallel pursuing every argument with an invincible force of reasoning through the cavea martis to the via solis and unravelling all the crosses in the tuberculum on the mons saturni till she came within reach of the via lactea under the girdle of venus and there the doctor stopped her and made acknowledgements of his satisfaction  we went lately to show bedlam to a countrycousin who came up to visit us and in the middle of the long room my snubsy took a fancy to let her kinswoman woman see how fine a skill she was mistress of in order to which she fell to reading us a lecture over the palm of a silent lunatic who with a rugg about his shoulders very quietly gave her his hand through the grate he was standing at  she had just pointed out how his mons mercurii became afflicted by an evilline from his mons lunae when the patient besprinkled her face with a bowlfull of a certain illscented liquor of his own making which his other hand had concealed behind him we were all in good measure made partakers of his bounty but my cousin and i were beginning to quit some part of it which we thought we should have no use for when we were interrupted by our dripping chiromancer who ran between us all in transport holding her hands as high as our eyes and crying out with great vehemence that her fears were now over  for she had foreseen by a combustline between her pollex and her cardiac that she should be in danger of a violent death either by drowning or suffocation  it is not in my power to explain to you all the benefits which i receive from this profoundness of my spouses foresight  other people when they take new servants are forced to send and enquire their character but my little conjurer does but peep upon their palms and satisfies her self immediately  i had a very strong partiality for a smiling country girl that came last week to offer her service in the quality of a chambermaid but upon the very first inspection my examiner charged her home with three favorite sweethearts and then whispered something in her ear which she staid not to return an answer to but ran blushing out of doors in the utmost hurry and disorder and this discovery my cassandra assured me was grounded merely upon palmistry the girl having a manifest triangle on the bottom of the mount of venus which extended so far downward as to make a cleft in her restricta  i was once in some kind of danger to have been drawn into a plot but my snubsy found it out in the palm of my hand and in presence of a minister of state who i can assure you made no small use of her convinced me beyond dispute that i should bid fair for being hanged by virtue of a crooked line that crossed my via combusta this frighted me from my foolish purpose but i remember i was strangely comforted to discover at the same time upon the ministers opening his hand too that his lordship had a combusta as dangerously marked as mine was  after so happy a deliverance by interposition of her art i grew desirous to be taught it and with a great deal of good success i got over the heathen names of her planets and knew what parts of her hand they kept house in i was wonderfully pleased with venus when i found in my primmer of palmestry that she signified womankind kisses and ladies curiosities but i could never away with mercury for her books were pleased to inform me that he held his influence over pages pimps and lawyers justices of the peace and astrologers i thought it from that time forward unbecoming my honor and gravity to apply my self to an art that had treated my office with such indignity and as often as i cast my eye upon these venerable words justice of the peace and saw them mixed with such ill company i closed my fist in a fury and would study palmistry no longer  yet in the way my snubsy practices truth compells me to confess it is an inexhaustable fund of benefits both to my self and to the public  if i happen to be sick she consults not my pulse but my palm and when persons of less learning feel change of weather in their toes she reads it under her fingers in short it is impossible for any body but one who knows as much of her as i do to imagine what strange sings and tokens she carries about her and what great things they signify  to such a powerful pitch of perfection has she raised her surprising skill that she saved a poor mans life lately who was brought before me by a neighbors daughter in order to charge him upon oath with having done no less than ravished her but snubsy who was for beginning the examination in her own way no sooner saw the inside of their hands than she convinced the sufferer very seasonably that the accident was unavoidable having been foretokened by a plain incisure on the center of her via lactea so that being decreed from both their births this misfortune became a fate and it would have been in vain to have struggled against it  the poor girl wept and thanked her and with charitable change of purpose told the prisoner that she forgave him heartily for she thought it hard to have a man hanged for doing nothing but what he was born for  in justice to the merit of a wife so deeply learned i could do less than desire you to acquaint the world with my snubsys character when you come to lay open the genius of our english ladies  i am with due regard sir your neverfailing reader and your humble servant walter worshipful   the plain dealer no    per varios casus per tot discrimina rerum tendimus  virg monday november        to the plain dealer edinburgh october        sir in my last i laid before you a short character of the present magistrates of this city and some account of the factious spirit that too often disturbs them and their laudable undertakings i am not at all surpised to hear that many of your readers among my own countrymen have taken offense at my free correspondence notwithstanding the sanction of your judgment under which it is published  prejudice will always make the world uneasy whatever cause it proceeds from it never fails to govern the understanding in a very shameful manner and though it is often no more than the imbibed sense of a second person which a man makes use of as his own it is rarely and with great difficulty restrained from producing innumerable bad consequences in life with the face and appearance of something that is good it mixes it self with every circumstance and action and has every where a powerful influence one man calls it religion another principle and he who dares be blunt owns it by its plain name of party whatever is done or said upon this foundation though never so faulty shall find advocates and however praiseworthy condemnation what a shame is it to reason to hear it avowed that such a set of men can do nothing ill because on our side and such another nothing well because they vote with our enemies  but enough of this subject  if as it is generally owned the public good should be the point most in view of each individual i ought to rest satisfied and may despise the spleen of my censurers  but sir i am inclined to construe favorably and perhaps the indignation that some people express against good persons and good things is not so much the effect of vice as of ignorance as when a scheme is proposed for public benefit blockheads may innocently decry it because they cannot comprehend it this i take to be the present case from the dull opposition that i have wondered to see made against several highly generous and profitable undertakings men whose souls are shortsighted love to walk in old ways because they are in no danger of being lost while they have a hedge at each elbow thus the hotentots adhere to their hereditary dirt and nakedness thus the irish too were formerly instigated to rebel against the yoke in defense of their ancient privilege of drawing ploughs by their horses tails with all the wit of a freeborn stedfastness and i am sorry i have cause to say that for a reason of this goodly sort my neighbors love stinking streets and hate the innovation of necessary houses  if in this part of the world we chance to hear of a project to make us cleanly we wonder at the crackbraind whimsie and guard our hearts against vanity if it is undertaken at the particular expense of the proposer we discourage the guilt of so presuming a generosity nay let a thing be actually executed and completely done to our hands we have still spirit enough to rail at it with the most masculine inflexiblity in this and other respects i have instances in my view and my neighbors will take my meaning though not my counsel  it were easy sir to expatiate upon the ignorance and partiality that prevail among our people were i inclined to write satyr and expose the weakness of my countrymen but as i am unwilling to spread their defects i beg leave on the the other side to lay before you several more of the blessings and ornaments our city boasts of  you have done us the honor to distinguish the genius and virtue of some of the rising generation in one of your papers and my last begins an account of the fair assembly here in edinburgh which notwithstanding the opposition of our clergy is one of the best nurseries of politeness in scotland by means thereof our youth of both sexes learn a habit of briskness and freedom which till of late were less frequent among us that restraint and stiffness of air and address which distinguished us from people of more generous education by decrees wears away and conversation which was formerly so confined and so dull grows open free and easy ladies find they may speak to gentlemen without violence to their modesty and gentlemen may entertain ladies without designs upon their virtue it is now no more a sight when a lover waits on his mistress home or takes a walk with her in a garden nay we have husbands who without jealousy can hear batchelours invite their wives to an entertainment in short we exchange the spanish affectation and gravity for the english liberty and free spirit and in place of narrow minds and the vilest hypocrisy we are growing profane enough to assert the dignity of humane reason and the innocent privileges of nature  perhaps i am not mistaken when i affirm that this conversion i beg leave of the clergy to make bold with the word because i have as good a title to it as they have is in a great measure the effect of the union of the two kingdoms but when i consider it is an advantage i would not be thought to mean that either nation is yet too happy under the effects of their incorporation it may be allowed us i presume to wish that however strictly they are united they may never be bound so close but that one hand may be loose enough to assist and unite the other if it is not quite impossible there should arise in some future age such a miracle as a corrupt ministry or a prince less watchful than our present glorious sovereign for the defense of his peoples liberties  but i am no politician nor will i attempt to enlarge upon a subject that fits not the purpose of your paper though i promise my self that the plain dealer will not scruple when occasions rise to assert the rights as well as the sense of a true briton  i proceed to remark that as the correspondence and communication between the now united kingdoms has in a great measure improved and polished the taste the air and the fashions of both the gentlemen and ladies of my country so it has also refined our language in a very sensible manner i do not mean the accent and pronunciation when we speak it  for these are hardly to be naturalized without much time and continual converse there being in england itself a shibboleth peculiar to every county no wonder then that scotsmen find it difficult to come up to their standard  but if you will allow that we make some progress in the substance of the language we will readily give up our pretensions to the graces of it yet our way of pronouncing the vowels has advocates in foreign countries and perhaps the authority might deserve a review with the english  i have wondered to say truth that we are such proficients in the language considering we have neither a court nor a theater which are the acknowledged fountains of its refinement  when i look into the writings of mr drummond of hathornden in the reign of king james i sir george mackenzie in the reign of king charles ii the earl of lauderdale in the reign of king james ii bishop burnet and mr fletcher of salton in the two last reigns and of a certain noted writer in the present when i compare their style with the style of some of their cotemporaries in england i am tempted to think my countrymen not so very far inferior as that critics should depreciate our pretensions to the language but when i consider too that whatever elegance or mastery of that sort we arrive at is as much a virtue in us as it is nature in you i am vain enough to imagine that we merit no less praise at least should meet with fair indulgence  one thing more i beg leave to remark with respect to our language many of our words that seem uncouth and are not understood by englishmen are notwithstanding of english origin and are not less emphatical and worthy for being obsolete among you i find few old words in douglass virgil that are not also to be found in chaucer and perhaps our allan ramsay a living versifier in oldstyle uses few that are not to be met with in shakespeare spencer etc  except when he coins words by virtue of his extrajudicial poetic privileges that never were and never will be used by any mortal besides himself  living languages are like living trees they have their summer and their winter the words of the one like the leaves of the other fall off and are succeeded by a new generation it is however discretions work in this case to naturalize none at the expense of better  you see sir with what freedom i write my sense both of persons and things to you i own i observe no order in the form of my letters nor do i believe that would recommend me more to your regard what i chiefly aim at is a natural simplicity in my expressions and a truth in my facts becoming a correspondent of the plain dealer  i have the honor to be with due veneration  sir your trusty intelligencer and most obedient servant fergus bruce   after having thanked my correspondent for the continuance of his agreeable intelligence i shall close with a short remark on on what he says concerning our language  i agree with him entirely that many of of our old words had the same original with theirs for all that part of scotland to the the southward of the frith was as much saxon as we were so then the foundation of our language being the same it is not so reasonable as i wish it were to allow this ingenious gentleman the claim he makes in behalf of his country  that the elegance and mastery which are by nature in us are a virtue in north britain  the nature is certainly alike to both nations the virtue is most due where the improvement was first made the nobility and gentry of scotland have at least for ages past been as learned as the english and much more accustomed to foreign travel and correspondence these are the great and indeed the only causes of refinement in a language  for trade and luxury are much more likely to corrupt it by the confusion they introduce mixing degrees and distinctions and contracting our care to regard nothing so much as interest  since then the scotch language was once the very same with the english and since their people have been more intimately conversant than ours among foreign nations and have always enjoyed the same assistance of learning and yet have been behind us in the improvement of our common tongue it follows by necessity that the praise of virtue is in ours  but it is a birthright which like kentish gavelkind we must equally divide with our brothers in the next generation for though they were slow setters out they have proved themselves as good runners and will be abreast with us in the race and lose no ground for the future  the plain dealer no    credula res amor est  ovid met  tormentis gaudet amantis juv friday november        the complaint of amanda in the following letter is of a nature as new as the foundation of it is just the guilt which it speaks of is frequent enough but this finespirited and discerning lady has placed it on the person who has hitherto been looked on as most innocent and deserving pity  the truth is there are a thousand resemblances of virtue which if unmasqd by so distinguishing a hand as amandas would assume their proper faces and be known for vices and follies  i will entertain my readers with this ladys excellent letter just as i received it and afterward in obedience to her command consider the complaint which is the subject of it  october         sir when parents have so much zeal for their childrens promotion and so little for their happiness as to force them to marry the person they have an aversion to how is the world moved with a tenderness of concern and nature shocked with the violence  such a constraint has always met with its just discouragement and your predecessor in plain dealing took it under his care but whether it is from the pride of one sex who are fond of the reputation even of a lover whom they hate or from the unjust partiality of the other the much greater offender in my opinion passes uncensured  such parents are stigmatized with inhumanity and well they may but what shall we say of him who continues to teize the woman who abhors him who would force her to make a prostitute of her love to enslave herself to interest and when her refusal has drawn down the resentment of her parents lays it all on his excess of love  is love then so base a passion so void of tenderness so unlike itself and all its generous pretenses that it can feed on the quiet of the beloved object and steal from it the joy which it has not power to give it no no the real lover knows not how to offend  his happiness must rise and fall with hers who inspired his passion  but if on the contrary his desires run counter to her happiness it is not love it is brutality and if he who is thus possessed supposes himself in love he is deceived and would deceive others  but even granting all this were the real effect of love on the part of the pursuer where can a woman find that dedelightful harmony that inexhaustible spring of bliss which we are taught to expect in loving can the constancy of an unlovd lover ever win her to a compliance no  rather prepossession will guard the passes of her heart nor suffer it to be bribed by obligations and time does but add to our hatred for opportunity finds out faults and furnishes reasons for our refusal  in short such a lover shows more extravagance than constancy more inhumanity than passion  this sir is my own misfortune to be miserably haunted by the man whose sight is odious to me one whom no words can convince no denials satisfy no affronts affect insensible of my uneasiness and indefatigable in creating it  i would fly him but i cannot unless i would fly my friends too and my parents nor have i any intimate left whom his diligence and insinuations have not made his own  it is of you therefore i must beg to say something that may give me ease and have some effect on my troublesome pursuer and if in any thing i have said i am mistaken in my sentiments or unguarded in my expressions be pleased to correct it and think that a woman cannot be always on her guard who has so just a cause for resentment as  your unfortunate humble servant amanda   it the admiration which is due to such a merit as this ladys did not place her above pity i could be sorry for that persecution which she laments in so elegant and pathetic a manner the gentleman who is so unhappy as to be the subject of her complaint will be the last that feels the force of it  there is a love of ourselves deeply rooted in human nature that imposes on us first and then emboldens us to impose on others we do not approve the faults which we are guilty of but which is almost as bad we cannot see them  we join heartily in with those who condemn the very follies which are most remarkably our own and are all the while insensible how ridiculous we appear to others by adhering publicly to the practice of what we as publicly continue to censure  it is i must confess the hardest lesson of nature to correct the extravagancies of love  where this passion is real it will be the sovereign of the mind it moulds the soul to its own purposes and lends its own eyes to the understanding neither does it depend for its violence or moderation on the capacity of the lover but on the proportion in which it actuates him the wise man in this case has no prerogative above the fool it is in love as it in madness the more exalted the genius the more unbounded the raging  a wise man may much better defend himself than a fool can but when he yields there is no difference because opinion in this passion always stands in the place of reason  this being the case amanda has small encouragement who by appealing to what is reasonable would dissuade her lover from what is necessary  her charms have deprived his life of every comfort but what she gives it and while he loves at the rate she says he does it will be impossible for him to think himself so much in the wrong as she finds him  it would certainly be a great happiness if men who love without hope could desist without misery for besides that amandas argument has thrown an air of ungenerous selfishness on the obstinacy of such addresses there is this further mischief in it that a lover whom an avowed hatred cannot repulse in his application cuts off his right when he becomes a husband to complain of or return ill usage  is she too cold too unkind too disdainful for a wife  how much greater is his fault who foresaw all this and yet would make her one  he loved her before she pitied him and consented to become his notwithstanding the most open profession of her insensibility and how base and ungenerous must it be to make the continuance of that insensibility his pretense for treating her ill after she has put her self under his protection which while she refused and detested him had no power to move his resentment  either he ought with a manly fortitude to tear himself from the remembrance of an object so insensible of his torments or in gratitude for a compliance that was involuntary and the effect rather of compassion than of love he should resolve to support himself under the misfortune of her aversion without permitting his own sentiments to be imbittered by the effects of it till by a progress of persuasive softness he shall have touched her reluctant heart and prepared it to receive impressions as well of love as of gratitude  but how monstrous is the brutal figure which i have seen some husbands make who when lovers were the poorest and most abject of all slaves  when they should be defenders they are tyrants and when it was reasonable for them to have been provoked they were stupidly submissive  how contemptible is their unmanly weakness a morose and restless peevishness makes up the behavior they expect to charm by they contract a surly sower habit from the disappointments they meet in life and instead of softening the edge of affliction toward the woman who is bound to share their sufferings they double them on her head from whom in honor and humanity they ought to ward off sorrow by a noble sweetness and endearing tenderness in their whole behavior  but the pleasantest stupidity of all is that when by a length of savage cruelties they have made themselves completely odious they are impudent enough to wonder how it happens that their wives appear no fonder of them  there is no part of our life that requires a nicer conduct than our choice of the person with whom we are to vow an inseparable union and yet there is nothing which we venture on with more rashness or which we examine with so little foresight  and hence it is that matrimony with equal satyr and justice has been compared by one of our old poets to a crowd in the street which excites a curiosity in every passerby to add one fool to the number but they are no sooner in the midst of the press than they grow uneasy at their situation and are as eager to elbow out again as they were before to gain admission  marriage is like unto a rabblerout they that are out would fain get in and they that are in would fain get out many are the pleasantries which the truth and frequency of this unlucky observation have given occasion to among men of wit who having laughed a while at others grow silly enough themselves to be also laughed at in their turns  but in all the multitude of sarcastick fancies which i have met with upon this beaten subject i remember none that is so uncommon and founded on so humorous a piece of extravagance as an epitaph which i saw at rome where a man and his wife who were buried together are represented quarrelling in their grave  the original is in latin but i will translate it for the service of coquets and old maids who cannot fail to make good use of it on a theme which they delight in handling  stay bachelor if you have wit a wonder to behold husband and wife in one dark pit lie close and never scold tread softly though  for fear she wakes hark she begins already you have hurt my head  my shoulder aches these sots can never move

virg monday november        by this time i suppose i pass for an outoftheway old humourist who has nothing in him but a few odd whimsies which he takes delight to be noted for but now the town begins to fill i design to take more state upon me and before the winter is half out i shall cause it to appear pretty plainly that i can make free with trade and politics as well as with wit and impertinence  i was walking the other day near the royal exchange and took up a little pamphlet that lay in my way at a booksellers shop entitled new and accurate observations on the coast of guinea  i was pleased with this subject for though i informed my reader my first setting out that i was an enemy to the east india company by which hangs a secret that may be disclosed in some future paper yet i am a lover of the royal african and have good reasons for both opinions  the gentleman who is author of the abovementioned treatise is a physician newly returned from the coast he writes of  he seems to be a person of learning and experience and expresses himself with a warmth of spirit that carries in it a generous plainness and a rough but manly integrity  when i began to peruse his book i thought he appeared too angry but before i had read it out the ill usage he complains of seemed incapable of being remembered without an agitation of such passions as must leave him fully acquitted  the abuses and mismanagements which this gentleman enumerates are such as i am sorry to hear of because their consequences must affect the company in too sensible a manner  i have often reflected not without the utmost amazement from what strange causes it should happen that the credit of that company has been sunk to so low an ebb since nothing can be more demonstrable than that it has advantages beyond comparison above all others to make it self the most flourishing  if any deficience within themselves with regard to stock or encouragement is the prevention of their good purposes methinks their complaints could be no sooner heard than they would be sure of a remedy for even as they now stand no company exists that is of such importance to the nation  if the interest of england in respect to trade depends most as it certainly does upon her american plantations those plantations do as certainly depend on the slave trade from africa a trade that strengthens us in the very vitals and first principle of government for it is perpetually adding increase to the numbers of our useful people far beyond the progressive growth of our slow and natural multiplication  the nation too in point of wealth as well as power is to an infinite degree more advantaged than the company by effect of this negro traffic when the company have sold a slave that profit which they once make is all the benefit which he can ever bring them  but for the benefit of the nation there is no computing what may be gained by him not only the wretch himself but his childrens children after him down to the latest generations are for ever doomed to work and all their product is the nations  the difference is vast and infinite  the extent of country comprehended within the limits of this companys charter is prodigious and astonishing for above thirty degrees on one side from the line and about twenty from the other all the coast is within their limits so that they have all the good variety of soils and of latitude which the whole world can afford them  they have consequently within their bounds a proper earth and climate for every rich product that we pick up here and there at the remotest distances from one side of the globe to the other  they have not it is true a claim of property to the lands but how easily might they purchase it as far as could be necessary at rates too inconsiderable to deserve the naming  they have islands too and settlements never subject to the natives insults  why might not these be cultivated why not rice sugar indigo cotton ginger and tobacco brought hence as well as from america and how much sooner and easier  in one short and comprehensive view may be seen a demonstration of the difference as to the companys profit between the slaves they transport to america and those whom they might employ if they pleased to raise products for their own benefit  to say nothing of the charge of shipping them which would be saved upon all so employed in africa nor to insist on the mafest advantage of cheaper freight and shorter voyages what can be plainer than this way of reasoning  compute the companys profit by the sale of a negro to be equal with what might be gained by him in a years work over and above his maintenance and the interest of his prime cost which it certainly never is yet the negro that works for the company costs no more than one who is sold for them whereas this last is wholly lost from that day forward to their interest while the first returns them yearly the same profit during life without new charge to balance it  i spoke just now of products which are commonly raised by our planters in america and might as certainly be raised in africa but there are eastern harvests of much greater consequence which time i hope will teach this company to reap without more difficulty than may gradually be surmounted  why not the richest of the east indian spices pepper nutmegs cloves and cinnamon procured and planted there they have soil and climate exactly the same with those in which they grow nay they have wild spices rising naturally under their agents eyes to be as it were an indication and push em forward to attempt it  but if they will not be persuaded to transplant advantages at least they might possess themselves of those which lie before them they have gold which the natives gather and bring down to their forts and factories i know what difficulties attend the view i am about proposing and i know too that though they are considerable they are far from unsurmountable what hinders then but that the uplands might be discovered and perhaps the gold mines found and worked upon by the natives themselves for the companys benefit in exchange for what those natives value more but which would cost little to their furnishers and this attempt though peaceably established and pursued might for more certain safety be protected by the awe of an armed force a very small one were sufficient here where numbers are of little strength for want of courage or of order  how much more useful than some of their present factories would forts and settlements be a hundred miles or more in distance one above the other along the niger or some other of those prodigious rivers which flow a course of two or three thousand miles through the heart of this vast and unknown continent how easy were it for the people in these forts to possess and cultivate a large tract round them to discover the bordering country and trade and make leagues with the neighboring princes to maintain a regular and frequent correspondence with each other by means of light vessels with flat bottoms adapted to the navigation properest for those rivers and once a year or oftener to send down their general stores to the companys ships at the entrance and receive back with the return of their small vessels what should be sent them from home either for their support or traffic  what new and numberless nations might the company thus trade with at first hand to their unspeakable enrichment  and were such an entrance once opened to them by expert and resolute adventurers what popular increase of consumption would it not occasion in our woollen and many other manufactures  there are no impossibilies in designs of this nature but to narrow and confined understandings and to spirits of a heavy fabric but this company has the honor to be assisted by great geniuss wise and enterprizing enough to mark out the way to measures that might soon recover them from the present ill prospect of their affairs and make the memory of the royal african company dear and glorious to all posterity  it is a work of too much length for such a paper as mine is to prove how practicable these things are but i shall sometimes occasionally touch the subject with the brevity i am confined to because when i consider into what hands my hints may fall i flatter my self they may grow fruitful and become a service to my country  the duke of chandos in the head of these has so fine and so enlarged a spirit and is so great and so acknowledged an honor to our nation that it is scarce possible to express in his praise so much as every wise man must think of him  i dare not therefore attempt so hard a task as his full character but while i mention him i am on fire with such an admiration of his generous qualities that i cannot forbear to close my paper with such faint outlines as can be sketchd by one who draws at too much distance  it is not alone in the princely grandeur of his economy that this illustrious lord reflects a brightness on his honored order and points out to us in a shining light what a nobleman was meant to be appearance he well knows can be no more than the shadow of substantial glory  he looks inward therefore and draws out into practice and example such a surprising train of virtues that instead of supporting his distinction upon the title which was so justly due to his he has added to it much more honor than some who wear it with a colder spirit have been able to borrow from it  though descended from a noble line one of the most ancient of the kingdom he disdained to owe his greatness to the grandeur of his ancestors nor ever thought of his forefathers honors but as an archer raises his eye to the point of some high steeple when he would shoot his arrow over it  how inconsiderable in so generous a taste as his are all the glitterings of a dependant greatness how much nobler after his more than imperial manner to adorn and serve this country his own unbounded expense than to be more busy to perhaps less purpose and be paid for his want of liberty at the head of an administration  the world lies open to his eye and all its interests are exactly known to him but nothing can he see in any part or happy corner of it more beloved and worthy than he himself is  there is this too peculiar in him that his mind with all its vastness is serenely centrical and regular his purposes are as rational as great his understanding is clear his penetration is boundless his resolution is ardent and his applications are calm and steadfast  he knows and marks the nicest difference between dignity and pride generosity and ostentation condescension and weakness  he reconciles state with easiness and teaches reverence to freedom how extensive is his wisdom how unwearied his industry how magnificent his liberality how enlarged are his ideas how unrestrained by prejudice how unconfined to party  what astonishment would it produce in the minds of ordinary men could a a history be given the world of the immensity of those princely expenses which might be charged to his humanity  the charity of the common world would blush and hide it self at the comparison for the munificence of this prodigious spirit would swallow up all other benignity as the enlivened rod of moses devoured the serpents of the egyptians  these are his known and public beauties but what amiable private qualities must there be in so exalted a mind which are hid from the distant world and appear only to those few those very few of his friends who not alone are conversant with him but have souls sympathetical enough to conceive the glowings of his untold purposes  under the influence of such a power what may not the gentlemen of the african house expect would they resolve upon such measures as may suit the glory of a company of whom it will be said hereafter as was once said of tire and sidon whose merchants were princes and whose traders the nobles of the earth  the plain dealer no    scribendi recte sapere est principium and fons hor friday november         there is no kind of wit which requires a livelier force or more comprehensive turn of spirit than that which we inscribe on monuments to express the characters of the dead and i am sorry i have reason to observe that almost every church in england is a witness of our deficience in it  the fire of fancy should on these occasions be extremely intense and subtle because wanting continuity it has all its effect at a flash and can therefore have no medium it must be either piercing or contemptible  when i stand before the tomb of mr dryden in westminsterabbey i am in debate with my self concerning that delicacy of veneration which was the cause of its being inscribed with no more than his immortal name  the noble founder thought it superfluous to add any thing after that because there scarce lives a reader who can be unacquainted with his character  yet methinks on the other hand the expression of a decent gratitude may be held due to a benefactor however raised above the want or expectation of our benevolence and to carry it yet farther though no profanation could be more unpardonable than the product of a vulgar genius on a subject so exalted there is at least one spirit in the nation greatly equal to the labor and this the founder of the monument must have known more certainly than any other person because more nearly conversant with and more sufficiently a judge of him  i would not after this say i mean mr pope but that in the course of my papers i shall let him perceive that i am no flatterer  i have wished to see his soul do honor to his fathers dust and animate a marble which can never be more dignified than it is unless his own remains should visit it  when my passions feel his force in eloises struggling conflicts i attend him through the depths of nature with the reverence which is due to godlike wisdom and philosophy and while my fancy flames and glitters in the sportive vastness of his levity where belindas hair attracts him i am transported at his wit and gaiety and grow in love with his good breeding yet five parts in six i doubt of all that admiration which has been paid to these inimitable flights of genius is implicit and mere accident for there are strokes so fine and delicate that like angels they must be invisible to the eyes of common mortals and seen only by those happy few whom heaven vouchsafes a visit to  i have been shown an epitaph lately which is said to have been written by this gentleman for the tomb of a friend of his the thought on which it turns is very happy and extremely natural  it has been published in some of our weeklypapers but not so full as i here give it  to this sad shrine whoever thou art draw near here lies the friend most wept the son most dear who never knew joy but friendship might divide nor gave his father grief  but when he died how vain is reason eloquence how weak when pope must tell what harcourt cannot speak yet let thy once loved friend inscribe thy stone and with a fathers sorrows mix his own ah no it is vain to strive  it will not be no grief that can be told is felt for thee the manuscripts of this fine epitaph which are handed about town have already various readings and in some the two last lines are wholly omitted but i can never suppose a castration of that importance genuine because the close at the first break has a strength so full and distinguished that it left an absolute necessity for a vigorous turn of thought in the conclusion of that which follows it whereas nothing could appear more languid and unequal to its author than to have ended after so fine a stroke with saying no more than this let your friend write your epitaph and tell the world that he is as sorry for your death as your father is  i have not i think at home read any piece of this kind more striking and strongly raised upon the force of its touching simplicity but i remember to have seen two epitaphs both foreign which gave me a delight of the same nature  i shall translate them as near i can into english this first is by a french poet on the death of cardinal richlieu and has in it a certain mixture of the great the natural and the surprising which is very rarely to be met with  stay traveller  for all you want is near wisdom and power i seek  they both lie here nay but i look for more and raise my aim to wit taste learning elegance and fame here ends your journey then for here the store of richliev lies  alas repeat no more shame on my pride what hope is left for me when here death treads on all that man can be the second which now follows is of spanish original and was the epitaph of a beautiful neice of the famous olivarez  if weeping love inquirers seek to know her name whose charms enrich the dust below point up and bid em read  but say no more nor strive in vain to count her virtues over scarce could the sweet amount be justly sung though her each atom were an angels tongue where there is justness and propriety in these rays and beamings of the wit they break out upon our fancy with irresistible force and luster we are often dazzled for a moment even with the false imitation of it where the proper sense is mingled and confounded with the metaphorical but we no sooner examine it closely than the counterfeit colors vanish and we despise our own and the poets weakness whereas when the thought is just as well as shining when it is founded on truth in nature and only raises our admiration by its grandeur grace and nobleness the heat contracted and pointed strong upon a near and single center inflames and catches like a burning glass and stocks and stones are melted down by it almost as suddenly as gold and silver  it were a work of general use and no unpleasant entertainment to make a muster of those false thoughts or affected turns of wit and pass em in review opposed to such as are true and solid  the common taste would stand corrected and consent to give up their favorites for few can want good sense to distingush when they see em together and mark that truth which is nature represented exactly as she appears is the life and soul of thinking and greatness delicacy and delightfulness the fine dress and ornaments of it  the black eyes of the spanish ladies have a jackothelanthern brightness that is very apt to mislead the poets of that warm country the following sonnet is a masterpiece of its kind and may deserve to stand as an example of that false wit abovementioned as consisting chiefly of contradictory ideas which are forced together like oil and spirit by the violence of the writers fancy but separate and distinguish themselves as soon as they have time to settle  i know too well my cruel fair why those sweet eyes have sable covers mere pity bids em mourning wear to grieve the fate of murdered lovers assist me then thou killing maid i hate my foe and must defeat him oh lend me but those eyes in aid and he is stone dead when next i meet him but though such turns as these are unnatural and therefore ridiculous when applied to any serious purpose yet there are turns both upon words and thoughts that preserving the truth of meaning are so far from being faults that in all the lighter kinds of poetry they are extremely graceful and desirable thus in the famous epigram of ausonius relating to dido who fled from phaenicia to carthage upon the death of her lover sichaeus and afterward died her self upon aeneass forsaking her the thought is just and solid and though it glitters and is so full of point yet it bears without diminishing every light that it can be viewed in  i will give both the latin and the english because our language has been judged incapable of expressing it without more compass and weakness than the original  infelix dido nulli been nupta marito hoc pereunte fugis hoc fugiente peris poor queen twice doomed disastrous love to try you fly the dying for the flying die there is something too of an elevated smartness and that will bear the nicest examination in the thought of a french poet concerning a cardinal already named who was accused of holding too great an ascendant over his master  il est trop absolu sur l esprit de son maistre mais son maistre per luy est le maistre des roys though he shadowed his master with arrogant wings yet he made whom he mastered the master of kings it is this power in the conception this comprehensive grasp of meaning where more than can be expressed in pages is crowded into a single sentiment and insinuated to the reader so as to swell and expand it self in his understanding it is this that is true poetry that makes up that illustrious art which is therefore justly called divine because it shakes and moulds the soul and bows to its purposes transports us out of our selves and raises a creation round us which is wholly of its own establishing  but how different from this is poetry as it is commonly understood and practiced  a trifling skill in measure and an easy sweep in rhyming are no more what makes the poet than the chimes can be called the church or the chariot makes the doctor he who thinks in a vulgar manner will be so far from concealing his emptiness by the verse he pretends to charm by that like the dirty fool in the gospel who invited himself to the marriage feast and sat down among the finest guests without a wedding garment he will be put pointed out with the more contempt and serve to set off the vast disparity between himself and those he presumes to mix with  whoever does but reflect on the different figure france now makes among the princes of europe compared with that which every body remembers her to have made within these twenty years will in justice to a most heroic monarch divest himself of the ungenerous littleness of common national prejudices and observe with pleasure that great princes influence over the wit and genius as well as the courage and obedience of his people  when i read the birthdaysongs of our english laureats i see the poorness of their salary through the slightness of their sentiments but the most light and jovial performances of our neighbor nation when they had their king for their theme seemed to glow with a warmth of gratitude as if reason strove with invention which should praise him with most copiousness  quil regne ce heroes quil triomphe toujours quavec luy soit toujours la paix ou la victoire que le course de ses ans dure autant que le course de la seine and de la loire quil vive autant que sa gloire may our hero long reign and still triumph in state and conquest or peace on his purposes wait let the course of his years like the loire and the seine flow with fullness and strength above times deepest drain for while blessed with her king what has france to implore but that he may live till his fame lives no more i designed when i began this paper to say a great deal more than i have left my self room for concerning epitaphs and elegies but i must refer what remains to some other opportunity and will conclude with one of the sublimest pieces of extravagance that ever heated the imagination of of a poet  the author was a portuguese and in describing the assault of a fortress by his countrymen speaks of the ditch in a flight at once so wild and yet so strong that it is impossible to find a proof more pregnant that genius without judgment can do nothing considerable in poetry  the yawning ditch declined with dreadful steep and from days aching eye so backward fell that saints might pass through its unsounded deep to scare the devils and let in light on hell the plain dealer no     dare jura maritis hor monday november         patty amble has many friends who

have stuck fast ever since in the dirt of your dear sussex  well though i have but half forgiven you for setting that breathing whirligig ned volatile upon me yet i think i am as much in love with you as with any of your rival candidates for the place i have to dispose of  but if ever i marry you there is one thing i must positively insist on  you shall keep me two chairs and a chariot  i had scarce a scruple of brains in my head all last week for after rumbling up in a stagecoach i was pounded to death from the dreadful borough to parkplace in an odious hackney mortar  you have history i know at your fingers ends pray send me the name of that tragical roman tumbler who was barrelld up by the carthaginians and rolled a mile or two down hill in a butt stuck full of tenpennynails methinks i pity him from my heart for i could not help thinking while i was bouncing up and down in my vehicle like a thimble full of shot in a quart bottle that my own case was as bad as his at least

resolution to issue writs and call together a female parliament  you allow that we have wit  we our selves know we have wisdom and every body has reason to know that we cannot want authority  so the thing it self is past dispute we have decreed to take government upon us but the question is under what name or title we shall exercise it  we are told by an experienced sister who is sole chamber counsel to an eminent counselor at law that the word parliament will be too bold and ardent for our purpose and yet if another of our members who is learned in law french be but as good at derivation as she has always been at disputation she will have parliament to signify prattlement and in that case who doubts but we might make good our pretensions  however let it go we aim at nothing but our just prerogative nor have any design in the least against the privileges of the other houses whose members for any thing i see to the contrary may be as capable as we are  yet it were certainly no harder upon the men that the women should usurp their offices than it is mortifying to us women to see the men interpose in ours and what truth can be more manifest than that there are malemembers of more houses than one ungallant enough to invade us in our very essentials  some can dance as well as we can some though fewer indeed can even talk as well  here and there one can manage a family as well  but an infinite number of them can wash their months as well and vye genius with us in dress and diversion  nay i am credibly informed by an able committeewoman of our assembly that she is intimate with two of them who are so far gone against us that the first makes shifts and aprons with the finest workwoman of his acquaintance and the other can cut paper the best of any gentlewoman in the three kingdoms  if such wrongs as these must be tolerated away with order and distinction  shall any body after this say we ought not to assume a title because the nation has already bestowed it on our representatives what were the nation without us and how are we represented where none of our sex are permitted to sit and vote for us is this free government is this to be subject to no laws but those we have first given cnsent to  either let us as a distinct body have a right to govern our selves or admit an equal number of us to sit where laws are made for us and i believe i may venture to undertake for the absent that we will be modest enough in that case to content our selves with a bare negative upon all bills that concern us  but what shall we do about this difficulty of the name old lady lofty was for having us dignifie our purpose with the awful sound of the senate but her granddaughter who can read horace in latin said that title had an air too motherly and would sit hard upon youth and gaiety  it was next moved that a commitee of virgin elders should be sent as far as poland to borrow and bring home the use of the word diet  kitty hoyden leapt out of our her chair to second this motion  she had been informed she said that polish diets are often summoned to meet on horseback and she was positive that no people could ride more learnedly than the horsewomen of our country she added that little more seemed peculiar to these polish diets unless it were their art of quarrelling without interval and in that too she saw no reason why an english woman might not equal them  it was now in a fair way to be carried on this side the question when suky shadely who is newly recovered from the jaundice turned the tide of opinions by crying out that she protested against the physical sound of the word for it put her in mind of her apothecary  what at last we all inclined to was the turkish title of divan i think convention was whispered faintly but none of us knew what to make of it and as for convocation it was unanimously rejected upon the insinuation of a grave archdeaconess that it would be inconvenient to assume known titles which under pretense of custom and precedent might reduce us to subordination and bring us to feel some power we should not dare to disobey and yet be heartily vexed at submitting to  dear slavy dont look grim but think for us and help us out as you wish well to your speculations  come for your consideration beforehand i will communicate to you the material heads upon which we meditate our institution as they were drawn up for us by a sergeants lady who has often made it a moot point whether her style or her husbands is most remarkable for conciseness  first then for avoiding disputes and contests with certain courts already established we renounce discharge and hereby openly disavow and protest against all claim and pretense whatever to decisions of justice or of equity  secondly we forego quit claim to and

debates that may and questionless shall and will arise in so able and so numerous an assembly the house shall choose six speakers of whom however no more than three shall speak at once that so there may be at all times a reserve for due succession in case of one setts wholly tiring under such incessant application  sixthly that the first session shall be held in the great masquerade room at the opera house in the haymarket where all the voices of that house whether women or other than women shall be admitted to sit with the members but no absolute men shall be capable of holding office within doors save only our trusty and wellbeloved john james heidegger whom in regard to his good will and past services we constitute sole bearer of our mace and of all other our convenient utensils  these are all our determined articles but it was as good as resolved at our last meeting that for the safety of our assembly proper application shall be made for a company of guards to mount upon us and continue to do duty as long as ever we sit the officers of this company as high up as the lieutenant may as usually they are be of the masculine gender but the captain must always be a woman  if the lieutenant happens to be married his wife will command of course but if not the nomination will be by majority of the members voices  you see now dear servant the great importance of this affair and since i am sure your head is stored with models schemes and systems concerning power and rights of government drawn from latin greek and gothic nay and for any thing i know from arabic and egyptian do but aid our generous purpose with your experience and grave counsel and you shall see as soon as we are married with how much gentleness i will hold the reins which your wisdom will have contributed to put into the hands of  i was going to say your affectionate but in sober sadness of  your obliged and not insensible humble servant martha amble   the plain dealer no  0 quicquid praecipies esto brevis ut cito dicta percipiant animi dociles teneantque fideles omne supervacuum pleno de pectore manat hor friday november  0      when i was young i remember among many other follies i was very vain and tenacious of my own way of thinking i was particularly delighted with the notion i then had of eloquence and made no manner of dispute but i was my self a wonderful proficient in it i was ravished with the flowing swell of a longwinded period i had formed my taste of style upon cicero and treated the commentaries of caesar with an extraordinary air of contempt when i compared them with the most frothy flourishes of that everabounding orator  i had not learnt to consider that there is a difference in the effect of the same words when they are spoke and when they are written  when we see and hear a powerful orator our reason is betrayed and dazzled by the interposition of our senses  the grace and majesty of his person the neverresting variety of his motion the aptness of his looks and gesture the rise and fall of his voice insinuating softening accusing repeating urging impressing and enforcing with a gradation of the strongest passions all these combine to charm and cheat us into admiration  but when divested of these prejudices we come to read with a steady judgment what we heard with so much emotion the cold and languid oratory depending now on sense and wanting all its aid of emphasis and utterance lies tasteless on our understanding and repetition and change of lights are found to fill up the place of richness and variety in the conception  one of the first who made me bold enough to break out of my roman bondage and resolve for the future to think all words which give a discourse no progress in its meaning rather burdens than embroidery was montaigne where he is speaking of authors  as to cicero says this freespirited frenchman to confess the truth frankly his way of writing appears to me very tedious his prefaces definitions divisions and etimologies take up the greatest part of his work there is life indeed and noble life but it is smothered in the dressing when i have spent an hour in reading him i recollect what substance i have gathered from him and find for the most part i have got nothing but wind he is not yet come far enough to be entered upon his reasons  now for me who only desire to be wise not eloquent i would read nothing but what is to the purpose  i know well enough without being told what is meant by death and pleasure why then do they give themselves the trouble of anatomising them i am for reason and argument at the first dash and would be instructed how to withstand rather than talk quaintly of my passions i am for charging at once into the heart of the doubt and not approaching it by way of siege with logical lines and trenches  the subjects of cicero languish by his delaying our expectation his way was very well for the bar or might do perhaps for the pulpit and since it is so common to nod at a sermon men in this case might have leisure to take a nap and wake a quarter of an hour after time enough to find the thread of the discourse men may speak in this manner to children or to ignorant people but i can never be made attentive by an authors elocution where his matter is too weak to hold me before i had the cood fortune to meet with this censure which carries with it no more boldness than reason i had ventured to appear in print and sent some treatises into the world which i have never thought of from that time forward without blushing at my conscious weakness in the affectation of a style so wordy that it moves my own indignation very strongly against my self for what i have formerly considered as no small part of my merit  if my own works were of importance enough i would light em up as a beacon to warn others of the danger but since that honor is more than they deserve i disclaim it with due modesty and will borrow an example of like nature from an author of more dignity  the gentleman i mean is a reverend and learned professor in whose preface to an excellent translation of virgil we are told after at least as much instruction as could reasonably have been expected that he has not yet done with us for something more still remains behind  now though much may be said for this gentlemans generosity from the profusion of his desire to satisfy us yet a less degree of praise will be sufficient for his discretion since it was not kind enough to whisper in his ear that he who tells us the same thing six times over will rather provoke us to indignation than to gratitude because it argues an opinion in him that he is talking to persons who have a deafness in their understanding  when he had assured us he had not yet done there could be no reason in the world but the overobliging liberality of his rhetoric to take the trouble of adding that there was something more much less that there was something more still  but when he goes on with so unhopd so unexpected a flow of bounty as to add that there was something more still that remained the obligation was enforced to so surprising a height that it must have been judged impossible to raise it more if we had not found immediately after that not only something more still remained but that it remained behind also  i could wish to see it established as a rule among writers that every word should be a fault which being taken out of a discourse left no void in the sense for to what end should we use expressions which may be cut off without maiming or let stand without beauty  when the pen of one who attempts to write history happens to be thus dropsically disposed he never fails to drown his facts in a deluge of affectation  we have then long speeches of great generals made to their armies in line of battle and just on the point of engagement in which the monstrous absurdity of supposing such a time fit for formal harangues or that they could be audible to the hundredth part of the numbers they are addressed to is not sufficient to deter these orators from displaying all their tropes with so much fullness and variety that when the armies come to charge the historian has not spirits enough left him after the fatigue of his war of eloquence to observe or explain to us how the battle it self was formed and fought or by what conduct on one side or mistake on the other the fortune of the day delcared in favor of the victorious  tacitus of all historians was least guilty of using wordiness or circumlocution in his relations  on the contrary when he errs it is in the much nobler extreme of too rich and delicate an excess of sense  he refines not on words but on things he speaks less for his great persons than they spoke for themselves but he thinks for them much more delicately than it is probable they ever thought  when galgacus at the head of his britons is about to charge the roman army what number of eloquent pages could have inspired his followers with reflections more apt to inflame them with heroic sentiments than what he flashed upon their imaginations in this comprehensive encouragement  fall on my friends and in the shock think of your ancestors and your posterity  antiquity can scarce produce an instance of more persuasive eloquence than this oration in a single sentence  but i have the pleasure to see before me the speech of a modern leader which as it had an end very different so its influence was much more powerful  caesar and many generals before and after him inspired fainthearted followers with courage but this is the only instance i have ever met with of a commander who had rhetoric enough to talk brave fellows into cowardice  the hero of our story which is sincerely a true one was at his studies in one of the universities of a neighbournation when the late rebellion broke out and allarmed the care of the government he was young and designed for a pillar of his mother kirk  grace and sanctity had therefore been more in his thoughts than arms and slaughter but some of his friends who claimed a power in raising and disposing the militia took a fancy to dignify the young kirkman with the command of a company and gave him orders to march them to a rendezvous that was appointed a few days after  the new captain as he tells the story himself with a great deal of humor and frankness thought safety more his business than valor yet was ashamed to appear fearful when every body round him looked as big as a bajazet  he resolved therefore to have recourse to his oratory and try if it was not possible under pretense of encouraging his men to frighten them into desertion  in pursuance of this hope he drew them on the morning appointed for the march into a ring at the foot of a little mount and placing himself on the top of it addressed them in the following oration which he gave me in his own handwriting  friends brethren countrymen we are marching against enemies who are marching against god for they fight against our king and our king protects our kirk and our kirk is the care of god  so our enemies are gods enemies and our cause must prevail against them  as an officer of command and a leader who knows no fear it is my duty to speak to you in a style that may inflame your courage  but as i am a christian as well as a soldier  a man of humanity as well as mettle i dare not conceal from you that there is a danger which i my self am afraid of i who to speak in the worlds notion of fear am so resolved that i can fear nothing  i mean my fellow soldiers the danger which some of your dear souls may be in of rushing headlong upon damnation  in all probability there will be an immediate engagement  i am confident we shall i mean all who survive the battle shall suceed in the event  but alas which of us knows whose lot it will be to fall in the field of slaughter and since there is odds against your lives are ye prepared for approaching death  it is indeed an unseasonable but ah my friends it is a necessary question  are ye prepared i say to die  have ye assurance of salvation  i acknowledge that your piety your loyalty and your bravery may entitle you to hopes of glory but if you want the inward token the assurance the testimony  if you are not positive my friends ye are doubters and he who doubts says holy writ is damned  mark that brethren  he who doubts is damned  ah weigh this important question before i lead you a step farther knock at your bosoms ask your consciences if ye are doubters and if ye find ye are upright and steadfast  if ye have clear and unquestioned evidence  if your lives have been pure and your bodies undefiled  your credentials for heaven are good  and ye may follow me undauntedly  for nildesperandum est teucro duce and auspice teucro that is being interpreted king george for ever amen  but if you doubt if ye faint if your inward man is not strong  i desire none none of your fruitless aid  i shall be more triumphant without ye neither would i have your blood upon my head since if ye die you will be damned  but my christian concern for your souls has made me forget that ye are soldiers  i come down to put my self before you and let you see by my example in the horrid bloodinesses of this day what an assurance there is in the accepted when they fight against the doubtful  i leave the rest to your consciences they who doubt not will follow me   n b  they ran away to a man from behind their commander  what an instance was here of the powerful effect of oratory  the plain dealer no     furens quid foemina

to find that dear genteel gay spritely charming spanish poet who was author of the verses to which you have done the honor of finding fault with them for no reason in the world but because they were made upon black eyes  i cannot help fancying that you have not only gray hair but white eyebrows with a wheycoloured fat face and a sower freckly forehead with a pale deadish look as limy and as walleyd as one of the watchtowers of your own barbican  never go about to deny it  for i am as sure that it is so as if i had been acquainted with you these sixty years and i will never believe to the contrary unless you get some body to draw your picture after the life and have it cut upon a copperplate to hang up like a sign at the head of your plain dealers for the entertainment of your female

because it is the prettiest of all colors and therefore i bought me a pinkcolour damask suit and carried it down with me on purpose to shake in the old gentlemans eyes and set him a fretting by way of diversion  i have searched the whole town over for an opportunity to deal with you as i did your brother surly in the country and at last i met with the enclosed copy of verses at an assembly where eyes of all colors black blue gray and hazel  nay even the green and the yellow agreed to smile with approbation on the wit and the subject and because i would mortify you i send you what others have been charmed by and as far as all good offices of this kind shall remain very heartily  your humble servant nigrella   verses to the right honorable the lady somerville on her marriage when themes

mortify me  how will she be able to support this disappointment  nay to nettle her still further i admire very much too the lady on whom the verses were made and i have even heard it affirmed by as many men as there are lines in the poem that nigrella s eyes are no more to be compared with that ladys than her spanish poets verses are as good as this gentlemans  but because i would not be behindhand with nigrella in a readiness to oblige i will in return for her entertaining me at so agreeable a wedding invite her to a funeral which we owe to the same hand  she may come without newdressing her eyes since they wear mounring already  but which will go very hard with a lady of so lively a temper she must lay aside her favorite pink color and set her face to look sadly  to close in a more serious strain  the following verses and the foregoing are the work of a northbritish muse and have for their author the young gentleman who writ the ode on the power of music  it will be needless to point out to the reader the unusual excellence of these two pieces they both abound with the true and sublime poetic spirit and the subjects are so diametrically opposite to each other that to place them thus together will furnish a striking contraste of beauties in the most joyful and the most melancholy of all humane circumstances  verses occasioned by the death of the right

weeping wonder turns its eyes away trembling the muse surveys the clouded courts how damped their converse and how dashed their sports what gloomy paleness deadens every face what sickening memory checks each rising grace the royal pair stand fixed in generous pain and look a grief that makes all language vain round in deep silence sadning passions flow and sighs from sighs catch the contagious

think  since not all your love could life retain how should your sorrow charm her back again high above hope or fear she now lives blessed where nothing but your woe can break her rest o let her undisturbed those blessings share which cannot greater be  till you are there the plain dealer no    mens immota manet  virg friday november         among the beauties of magnanimity there is none of a nobler quality than the power of forgiving injuries  it throws a majesty over the mind and illustrates the person with an air of sweetness and serenity  we ought the more to admire it since wherever it is found it is in company with the sublimest virtues there not being room for it in a narrow vulgar soul because overfilld with little sentiments such as have their rise and revolution within the circle of selfinterest  but the brutal passion of revenge and a malicious memory for mischief is become so shameless and licentious that it is common to hear resolutions of retained malice avowed coldly and in general expressions such as setting upon peoples skirts  finding a time to be even with them  and the like malignant silly phrases whereby the burnings of an inward hatred seem to struggle for eruption  methinks a sufficient fortification against so abject a frailty might be drawn from such natural reflections as these  that in violently returning wrongs we do nothing but what beasts can do more readily  that in malice the most exalted noble is but on a level with the lowest slave whereas to pardon is an act of sovereignty and however inferior we were before to the person who has injured us from the moment in which we forgive him we exchange conditions and become superior  but since many who have no ambition to be thought men of virtue would yet gladly be esteemed wise it may be an argument of more persuasion that this propensity to revenge is a mark not of meanspiritedness only but of ignorance  the man of knowledge can never be enough surpised at common wrongs to be inflamed into a resentment either too malicious or too violent  his wisdom has instructed him that wherever we find men we shall be sure to find injuries and that there is a necessity of its being so from the incompatible and opposite wills humors and interests among mankind  should the treacherous the suspicious the covetous the insolent or the reproachful behave themselves otherwise than we could have expected from their natures we might be justified in our wonder at it  but why should we express amazement at what it was natural for us to depend on why be angry with the inconsiderable  most of those who provoke and offend us deserve rather our grief and pity for they are no more in their own hands than a madman or an idiot is and we make a poorer figure than our pride allows us to believe when we disquiet our selves on such weak motives  when a fool throws a straw at us it were to seem light to feel the weight of it and he will never enjoy rest who is not master of resolution to forgive all those injuries which his honor or his safety does not compel him to defend himself against  neither is there only a wisdom and a nobleness  there is something too of a generous courage in a heart that is above the reach of these vindictive impressions  the levity that is shown in being moved at every trifle carries with it an air of faintness and may be mistaken for pusilaity for the firm and manly temper apprehending nothing with fear receives all accidents with calmness and justly conscious of its strength to support it self against danger is indifferent to the indiscretions or animosities of malignant natures  there is a single heroic word in the history of the life of adrian which i could never read without emotions of the highest admiration and which carries in it the instruction and sublimity of many volumes  after that greatspirited prince became possessed of the empire he met a person in the public way who had been his most implacable and bitter enemy  the wretch whose heart was as contracted as his malice had been extensive began to tremble with expectation of some severe and sudden punishment  such as he knew he would himself have inflicted on adrian had the emperors power been his but adrian with the serenest gravity only whispered as he passed him evasisti  you have escaped me  all that largeness of soul could inspire or eloquence adorn and utter seems to have been expressed in this escaped me  it laid open to the view of the world the mighty heart of it is great speaker  it declared him nobly sensible that justice would look like malice should he now when at the head of empire revenge upon a private enemy the contempt he met with while a subject  that very power and command of punishment which sordid natures would have used with greediness to the destruction of the man they hated restrained and tempered his resentment  he considered himself as no longer on a level with his injurer the protection which he owned his subject disarmed the hatred which he bore his enemy  you have escaped he meant to say in that significant single word you have escaped by my becoming your master the vengeance which you should have felt from me had i continued but your equal  that adrian is now no more from whom you could not have expected mercy and this adrian who gives you pardon owes compassion to his offending subjects and remembers none of the other s injuries  it is impossible but a collection of such amiable examples as this enforced by some persuasive pen must work strongly upon the minds of men not depraved into utter tastlessness for by striking even little hearts with a clear conviction that the precept contains nothing but what has been exceeded in the practice it would leave them no pretense for evasion and insinuate by a gradual progress out of their memory into their imitation  but nothing furnishes more occasion for surprise and indignation than to observe our places of public worship filled with outside formalists of all ranks and of both sexes who either with an impious hypocrisy or a stupidity as dark as ideotism affront the majesty of heaven by petitioning gods pardon  as they themselves pardon others while at the very moment of their kneeling in this empty mockery of devotion it is known to one half the congregation that the hearts of the other half are embittered with malicious purposes and glowing with a painful restlessness till they can be revenged for some slight indignity  could these people have a sense of the signification of the words they utter they would tremble at the apprehension of having what they pray for granted literally and the mercy of that dreadful god they dare to trifle with refused to their unworthiness till they have learnt as readily to forgive as to pray to be forgiven  but exclusive of those severer arguments which might be drawn from grace and virtue there is one which must be welcome because we all agree to love ourselves and no enemy is so troublesome as malice to our pride our health and our quiet  we submit our selves by this unmanly passion to the humors of the men we hate  we empower them to afflict and mortify us  at the sight of a person against whom we meditate revenge our spirits undergo a tempest and even when he is absent our memory goads and tortures us  our very dreams become embittered and confound our rest with our disquiet  we wish the evil to another but we inflict it on our selves and contrary to our own intention become patients where we design to be agents  the revenger lives in torment and he on whom he would be revenged is at ease  it is a grinding gnawing passion that preys inward upon the heart and mistakes the means of its own purpose  what triumph can revenge afford us but from a reflection that the person punished repents and wishes the wrong unacted this end can never be obtained by mischiefs for by provoking new malice they make the memory of the old delightful but it may be nobly effected by astonishing disgracing and confounding an enemy with benefits in return for his demerit and this is what the most venerable of all books very strongly expresses by heaping coals of fire on his head that is it burns and wounds his imagination with a conscious shame at his inferior figure while he sees himself disgraced by services from that person of all the world whom he least deserved to be obliged by  the stubborn virtue of cato would have allowed him to submit to caesar but that his pride was more afraid of a pardon than his person was of an insult  men of spirit should despise this passion because it is evident that the weakest minds are most malicious and revengeful  children women and men less resolute than women sting and fret themselves with sense of slights contempts and follies which they miscall injuries while the rational and steadfast mind neglects or smiles at all such accidents  their effects may flutter round him but when they find no place to enter at are lost in fruitless murmurings like a tempest that is repulsed against the firmness of a mountain  the distasts aspersions and indignities which appear so formidable to an abject nature may be compared with thunder and lightning which are terrible to our lower world but have nothing in them worth the notice of those angels and superior spirits which inhabit the caelelestial regions  scipio caesar alexander all the great and shining characters which have made antiquity illustrious have been so far from stooping to indulge revenge that on the contrary they have sought occasions to overwhelm with torturing kindnesses the most malicious of their personal enemies  but a mixture of shade with light being necessary to complete a picture i will set them off by one another in a comparison between a monarch and a minister out of mirkond a persian writer  a poet whose name was delah attracted by the fame of ogtaikhans munificence undertook a journey on foot from the remotest parts of tartary as far as to that princes court in china for no other purpose than to throw himself at the foot of his throne and implore his assistance to discharge a debt of five hundred balisches under the weight of which he became dispirited and was interrupted in his studies  the generous prince conversing with him and discerning his extraordinary merit entertained him very graciously and ordered him a thousand  his chief minister remonstrated that this was rather prodigality than bounty to give double the sum demanded  have you not considered replied ogtaikhan that the poor man has traveled over the mountains and deserts merely on the fame of our liberality and should we send him back with no more than is just sufficient to pay his debts by what means will he be able to defray the charges of his journey but your highness answered the minister has not yet been informed that he presumed to write a satyr against me since his coming hither because i was unwilling to allow him access with so impertinent a petition  for which reason replied the prince you shall present him with another thousand out of your own private purse that he may go back and tell his countrymen there is a monarch in this part of the world who permits not his ministerss resentments to be the measures of his bounty just half as good a story we read of queen elizabeth and our spencer she had ordered him a hundred marks for some piece of his poetry but the frugal treasurer of those days whose wit was too little for his wisdom took upon him to tell the queen it was too much money for an idle ballad  give him then said she what you think he deserves in reason  he replied he would consider of it which he delayed to do so long that at last he quite forgot it  the queen a year or two after dined in one of her progresses at the house of a gentleman where spencer happened to be who in presence of his friend the treasurer put into her hands these verses  i was promised on a time to have reason for my rhyme but from that time unto this season i have had nor rhyme nor reason the queen says the story was highly pleased with the humor and commanded the treasurer to pay him double the sum first ordered  had she added that he should pay it out of his own private purse we should have found no occasion to mend her deficient example by a better in that of ogtaikhan just mentioned  the plain dealer no    proprium humani ingenii odisse quos laeserit  tacit monday november  0      mahomet the iid that victorious turkish emperor who took constantinople from the christians had a very great genius for poetry and was so warm in its encouragement that he is reported to have offered rewards for every fault that could be pointed out in the works of his court poets and made good against the arguments which should be brought in favor of the defendants  heaven be praised that his majesty of great britain has no such partial opinion of the poets of our age and country such a proclamation would drain his exchequer more effectually than a ten years war with the strongest power of europe  but i believe we may live at ease the encouragement of the poets art in this present generation will occasion no profuseness that can be dangerous to the revenue and as for our great men they are patrons for the most part as they are doctors and masters of art rather by accident than by purpose and think themselves under no obligation to pay for compliments which their conscience tells them they have no right to  the truth is when any thing so extraordinary falls out as that a man of quality is witty himself and an encourager of wit in others the poets are so unmerciful in their assaults on his liberality that his equals in dignity have found much safety and comfort in the fame of dullness and there never was a livelier proof of the soundness of that common maxim that honesty is the best policy than the success of the fashionable expedient at once so frank and so ingenious of returning the dedicators gilt book with this short apology for not accepting it  my lord gives his service and says he does not understand these matters  for want of some such dextrous stroke of art the grandees of that turkish emperors court whom i named at the head of my paper were often reduced to a nonplus it was particularly the case of alibasha his favorite treasurer he had learnt to read and cast accounts but wit being out of his way he had one regular method of rewarding all who addressed their writings to him he put the book into one scale and dropped gold into another and having adjusted the balance gave the weight of the work as a gratuity to the author  the worst effect of this general rule was that it was common for the lightest discourses to bring with them the heaviest bindings there was nothing more substantial than the covers of this great patrons books  but one poet above the rest had contrived a pleasant scheme to make the most of his ingenuity he composed a copy of verses and instead of writing them in the usual manner caused them to be engraved on a block of marble that was large enough for a tombstone  he loaded a cart with his compliment and went to wait on the basha with it who having notice of his intended present sent out the master of his buildings to examine the size and workmanship of the stone and pay for it according to its value  the poet went away very much surpised and dissatisfied and writ his patron a complaint how contrary to his greatnesss custom his officers had presumed to treat him to which the basha answered gravely that it arose from a change in his manner  for whereas he had formerly rewarded by weight he should hereafter do it by measure  we have some among our nobility who are equally illustrious for their learning and their patronage of learning but they are so poetically persecuted by the swarms of little creatures who have no end in writing but the profit they propose to draw from it that they meet with daily provocations to repel the avarice of flattery with a spirit and sharpness like the bashas abovementioned and this no doubt is one reason for the neglect which works of genius often meet with when addressed to men of quality  but if contempt is due to the mercenary the modest deserve encouragement and they who are truly generous should never wait till occasion offers it self but seek and make the opportunity for as the sharpness of our sight is best proved by the remoteness in which we distinguish objects so our judgment appears most strongly when we discern merit at distance and invite it to aproach us  i am always pleased with the prospect of any work from which the public may promise it self either entertainment or instruction and i hope the gentleman who has sent me the following verses and letter will have no reason to complain of the reception his design shall meet with  the happy man high over the winding of a cliffy shore from whose worn steep the backning surges roar freeman  sweet lot  in quiet plenty lives rich in the unbought wealth which nature gives unplanted groves rise round his sheltered seat and self sown flowers attract his wandering feet lengths of wild garden his near views adorn and farseen fields wave with domestic corn the grateful herds which his own pastures feed pay their asked lives and in due tribute bleed here in learned leisure he relaxes life twixt prattling children and a smiling wife here on dependent want he sheds his care moves amid smiles and all he hears is prayer the world lies round him like a subject soil stored for his service but beneath his toil hence in a morning walk his piercing eye skims the green ocean to the circling sky and marks at distance some returning sail winged by the courtship of a flattering gale the fearless crew concluding danger over with gladning shouts salute the opening shore forethink how best they may their gains employ and antedate thin scenes of promised joy till a near quicksand checks their shortened way and the sunk masts point through the rising spray freeman starts sad  revolves the changeful sight where misery can so soon succeed delight then shakes his head in pity of their fate and sweetly conscious hugs his happier state mr plain dealer the enclosed is one copy of verses of a great number which my friends have been kind enough to savor me with in order to furnish out a collection of miscellaneous poems concerning which you may possibly have met with a proposal in the hands of some of your acquaintance for their being published by subscription in the name of richard savage son of the late earl rivers  i am sir that unfortunate richard savage the peculiar circumstances of whose uncommon treatment from a mother whose fine qualities make it impossible to me not to forgive her even while i am miserable by her means only induced you some months since in your twenty eighth paper to publish a few ineffectual lines which i had written on her surprising usage of me to which your humanity was pleased to add certain reflections in my favor which i remember with due gratitude and am encouraged by that instance of your goodness to make the present application  when you shall have perused my extraordinary case and those convincing original letters which i have entrusted with the gentleman who brings you this i shall need say no more to satisfy you what right i have to complain in a more public manner than i have yet allowed my self to resolve on  the papers in the order you will see them are prepared for a hand too just and too powerful to to leave me the least distrust of being shortly less oppressed than i have been but i judged my self obliged to lay them under your eye that you might be sensible you said less of my wrongs and my sufferings than the unhappy truth could have justified  as to the mentioned collection of poems they are some of em my own but many more the works of eminent hands for the most part never before published  the subscription will be half a guinea and as i can solicit nothing with importunity in which though a small one i have a visible interest my subscribers will be only those who if they think they see any thing in me or in my design worth their notice or encouragement can have generosity enough to save me the confusion of applying to them and send their names and the number of books they subscribe for to buttons coffeehouse in covent garden where receipts will be given  the book is now in the press and will be published as soon as it can be printed off  if you find among the poems which my friend has desired he may show you what you think worthy of your aprrobation in that case and in that only i shall hope your favorable interposition in behalf of  sir your most obliged humble servant richard savage   i have purposely left out much of this ingenious and unhappy gentlemans letter which was very new and surprising and affected me with the most touching grief  if i apprehend his case clearly and the proofs he sent me are too strong to be easily mistaken it is in some measure to be considered as that of an injured nobleman  but of this the world will judge for it self when the particulars shall be more public  that is his own immediate concern and will i suppose be his own care  but his proposal is what every body ought to take part in because the book in itself has a very uncommon merit and both merit and illfortune join to recommend the proposer  i think it was finely said by a gentleman whose writings and humanity were for many years the admiration of the kingdom  that it ought to be the care of all in whose power it lay to lift mr savage above a sense of his mother s cruelty because a misery so undeserved had entitled him to a right of finding every good man his father  but when to a misery so undeserved we add a design so full of reason it is impossible but there must be many who will feel a noble delight in distinguishing their zeal for so modest a proposer and send their own names and those of others whom they can influence as so many examples when the list comes to be published that we have spirits who can discover genius before it rises into noise and dare promote it without waiting till the way has been led by others  the plain dealer no     fuit haec sapientia quondam publica privatis secernere sacra profanis hor friday december        my devotion i am afraid is not so pure and simple as it ought to be there is a niceness in my taste of other peoples behavior at church which ill agrees with the duty which i my self am there for the discharge of  i discovered this defect of grace in the constitution of my zeal by a kind of reprobate contempt which i found my self affected by last sunday against that plain and humble aukwardness with which the mangled psalms of david were vociferated by the congregation  a gentleman of my acquaintance unluckily whispered me in the midst of what they call their singing that he knew a dutch painter who had drawn the liveliest grotesque piece in europe by an idea that he brought out of church with him from a gallery of country psalmssingers  my eyes and ears took his hint and i shall never forget the group of living imagery  the rolling eyes raised faces hanging heads oblique chins stretched mouths and distorted muscles  the voices too were as provokingly dissonant as the looks were ludicrously penitential  instead of finding my thoughts exalted by the spirit of transporting harmony i became ashamed at the presumptuous license with which the coarsest and most unskilful roarers took upon em to bear part in music sacred to the praises of the almighty  this brought to my reflection with how much reason as well as reverence the choirs of our cathedral churches preserve the dignity of their religious harmony by excluding the unskilled and aiding the attracted heart by all the sweet and melting force of vocal and of instrumental music in its most moving elegance and perfection  but it is not only the manner in which psalms are commonly sung that i consider as an indecency the psalms themselves as we have them in the old english version are a disgrace to our our learning language and our religion  who that forms his notion of davids genius from his poetry as this translation gives it us could possibly believe him the sublimest of all human writers who that should read these lines as they run in the exalted original  lord let not all alike thy mercy share strike the presumptuous but the lowly spare who i say could suppose he had found them either in the sense or the despicable expression of this which follows from our vulgar version  o lord then be not slack nor draw thy hand aback but pluck it forth from out thy lap and give thy foes a rap the sectarians who are too frequently exceeding rigid and narrow in their adherence to imbibed prejudices seem rather to affect than discourage cant and dullness in their religious eloquence and it is a very extraordinary reason which some of those gentlemen have been pleased to give us in print for the want of taste and incapacity with which the noblest and most elevated strokes of davids sacred poetry have been debased into low and untuneable jargon  gods altars need none of our polishing as if to write poorly were a merit in religious treatises and it were possible to find a subject more adapted to the fullness of art than the praises of that god who formed both art and nature  there is nothing so rapturous nothing so strongly painted in all the noblest warmths of fancy or of judgment which have immortalized the ancient poets as most of the hebrew descriptions of the power and majesty of god and among these the civth psalm and especially the first part of it is a collection in one view of the most dreadful and amiable of the almightys attributes so glowingly conceived and represented in such lively fullness that all the greek and latin odes are faint and languid in comparison with it  it is impossible to translate the images of this prodigious poet without doing them some injustice but having lately been presented with an essay upon the mentioned psalm in which an eye has been every where kept to the sense and dignity of the original rather than to its dead letter i will publish it as a proof that nothing can be more unlike the thoughts of david than what we sing as his in most of our churches  i now while my heavntund harp is rightly strung soar my winged soul and let thy god be sung clothed with embodied light he reigns sublime and grasps eternity  and governs time from his feared wrath the suns fierce blaze retires and dark convulsions shake his sickening fires conscious of beams which dazzle natures eye and which but once to view were then to die kindly the unequal sight of man to skreen god like a curtain drew out heaven between dreadfully known in aweful fires he glides or veiled in clouds his selfrolld chariots rides he walks upon the wings which guide the wind steps beyond worlds  and leaves even thought behind ii myriads of angels his commands fulfill angels the heralds of almighty will lightnings in millions sweep his fiery way and round

manil monday december        i declared in a late paper that my speculations should sometimes extend to politics this days entertainment shall be an introduction to that purpose which i shall occasionally pursue with the open spirit of a plain dealer asserting and making free with all the liberty i was born to  a liberty which does not alone entitle us to a property in our estates but in our thoughts also it is the great charecteristick of every freeborn briton that he may speak as he thinks and think as he pleases  while like the provinces of the declining empire of old rome we are fretting and disturbing ourselves under the notion of reason and principle to support the factious avarice of a few aspiring men who find their interest in our divisions the goths are at our gate and we are apprehensive of no outward danger  there seems to be rising near us that northern lion which has so often been prophesied of and i believe in the course of my papers i shall make it sufficiently visible that if early measures are not taken by way of prevention against the threatened evil the universal empire which spain and france have successively alarmed europe with a fruitless dread of seems in reality to be coming upon us with all the terrors of a fifth general monarchy  if it is supposed that such a fear concerns us less than other states which may be thought to lie more exposed i doubt we deceive ourselves by a vanity common to all nations in overrating the hazard of an enemy who should presume to invade us  our ships powerful and numerous as they are are more formidable by the reputation of their terror than by the danger of their opposition for to expect that a fleet will at all times be able to keep danger at a distance were to give our protection to the winds  how many caveats against so unstable a security cannot our own history furnish us with  neither ought it to be considered as a remote or chimerical prospect that we may be matched in our marine pretensions  we cannot possibly have more advantage in the fame and practice of dominion at sea against any of our cotemporary states than the carthaginians had against the romans and the success which crowned the industry and unconquerable spirit of these last in defiance of all obstacles as well of nature as of art is a lesson which may may teach our statesmen that there is infinite difference between things difficult and things impossible  not to insist on the memorable surprise with which france in a few years application convinced us with how little reason we had indulged a notion that there were natural impossibilities to prevent that great nation from becoming powerful at sea all which were found mere shadows when the genius of her ministers turned their thoughts on attempting it  the prodigious and enterprizing spirit of the present czar of russia has at once established in the baltic a third maritime power superior to both its old ones and now while i am writing has a fleet of sixty ships of the line besides frigates  and galleys without number  as to natural advantages whether for building equipping or maintaining a navy this prince has the start of us beyond all comparison  and since when his ships are as many and as strong as ours which judging by what has been done already they may be in three or four years our whole pretense to superiority must be placed in our skill and experience in sea fights how dangerous would the consequence be found should he hit upon some new method of improving his vessels in their strength defensive or offensive many high and arduous attempts toward which have busied some years past the unresting genius of that monarch  within the memory of numbers yet living the muscovites were considered as a people so far from dangerous that they were even contemptible and the precipitate advance of their reputation in arms and policy is a proof that no vanity is more weakly founded and unjust than the common practice of all nations to esteem themselves more valiant than their neighbors  mankind is every where the same by nature till a difference is produced by custom  what nation braver than the persians under cyrus yet what nation baser when they opposed the arms of alexander  what people under heaven have more enriched the histories of former ages than the ancestors of those degenerate greeks who are now the disgrace of christendom contented slaves under a tyranny a thousand times more insupportable than the worst of those in scorn of which their ancient orators have filled the world with noisy declamations in the boasted cause of liberty italy the imperious mistress of the universe has been sunk for many ages and parcelld into petty and almost inconsiderable jurisdictions  and to bring the proof quite home what people ever seemed to hold a clearer superiority over their enemies than the english armies which our first edward led to war against the scots and yet what truth more undeniable than the shameful cowardice and downright baseness of the sons of those very english drawn out against the sons of the same scots in the next succeeding reign of edward the second  courage when considered nationally is not the effect of nature but of discipline skill and practice teaching an agility in the use of arms excite a pleasure in their exercise and abating by degrees that fear of death which is natural to all men convert it into hope of victory and a proud and restless thirst of glory  arms therefore and a dexterous superiority in the use of them should be esteemed the sinews of war and not money as is commonly pretended  an army capable of conquering will always find means of subsisting but money though it subsists an illdisciplined army can never qualify it for conquering  the helpless indians of mexico were infinitely richer than their plunderers  the goths when from that very country which the czar now governs they overran and ruined europe brought them only iron they knew that would make them masters of all the gold they should have occasion for  princes whose authority is absolute and uncontrolled by privileges rights or customs whose dominions are vast and populous and whose subjects are laborious hardy and obedient and acquainted with no learning but what is sufficient to aid their industry without inflaming their pride  such princes become dreadful as soon as they appear ambitious and exert themselves in preparations for war  but when it happens too that a prince in so tempting a situation has a genius capable of improving the artmilitary it is difficult to put limits to the consequences which may attend his fortune  though the study of the art of war has been carried to a great perfection yet there is room enough left to give scope to the force of genius this way and it would perhaps be found upon trial that the modern system notwithstanding the use of gunpowder which was unknown to the ancients is as subject as the old was to be trampled on and overpowered by some new and unforeseen discoveries on those sides most especially where we believe ourselves securest  the measured lines of humane foresight which are so proudly distinguished by the name of policy are vain amusements and mere cobweb subtleties  their narrow busy schemes of balancing the power and interests of nations are often insufficient for the purposes of their designers because these highway statesmen found their maxims upon error in the first concoction  the force of a prince is by their rule to be calculated from his revenue and his revenue from the wealth of his subjects but this argument depends entirely on the general mistaken notion that all equal numbers will be of equal weight in war which is so far from being true that should the poorest prince in europe fall upon the richest with a skill in arms as much superior as he is inferior in his numbers the disparity would be reversed immediately  the romans who never conquered in order to prolong a war but to make it bear its own expenses and increase as well their treasury as their reputation were so far from this new way of computing an enemys strength by his riches that their judgment was directly contrary and this opinion of ancient times appears strongly in that magnanimous answer which was given by a gaul to a king of macedon who showed him his heaps of gold in order to excite terror and then asked him what he thought of his condition the rugged soldier replied sharply that as to what concerned his condition a stranger could be no judge but his bounty he could perceive extraordinary  since he had taken such unusual pains to let his enemies be convinced clearly that his kingdom was worth their conquering  where a prince is really strong  to be held weak in the opinion of the world is rather a benefit than a disadvantage  his preparations alarm no body and the blow he designs to strike will as soon be felt as apprehended whereas the fame of power and riches keeps jealousy awake and attracts envy and opposition from all quarters  the fortune of the late french king had possibly kept pace with his ambition if it had not been watched and checked upon this single consideration  on the other hand gustavus adolphus was so happily despised by the austrian grandeur which took it for granted according to the modern reasoning that the poverty of such an invader would be a curb to his courage that boldly entering germany with an army of but seven thousand men he carried every thing before him like a torrent broke the whole scheme of the emperors designs and had ruined in all likelihood the interest of that family if he had not been killed in the battle of lutzen  designing in some future papers to speak of things a little out of the common road and draw conclusions which i judge too new to venture on without a previous notice that i propose not to deduce my arguments from the principles of modern politiques and therefore refuse to be tried by them i have for that reason thought necessary to publish these few general reflections as a preparative for what i intend hereafter to consider in a more distinct and peculiar manner  the plain dealer no    quos ego  sed motos praestat componere fluctus virg age si hic non insanit satis sua sponte instiga teren and friday december         while i was preparing to make good my promise in a late paper concerning the african company i received the following letter which has thrown me under a necessity of suspending the execution of my purpose till i can argue the ladies into a humor of supporting the burden of something very grave upon the comfort of its having been preceeded by something that was very whimsical  mr plain dealer i have been one of your female readers ever since your first appearance and having begun to take a fancy to you was much concerned for your sake when i saw you venturing upon african stock take my word for it you and i shall be both losers only i have lost money and the plaindealer will lose but labor  you may spare your self the trouble of instructing the knowing gentlemen who manage our affairs in that country how to get all that is to be gotten and since no more than all can be hoped for away with your schemes to improve trade and enable us to improve conversation  i remember a story in one of your papers of a widow at wapping that had brought over an elephant from guinea that could dance moll peatly overturn apple baskets and play a cleverer circle of of tricks than a whole set of managers put together  i remember too there was a russian bear in the same paper who came over to offer his service among the italian fiddlers of our haymarket orchiestra but was rejected as i since heard on the remonstrance of some of their singers  that his strokes were too masculine for their measure  now never trust me if i was not a thousand times more pleased with your account of these two wonderful curiosities than i am like to be with your expected essay for the improvement of our african traffic  but if you can prevail with the royal company to trade in something which we women may find our interest in if in their exports for example you could include our husbands and disagreeable lovers and enrich the bills of entry with any privileges rights or benefits imported customfree for the use of the sex at home in this case i could read with patience the most profound of your commercial dissertations and so might come in time to get gravity and breath enough to peruse one moiety of an act of parliament or begin and end a church history  i am in no small terror and apprehension  sir yours at all points proper laetitia gambol   as there is nothing more easy than to satisfy the demand of this lady and i am naturally inclined to do every thing in my power to promote the pleasure or interest of the sex i shall postpone what i mean to say further on the improvement of that companys trade in general till i have opened a prospect to this ungovernable member of theirs mrs letty gambol of the many great and glorious advantages which may be imported as she desires out of africa to our seaport towns and thence spread themselves in due time over the heart of this happy kingdom for the ease emolument and distinction of the women its best manufacture  i shall not confine my self to any single part of africa but boldly ransack that whole continent for a purpose so meritorious  it is the same thing to me whether the commodities i enquire after are the products of wappo of popo or of ekke tokki provided only that the goods are as polite and elegant as the names i shall load as willingly at boffow or juffer as at quaqua nor shall i make any difference as to the value i rate laudable customs at from the ones having been the prerogative of a bossum and the other the quality of an arompo note an arompo is a maneater whence no doubt our english word romp a private remark by the bye for the particular use and instruction of the lively mrs laetitia gambol   the sable toasts of those sunny climates have such choice of tempting privileges that i shall have room in this paper to recommend but a very few of them i will therefore select the best and begin with this archclaim of virginity within the tropicks that girls at nine years old commence women  the young ladies too in most places are at liberty to dispose freely of whatever may be called their own and when afterward they think of marrying their credit like that of other traders is rated the higher by how much wider and more publicly they have carried on their dealing  i think no doubt can arise concerning the welcome with which these two valuable rights will be received but not being altogether so clear in my opinion concerning the following i shall leave it to be weighed maturely how far it may be of use among us it is a privilege to retire from the fatigue of mans society after having been mothers of ten children  the ancient trial by bitter waters has been more generally heard of than approved among our women here at home who if not perhaps the deepest are unquestionably the prettiest casuists in the universe but the duskier beauties of negroland when under accusations of too much good nature have an appeal to sweeter waters in justification of their innocence for in order to discover to a jealous husband whether the wife has been guilty or not she is thrown headlong into a river and if she drowns she was a sinner but it is a remark of great consolation that there never was found a woman who had not lightness enough to swim and escape the malice of her accusers  there is something too in their agreeable manner of mourning for the death of a husband which deserves to be offered to the consideration of the sex in these more phlegmatic northern regions and one would wonder indeed how any thing so extravagantly polite should have got footing among people who never subscribed to an opera  the whole term of such mourning is included within fourteen days and the ceremony consists of cries which are modulated by the tunes of musical instruments and accommodated with a certain equitable dexterity to the ease of the performer and more lively entertainment of the audience by large intermediate pauses during which they drink brandy and smoke tobacco till their spirits are duly raised to expect when the music begins again for another act of the obsequies  but above all their agreeable customs i contemplate with most reverence the vast extent of their charity there is in it an uncommon profoundness and a tenderness of heart beyond example  it is a practice among the rich negro ladies on the gold coast to give orders on their death beds for buying up a number of femaleslaves to bestow on the public as living legacies whose whole business it is to be at every bodys service in one sole employment which they are all equally capable of for the price of three periwincleshells  they consider this as a work of great mercy and compassion and conscious of their pious purpose close their eyes and die satisfied  i could add an infinite variety of such uncommon commodities as these but the foregoing will serve as samples of what rich goods may be imported for the uses which my correspondent hints at if in right of her self and the ladies she acts for she could propose any scheme of engraftment by virtue whereof the assistants of the royal company might cooperate with the sisterhood  it is not to be questioned but when such a scheme comes to be seen the directors of some other of our more thriving societies will stir against it out of envy and propose their own respective bodies as most capable of or more adapted to the mentioned incorporation but the ladies will i hope have honor enough to keep close to their first engrafters and least their natural disposition to think too meanly of themselves and their own reasonings should expose them without defense to the force of arguments they cannot answer i will conclude this essay for their service with the example of a royal african his majesty the king of boffoe who when his conscience was a little puzzled brought himself off by his resolution  king yagou the abovemeant was a lover of the female sex but being a prince of great frugality contented himself with ten wives only when many of his subjects had forty and out of that small number of ten would now and then for mere good husbandry bestow one on his son joost  a portugueze friar to whom he was boasting of these great qualities represented to him the wickedness of the action and assured him that no civilized part of the world allowed it  at which he laughed very heartily and returned him this answer  must i be a fool because the white men of your country are fools  my people are better informed  and we act in both places according to our different understandings the plain dealer no    misce stultitiam consiliis brevem hor

might sit round him with due gravity to hear his son read some chapter of the alcoran which the father would take pleasure in opening and enlarging on to his domestic congregation it happened one night that in the midst of the sermon the whole audience fell asleep except the preacher and his son which last as soon as he observed it interrupted his father with this remark  see sir the fruits of your good purpose there is not one of them all but sleeps as soundly as if gods word deserved no reverence  the emir looked round the company and shutting up his spectacles in the book against a fitter opportunity drew his discourse to a conclusion with this reply to his sons intelligence  you had your self been better employed in adding one to the number of sleepers than in waking not so much to correct your own faults as to observe the faults of others  i received a letter the other day which brought this story to my remembrance and is one proof among many how difficult a province he undertakes who assumes the office of a plain dealer at a time when people are so vigorous in the censures which they make themselves and so languid in their approbation of those which others make with the same liberty  the author of this letter is so kind as to let me know he is one of my best friends he will not therefore insist on my disingenuity to fall foul of  a single sentence  in one of my late papers and dwell on one error in a voluminous author but he is so good as to be in pain for my veracity having carefully he says examined every single paragraph of mr trapps preface to his translation of virgil and not being able to discover what i charge him with  he closes all with a hint that he writes in vindication of that worthy and reverend author and would not have offense taken at every trifle  the veracity of the plain dealer being the side he will be sure to be most defensible on it was unskilfully done for a lover of the muses as my correspondent subscribes himself to bring on his attack so rashly on that quarter  he ought first to have been very careful and confirmed in his discoveries  but to remove the cloud from his sight if he pleases to turn to page     of the first volume of the mentioned translation in an essay on moving the passions previous to the remarks on the  th book he will find a paragraph ended thus  we have not  as  yet  indeed  completed the explication proposed  for something  more  still  remains  behind  if this differs from what it appeared in my paper it is only by being a little worse than i made it  thus much to the charge in that only part which carried any appearance of reason with it  the other articles have no weight at all but from the regard that is due to a mistaken goodnature which has misled the gentleman whoever he was to apprehend as a trifle an error of the first magnitude in writing  it is certainly the business and the aim of every author to explain and illustrate his argument but this tedious redundance obscures and perplexes it  where a man should imprint ideas he distracts and erazes them and instead of awakening the passions affects the spirits with drowsiness  such a trifle is this fault which my correspondent is for passing over with so tenderhearted a blindness  the censured passage then is no error of such small importance as the animadvertor had thought fit to imagine but he falls next into another mistake of considering it as a place picked out by the inquisition of a malicious eye whereas if he had been as attentive to the argument of the paper where he found that censure as he was to the censure itself nothing would have been more easy than to have observed numbers of the same kind of amplifications which might with equal effect have been borrowed from that work and thence he must have drawn this natural and obvious conclusion  that one error only was dwelt on not because it was all that could be found but because it was all that could be admitted in that paper  as to the worthiness or reverence of the author the letterwriter himself can wish no less ill to him than the plain dealer does but this is a matter entirely out of the question the person has nothing to do where what he has written and published is the ground of the argument  for a friend partiality is weakness and against an enemy it is baseness the merit of a cause lies above the level of such low motives and they who would reach it as they ought must be listed in their attempt between justice and resolution  there is nothing which the plain dealer has a sincerer detestation of than personal reproach or defamation but then on the other side he who dares not speak out openly whenever occasion offers it self concerning the miscarriages of the greatest men or the virtues of the most unprosperous has a soul below the duties of one who writes that he may deserve reading  but to make a transition to a subject which i have for some time in vain been expecting an opportunity to resume with a spirit less ludicrous than that in which i touched it not long since i am raised to such a height of wonders by the triumphant posture in which the wit of this generation is visible almost every night at one or other of our theaters in the genius of our actors limbs that there is nothing which i cannot promise my self from the readiness of their elastick capacity and the humor which the town is in of listening to the voice of their muscles  i have noted for this reason what i discovered not without due transport as i was perusing a certain venerable high german compiler  camerarius his historical meditations  it is a new and unbroken mine of theatrical treasure which i shall recommend with the stronger hope to the contention of our rival stages because the nevertobeforgotten the triumphant faustus himself was of happy high german original  i have oftentimes says this grave and authentic sage for i reverence him too much to vary a word from his text seen with wondering in the prince of bamberg his court a certain peasant of germany nourished and brought up as himself avouched in the mountains among beasts who was so active and nimble of his body that all that saw him were astounded and thought he used enchantment which yet i do not verily think he did  and that which was most remarkable in him was that he showed his agility not standing but walking upon his hands and his feet prone and flatbackd like a dog or a cat  in that same court was a dwarf who would get up upon this peasant as upon a horse making him to turn and wind all manner of ways as a rider would do a spanish genet but when the peasant listed he would easily throw his dwarf for all that ever he could do to sit fast  sometimes he was baited with very mighty mastives and with english dogs that the prince had and by a certain barking which he counterfeited naturally and a furious snarling like a dog would give them the chase and make them run apace out of the hall  that done he would set himself to leap upon his hands and feet forwards and backwards with a nimbleness incredible and would scramble up by the coins toward the roof of the hall faster than an ape could do albeit otherwise he was a rustical fellow heavy and of a gross making  i saw him twice as i was at the princes table after he had thrown his dwarf and driven away all the dogs that were in the room leap upon the shoulders of one of the guests and thence upon the table without overturning dish or cup and then cast himself with such a spring upon the floor that one would have said it had been a squirrel or some wild cat  he did use to skip as fast upon the tops of towers and of houses built pointwise as our housecats would do and so many other parts of a cat and an ape he played that his tricks were the talk and the wonder of all men  i was so pleased with this fancy that i could not forbear communicating it for the future entertainment of our people of fashion and i am so firmly convinced of the imitative spirit and genius of the hostile harlequins of the two comic houses that i question not in the least but by the second week after christmas we shall see a dozen or two of bulldogs round the tail of shepherd on drurylanestage without being able to bite him while he curvets and barks with his back up and wheels safe in their center  and mr lun at the other house crawling up the edge of one of his scenes and sticking to the roof like a spider over the heads of a shouting pit where he will spin himself into their good graces till their necks are half broke with the sublimity of their entertainment  the

by the letters of my correspondents none of which beat so violently upon me as those from the feminine quarter  i begin to find it impracticable to work any good on that perverse and malapert sex by the weight of age and experience  if i had not confessed at my first setting out that i was then in my grand climacterick i am verily persuaded i might have applied my self to them with more success  under their sense of my weakness they despise the wholesomest of my lectures and go on in open defiance of the utmost i am able to do to them  not a day passes but i have new intelligence brought me

neither and what is a man without a business  my case being therefore of great importance and my livelihood depending on my business i do not at all doubt but that when you have taken it into consideration it will likewise be of great benefit to many hundreds besides myself  good mr plain dealer pardon this my presumption and be pleased to correct what i have writ amiss being not right in

foregoe her  with so sincere so disinterested so artless a passion i am  amandas everlasting lover   to the plaindealer sir if you would do a piece of service to the young men of the world whose warmest ambition it is to recommend themselves to the fair without considering what virtues they whom they love are possessed of  let me give them through your means the following true relation  olivia is a lady of genteel and fashionable education for her mother took early care to show her the world as they call it that is to teach her through the most contrary appearances to intend nothing but her pleasure and interest  pamphilio is a gentleman of good estate in the neighborhood  the ladys reputation was unsullied he saw her often and every time he saw her saw new marks of her wit and good humor her freedom and sincerity till from admiring he fell to adoring her  his love was inflamed by the little innocent encouragements which olivia knew how to give without incurring the imputation of forwardness and which pamphilio regarded as so many modest overtures to the advantage of his passion  his visits were more frequent and more open he could no longer conceal his love he declared it at once to both olivia and her mother  for her father was dead and they both gave him hope of succeeding in his wishes  pamphilios affection growing stronger and stronger he became impatient for their marriage in the near prospect of which all the neighborhood rejoiced and did their utmost to advance it for they observed how his soul doated on her and darted itself into his eyes whenever she approached him  olivia declined marrying  she was too young she said to be mistress of a family and insisted on a year more in which she might fix her resolution  though this year to pamphilio was a lovers eternity he was to submit on any terms and the time required by olivia at last drew near its conclusion  the lady then grew cooler and the lover more transported  she declared to him very frankly that it was impossible for her to love him  neither love she said nor hatred were things in our own power and he ought not to take it ill that she could no longer deceive him  poor pamphilio had no voice to reply but a sudden tear or two spoke for him  he trembled grew pale and gazed on her  and sighed at length this faint hope  that she could not sure be in earnest  she answered he had no reason to give himself the air of so much surprise  she had never promised him marriage  and was yet at her own disposal  pamphilio bowed and left her and has also left society he shuns all his former companions and is sunk in the deepest melancholy his affairs are neglected his health is destroyed and his friends are enraged and astonished  about a quarter of a year ago olivia was married and with so extraordinary a success that her relations are already upon suing out a divorce  what ought to render the condition of this lady inconsolable if she has either generosity or reflection is  that her hard fortune afflicts pamphilio to a sharper degree than his own did  such a jilting temper may perhaps be consistent with chastity but it can have neither honor nor tenderness  she was formed to inspire love and very capable of it by nature but she was hardened by education to become unsusceptible of it  she exposed charms to sale which she intended not to part with and then like a covetous tradesman who has lost his best market she resolved as a pretty revenge to throw herself away upon the first bidder  yours pamphiliophilus   the plain dealer no    incertam frustra mortales funeris horam quaeritis  propert tum vero in curas animum diducimus omnes hor monday december         i never met with any accident which more touchingly surpised me than the death of my friend sir portly rufus under circumstances with regard to his fortune much inferior to the figure he had maintained in the world and which made such impressions on his departing soul as served at once to excite my pity and inflame my admiration  i visited him during his sickness and found his family in great disorder the cheerful faces which were formerly worn by his servants as the lively signals of his hospitality were quenched and saddend by a sorrow that proved its deepness by its silence  he was fallen into a forced sleep when i came down to his house in the country and it being late in the evening i went to bed with a resolution not to disturb him till the morning  i lay awake and heard the clock strike one indulging my thoughts under the solemnity of the midnight darkness with a thousand busy reflections on the instability of our health and pleasures when from an old tower of the parish church which was almost contiguous to my chamberwindow i heard the toll of a great bell sound out many times distinctly with a deep and mournful fullness which left an unusual vibration in the air and had scarce ceased when i found the whole family alarmed and the house filled with shriekings and the most distracted cries of sorrow  i rose and dressed my self in much amazement and following the clamor found it collected in the sick mans chamber  i was assured at the crowded entrance that sir portly was a dying man  that the bell which had tolled out at midnight always did so of it is self before every death that was to happen in the family  that it was a warning which had never failed  and that sir portly who had been waked by the sound of it was himself of the opinion that he could live but a few hours  i found my friend sitting up in his bed very faint and scarce able to speak and looking round him with a mixture of wildness and of sorrow on the distraction of his assembled family  as soon as he saw me near him he gave me his hand with a glimpse of cheerfulness which seemed to brighten through his anguish and insisting with much earnestness that i should be left for some time alone with him the rest withdrew and i sat near him on the bedside  he continued silent for several minutes fixing his eyes on me very steadfastly and with much inward commotion till at last he spoke to me as follows  you have timed this visit kindly for it is the last you will ever make me it is a sensible comfort that i have this opportunity to communicate my dying sentiments to a friend who will be capable of doing me justice where the world may speak of me with a mistaking liberty  here he put a key into my hand and directed me to find a paper which i have now in my possession and from the subject of which i shall take occasion some time hereafter to draw more observations than one for the use of men of business who may receive entertainment and advantage from it  he said something concerning his private affairs in which my advice he believed might be of service to his family and then assumed a discourse on the tolling of the parish bell and proceeded in it with much composure  i have neither learning said he nor leisure to enter upon an examination concerning the causes of these praeternatural notices it is enough for me that it is thus and you will soon be convinced of the consequence with regard to my approaching end  but let not any thing so common as death be an affliction or surprise to you i have enjoyed my bed of sickness like a study it has given me an opportunity of retiring into my self without partiality or interruption  the danger of my condition drew a curtain betwixt the world and me and contracted all my business into the compass of this silent chamber here i have seen things as they are and learnt to judge of them without prejudice  to forsake the world gives me no pain from any attachment to its pleasures it can tempt me with nothing new for i have already seen it all  though i die as i shall to night tomorrow will be like to today the same sun will rise upon it and leave it in the same darkness  the seasons will come round again and be called new but they will be no other than the repetition of what i have so often beheld already  why should it startle me to be called back to the place from which i came hither i rose from uncertainty into life and i am now but returning out of life into uncertainty can any thing be more reasonable than that others having given place to me i should give place to others in my turn  either i have not made the proper use of life which i have enjoyed so long already and therefore deserve to hold it no longer or having reaped the profit of living to what end should i wish life lengthened  i have many hopes it is true which it grieves my soul to leave imperfect but if i would live till i am completely happy i seek what is never to be found it were to act like those foolish indians who run themselves out of breath to catch the sun when it seems to set so near them  so might i travel on for ever and weary my self to no purpose the object of my pursuit is not in the same world where i am  yet there is one thing which makes death terrible and triumphs over reason reflection and philosophy it is that we are torn from our friends society  that we are divided by perhaps an everlasting separation from what love has made dearer to us than our life is it is that blending  that liquefaction  or confusion of two hearts in one will desire and interest which is the spirit of all human blessings light is darkness without it and prosperity not enjoyed but possessed without relish  in this view of our souls union here on earth with some kindred spirit which it delights to mingle with death is dreadful when it strikes between us  how many unfinished purposes may it interpose it self to the disappointment of with regard to the comfort or service of those who are thus dear to us when we are cut off by a sudden summons and allowed no time to complete our yet but intentional gratitude or give perfection to our unripend labors can a husband sit easy within when he is straining his dying eyes for the last afflicting sight of a wise who deserved his tenderness and was entitled to his protection but whom he is that moment compelled to leave to struggle with the bitterness of want and acquaint herself with the licentiousness of reproach contempt and insult  or can there be a strength in wisdom to sustain a dying father whose heart is tortured with the burning uncertainty of what shall become of his helpless children exposed orphans to an unpitying world without guide support or prospect  here my friend was interrupted by the impatience of his family who broke in upon us with a grief which soon appeared to have too just a ground for sir portly died in less than a quarter of an hour after  there were many circumstances in the manner of his death which will deserve to be described in a future paper but the melancholy impression they have left me under will at present be best indulged by an abstract of some excellent verses from a poem of mrs elizabeth singers on the death of her husband  i am not sure that i remember them right for it is long since i read them but there is so much of beauty nature and passion in them that the reader cannot fail to discern and admire the authors genius through whatever injury they may have suffered by any injustice i may perhaps have done them  in what soft language shall my thoughts break free my dear alexis when i talk of thee nor nymph nor grace of all the fancied train nor weeping loves shall aid my pensive strain true passion has a force too strong for art she needs no muse who can invoke her heart tasteless of forms and from all comfort torn the husband  lover  and the friend  i mourn all that to worth and tenderness was due whatever excess the fondest passion knew i felt  my prayers to heaven were all for thee and love inspired me first with piety oh thou were all my triumph and my pride my hope my peace my shelter and my guide thy love sweet study busied all my days and my full souls ambition was thy praise why has my heart this fond engagement known or why would heaven dissolve the tie so soon whence had the charmer all his power to move or why was all my breast so turned for love oh he could talk  twas ecstasy to hear the listening soul hung trembling on the ear musicks whole power dwelt artless on his tongue awefully soft like some kind angels song pain that but heard him speak was charmed to rest and mercy melted down the misers breast hours days and years unheeded took their flight for time was only measured by delight fancy still paints him fresh in every grace but the thin shade eludes my lost embrace the shrinking vision melts in shapeless night and a cold horror blots my blasted sight then the past misery rises to my view his death sad scene will be for ever new then with the quickest sense his pangs i feel and his last accents over my silence steal my wife  my sharpest pain my fondest care heaven for thy sake will hear a dying prayer will lead and comfort thee when i am dead when from these aching eyes thy form is fled when these cold hands which now thy grasp implore shall tremble at the touch of thine no more oh where shall my unsocial spirit stray how err unblest along the eternal way from all engagements here i now am free but that which keeps my lingering soul with thee how i have loved thy bleeding heart can tell and  we may meet  till which dear time  farewell he ceased  and waiting angels caught his breath and his quenched eyes dissolved their beams in death but oh what words have passion to express what thought can feel the rage of my distress why did they tear me from the breathless clay i should have stayed and wept my life away yet gentle shade  where ever thou now may dwell wherever thy spirit does the rest excel if thou can listen to my grief oh take the softest vows that love and truth can make for thee my thoughts all pleasure shall foregoe my tears for thee shall stream in secret woe far from the busy world i will retire where mournful memory feeds the silent fire first taught by thee the noblest flame to prove the force the life the elegance of love  sacred i will to thee thy gift confine grasp thee through death  and be for ever thine the plain dealer no  0  populus me sibilat at mihi plaudo hor friday december         it has been justly observed by our writers in defense of the stage that it is a glass in which we see what we ourselves are by the image of our own actions represented in the persons of others  commend me then to the wit or the satire of one of our theaters where they have brought newgate into their mirror and taught our people of quality the elegant art of breaking jayl by way of diversion and improvement  to treat this subject if possible with some appearance of gravity either the taste of our audiences must be depraved to a degree of horror or the judgment of our masterplayers corrupted to a degree of pity  too long indeed have the most successful of our theatrical entertainments been low and contemptible but i never observed before that they were ungenerous and inhumane  what idea will posterity conceive of the present age when they shall read among a thousand living records to our infamy that our nobility and people of the first figure in life could descend to be partakers in an insult offered to the memory and misfortune of a poor wretch a felon who had just before been executed at tyburn by sitting contented spectators to observe his crimes and his miseries acted over again for their delight and instruction  but if as lucan says of nero the gods could make way for caesar by no other means than those dreadful things which preceded him  if nothing less could induce the town to bear with the insupportable caesar in egypt than their acting it immediately after shepherd in newgate the players have at least one good argument for permitting it  they made way too for a brothers tragedy whose tender heart might have been broke if he had twice write dismally to no purpose  king john the dramatick abortive of last winter was a pusillanimous prince and could condescend to hear reasons why it was necessary to submit for fear of a forcible deposing but caesar was a hero and too resolved to shake at danger  though all the serpents of africa should have hissed in his face he would have regarded them as little as he did the boxes the pit and the gallery  this tragedy is so provoking and copious a field for satire that it is with difficuly i restrain my pen from the severest license of just invectives but i soften my indignation when i turn my eye from the play to the author  the exemplary candor humanity politeness affability and generosity of that gentlemans indulgent behavior with regard to the works and interest of other writers but above all his prodigious modesty these his extraordinary and wellknown virtues overbalance a thousand absurdities in his tragedy and determine me to continue silent  the theater to confess the truth is a subject of too much consequence from its effect on the morals and behavior of the public to leave it either decent or reasonable to omit defects in the stages constitution and descend to the actors particular failings  but we have persons on the stage who want not some graces and generous qualities as well of body as of mind which might have adorned even the best of those characters which they are accustomed to represent and of these i shall speak seriously and with pleasure on occasions which will offer themselves when i come in a little time to consider the present state of our stage and what justice there may be in those pretenses to its improvement which we have heard so very much of under its management as it now stands  but to return to my first subject there have not been wanting public marks of disapprobation as often as those illchosen entertainments abovementioned have been exhibited yet they went on with an unmovable steadiness of resolution which in a cause the reverse of theirs might deserve to be called a virtue and even as the case really stands it is an accomplishment very new and extraordinary and must be allowed not unworthy of the highest admiration  that heroic roman spirit which horace speaks of in the motto to my paper went no farther than a private applauding himself at home in return for the hisses which he met with when abroad but our english firmness of face can look reproach in the teeth and persevere with as much negligence and satisfaction as if we suffered for our excess of wit what is levelled at our want of judgment  i was favored many months since with a sheet or two of excellent reflections which were lost by some accident and have been but lately recovered the following observations seem so applicable to my present purpose that i cannot do better than borrow them for reproof of a barbarous custom which had spread itself too broad among us before it appeared on one of our theaters  at paris and at amsterdam there is scarce a week passes without some public execution and yet though there are newspapers in abundance we seldom or never find any account of that sort in them  they think and perhaps justly enough that it is a point of national credit to conceal with as much decency as they can the enormities of their countrymen  on the contrary our writers for the day and the week watch with earnestness for the opportunity and are sure to pass by no such subject  it often makes a very glaring paragraph but is sometimes unhappily situated i have frequently known a change at court yoked with a remove at tyburn and both followed close in the rear by an account of some churchadvancement or newdrawn matrimonial tie among people of quality  i only hint at these liberties and desire to deal gently with my contemporaries  there are other wretches among us who attend the gibbet like ravens or vultures and expect their subsistence from it  not a poor criminal can be hanged but they break open his expiring lips and rob him of his last words when he has suffered the sentence of the law he is condemned afresh to a libel and is far from being at rest even after he has surrendered his life to the halter his clothes to the hangman and his body to the surgeons for then come the scribler the pamphleteer and the biographer of newgate who draw out his good name and quarter it and hang up his reputation in effigy they give him a quarto or an octavo shroud and fringe and flourish it with his birth and parentage  hence the ordinary to preserve his perquisites is driven upon the necessity of advertising against counterfeits and has sometimes no better expedient than to publish the posthumous works of his communicants even before they are yet departed  to be halfhangd has been the case of one or two sufferers but to be twice hanged is a very great hardship and when a criminals account of himself is supposed to be true it seems a mifortune that they who wilfully belie him should be permitted to survive him  if the sufferer can write and read then besides his birth and education his trial and confession we have his last works and compositions if he is married we have his widows lamentation if he dies troubled and unsatisfied we have his ghost and if his life has been at all remarkable we have his history and adventures  some ready compiler of newgate bundles up his memoirs and describes his exploits in so discreet and adapted style that the pleasantry of the relation is more apt to prevail on the young and the giddy who are the common readers of such tracts to imitate a life of so much seeming heroic extravagance than to take example from the fatal end of it  i know not whether such exposing methods as these are not suffered to take place by way of advance upon the lenity of our english executions and as a counterballance to the foreign severities of torture and mutilation if there is any such depth of politic refinement in the indulgence which is shown this practice the dead feel nothing that relates to them and the living i am persuaded are very little the better for such paper executions but of this i can venture to be positive that should some drudge for the booksellers benefit make a collection of all works of this kind and some mercenary translator dress it out in a foreign language our neighbors and our posterity might be tempted to believe that the present generation of englishmen were a nation of thieves and pickpockets  the plain dealer no    diversos diversa juvant non omnibus  omnia convenient  gal eleg monday december         it is a rule in conversation that he who keeps all the talk to himself never pleases so much as one who listens in his turn to what is said by the rest of the company  the same observation will hold good with regard to such a paper as the plain dealer i must sometimes fall civily back and give way to my correspondents or i shall incur the reproach of writing rather to entertain myself than to delight or oblige my readers  mr plaindealer i have such a veneration for the fair that i am sorry i should have occasion to exhibit any complaint against them but i am once a week so whimsically treated by some of them that i am resolved to speak out and spare not  there are many young ladies and what is worse many old ladies within the bills of mortality that every saturday while their houses are cleaning take a fancy to have business with me for no other reason in the world but because they cannot tell how else to dispose of themselves  for you must know that i am a mercer  they swim into my shop by shoals not with the least intention to buy but only to hear my silks rustle and fill up their own leisure by putting me into full employment so they tumble over my goods and deafen me with a round of questions till having found nothing in my shop to their fancy as they call it they toss themselves again into their coaches and drive on the persecution to the terror and disturbance of most of the honest shopkeepers from one end of the town to the other  last saturday was three weeks at two in the afternoon i sent out my servant to watch a couple of these silken strollers and keep if possible within ken of them they undressed about a dozen shops without stripping themselves of a single shilling and at six my man returned out of breath and told me that he had left them cheapening sugars beyond nortonfalgate  but presently they came back and saw my next neighbor a linendraper at his door they pulled their coachman by the thumb and broke in upon my friend and acquaintance though his shop was shut up and empty  they had bethought themselves that they must see some cambricks my neighbor knew them for they were his customers of five years standing during all which time he had never taken any of their money  but they had done him the honor to lean over his counter find fault with every thing he could show them exclaim at his frightful prices and make it a rule with them to bid nothing  he turned over his whole variety of cambricks and had the unexpected goodfortune after the prettiest doubtings and hesitations in the world to fix their determination for they pitched upon a particular piece about half an hour past seven and ordered him to cut off enough for a tucker  the worst of all this is that these unprofitable wayward visiters keep buyingcustomers out of our shops  pray mr plaindealer reprimand them for the good of trade and the ease and deliverance of  your afflicted corespondent j h   sir a great many useful lectures were levelled heretofore against the enormities of certain fashions which had taken possession of the female world  the reduction of the stays the exaltation of the petticoat  and the lightness and the transparency of the modesty piece  as that sex had peceluiar views in each of these modes have been topics for admonition and stature  the ladies have even been told that the obsolete relics of their greatgrandmothers scarecrow wardrobes were less fantastical than the modern whimsies but those wholesome severities suffered the common fate of such good purposes they diverted for a week and were forgotten  all arguments which would be successful must adapt themselves to the understanding of those in whom they expect to operate  the wit of a woman is her dress to move genteely is her judgment and to govern herself with full freedom is her birth right as an english subject who renounces and protests against all absolute and unlimited monarchy  but pray whisper if you dare to these pretty freethinkers that there is a a country in the world called turkey where women are secured against the danger of sunburning by being kept out of the open air and locked up like other jewels in places where no mischief can reach em  a sideglance once a year from a window or an imperfect randomshot through the hedge of a gauze muffler is the utmost danger a man can be exposed to in those safe and silent regions where they have an unaccountable savage notion that there is temptation in a womans eye and that it is possible for a pretty fellow to stare himself into fornication  a little private rumination on such laudable customs as these may have influence perhaps to moderate some of our fine ladies wellbred exorbitancies if not we have at least this remedy it is but to turn turks and we new model our system of government with regard to this female freedom  such a resolution would furnish business not at all disagreeable to  your most humble servant the black eunuch   mr plain dealer oracles have been delivered in dreams and i see no reason why truth may not be as well nodded over by us moderns as by the much more wakeful ancients  our senses being too gross and our minds too much prejudiced to receive truth for its own sake it must approach us obliquely that being couched under sensible representations it may be brought nearer to our view and make its way into our apprehension  upon this account therefore not to keep you in suspense any longer least you may think me dreaming already i have sent you my last nights vision which if it meets with your approbation may encourage me to close my eyes again for i am both sleeping and waking  your constant admirer eugenio   after having reflected on my mistress and on marriage i fell asleep and found my self in a myrtle grove where several ways ran together into one great path that led to the temple of hymen  the flowers most of which were violets and bleeding lovers exhaled a delicious odor and the birds that warbled round me helped to fill the scene with transport  i observed crowds of travelers passing onward but none to my great surprise repassing  upon looking a little nearer i discovered troops of flying boys with silver wings that hovered before them for their guides there were persons of all ranks and of both sexes  i took particular notice of some who though they seemed to make more haste then the rest were at the end the farthest behindhand these i heard were called coquets in the language of the country they seemed to do nothing but sport and flutter about without gaining any ground or desiring to gain any  the next i was told were prudes and these had taken a byepath and moved onward toward the temple very slowly and to all appearance unwillingly with their necks fantastically reverted and their eyes looking back upon the country they had newly passed through yet these were the first that came up and slipped silently into the temple  among the men was a troop which seemed composed of the most expert travelers my guide informed me they were called hibernians they did many things i perceived very differently from the rest for while others led up but one companion to the temple these had several in several paths and were the only persons who after lodging one went out again to conduct another  it was easy to distinguish them however mingled in the crowd by the shine of a certain metal which had burnished their cheeks and foreheads and cast a gleam like a corinthian vizard  i was called off by a confused noise at some distance and made toward it as well as i could but found such an alteration in the air that i could not stir one step without sneezing this was a troop of swordknots and cockades displaying a powerful instrument that glittered much and was called a snuff box the scuffle of tongues was so great that i staid not long among the pretty gentlemen for that was the name they went by but passed on to a part of the grove whence there issued a delightful harmony  coming thither i observed a number apart from the rest with harps in their hands which they touched with transporting melody nine goddesses were mixed among them all most ravishingly beautiful these happy gentlemen i found were the favorites of the grove but they made no haste to the temple rather wandering up and down and making sallies into every path with an air of agreeable indifference  i left them and came up with a troop of clowdy haughty and erect movers distinguished by peculiar headpieces which at distance looked like diadems all the female travelers they chanced to meet with received their whispers with a kind of triumph and listened to them with more rapture than even to the voices of those divine musicians  this train was under the care of two goddesses whose names were insolence and privilege i was now within the sight of the temple but taking an aversion in my sleep to the affected struttings of this company i waked fortunately out of my dream and resolved to send it to the plaindealer  the plain dealer no    segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem quam quae sunt oculis commissa fidelibus and quae ipse sibi tradit spectator  hor friday january        an evil spirit had taken possession of one of the villages in lapland and turned the inhabitants into bears by which means being deprived of the discretion of humane creatures and unable to provide for themselves the king of the country committed them to the keeping of two or three of his beefeaters who took the office with no other prospect than to live at their ease on the perquisites of it and were consequently more inclinable to provide diet to their own taste than to that of the metamorphosd animals which had been delivered into their custody  they had however so much gratitude for the profit accruing from their grant as to resolve that the poor creatures should want nothing that was strong and savoury but they had not the judgment to consider that a man when he becomes a bear requires a coarser kind of nourishment than he was accustomed to while a rational creature  they gave em nothing to drink but brandy and fed em with cockbroth and forcdmeats till they all grew giddy and lightheaded and were taken with a dangerous vertigo  a young shepherd who had been brought up a little wildly and who by living much among beasts had acquainted himself with the nature of bears undertook to board em cheaper and built and opened to that end a new house of entertainment where for the same rates which were paid his rivals he treated the animals in their own way with raw horse flesh instead of ragousts and spring water in the place of brandy  the bears were strangely delighted at a change they were so able to relish and flocked in transport to their new ordinary where they grinnd and grew fat upon a diet which was adapted to their palates so that in a little time not a cub of any quality could make a meal upon their old commons and the poor shepherd who provided for them so judiciously had all their custom for the future and became richer than the kings own bearwards  how such an odd story as this came in my way i know not but i will leave it as i found it for i am in a humor to talk of the theaters  the royal company of comedians differs from the southseacompany the bank and other acting companies of this city in this one point among more that it has directors but no governor  it is certain however that those gentlemen whom they call their managers have had all possible advantage on their side the courtauthority and countenance went with them  the noble and the ignoble joined in a long and unreasonable partiality to support them without rivals in direct opposition to the interest of their own pleasure which is undoubtedly best provided for when rival theaters contend which shall most deserve encouragement  it is worth while then to examine how they lost this advantage and i take the fact to be thus  the good old patentee of the new theater died under a length of oppression and left his right and his house to his son an unfeard and friendless youth of whom it might then have been said as of chamont in the orphan his hopes were all his fortune  he opened against a tide of prejudice and acted many years not only without favor but almost without notice at least from the fashionable world  he tried every reasonable art of pleasing without success  he revived the best old old plays and brought on several new ones but had often the mortification to oppose his own industry and the sublimest scenes of shakespeare to the cold encouragement of empty boxes  what should he do in this case  the torrent of opinion was against him good sense and solid thinking were as useless to him as his boxkeepers  at last by a quickness in his natural wit and a satirical sharpness in his observation he perceived he had nothing to do if he would have the game played into his hands but to lay aside his judgment and abandon himself to his fancy  in pursuance of this lucky discovery he composed a new species of entertainment which had an infinite deal of sense in them but it was only the sense of seeing  it is scarce possible to conceive the ease which this reformation of the stage gave the bulk of our genteel audiences  they could now laugh out without restraint for they were no longer in danger of being merry in the wrong place they felt no weight of words which had formerly lain heavy upon their understandings and the burden of their attention being so commodiously lightened they came and saw and were satisfied  the old managers were indiscreet enough not only to envy but to imitate him  they made that their choice which in their rival had been necessity but attemping it with inferior genius they appeared so awkward and ungraceful in it that they compelled their partial admirers to take notice that they were excelled  and so taught em from that time forward to believe it probable that since in one point they had so manifestly the disadvantage they might in others too have been rather fortunate than so deserving as they had concluded them  thus the young and oppressed became a a match for the old and prosperous  he has continued ever since to maintain the ground he won till the current is now turned and disposed to run in his favor  so far his wit has carried him we are to look out for his judgment hereafter but for my part i am of opinion that when he shall have toyd us into good humor enough to forgive him a little reason he will have courage and generosity to restore the stage to its dignity and exchange our juleps for substantial diets as soon as our sick stomachs shall have recovered strength enough to digest it  there is scarce a surer proof that a man has worth than the respect which he shows the worthy and i was delighted the other day with the praises in which i heard it told at an assembly that the old bachelor is by this gentlemans voluntary offer to be acted next monday at the theater in lincolns end fields for the benefit of so learned a benefactor to the stage as mr dennis  upon my expressing some concern that it was not rather a play of mr denniss own writing i was informed that the master of that theater who sought all opportunities of showing his esteem of so excellent and so injured a judge of wit and learning had left the choice of the play to mr dennis himself who had pitched upon the abovementioned because it was a work of his old friend mr congreve  i acknowledged the generosity of the master of the theater and the modesty of the gentleman whom he treats with so welljudgd a humanity but i could not avoid indulging a fit of talkative spleen against that malice or ignorance which has more than once appeared in the discountenance of some writings from which the name of mr dennis will long continue to receive honor after his body shall be dust and ashes  the stupidity which follows prejudice has made thousands of his cotemporaries insensible of his great merit which if they allowed their reason to examine it they would be charmed by and take a pride to encourage  the terror with which young writers have accustomed themselves to hear and to talk of his austerity and of his aversion against scriblers has spread abroad a false opinion that he is illnatured where he is only impartial and that he is an enemy to wit and learning while he is only such to the prophaners of them  it is pleasant to observe to what a whimsical degree this dread of critics has been propagated and how far down into low life we may trace the effects of our poets mistaken outcries who by giving their shepherds the name of wolves have taught the clowns to set their dogs upon em and cut off the defense of their own fold honest mr david cook the ingenious bellman of pyestreetcorner is i find against the opening of the new year under terrible apprehensions from the impressions he has been filled with of the dangers all good works are exposed to   great sirs my muse has you her guardians chose against the railing malice of her foes for she perceives these wellmeant lines must bear the criticks censures who will nothing spare i was visiting where one of honest mr cooks great sirs asked him why he was afraid of critics and was much edified by his answer  one mr pope sir an ingenious member of our fraternity knows much of these matters and has said it in print that  critics proceed without the least remorse seize on our fame and put their laws in force   though i smiled at the turn of this reason for the fears of so safe a muse as mr cooks yet i cannot help wishing that no great writer had ever allowed himself to join the common cry against critics  if the poets have no art they are a race of contemptible triflers and if they have art they have criticism  whoever is a good poet is and must be himself a critic  to be afraid of a judge is the mark of a criminal conscience  but the severe and manly censures which are peculiar to mr denniss writings have increased the number of his enemies by a piercing sharpness which they carry with them such arguers if they had lived with cato would have made war upon that noble plainness which distinguished and supported his character and refused the reverence due to his virtues because his manners were not supple enough to fall in with their notions of politeness  the best way to become acquainted with a writer is to look for him in his writings  his soul which is his noblest self lives there and is there discovered  how often have i remembered with pain for the infamy it must one day bring us that the most generous and extensive design that ever was conceived by man with relation to the groundwork of criticism in poetry was once undertaken by this gentleman and a subscription for it proposed upon the most moderate terms with so disproportioned a success that after a year or twos fruitless application he published a specimen of his intended work with an apology for not proceeding in it because after so long a trial he had been able to procure no more than seventy or eighty subscribers whose names he printed to their glory for they will be read an age or two hence with a veneration not unlike that with which the athenians engraved those of the three hundred ptriot greeks who defended the straight of thermopylae against the fury of the persian army  so would those noble few have defended the honor of their countrys judgment against an inundation of ignorance and presumption  what will make this fact more wondered at is  that it happened at a time when a boundless profusion of encouragement was poured out upon all pretensions but those of learning and of modesty  but it will not i hope be believed that the tragedy of appius and virginia was acted three or four times and forgotten in spite of those powerful passions and strong pictures of transported nature which it every where abounds with or that shakespeares coriolanus could be altered by such a hand as mr denniss and so strikingly to its advantage and yet brought on without success where shakespeares richard the third racked and mutilated by a barbarous player ran into fame and applause and drew audiences every season  but i can never expect room in such a paper as the plain dealer to touch the merits of this gentlemans writings for whose benefit as above the play of monday next is to be acted and who now descending apace into the vale of years ought to find his way made smother for him and lose sight of these malignant enmities which his stronger days have grappled with there can be nobody who is a friend either to learning or humanity and who has his heart in the right place but must feel a generous delight in being present for his benefit whose whole life has been taken up with essays for the benefit of others  the brave and the beautiful will agree in a resolution to shine out upon this occasion where they will be known to appear in the cause of wisdom and where to be seen is to be honored themselves for doing honor to unrewarded excellence  the plain dealer no    numquam adeoque pudendis utimur exemplis ut non pejora supersint juv monday january        i have somewhere met with a story of one of the ancient princes of the east i think it was antiochus  he was hunting and lost his followers and night coming on after a tedious wandering over heaths and forests he came at last to a little cottage where the poor people were at supper and entertained him very cheerfully as a traveller who had lost his way the chief subject of their discourse was concerning the king and his ministers  as for the king himself they accused him of no vices  they spoke of him with much duty and agreed that he meant well and was desirous of his subjects happiness but he was not they said so absolutely the monarch of his ministers as of his people submitting his own sense of affairs and the authority of his determinations to men of less virtue and understanding than himself and giving way to ease and indolence while he devold the power of his office on wretches whose hearts were too narrow and their passions too violent to deserve any government at all much less that of a kingdom  the king said little to all this but laid it up for his use and benefit and in the morning when his guards and the great men of his court having followed the track of his horse were come to him at the cottage he received them with this declaration  you are mistaken if you suppose i have been all night out of my way  i have sat in counsel with an assembly of the only honest and faithful advisers i met with since i became your sovereign nor did i ever hear a word of the true condition of my affairs before i learnt it in this cottage  the condition of a nation where minions have their prince in pupilage is so vastly the reverse of ours that a discourse on such a subject must be forced to draw examples either from the histories of foreign countries or from our own removed far backward  but as the blessing of a perfect health is never better understood and valued than while he who is so happy as to enjoy it employs himself in reading the symptoms of some dangerous and dreadful disease so the comfort which we free britons must receive from a comparison of our own happiness with the misery of others is an argument which convinces me that no theme deserves more justly the consideration of a plain dealer  i will venture to lay it down as a maxim that where the soul of a minister is not great enough to overlook and forgive and to drown all personal regards in the ocean of his public cares let his other virtues and good qualities be never so numerous and so shining he will confound his princes interest with his own private resentments instead of healing divisions he will inflame them and by a thousand passionate extravagancies draw upon himself a universal hatred and upon his sovereign a contempt that is the most dangerous of all motives to sedition and what wise princes have been careful to guard themselves against by a spirit and activity which even where they have not been loved served at least to make them feared which is the next sure anchor of obedience  the best of princes have had their favorites but it is the easiest thing in the world to distinguish the minion from the minister the minister is his princes instrument the minion makes an instrument of his prince  under a minister the common themes of all public conversation are his great designs for the ornament or the interest of the kingdom  benevolence mercy wisdom generosity and magnificence flow down upon the people in a current of new laws and benefits  on the contrary under a minion nothing is talked of but his subtlety his malice and his avarice  little weathercock artifices and temporary shifts and expedients stand in place of a steady policy and a manly course of equanimity  oppression pride suspicion faction bitterness and partiality are the products of his influence and the law which should be the measure of his rule is the nose of wax to his ambition  the minister takes delight to inquire out men of learning or of virtue that his bounty may raise them high enough to shine like stars upon his administration  the minion hates discernment because he knows himself unfit to be looked into and therefore appropriates rewards and preferments to the mercenary and the ignorant  in short the minister is wise but the minion is only cunning  it is finely observed by aristotle in his discourse concerning government that monarchy when its power is wisely divided among distinct counsels none encroaching on the others boundaries draws into it self all advantages which are attainable by any of the commonwealth systems but is in nothing so weak and unstable as in the folly of partial kings who ruling by their passion instead of their reason remove truth out of their hearing and submit their will to the guidance of some one sole director neither examining things themselves nor allowing others to examine them  such a political monster of a minion we read of in the annals of france in the year nine hundred and nineteen says the author in his second book charles lived as it were alone in soissons despised and forsaken by his peers on account of one haganon of laon a man of vulgar extraction but who was solely trusted with the kings secrets and without whose concurrence no matter of importance could be done either in the court or in the kingdom but the credit of this new upstart was the cause of the kings ruin for the great men resolved at last no longer to endure that such a base scoundrel should be exalted over the heads of the whole nobility  hagijusouf a governor of arabia under the reign of caliph abdulmelec met with a stroke of unexpected satyr which gives a lively representation of the general odium these busy minions are always destined to live under  he was hated for his cruelty and exactions but carried nevertheless an outside of charity and religion he met a dervis one day in the street and having stopped to give him alms recommended himself to his prayers  the dervis lifting up his eyes to heaven cried out with a loud voice take him from us o great god take him from us i beseech thee  hagijusouf was not satisfied with the turn of this prayer and began to murmur at the dervis but the holy plain dealer replied with great earnestness and humility  it is good for you and for all the mussulmans  the truth is there is an unavoidable necessity that princes should be assisted by such subjects as they think fit to favor but it is happy where the master has spirit and the servant moderation for in that case the mischief will be either prevented or corrected before its progress is become considerable  opinion and the obstinancy of reasoning have made a mighty noise in the world concerning the differences between arbitrary and limited government but in the nature of things there is neither absolute power nor freedom taking them in their full sense  every whale has its little leading fish and follows it with a kind of unweildy obsequiousness this in the sea has been thought a wonder but few things on land are more usual and familiar  the most terrible of the state leviathans have been managed and led along by a wife a mistress a favorite or some other such dimunitive pilot so that in an unlimited signification there is no such thing as monarchy  the grand signior it is true can cause any of his subjects to be strangled without assigning other reasons for it than his imperial will and pleasure but how seldom is this done at his own mere motion and how often at that of his viziers and tyrannick minions  i my self says a writer of the last age have known some sovereigns so far strangers to what was convenient that they would scarce grant or deny any thing out of the presence of their secretary  there is but one consolation which can give men patience while they are suffering under the insolence of such upstart tyrants and that is their reasonable hope that they shall live to see the punishment when the guilt is ripe enough for vengeance  it is long before a prince can break out of the obscuring mist which an evil counselor will conjure up and involve him in  but when by accident or reflection he comes at length to clear his eyesight and see things in their proper colors the minion then first becomes a benefit to the people he has injured for he leaves them a protection in the example of his fall which may guard them in times to come against the malice of a new oppressor  the last emperor of china was one of the greatest monarchs of his age and for nothing more celebrated than the vigor and strictness of his justice but he was warm in his pursuits of pleasure and impatient of interruption when his mind was intent upon it  the viceroy of one of the provinces of that vast empire that lay most remote from the imperial city had wrongfully confiscated the estate of an honest merchant and reduced his family to the extremest misery  the poor man found means to travel as far as to the emperors court and carried back with him a letter to the viceroy commanding him to restore the goods which he had taken so illegally  far from obeying this command the viceroy put the merchant in prison but he had the good fortune to escape and went once more to the capital where he cast himself at the emperors feet who treated him with much humanity and gave orders that he should have another letter the merchant wept at this resolution and represented how ineffectual the first had proved and the reasons he had to fear that the second would be as little regarded  the emperor who had been stopped by this complaint as he was going with much haste to dine in the apartment of a favorite lady grew a little discomposed and answered with some emotion  i can do no more than send my commands and if he refuses to obey them put thy foot upon his neck  i implore your majestys compassion replied the merchant holding fast the emperors robe his power is too mighty for my weakness and your justice prescribes a remedy which your wisdom has never examined  the emperor had by this time recollected himself and raising the merchant from the ground said you are in the right  to complain of him was your part but it is mine to see him punished  i will appoint commissioners to go back with you and make search into the grounds of his proceeding with power if they find him guilty to deliver him into your hands and leave you viceroy in his stead  for since you have taught me how to govern you must be able to govern for me  the plain dealer no    curae leves loquuntur  senec hip friday january        many writers besides the author of my motto have observed that the lightest griefs speak loudest and it is doubtful whether there would arise most occasion for mirth or pity could we see at one view the numberless variety of little accidents which are magnified into miseries by the impatience with which we kindle ourselves upon every unwelcome trifle that runs counter to our wish or humor or squares not exactly with our interest  if people could divest themselves of the prejudices of selflove half the vexations which imbitter life and rob goodfortune of its tranquillity would be found to owe their existence either to our pride or our avarice but i am afraid i shall touch this subject with very little effect because i have a thousand times observed that there is a healing quality in vanity which cures the wounds of good counsel lady lowtaste finds seneca so dull where he lays open a sordid heart and shames it by a comparison with the noble loveliness of generosity that she can neither relish nor support him but falls asleep over his philosophy as the readiest way to be even with him  yet who so lively in her attention and so transported an admirer of this very seneca where he happens to speak kindly of any virtue she is conscious of in herself or severely of of any vice which she can charge upon her acquaintance  there are two ends to the glass through which we look into ourselves and others one contracts objects and one enlarges them and it is the pleasantest observation in the world to remark how kindly nature has instructed the silliest and blindest of both sexes to apply either end of this perspective so as to answer their particular purpose with as much readiness and sagacity as if their wit were no less than it should be  i am overwhelmed with letters of complaint against fate illluck blind fortune and the whole train of malevolent chimeras under whose shadow it is usual to hide the effects of our own miscarriages  arietta a brown coquette in her five and fortieth year of fluttering has filled three pages of an angry epistle falsehood traitor and inconstancy against a cousin of ned volatiles who loved her four months and a week and then visited her no more upon a private intelligence from mrs lucy that his name was down in her ladys list as the nine and fiftieth of her absolute conquests  what shall we say to these insupportable misfortunes they must be submitted to with as much resignation as the nature of them will bear and for what remains i can do no more than provide a little comfort for such afflicted virtue by a proof that there are others almost equally wretched  if therefore arietta will let me know what part of the town she shines in i will wait on her the day after and apply a letter to her wounded heart which i received from a druggists wife in the city who had threescore tickets in the last lottery and was so strangely unfortunate that she cleared but about two hundred pound over and above her whole adventure though an ordinary creature over against her that had but three tickets in the wheel could have two of em come out such prizes that she sets up truly for a fortune  the following letter i am afraid must be numbered amonst the curae leves though there is an air of concern and sincerity in it which persuades me that the author is in good earnest at a loss how he should act in the business he writes about  fleet street december         dear sir i contracted a strict friendship with a gentleman and we lived together for some time during which he fell in love with a young lady between whose body and mind there seems to be a perpetual war which of the two shall appear most beautiful  but she was promised by her relations to one whose fortune is much superior to my friends  yet he had frequent opportunity of discovering his passion but wanted courage to declare what he as much wanted power to conceal and so was forced in search of rest to retire into the country  but absence instead of lessening inflamed and rivetted his anguish  he returned to me in great disorder and delivering a letter into my hands pressed me with the most moving words and gestures to convey it privately to the ladys  now sir you must not start when i ask you this question  whether i ought to deliver it the difficulty lies here  i know her relations have a particular aversion to this gentleman  and they are persons to whom i owe a thousand benefits and obligations  my friendship is dear to my soul  and my gratitude is due to my honor i would not appear to betray those who have so strong a claim to my sincerity  on the other hand i was tender of shocking the delicacy and refinement of a passion so sacred as our friendship love is rash and distrustful takes alarm at every trifle and judges hastily and without reason he would conclude if i refused him that his peace and interest are of no weight with me  would he had thought of another means of conveying his letter to the lady  but now should i advise him to it it would look like coldness in his cause and his imagination would take fire with so many false apprehensions that he could never preserve temper to consider that he has pushed me where there is no necessity for it on the surest step by which i can incur the hatred and the reproaches of a family to which i am indebted for almost every thing that fortune favors me in  in this struggle between the duties of friendship and of gratitude i can come to no resolution i have friends enough on whose advice in other things i set a very considerable value but there is no opinion i would follow so soon in a point of this niceness as that of the plaindealer it is the first request i have ever made to you and i hope you will not refuse your answer  when i tell him whose determination i act by i am sure it will satisfy him and if you deny me the prejudice may be infinite  let me have but a single paragraph to direct me or if that be too much give me a yes or a no at the bottom of one of your papers and it shall be enough for one of your sincerest admirers  b  b    methinks the difficulty in this case is not so great as the lively painting which describes it makes it appear upon a first view  since the lover is so worthy of the lady if he had no other means of reaching or being recommended to her but through the hands of this friend my correspondent without all doubt would have stood bound to deliver the letter and try the utmost of his influence to render it successful and the rather because interest only and not merit seems to have recommended the rival  but since it is so easy to find other means as effectual and the favors received by my correspondent from the ladys family are strong motives against his friends employing him where there is no visible necessity that confines the choice to him only he appears to me a little mistaken when he strips friendship of that generous freedom without which it can never subsist and punishes himself with such inward conflicts in support of a delicacy which though it beautifies the face of friendship is rather the dress than the body of it  of all human passions this of friendship is the most refined and i might almost say too the most ardent but i would be understood to speak of the thing for the word is much more common and less powerful  most people when they say friend mean companion or acquaintance but alas what infinite difference  how few can distinguish between friendship which is a parity of souls and affection which is a claim of blood or a tie of mutual interests or an agreement of hopes or fears or principles or humors or any of these mistaken fellowships which are parts of friendship but not friendship  i said it was the most refined of all our passions and it is so from its disinterestedness its nobleness and its exemption from all earthly motives it is a struggling of the conscious soul to enlarge her limits in the body and exert herself in generous sallies into the purlieus of immortality  it is indeed a desire but it is such a desire as the angels burn with  it is an exaltation of the human nature by a powerful mixture of the divine and serves to give us an ideal foretaste of our business when we shall have outsaild time and launched into eternity  i had a friend says our immortal dryden in some or other of his tragedies  i forget the particular place but must always remember the beautiful description  i had a friend that loved me  i was his soul he lived not but in me we were so lost within each others breast that neither found himself but in the other we mixed like meeting streams that flow together all knew us different yet perceived us one nor could again divide us but i am entering on a subject which should i do more than barely touch it would carry me away with it into a length in which i might lose my self and my reader and the best way i can find to prevent it will be to put an end to this days paper with two excellent stanzas from spencer which are very strong and elegant upon the subject  hard is the doubt and difficult to deem when all three kinds of love at once contend and cleave the laboring heart with wild extreme which with most power the stubborn will can bend or dear affection which from blood descends or raging fire of love to womankind or that sweet tie of souls that fastens friends yet sure the knot that joins the fellowd mind should the associate heart with strictest union bind the love of kindred soon will feel decay and shrink or melt in cupids scorching flame but firmer friendship bears its fiercest ray and brightning in the proof its rage can tame inviting trial and despising blame for as the soul inspires our moving clay and gives the body every act and aim so the souls love does love of bodies pass far as the ripened gold surmounts the cankry brass the plain dealer no    gratum est quod patriae civem populoque dedisti si facis ut patriae sit idoneus utilis agris utilis and bellorum and pacis rebus agendis juv monday january         to the author of the plain dealer sir having lately met with an opportunity of looking back upon a complete set of your plain dealers the last paragraph in your paper of monday the  th of november puts me upon asking whether it would not be worth while to bestow an essay to show the honor as well as the profit of trade in order to remove that mistaken motion which possesses the minds of the indolent and unthinking part of our nobility and gentry that by engaging in trade they degrade themselves  you will easily prove the contrary since not only our credit at home but our power abroad is supported by it besides which the education necessary to qualify a man for a complete trader is such as becomes a gentleman of the first rank for he should be a proficient in languages history geography and mathematics and in order to be master of the improvements which may be made in every soil and climate he should know something of natural philosophy  he ought to be acquainted with the policy and government of all nations and though he does not immediately concern himself in the management of state affairs yet he should be qualified for a prime minister  our youth of title and gaiety are generally taken with the character of a soldier and it must be allowed a noble employment  especially when assumed in the defense of our country but then it may be remembered that the art of war was introduced through the corruption of mankind and is always attended with ruin and desolation  others who would appear more polite than their neighbors breed up their sons to practice the law  but i am sorry to say that this considered as a profession is is attended with consequencs as fatal to families as that is to nations  for though our seats of justice are filled with men from whom we may expect all that is equal and just yet by the turns and managements of the inferior practicers in those courts our approach to them is made so intricate and expensive that they who are obliged to sue for their own right in the common forms are frequently undone even though they obtain the verdict in their favor  thus the properties of the people are rendered precarious and many difficulties are put upon them in their pursuit of justice by those who pervert the true intention of the law and make that a dark mystery which being the rule of every mans actions should lie open and plain to his understanding  and here i cannot help mentioning a thing which though it seems but a trifle much be allowed to look like a very unreasonable hardship  the manner of making out and serving a subpoena in chancery  this is a small slip of parchment rolled up in a lump of wax and may chance to be served in the country upon a person who can hardly read the plainest english  when it comes to his hands perhaps at first he is afraid to break it open but if he proves hardy enough to do that he is not one jot the wiser for it is wrote in barbarous latin with odd unintelligble abbreviations and in a hand more resembling a set of hieroglyphics than the letters of a christian alphabet  the poor man thinking no harm lays it by till his convenience serves him to get it explained by the first great scholar he happens to meet with but in the mean time upon this delay out comes an attachment and so on to a writ of rebellion for no other reason than that a man who was bred to understand nothing but husbandry could not decypher a summons served upon him in a language he never heard of and a character which the parson of the parish might himself have been equally puzzled by  there are many other proceedings in the law of a like nature which if truly considered have methinks but an odd appearance in a country of so much boasted liberty  but if while we censure what seems thus unreasonable in the method of some of our lawpractices it should be alleged that notwithstanding all this it has produced many great and useful men i allow it  only it may be worth considering whether we have not more reason to be ashamed we stand in need of them than to boast that we have them and i will ask this plain question if that would not be esteemed a happier climate where there is no need of physicians than where the uncertainty or unwholesomeness of the air has encouraged so many of them to settle that you are sure of finding a good one in every street  i beg pardon for this digression but i was led into it by mentioning the law as a profession compared with that of the merchant in order to engage your more able pen to show at large how much one is preferrable to the other as well with respect to the honor as the usefulness that attends it  since all who raise their fortunes merely by the practice of the law or the success of the sword must necessarily do it upon the ruin of families and nations whereas the generous trader while he enriches himself is spreading benefits to all about him from whence we may infer that this is the employment most agreeable to the original design of our beings which was not to destroy but to comfort and cherish each other  moses was a great lawgiver and david was a warrior but solomon whom god was pleased to honor with still sublimer marks of his favor and to whom he gave the wisest and most understanding heart  so that there was none like him before neither should any rise after like unto him this solomon the greatest king the chosen people of god ever had was a merchant and sent fleets by way of the red sea to bring home gold from the east indies and what noble monuments did this prince leave behind him of his wisdom and his grandeur  but we have a living example in the czar a prince who has done more for the advantage of his country and his own glory by encouraing arts and sciences and improving every branch of trade in his dominions than by all the battles he has ever fought  in fine who has not observed that our own most gracious sovereign at the opening this present session of parliament recommended from the throne the encouragement of trade and navigation as the great means to support and establish us  if you think any of these hints can be of service to the public you may use them as you please  i am sir your very humble servant patricius jan   th       i am perfectly in the sentiments of the ingenious gentleman who sent me the foregoing letter  but the subject which he has recommended can never hope to succeed better than under the care of so able a hand as his own and for that reason i am very desirous of the continuance of his correspondence  the opinion that merchandising debases blood is a folly worthy only of the tribe to whom this gentleman imputes it  it is a truth too well known that the indolent and unthinking part of our nobility and gentry is a very large part of them but heaven be praised not at all a considerable one  they are a race of pleasant creatures who had the honor to be born for their own ease but for the entertainment of other people  they put me in mind of the innkeeper in the stratagem who was able at present to produce none of the good things his guests wanted but had the satisfaction of remembering that he could have furnished em all if they had dined with him last sunday  no matter how purblind a man of quality happens to be since he had a great grandfather that was sharp sighted he may be a fool too himself  but it ought to be scandalum magnatum to laugh at him  for he has proofs in the heralds office that his forefathers could act wisely  we have the comfort however to know that all our lords are not lords of trade if they were my correspondents excellent notions might be urged with an effect but illproportiond to their value and fall under the noble eye of not a few able ministers of the same stamp with a famous one in a late reign who when a certain knight a great trader presented him with a scheme for the improvement of commerce threw it back to him with a wise contempt and asked him whether he thought that men of his quality had nothing to do but to read papers  to the just and lively observation that a merchant ought to be qualified for a minister of state i will add this wish of my own  that we may never have a minister of state who is not qualified for a merchant  not trade alone but politics would soon feel the benefit of so new a regulation  yet there is a happiness still greater and it is the last the warmest hope of those to whose successful industry we owe our commerce  that the way might always lie open to the ear of our princes themselves without passing the narrow posterns which truth is often obliged to wait at till it has wearied it self to no purpose  the first remarkable start in the enlargement of the english traffic was made in the reign of our highspirited queen elizabeth and to what kind of measures it was owing may i presume be gathered without much difficulty from the following little story which i have taken out of sir walter raleighs discourse concerning the prerogative of parliaments  queen elizabeth would set the reason of her meanest subject against the authority of her greatest councellor by her patience herein she raised the ordinary customs of london above fifty thousand pounds a year without any new imposition  the lord treasurer burleigh the earl of leicester and secretary walsingham all three pensioners to customer smith joined to set themselves against a poor waiter of the customhouse called carwarden and commanded the grooms of the chamber not to give him admission  but the queen sent for him on a petition which he delivered into her hands and gave him countenance against them all  it would not serve the turn with her to be told by her great officers that she disgraced them by allowing her ear to the complaints of busy heads and that she dishonored her own dignity  she had always this to answer  that if men should complain unjustly against her ministers she knew well enough how to punish them  but if they had reason for the complaints they offered her she was queen of the small as well as of the great and would not suffer herself to be besieged by servants who could have no motive for wishing it but their interest in the oppression of others the plain dealer no    audit iter numeratque dies spatioque viarum metitur vitam  claud friday january         i think i have already informed my readers that i am a great lover of walking but i dont know whether i have yet acquainted them with a custom i have to look back from every rising ground i meet with in my perambulations and examine the change of prospect and the face and situation of the country i have left behind me  i have transplanted this good custom from my body into my mind which i have for some years past inured to make pauses now and then in life and reckon over its past stages and the uses i have adapted them to and this i sometimes do after a general and at other times in a more particular manner  the distinction of ages by solon into divisions of seven years is an example of the first kind and has something in it that is just and natural and uncommon enough to be worth translating  the seven first years of life mans break of day gleams of short sense a dawn of thought display when fourteen springs have bloomed his downy cheek his soft and blushful meanings learn to speak from twenty one proud manhood takes its date yet is not strength complete till twenty eight thence to his five and thirtieth lifes gay fire sparkles burns loud and flames in fierce desire at forty two his eyes grave wisdom wear and the dark future dims him over with care on to the nine and fortieth toils increase and busy hopes and fears disturb his peace at fifty six cool reason reigns entire then life burns steady and with temperate fire but sixty three unbinds the bodys strength ere the unwearied mind has run her length and when from seventy age surveys her last tired she stops sho t  and wishes all were past of the second and more particular kind i have met with no livelier example than that of the illustrious paulo paruta a noble venetian who was sent ambassador from his republic to pope clement the eighth and composed the following soliloquy during his residence at rome wherein he briefly examines the whole course of his past life  where am i what am i doing what am i designing  i am hastening already to the end of my life and have hardly so much as thought upon the end of my being  i am transported with that which i am not sure to possess a day and neglect to acquaint myself with what i must carry with me through eternity  age has naturally a power to afflict and mortify the body let it now exert a nobler influence and exalt and quicken my spirit  summon o my soul thy strayed and degenerate thoughts know the dignity of thy condition and let nothing proceed from thee but what may truly be worthy of thee  i fear if i make a scrutiny into the conduct of my life i shall disgrace my blushing reason by a recollection of my vanity  the tenderness of my infant years was too weak to afford matter that could merit my ages notice and yet the tears methinks which it was subject to might have forewarned me that i was entering upon a wilderness of misery  in the boyish years which succeeded childhood i drew in pleasure at my eyes and ears and gave my soul a tincture that prepared it for the impressions of future levity  riches honor and worldly greatness glittered on me from a lovely distance and retirement when i heard it talked of seemed stupidity or madness  these conceptions gathered strength as i advanced into riper life from the common consent of all men to practice and to praise as i did and that most among those who were reputed wisest and most happy  at my entrance into youth i applied myself to study  i delighted chiefly in rhetoric and philosophy and having the good fortune to meet with excellent masters i made a swift and unusual progress  yet i cannot help confessing that it added fuel to my native pride it inflamed me with a thirst of praise and served to countenance that selflove which stood in need of no incentive  knowledge is apt to puff up its possessors  i dare not say i possessed it but if i should be asked what fruit i reaped by my studies i think i might venture to answer that philosophy if it did not teach me truth awakened and prepared me to receive it  for a while i was very earnest in the study of morality and delighted in it so much that i published a treatise on that subject and afterward when i was come to mans estate i composed in obedience to my fathers particular command an elaborate history of my country  but while i labored to contribute toward the glory of other men i pleased myself with a flattering prospect that i too by those my labors should have a place in the temple i was building and live in my fame many ages after my death absurd extravagance of erring vanity  as if what is nothing in itself could gather an existence from the opinions of others  next i gave myself wholly up to the service and government of my country and found my way so plain and easy that i soon attained great honors and helped to fill the foremost employments  but alas what boast is this  am i not sensible that not only the most busy but even the most pleasing of my present thoughts will vanish like a silent shadow  all these dignities and distinctions these state bustles and negotiations with which my mind is so gloriously encumbered will dissolve like smoke into the wind or be withered like flowers by the beams of that sun which cherished them  yet unstable as these phantasms are and as i know them to be i must meditate on them only my thoughts however reluctant must at all times and in all places give way to the imaginary importance of these proud chimeras and abandon the contemplation of things intrinsically noble  alas how hard it is to serve two masters of opposite meanings my reason and my pride seem to have divided me between them  pride teaches me to measure my actions with regard only to outward appearances by which men rather seem happy than are so  but reason is always whispering me that patience humility mediocrity and selfdenial are the roads which lead to felicity  as i approached to old age i grew more and more sensible on which of these two sides truth lay but i persisted even against conviction and sacrificed my peace and rest to careful power and splendid misery  what then do i wish  what is it that i am expecting  if i know that my pursuits are follies what hinders but that i change them  if after having wasted the vigor of my life without advantage from such applications i am less satisfied than when i began to live am i weak enough to hope that while i myself do not change the very nature of things should alter shall disappointment turn to delight because i am fondly in love with pleasure  or shall a world that produces nothing but cares be taught hereafter to abound with comforts that i only may be indulged with new and unnatural satisfaction  look out my soul upon these ruins that are every where spread round thee this was once that aweful rome the queen of the dependant world  where is now her unbounded influence where the majesty of her empire where are her treasures her triumphs and the dreadful consequences of a thousand victories  are they not the prey of death and time do they not lie buried in these heaps of ruin  and shall thou be fond of glory  thou who can look down with pity on the desolation of a power that drew a chain about the world  shall thou presume to pride thyself in honors or distinctions or grow vain upon the little preference of a light and momentary dignity  no  thou who have duration and stability thou who shall endure unwasting through the changes of eternity consider better the true rate of things and proportion thy desire to their value  if they are not of real worth why then have thou loved them  why endeavourst thou to retain them why art thou shaken at a prospect of thy losing them  or grant they have in them any thing that may be called a real good why at least is it not remembered for how short a time thou can possess them  a thousand ways these worldly benefits have it in their very nature to deceive us  while we suppose their increase the only means to make us happy we insensibly become miserable for we fix our minds so intently upon the little we yet want that we continue dead to the enjoyment of all that we were before possessed of  the fear of losing what we have already got has a power to impoverish vulgar minds as effectually as if they really possessed nothing and a greater vexation than this the humane soul is not capable of being tormented by  because as the misery is imaginary it is boundless and as it drew its evil from depravity it can receive no cure from reason  strange perverseness of our nature  we have our happiness within ourselves and are always seeking it abroad  we have our miseries remote and without and yet are for ever smarting inward and transplanting tortures to ourselves which have no roots but in our diligence to excite and nourish our own mischiefs  if we feed the soul with meat which is not proper to her nature what wonder that she pines and can never be satisfied  but i perceive while i praise mary i am imitating martha  i discern the right way but i choose to travel in the wrong till i have lost my self in its intricate windings  i am troubled and busied with many things though i know well enough that there is but one of em sincerely necessary  i am birdlimd by the tempting world  i am given over to a variety of solicitous and grinding cares which i hug like blessings to my bosom and am softened more and more into an affection and partiality for them  the love and gratitude i owe my friends  the hopes and fears and touching tenderness with which i think of my wife and children  domestic and private economy and the weightier concerns of the government of the commonwealth press my thoughts on every side and afflict me with purposes diametrically opposite to each other  fain would i free my soul and restore her to her liberty from these passions which confine and torture her but i neither know how nor when to resolve it  yet am i comforted however that i feel in myself a strong desire to exert the prerogative of my reason since i consider it as a sign that though i am not able to do well i retain the principles of welldoing  the plain dealer no    hoc habet animus argumentum suae divinitatis quod illum divina delectant  sen monday january         to the author of the plaindealer sir if you think this may deserve a place in one of your papers insert it if not deal plainly and commit it to the flames and either way you will oblige  yours etc   the wise author of nature gave us passions for a noble end and to defend us from excess our understandings were conferred to regulate them and least all should prove deficient out of his overflowing goodness he enriched us with a revelation  the eternal truths of the christian religion cast a shade upon the finest and most exalted productions of humane literature which remark has been frequently brought as a defense of its divine original and is really a very strong argument for who can imagine that without supernatural assistance men of ordinary condition unassisted by the lights or improvements of learning should be able in various languages to lay down such invaluable principles a multitude of which were vastly preferrable to any that had been introduced by the most penetrating of the heathen philosophers  socrates plato epictetus and several others have thought and written so well that their memories deserve to be highly respected but what nobler and inimitable morals how extensive and yet adapted to all abilities have descended to us in the divine collections  i have often with no small concern lamented that the study of the scriptures is so little relished i had like to have said so much despised in in comparison of the pagan writers  in the schools to open an aquaintance with the politest of the classicks is undoubtedly a commendable outset but to be taught a greater admiration of them than of the prophets and inspired writers is an extreme and one that is more than ordinary criminal  how common is it to hear persons expressing their utmost fondness for the former whilst the last is seldom mentioned or however with much indifference there are sublime sentiments in the greek and latin authors  but there is something too which i cannot forbear to take notice of that their characters were seldom suitable  one proof of which assertion we may borrow from plutarchs life of cato even that cato who was famous for the rigid stubbornness of his morality  when his domestics were worn out with hard labor or grown past it through increase of age he would dismiss them and show no tokens of further regard or humanity on which plutarch has left us this reflection that we are not to use unfortunate wretches who depend on us as we do our old shoes or platters and throw them away when they are broken and fall to pieces in our service  but if it were for nothing better than to express the respect we have for the humane nature a man ought always to cherish in himself a kind and compassionate disposition  but not to digress farther there are infinitely sublimer sentiments in the sacred writings and the lives of their authors shone illustrious examples of their doctrine  how becoming a great soul is the lord gave and the lord has taken away blessed be the name of the lord  again what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil  how happy would it be for mankind if they would feel and apply to their practice the glorious commands of our redeemer to do nothing but as we would be done by to exercise our benignity even toward those who hate and who persecute us this proposition is contemned by too many though we have it so strongly recommended not only by the words but by the practice of him who died for our salvation besides as you have observed in one of your plain dealers a return of good offices for injuries is indeed the sharpest revenge for by such a conduct we triumph over confound and disgrace a malicious enemy as by a contrary management we seem to justify as well as inflame him  in fine there are a beautiful variety of instructions in holy writ which can never be paralleled they manifest their heavenly original and if we make em our delight will alleviate all earthly calamity and furnish an infallible remedy for every accident that can befall us i designed now to have ended but recollecting that there are some who have little faith in revelation i will go on a line or two farther  suppose we grant their inconsistent hypothesis yet still it is our interest to direct ourselves by the measures of revealed religion because it is the truest friend to humane nature and promotes nothing which is not conducive to our quiet and wellbeing so that allowing it were not our duty it is however our prudence to comply with so excellent and even so agreeable a model  so far i have entertained my readers with some reflections for which i am obliged to an unknown hand on a subject whereon much has already been written with less effect than might reasonably have been expected from the force and clearness of the arguments  if i am not mistaken that disrelish of the sacred writings which my correspondent complains of though i hope it is far from universal among us may be imputed to the low spirit and flat obsolete expression of the coarse english they are translated in  i leave it says an excellent modern critic to our prelates and pastors to consider whether since they are satisfied that there is a necessity for a numerous style in some parts of our public worship they ought to remain contented with the vile versions now in use and suffer the most lofty and most pathetick ideas of religion to be burlesqud in our churches  which is all one as if they should dress up a bishop in some antickhabit and expose him every sunday in that merry garb to raise the veneration of the people  it is finely observed and indeed undeniably demonstrated by the same gentleman in his grounds of criticism in poetry that as the great characteristick of poetry is passion and the strongest and most moving passions flow most naturally from religious ideas for this reason chiefly the ancient poetry where their religion had its most powerful influence has so visibly the advantage over the modern which is for the most part light profane and contemptible and for the same reason too the poetry of the hebrews which the old testament is every where filled with excelled that of the ancient greeks and romans  there are numberless instances in the psalms and among the prophets and indeed throughout all parts of the old and new testaments of a sublimity that exalts the humane soul and shakes it with a much stronger degree of terror and admiration than any the most noble strokes of rapturous enthusiasm which can be met with even in homer himself  what a collection of dreadful images are thrown together in the eighteenth psalm to describe the majesty of god descending in the fullness of his power  the earth trembles  the foundations of the hills are shaken  he bows the heavens and comes down  and darkness is under his feet all this is animated and wonderful  but what follows is a conception of so immense and terrible a grandeur that our vulgar translation seems unpardonable for the manifest injustice it has done the meaning then the channels of the waters were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered  but see how this ought to have appeared in the noble dress which mr dennis has given it  still darkness ushered his mysterious way and a black night of congregated clouds became the dark pavillion of his throne earth upwards from the gaping center cleavd and barred the fixed foundations of the world a sight that blasted even the worlds great eye and made the starting sun recoil from his eternal way what comes nearest to this is that famous passage in the xxth iliad of homer to which also the gentleman just named has given the finest translation it ever met with mean while majestic neptune from below the reeling globe with his huge trident struck mount ida trembled from his hoary top and from his nethermost foundations shook pluto starts frighted from his burning throne and striking his infernal breast cries out least such another stroke should rend the globe and on his pale dominions let in day   the hebrew prophets abound everywhere with ideas so sublimely enthusiastic that they transport and carry away the reader with a power that is resistless and worthy of the god who is honored by them  among these the description of that desolation from the east which was prophesied against the jews by habakkuk as we see it in his first chapter has something in it so strongly painted and so terrible that it strikes us through the most unornamented simplicity with a force that was never excelled by all the elaborate productions of poetry  i will raise up the chaldeans that bitter and fierce nation and they shall march through the breadth of the land  they are terrible and their horses are swifter than leopards and fiercer than evening wolves  they shall come on and fly with violence as an eagle that hastens to eat  their faces shall drink up like the east wind and they shall gather the captivity as sand  the fourth chapter of the same prophet is one continued height of the divinest elevation and i shall insert the whole succession of its matchless images as a proof how truly it has been observed by the gentleman who sent me the foregoing letter that there are infinitely sublimer sentiments in the sacred writers than in any of the most celebrated classick authors  at israels call the almightys thunder hurled from parans summit shook the astonished world frowning provoked his threatening wrath flamed high and earths dim regions gleamd beneath his eye poised in his undetermined hands he bore judgments heaped horn and mercys struggling store near him pale death in shadowy triumph trod and pressed with ghastly signs the doomful nod keen from beneath his feet red lightnings broke and the veiled mountain shook in clouds of smoke he stood  and while the measured world he eyed the starting nations dropped their warlike pride highboasting cushan struck her tents with shame and midian groaned beneath repented fame he stepped  and from their old foundations rent the everlasting hills before him bent he marched  and all the uprooted mountains stray and roll in earthquakes to escape his way fastfollwing from their chasms a thousand tides spout a wished deluge over their frighted sides back swelled the roaring sea his face to fly and in oe trembling billow scaled the sky conscious of wrath divine the sun grew pale and over distinction cast a dusky veil this when i hear chill frosts my heart overspread and my lips quiver with the rising dread trembling and sunk my limbs i faintly draw and my bones crumble with ideal awe i shall close my paper with the words of a gentleman whom i have already once or twice named in it  if harmony says he is of itself so efficacious what must it not be when incorporated with a religious sense  there can certainly be no better way to reformation than the reading of those writings which we believe to be divinely inspired but it is equally certain that the greater the pleasure is with which we read them the oftener we shall discharge that duty and to make us read them with more pleasure they must have more of the harmony and force of their originals  this would attract the gentry and persons of the most extraordinary parts whose examples would influence the rest for persons of the most extraordinary parts being extremely delighted with poetry and finding the most exalted poetry upon religious subjects would by degrees become more used to be moved by sacred than profane ideas and in consequence would be reformed  the plain dealer no    suave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis et terra magnum alterius spectare laborem  luc friday january         the sea is the most vast of all the visible objects of nature and when the wind adds disturbance and motion to its immensity there is nothing that seems so dreadfully proportioned to the greatness of its almighty creator  yet as the art of the painter gives us a sensible delight from the representation of prospects of creatures or of actions which in their natures are productive of horror so we are never more pleased by any descriptions in poetry than by those which set before us the strongest and liveliest pictures of shipwrecks and storms at sea whether it is that the soul exults and prides its self in a consciousness of its own capacity to move and conceive so greatly  or that we derive a sharper taste and enjoyment of our own safety from a comparison with those represented dangers  all the poets ancient and modern have been fond of raising tempests wherein for the most part their own time has been castaway for they have scattered and weakened the terror they designed to increase by throwing together all the images that occurred rather than selecting the most essential and impressive by means of which perplexing and inconsistent variety their readers imagination finds relief from not clearly discerning their object through the dust which they have raised about it  it has been observed by the admirers of homer that there is a similitude between his manner of thinking and that of david and solomon and others of the hebrew writers who owed their excellence to the inspiration of the holy spirit  meethinks this remark which is much to the honor of that immortal greek may gather some new force if we consider homers description of a tempest which longinus was so justly charmed with and compare it with that of david in the  0 th psalm which has often been mentioned with wonder by the critics of our own and foreign nations  both the versions are new but both the originals are inimitable  i begin with that of the psalmist  they who in ships the seas vast depths descend and over the watery world their passage bend they more than all their gods great works discern and midst the unfathomed deep his wonders learn there from smooth calms on sudden storms they rise hang on the horrid surge and skim the skies now high as heaven they climb their dreadful way now sink in gulphy slants and lose the day giddy they reel to shoot the frightful steep and their souls melt amid the sounding sweep helpless they cling to what supports them first and over em feel the breaking billows burst then to their last almighty hope they cry who hears and marks them with a pitying eye he bids the storm be hushed  the winds obey and the awed waves in silence shrink away now follows homer with a terror and a majesty which leave it almost doubtful to which of these great poets the victory should be ascribed but certain beyond all question  that no other has equaled either of them  over the broad sea the driving tempest spreads and sounding surges swell their sweeping heads upwards immense the liquid mountains flow and shade the distant ship that climbs below down her washed decks the whitening foam rolls over and the big blasts through bursting canvas roar back shrink the sailors from the briny grave and see pale death press close on every wave we see here no time lost in enumerating little particulars all the great and striking circumstances are thrown forward in their proper lights but nothing is added that can either diminish or distract the apprehension  i have placed these two admirable descriptions thus opposite to each other that some of our fashionable applauders of homer may see his sublimity more than matched in the works of a poet they have seldom heard of and that they who are justly his admirers may find cause to esteem him yet more by observing how near he comes to one whom od was pleased after a peculiar manner to inspire and delight in  while i am upon this subject it falls naturally in my way to recollect a letter that was lately sent me by a gentleman who writ the particulars of the story from the mouth of a person who was himself an eyewitness  to the author of the plain dealer wills coffeehouse cornhill sir you appear by some of your writings to be so heartily a lover of the trade and prosperity of your country that i persuade my self you must of necessity be a wellwisher to the honest sailors a set of men who at the continual hazard of their lives contribute their toil and their skill to the power and grandeur of the nation and who allowing themselves no leisure for luxury furnish means notwithstanding to maintain the luxury of other people  the sailors to be short are a race of openhearted gallant thinkers who retain the plainness the uncorrupted sincerity and blunt species of virtue which distinguished our forefathers and which old england has so often triumphed by in times whose customs we rather admire than imitate  whatever therefore relates in a very extraordinary manner to the good or ill fortune of any of this useful and worthy race of your kindred plain dealers i promise my self you will take pleasure to distinguish by allowing it a place in your paper  the ship bouevia of london of burden about   0 tun captain brooks commander set sail from the coast of holland on the   th of november last having two pilots one english and the other dutch and his wife was on board with him  the day had been fair and clear but in the evening about six it blew hard at south and by west the gale increased into a violent storm and continued for about seven hours veering to the west and north and by west during which the ship was stranded off of enchuysen in the texel  in order to save themselves if possible the men all got into the longboat and were just ready to put off but not having their captain among them they called to him to hasten down because the sea ran so high that it broke over the boat and endangered her beating to pieces against the side of the stranded vessel  the captain in this nice and perilous point of time recollecting that his wife was seasick in the cabin could not bear the ungerous thought of endeavoring to save himself without her and was earnestly laboring to bring her along with him  but she who had heard the men cry out that the boat would sink under the weight of two persons more embraced him passionately and refused to go  she wept and told him in the most moving manner that a woman in such an extremity would prove a dangerous encumbrance she implored him not to think of dividing his care but to employ it all for preservation of his single life much dearer to her than her own was  for some time he pressed her in vain but prevailed with her at length to come up with him upon deck where the first observation they made was that the boat was out of sight having been beaten off by the force of the swell that rose between her and the vessel  he was gazing speechless on her face in a despair which he found no words to utter when a billow breaking over the midship washed him headlong into the sea and left her shrieking and alone behind him in a condition so far less supportable than his that after a succession of the bitterest outcries she fell forward in a swoon and sunk senseless after him  the boat in the mean time endeavored to return to the ship and passing providentially near their captain who was yet faintly swimming the men discerned him in the sea and took him up quite spent and speechless in which condition they laid him in the bottom of the boat and coming along the ships side one of the sailors looking up saw something like a woman with her arms and clothes entangled in the shrouds  this woman was the captains wife who in the moment of her falling forward had been saved and supported against that part of the rigging  she was still in a swoon and insensible but so beloved by the mariners that they redoubled their efforts to get aboard that they might have it in their power to save her and they were so fortunate in their humanity that they found means to lift her into the boat where they laid her dead in all appearance by her husband who was in the same condition  they put off again and with great difficulty got ashore upon one of the islands in the texel where the captain coming to himself told his men that they would have done more kindly had they let him perish in the sea since the life they had forced upon him must for ever be embittered by the memory of her unhappy end for whose sake only he had thought it worth wishing for  his wife was now recovering and near enough to hear and answer this noble instance of his tenderness  they flew astonished and quite lost in exstacy into each others arms  and it is easier to imagine than describe what they thought and said on so transporting an occasion  let me only add that this relation was faithfully taken from the mouth of a gentleman who was an eyewitness of the miraculous and providential particulars  i am  sir your most humble servant g  b  r   the plain dealer no    sed neque quam multae species and nomine quae sint est numerus  virgil monday january         sir since my misfortune arises only from my having succeeded to the fullest point of my own and my friends wishes i know not how in conscience i can expect your pity but be that as it will my case is somewhat extraordinary and i shall fairly state it with the purpose of serving as a buoy for the warning of others  you must know sir i was left an orphan under the tuition of a rich uncle who promised to settle his whole estate upon me at the day of my marriage and that he might not cramp me in my choice a folly too frequently attending the caprices of old age the only article he insisted on was a woman of strict virtue  a condition so very reasonable was sure to meet with an easy compliance and i so punctually and exactly observed it that from the overflowing of my wifes virtue my happiness lies under water  whatever mismanagement or folly she happens to be guilty of she can immediately set to rights by the counterpoize of her chastity and i have no sooner opened my mouth than she hits me in the teeth with her virtue the conscious good fortune of coming off without cuckoldom is it seems a cordial preparative that can defend a husbands palate against the bitter taste of arrogance pride vanity ill nature and the rest of that long catalogue which female purity is pleased sometimes to arm it self withal against the danger of worldly temptations  i shall content my self with mentioning a few instances that lately happened upon the heels of one another  amongst many neighbors in the country i can boast but of one friend with whom i live in the greatest intimacy  he was one day at dinner with me and said occasionally in a laughing way that there might possibly be other faults in a wife as insupportable as adultery at this my lucretias chastity flew out at her mouth and eyes  the spirit of honesty came upon her and she threw the spoons and salts at his head till her virtue remained triumphant and she had driven her antagonist from table  while this storm was in the air there could be little quiet under its influences so i judiciously retired to a farmhouse where i had been recovering my self about a week when a messenger came with tidings that my spotless spouse having heard as illluck would have it that the nurse to my only child was a bastard had turned her away at a minutes warning and killed the child in three days after by persisting in a resolu to wean it from a milk of so wicked an original upon this melancholy account i hurried home where i had the comfort to be convinced that i ought by no means to be sorry for the death of my child since my wifes virtue was yet alive and her modesty preserved inviolate  now sir what is to be done in such a case  i would tell her if i durst nay i will if you are so kind as to stand by me that the virtue of a mans wife will never atone for the loss of his friend and that her chastity is the worst remedy she could have thought on to supply the loss of a son and heir  nay if she should not believe me i am determined if you think there may be no danger in it to let her alone to try the experiment  sir i have fairly told you my story and beg you will expatiate upon the subject pray give a little of your seasonable advice to these professors of grace without gracefulness  persuade em if you can to consider that a wifes chastity is in the nature of laudanum to her husband a just quantity promotes rest  too little occasions restlessness and too much gives convulsive ravings  such a desperate old gentleman as you are may venture to say too that continency by constitution is rather a happiness than a virtue and that a wife who sets up her chastity as a specific to cure all uneasinesses is more insupportable than a quack who can cure only the toothache and maintains for that reason that the stone the gout and the consumption are distempers of no consequence  yours j w   instead of complying with the request of my correspondent and coming in to his assistance against so impenetrable a championess i shall add to his complaint as just a one of my own  that i too lose my rest by women  what they do or what they suffer is for ever invading and overwhelming my purposes  their charms and their mischefs press in upon me from town and country  the post groans as we do under the burden of their vanities  but what i think ought to be reckoned among my sufferings not deserved is  that it often costs me a groat to read one of their secret histories not worth a halfpenny my intelligencers from remote quarters make no manner of conscience in their correspondence with me  for while they charge the follies they acquaint me with upon those to whom they belong they take care to charge the postage upon a person who is wholly innocent  i was lately in despair of working any reformation upon offenders who possess the power of bewitching those who examine them but there came to my hands some time since a short treatise in manuscript subscribed by seven ladies its authors who entitle themselves the order of angels into this order they tell me they propose to admit all the believing fair which if they do they can never fail of a most comprehensive establishment the business they are to be admitted for is to learn it seems to conceive after a new manner so as to be brought to bed of themselves and by virtue of such new birth be made kings and priests to god and become what all the best of them were at first created by the lord to be real blessed heavenly angels  these being the words of the ladies treatise i am restored to some degree of hope and shall shortly form a resolution to disburthen myself of a care i am unequal to and deliver over the whole sex into the hands of these able undertakers  mean while here are three letters  the first is a mortifying proof that avarice can teach women of fortune to think as poorly as the lowest of their species and the second and third relate to a grievance almost too common to be worth complaining of i should not therefore have inserted these two but for the sake of a rhetorical figure in the last concerning a snail whereby i have been able to gather that the person accused is less pardonable for having no money than for having no conscience or generosity  to the plaindealer sir i have been so unhappy for this great while as to indulge a passion for a young lady in whom i thought i might reasonably promise my self an agreeable companion and a virtuous wife but alas how vain and uncertain are all our hopes a near relation of mine who married her sister by errors and misfortunes which generally go together is well nigh reduced which i am too sensible has created a prejudice to our family my present circumstances are such as i think could not well be excepted against but am so well acquainted with the effects of prejudice that i dare not hazard revealing my mind fearing it may totally debar me the satisfaction which i sometimes but alas seldom enjoy of being in her company  as she is your constant reader the incerting this in one of your papers may very possibly incite her to pity him who loves too well to dare to offend hoping fortune may some time offer the happy means of possessing her the only object of my desires excuse this trouble  i am yours etc   good mr plain dealer a distressed kinswoman of mine desires you would be pleased to insert the epistle enclosed which i received from her by the last post in your next paper if possible for a public warning to our unguarded sex and if you would take upon you to warn these unthinking monsters the men by describing the heinousness of their crime you would do a laudable act and worthy your self for men of this complexion are become so daring of late that none but a plain dealer dare meddle with them  i am your constant admirer e a   dear cousin you might too justly have condemned my folly if it had not been too too severely punished already i am therefore to entreat you to lay by your anger least you still aggravate my too rigid fate and lend a compassionate ear to this doleful tragedy and consider withal that it is i  your near relation who bear the principal and insupportable part in it no hopes remain  to speak at once the unwilling truth and utter all my disgrace  i have been betrayed betrayed by gaudy outside expecting wedlock and a wealthy spouse but confusion seize him  the snail carries his all upon his back  nor is this all the upbraiding consequence too plainly appears  the consequence  that swells the tide of all my woe  i can no more  let others who are free learn from my woes to shun the alluring bait and least such treachery should be any longer a secret dear cousin let me as a small recompense for this long train of evils have the poor pleasure of being a warning to others and to that intent i humbly entreat that you would get this publicly printed the first opportunity and forgive the error of  your much afflicted till death but loving cousin z h  ps do not forget to have this printed     the plain dealer no  0 unusquisque sua noverit ire via  propert friday january         to the plaindealer sir in return for that pleasure with which i have read your abridgment of parutas soliloquy in one of your late papers i send you an abstract from a much more modern treatise entitled an enquiry into the nature of society wherein the author has considered hypocrisy as it is the effect of our common selflove in a manner that is equally new and delightful and with a penetration as remarkable as the pleasantry of his images  in short his descriptions appear to me so full of nature wit and liveliness that i believe they cannot fail to give great pleasure to your readers and for that reason i have transcribed what follows and send it you for their entertainment  they says this too near observer who have never taken notice of the conversation of a spruce mercer and a young lady his customer who comes to his shop have neglected a scene of life that is very entertaining  his business is to sell as much silk as he can at a price by which he shall get what he proposes  as to the lady what she would be at is to please her fancy and buy cheaper by a groat or sixpence a yard than the things she wants are commonly sold at  from the impression the gallantry of our sex has made upon her she imagines that she has a fine mein and easy behavior and a peculiar sweetness of voice  that she is handsome and if not beautiful at least more agreeable than most young women she knows  as she has no pretensions to purchase things with less money than other people except those which are built on her good qualities so she sets herself off to the best advantage her wit and discretion will let her  the thoughts of love are here out of the case so on one hand she has no room for playing the tyrant and giving herself angry or peevish airs and on the other she has more liberty of speaking kindly and being affable than she can have on almost any other occasion  she knows that abundance of wellbred people come to his shop and endeavors to render herself as amiable as virtue and the rules of decency allow of  before her coach is yet quite stopped she is approached by a gentlemanlike man who has every thing clean and fashionable about him and who in low obeisance pays her homage and hands her into the shop  there immediately he slips from her and through a byeway that remains visible only for half a moment with great address entrenches himself behind the counter whence facing her with a profound reverence he begs the favor of knowing her commands  let her say and dislike what she pleases she can never be directly contradicted she deals with a man in whom consummate patience is one of the mysteries of his trade whatever trouble she creates she is sure to hear nothing but the most obliging language and has always before her a cheerful countenance where joy and respect seem to be blended with good humor and altogether make up an artificial serenity more engaging than untaught nature is able to produce  when two persons are so well met the conversation must be very agreeable as well as extremely mannerly though they talk about trifles while she remains irresolute what to take he seems to be the same in advising her but when once she has chosen he immediately becomes positive that it is the best of the sort he continues to extol her fancy and the oftener he looks upon it the more he wonders that he should not before have discovered the preeminence of it over any thing he has in his shop  he founds her capacity finds out her blindside and by fifty little stratagems makes her overvalue her own judgment as well as the commodity she would purchase  the greatest advantage he has over her lies in the most material part of the commerce between them the debate about the price which he knows to a farthing and she is wholly ignorant of therefore he no where more egregiously imposes on her understanding but though he has here the liberty of telling what lies he pleases as to the prime cost and the money he has refused yet he trusts not to them only he attacks her vanity and makes her believe the most incredible things in the world concerning his weakness and her own superior abilities  he had taken a resolution he says never to part with that piece under such a price  but she has the power of talking him out of his purposes he protests must lose by her but since she seems to have a fancy for it and is resolved to give no more rather than disoblige a lady he has so extraordinary a value for he will let her have it  only begs that another time she will not stand so hard with him  in the mean time the buyer who knows that she is no fool and has a voluble tongue is easily persuaded that she has a very winning way of talking and thinking it sufficient for the sake of goodbreeding to disown a sense of her merit in some witty repartee she swallows very contentedly the substance of every thing he has told her and the upshot is that with the satisfaction of having saved ninepence a yard she has bought her silk exactly at the same price as any body else might have had it for  it is possible that this lady for want of being sufficiently flattered or for a fault she is pleased to find in his behavior or perhaps in the tying of his neckcloth or for some other dislike as substantial may be lost and her custom bestowed on some other of the fraternity but where many of them live in a cluster it is not easily determined which shop to go to and the reasons some of the fairsex have for their choice are often very whimsical and and kept as a great secret  among the mercers a fairdealer must keep before his own door and to draw in random customers make use of no other importunity than an obsequious air and a bow to every welldressd female that offers to look toward his shop  but i have seen another method o inviting customers the most distant in the world from what i have been speaking of  i mean that which is practiced by the watermen on those whom by their mien and garb they know to be no londoners  it is pleasant to see half a dozen of these tritons surround a man whom they never saw in their lives before and two of them who can get nearest clapping each an arm over his neck hug him as familiarly as if he was their brother newly returned from an east india voyage a third lays hold of his hand  another of his sleeve  his coat  the buttons of it  or any thing he can come at while a fifth or a sixth who has scamperd twice round him already without being able to get at him plants himself directly before the man in hold and within three inches of his nose contradicting his rivals with an openmouthed cry shows him a dreadful set of large teeth and a remainder of bread and cheese which the country mans arrival had hindered him from swallowing  at all this no offense is taken the peasant thinks they are making much of him and therefore far from opposing them he patiently suffers himself to be pushed or pulled which way they direct  he has not delicacy to find fault with their dirt and sweat for he has been used to it from his cradle and it is no disturbance to him to hear half a score people some of them at his ear and the farthest not five foot from him bawl out as if he was a hundred yards distant  he is conscicious that he makes no less noise when he is merry himself and is secretly pleased with their boisterous usage the hawling and pulling him about he construes as a courtship which he can feel and understand and he cannot help wishing them well for the esteem they seem to have for him  he loves to be taken notice of and admires the londoners for being so earnest in their desires to serve him for the value of threepence whereas in the country he must first tell people what he wants and though he lays out three or four shillings he has hardly a word spoke to him unless it is in answer to the questions he is forced to ask them this alacrity in his behalf moves his gratitude to all the watermen and being unwilling to disoblige any he knows not which of them to pitch upon  i have seen a man think all this or something like it as plainly as the nose in his face and move along all the while very contentedly under a load of solicitors carrying down to the waterside with a smiling countenance seven or eight stone more than his own weight  there is something so strongly touched so picturesque and so diverting in these two descriptions that i could not resist the temptation i was under to send em you with my request that you would publish them in one of your plain dealers where if i am not mistaken they will make a very agreeable figure  i am sir your constant reader and humble servant terentius   the plain dealer no     furit alter amore manil nascentes morimur finisque ab origin pendet ibid monday february        in the decision of that important question what is strongest which we read of in the sacred writings love and death stand out distinguished and two of my correspondents have given me an opportunity of placing both these invincible powers in full view near one another a position which like the contraste observed in the poetry or painting of judicious masters sets off and throws forward every object by its opposite and rounds and raises to the eye what without such artful disposition might be lost and lie too flat to catch the notice of a slight remarker  i shall introduce the lovers letter by a reflection concerning the impossibility of describing love and the benefits which society owes this passion from a poetical picture of it which i have more than once made mention of in the course of these papers the roughest passions gently learn to move and savage hearts are humanizd by love love in a chain of converse bound mankind and polished and awaked the rugged mind pity truth justice openness of heart courage politeness eloquence and art that generous fire with which ambition flames and all the unsleeping souls divinest aims touched by a beam from love burn up more bright proud of the godlike power to give delight thus have i vainly tried with strokes too faint love in his known and outward marks to paint forgetful that of old they veiled his face and wisely covered what they could not trace lovely creator of my souls soft pain pity the pencil that aspires in vain versed in love pangs and taught his power by you skilled i presumed that what i felt i drew but i have erred  and with delirious aim would picture motion and imprison flame he who can lightnings flash to colors bind may paint loves influence on the lovers mind   to the plain dealer sir ever since you have obliged the world with your paper i have taken a great deal of pleasure in reading it such just sentiments and your peculiar method of plain dealing must charm the intelligent and give satisfaction to every one who is susceptible of tenderness and good nature  among the subjects which you have cursorily touched on love that heavenly passion notwithstanding your grand climacteric seems to claim a considerable share in your composition else how could you so tenderly express your self concerning the affair of lucinda with what energy did you discourse humanity appeared in every word and i believe it impossible for the most ardent lover to speak of love with greater emotion than you did in that beautiful plain dealer  i have for some time been in love with a woman invested with all the graces which accomplish the sex and as i am entirely devoted to that passion when i read that paper of lucinda i felt within me something new that argued still for love something so natural so moving that it was impossible for one in my circumstance to withstand it the opinion i had already conceived of my beautiful disturber heightened by a growing and virtuous passion made me a thousand times delight my self with an imagination that my emilia resembled lucinda the love i bear this most agreeable woman has so deeply rooted it self in my heart that neither time nor accident can eradicate it  all my thoughts center in her and when absent from her i have lost the soul that animates my life and my mind is as effectually dead as my body will be when i am no more and shall have learnt the power of forgetting her  my passion for this dear creature has been sometime dormant about two years ago my affairs obliged me to go abroad when our acquaintance was but little cultivated yet an infant passion even then made me solely her admirer such beauty goodnature wit and lively conversation as are rarely to be met with in one person so captivated me that i could think of nothing but the dear emilia  when i returned home my passion increased daily insomuch that at this time i am a stranger to every thing in the world but love and emilia without her i shall be the most unhappy man alive  i dread the thoughts of her being unkind and heaven grant they may be groundless  i have declared my passion to her and if i dont flatter my self she appears to have some regard for me this you will readily conclude gives me hope but alas i fear too or i should be no lover  our circumstances are very different and we seem in this case only to be diffident in one another as for my part a genteel employment is the only fortune i have to trust to and therefore according to the laudable custom of bargain and sale in the affair of marriage i am afraid i have too little plea that way yet she is entirely at her own disposal and can without asking any body leave make me the happiest man on earth  dear mr plain dealer as you have been an advocate for lucinda i beg a little of your assistance what must i do without her i am inevitably lost and am afraid it may be so if you dont intervene with your good advice i beg you to publish this in your next it may have some effect on the dear emilia i am almost persuaded she does not hate me and yet when i reflect on the mercenary ways of the world i am plunged into the utmost despair  sir as you are a man of reason make not light of my condition but exert your self to assist me i am afraid i have exceeded the bounds of a letter pray correct the mistakes in sense i forget every thing but the dear emilia  angels protect her and make her kind your advice how to proceed will be very grateful and your publishing this save me a great deal of confusion for she will know it comes from me by a declaration in it which none else can perceive  i am sir your constant reader and humble servant c k   there is no spectacle more profitably terrible than that of a man who lies expiring his soul on his deathbed  to see how the spirits shrink inward and retire to the heart which is beating with convulsive anguish while the hands and feet its most remote dependancies are first incoldend to a fashioned clay as if death crept in at the nails and would by surprise from both extremes make sure of the vital center  the mind would fain utter it self but the organs of the voice are so debilitated that it cannot the eyes now settle to a dim fixedness which but a little before was as swift as the shoots of lightning as nimble as thought and as bright as the polished diamond the countenance through which perhaps there shined a lovely majesty even to the captivating of admiring souls is altered into frightful paleness and the languor of a ghastly stillness  the tongue is silent which commanded a family nay perhaps a kingdom and kept every thing in awe with the importance of its motion  the form that was yesterday so graceful is now become a thing so full of horror that children are afraid to look upon it and must therefore be transmitted from its pleasures and its passions  from all the scences of its enchanting blandishments to a dark and silent grave  there is even the difference of two several worlds betwixt a king enameled with his robes and jewels sitting in his imperial state and his posture figure and condition when consigned to his six foot of royalty to his box of everlasting obscurity and yet this change is without any visible substantial diminution all the limbs remain perfect as they were without dislocation or contraction  whence scaliger defines death to be but the cessation of the souls functions as if it were rather a restraint than a dissolution what seems wanting is chiefly color heat and motion yet that gross object which is left to the spectators eyes remains remains now but a compound of the two ignobler elements water and earth while the two purer fire and air are winged away as fitter attendants on the soul than on the extinguished body  when this happens to one whose conversation has indeared him to us when we see his eyes put on death and hear the tolling bell give public notice of it what soul can then lose a thought on the fugitive joys of pleasure what a bubble what a puff what a wink of life is man and with what a general and sure success does death stand over humane nature always striking here and there and exercising an unbounded triumph  i have lately from such a sight as this learnt both humility and elevation  the one to lower my esteem of a body which must one day perish in unlovely rottenness  the other to reverence a soul which after having lived here but as a sojourner reascends when its house of flesh is demolished with a vigor as unrestrained and an essence as refined and glorious as the unimbodied and celestial angels  mr plain dealer if you think these few foregoing hints of mine worthy to fill up a corner of your paper by incerting them you will oblige your constant reader  aulus martius inner temple january the   th          there are descriptions in spencers writings much more bold and strongly figured than those of almost any other poet ancient or modern his fancy was quick penetrating vast and his conceptions so clearly possessed that he seems to have embodied his ideas and given us instead of his thoughts the very substance of the things he thought of  there is in his works an image of death so dreadfully drawn and painted in such glowing colors that having got it by heart when i was a boy it made so lively an impression on me that i never failed for a long time after to see it at my beds foot as soon as the candle was carried out of the room  and met it in every churchyard i passed over after sunset  death with a bow in his left hand was seen and his long arrows slanting from his side all naked dangerous and deadly keen with feathers in the blood of millions died such the fierce indians in their quivers hide these be shot careless ever changing place strait to what mark so ere he next him spied nor was there power in art to shun his case or cure the eternal wounds he makes in human race as pale and wan as ashes was his look his body lean and meagre as a rake shrunk was his skin like a dry withered root cold to the touch and dreary as a snake t as

uncles who is a rich merchant in the city and give him an account as he calls it what i have learnt during the other eleven his education has tinctured him with that infallible mark of a narrow spirit  the destroying half the merit of his purposes by an ungraceful manner of executing them  and he has so often taken delight to put me coarsely in mind of his charity that he robbed me even of the comfort which he laid out his money to procure me  this last christmas being seized by a violent fit of the gout he was roaring out one day in extremity of pain and peevishness  he could not he said imagine how so temperate a man as he was should come by such a distemper as the gout if he had been a glutton or a drunkard he should not have wondered at it  but for a smallbeerdrinker one who had always been remarkable for his selfdenial to fall under the torture of such a disease as the gout  it was very hard  it was very strange  and he could not for his part tell how it was to be accounted for  it was my goodluck at that time to have been newly reading a collection of miscellaneous poems and i bethought my self of something that i met with in it which had pleased me very much and made an impression on my memory  i ran and fetched the book and opening it to the place put it into my uncles hands and told him he might there find the reason of that misfortune he had been complaining of  he desired me to read it to him and i did it as follows  the learned sydenham does not doubt but profound thought will bring the gout and that with back on couch we lie because our reason soared too high as cannons when they mount vast pitches are tumbled back upon their britches my uncle smiled and said twas pretty he made me read it so often that he has got it by heart and repeats it twenty times a day in all companies as a proof of his nephews ingenuity he never could abide poetry but is now grown very fond of it  he could not have believed he says that there was so much good reason in rhyming in fine i am grown a favorite and he allows i have a great deal of wit ever since i proved his distemper to be the consequences of his judgment and profound thinking  i could not forbear

heedful so far forth as thou shall be able that thou neither deridest the unhappy nor hold the meek man in scorn  when thou art moved by the sharpness of the wit which works within thee thou ought to shoot thy arrows at the mighty  yea at the men who pride themselves in the strength of the flesh and have no feeling of the spirit that labors within them take heed also that thou slidest not into vanity when thou hear thy self well spoken off neither inflamest thy self into anger when thou chancest to be rebuked  verily friend this great city may be likend unto a field which has rank weeds if by thy writing thou can root them forth and throw them on a heap from among the wheat thy name shall become exalted in the mouths of the brethren  if thou art even as thou seem to be thou will deliver forth a reproof against the scorn which light men of thy persuasion make of the habit of us friends thou know the corn of the field is not so beautiful as the butterflower neither is the pomegranate

comes to my house whether i will or no upon no other account truly but because i have a handsome wife i would have believed him though he had not told me so for he takes very great liberties with her before my face  i am informed she came by him at the masquerade she says she cannot tell how to get rid of him  i desire therefore to know whether i ought not to take some measures with him and in particular whether i might not with a safe conscience swear the peace against him for without some such security i am afraid to forbid him my house myself and if my wife does it she says he will not

of shetories he can never dine without a restraint that he takes to be an abuse of our happy constitution and which was never known but in a state of nature before kings were by mutual compact deputed to execute laws for us  that they persecute him ever and anon with much good may do you  i am glad to see you eat so heartily  a good stomach is a sign of health  and such like exorbitant encroachments  and that yesterday for example after he had eaten at most but six slices and was peaceably and without cause of offense to any of the company preparing to enter upon the seventh he saw the eyes of the whole circle most tyrannically fixed upon him with an air of arbitrary and unreasonable wonder to the manifest abasement of your petitioners courage and the violation of his undoubted privilege to eat as long as he finds himself hungry  he therefore most humbly prays that your reverence would condescend to take this grievance into your consideration and acquaint these invaders of the peoples rights that there was a reserve either expressed or tacitly implied in the original contract that every man should have property in his own appetite and eat and drink to please himself and not to humor the taste of his company  and your petitioner as in duty bound shall pray as heartily as he eats etc luke thoroughstitch   to the author of the plain dealer sir i have seen the first part

delight which i observe you take in praising whatever has real merit convinces me that i shall contribute to your own as well as your readers pleasure by having transcribed a few verses from this satire which unless i greatly deceive deceive myself carry with them the most shining marks of a spirit that is truly poetical  speaking of a kind of people called lords he observes with a great deal of goodbreeding that the first place in his satire is due to quality and accordingly makes way for them like a person justly conscious of the respect which ought to be shown them i mean the generality of them  for some are far from deserving the distinction  my lord comes forward  forward let him come ye vulgar at your peril give him room he stands for fame on his forefathers feet by heraldry proved valiant and discreet with what becoming pride he throws his eyes above the man by three descents less wise for men like figures pass for high or base slight or important merely by their place

portentaque thessala   monday february        to the plain dealer cambridge january         sir the only account i shall give you with regard to myself is  that i am a fellow of one of the colleges in this university my chief design in writing bing to strengthen you with some new materials for the better performance of that promise you were once pleased to make us of proving that the women are a great deal wiser than we are  my father very lately sent me down into the fens to make love to a young lady who is mistress of a considerable fortune where i discovered to my no small mortification that all my learning hitherto has taught me nothing that deserves comparison with the universal knowledge which i met with in that discreet and profound family  not heaven alone but earth air fire water birds beasts stocks stones  every part of the still or moving mute or speaking creation has contributed to the erudition of my more than accomplished mistress  all things been laid open to her if not in their natures i am sure i may say in their meanings  in short after three days unsuccessful endeavors to fathom my fate with regard to this infallible lady i am come back to my college almost too humble to wish for the possession of a blessing so uncommon  i saw a female dwarf in my mistresss neighborhood and could not help thinking while i was looking on her and listening to a little history of her having been served up in a goosepye that this pocket abridgement of womanhood might as modestly pretend to incorporate herself with one of the giants in the king of prussias frightful regiment as i to match my mind with one whose comprehension is so vastly too big for me   at my first coming i was received by an old maiden aunt who is mistress of the ceremonies to the lady i was recommended to she surpised me with a declaration that she knew of my coming before she received my fathers letter i said i thought it had been a secret but she assured me that i had been hanging for a whole week past upon one of the bars of the kitchen chimney  not being entirely enlightened as to the authority of this dark prognostic i was preparing to ask a question or too but was scared out of the intention by a melancholy denunciation that my father would not live to see the match come to perfection for this good lady had the night before this letter was brought to her seen it coming in both her candles with a winding sheet just over against it  i bowed with a becoming sorrow and received the prophecy with all that reverence which was due to so extraordinary a reason this won her to a warmth in my interest and she would carry me without ceremony to surprise her neice in the garden where she was visiting her orange trees in the greenhouse  we were got as forward on this pleasing journey as to the outside of the garden door when some or other of those busy powers who envy lovers their proposed enjoyments put it into the old ladys feet to stumble over the threshold upon which she turned back in a fright and pushed me in again with such care and kindness that i can never sufficiently thank her since if i had gone on after such an ominous warning and met my mistress in an unlucky minute all the world it seems from that time forward could never have made it possible for me to come near her in a lucky one  she overtook us however as soon as we were got back into the parlor and broke in upon me with such a flash of charms that as i saluted her i was struck dumb with rapture out of which i recovered in time to overhear her tell the old lady as she was passing round her to a chair that it was not i that had drawn open her curtains when the bridecake was put under her pillow  i was not yet skilful enough to know what good or ill this boded me but before we were fully seated a new misfortune had befallen us  my clarindas chair tumbled backward upon which she declared to me with the prettiest resignation in the world that she was not to be ladymayoress this year but had patience to support herself under all such disappointments  being now got into perfect composure i began to find that i was looking silly  so i sighed three times and informed her as well as i could of the great respect my father had for the family and clarinda on her part had opened her fan to its full extent and was looking down upon it in the proper attitude and telling the sticks with both fingers when the aunt interrupted me with a groan that had been unluckily mentioned by my naming my father and confirmed her former remark of the winding sheet by a deaths head she had found out in the fire  as great misfortunes rarely come single a malicious coal in the shape of a coffin flew just then to clarindas feet who turned pale and took it up betwixt a finger and thumb and after throwing it behind her over the left shoulder corroborated her aunts evidence by a deathwatch that had kept her waking  by the howling of a dog all night long  by a deep grave that he had scratched up at the foot of a rosemary bush exactly under her window  and now their eyes being turned on me as if they expected my opinion i gave it them very gravely that these things had somewhat in m  and it was happy for me that i said no less for an old family servant with a sober mournful face having heard part of the discourse while he was busy about the fire very dismally confirmed our terrors by three proofs which were stronger than all  first by the squeaking of a weasel that had met him upon the cellarstairs secondly by a hole that the rats had gnawed in the back of his best livery and thirdly by a strange dream that mrs susan the chambermaid had been almost frighted out of her wits by about wet clothes  three ministers  ripe fruit  and roses in blossom  after all which to put it absolutely out of doubt and convince us that somebody would die shortly he showed us on one of his hands a dirty yellow spot which the thumb of his other as he shook his head and observed to us was not broad enough to cover and this they all agreed was no better than a deathmould and must mean something  in the midst of these miseries i had very little to say for my self having been put out of a premeditated speech which i had been inventing during my whole journey but as goodluck would have it the tea came in to my relief and the first dish that had the blessing to approach clarindas lips was so richly covered with moneybags floating in white circles all over the surface that gayety took place of melancholy  a little spider too was so kind as to spin down goodluck into her lap which methought meant me no harm nay i became on a sudden so happy that her elbow declared in my favor and her aunt put her to the blush by observing she must change her bedfellow  but let no man be too much in haste to conclude that he is happy  my triumph was dashed at once by a discovery that this was childermasday after which my mistress said no more but that nothing would come to good that was begun on that worst day of the week so her teeth achd most prodigiously she was sorry she could be no company and took her leave of us till next morning  next morning came  and the first person i met was mrs susan whom i discovered cross the hall spitting seriously in her hand and shutting it close with a great deal of caution for fear of letting slip as she afterward told me a sign she had felt in her palm that a handsome gift was very near her  i was glad of this favorable opportunity to confirm the truth of that token and she was so obligingly communicative as to entrust me with two great secrets one that i had trod upon her ladys toe last night in the hurry of waiting on her to the stairfoot whence a conclusion had been drawn in my favor that i should come ever long to her bedside  the other that mrs susan having discovered this very morning that one of her ladys stockings had been put on wrongside outward was forbid pulling it off again for fear of turning some goodluck that was meant her  mrs susan in return for her kind intelligence was very earnest to know whether i had dreamt of no body  i told her i had had the happiness to be all night in her ladys company and i could perceive that this information was no more than had been expected which led me into some probable guesses concerning the purpose of a caseknife in a common prayer book which when i got up in the morning i had found under my bolster  while i held this conference with my fellow servants we had the pleasure of bidding our mistress goodmorrow and of hearing to my no small comfort that her foot as she came down stairs had given her the signal that she was to tread upon strange ground  in fine sir it is impossible for you to conceive what an infinite variety of notices impulses and prognostics outward and inward these ladies direct their conduct by  in my three days stay which i thought enough for my first visit i could learn nothing with any certainty of what i chiefly sought to know but was edified above measure in the occult sciences of the family  my mistress called after me when i had taken horse to come away that she was afraid i should have a wet journey for puss was washing her face and carried her paw above her ears which she assured me was a sign that had never been known to miscarry  whether she meant this as a display of her art or of her inclination to bring me back again is a mystery which notwithstanding the great advance i have made in guessing i am yet unable to disclose with any positive dependence  but i would not for all that have you think slightly of my skill in tokens since i could astonish you if i thought fit with a profusion of portentous mysteries  i am absolutely master of that oraculous secret which is kneaded up in the dumb cake i am instructed in the aweful ceremonies which are sacred to the famed saint agnes to the purity of whose mysterious worship three fasting virgins must concur with so strict an abstinence that a kiss during those restrictive rites would be as undoing as a rape after they are over i can foretell the most agreeable things in the world by six peashells over a door and anticipate consequences which would puzzle a southsayer by turning three times round in my shirt and falling into bed backward  i know who will die an old maid by the help of a gray goose wing a clean hearth and a seive full of ashes  but i should never have done were i i to let you into the virtues of roses gathered on midsummer night  of hempseed sown and mown in the dark upon the graves of a country churchyard  of patching a pretty face with applekernels  of cutting the nails fasting  of twisting a garter in nine knots round a bedpost  of a certain hair that you may find in your shoe the first time you hear the cuckoo  and a thousand other deep discoveries which i have made in this delightful journey and which have put me quite out of conceit with my former studies since after having labored to be wise so many years in a college i found my self notwithstanding little better than a fool as often as i came into my mistresss company  pray sir favor me with your opinion how far i may prudently venture my self with a lady so much wiser than i am your advice will have its weight with  your humble servant aemilius   the plain dealer no     non quicquid turbida roma elevet accedas  pers friday february         we had once a species of opera called dramatic in which the dignity of reason was not sacrificed as it is now to the dissoluteness of sound but the force of words and meaning was increased by music and decoration and impressed upon the soul by the mediation of the senses  i have heard with a pleasure which i hope was not groundless that there is a design on foot in one of our theaters to restore these manly as well as delightful entertainments with an elegance and magnificence of ornament which we have not yet been accustomed to  the success which dioclesian has met with an opera of this kind but far short of the perfection which i am told it is proposed to raise to them to will serve it is to be hoped as an encouragement to keep the gentleman who is patentee of that theater firm and vigorous in his intention  his genius is admirably turned to those embellishments of show and scenary which will always have a surprising and powerful effect on the stage but most where they are aptly and significantly introduced  and there are not wanting writers who can contribute subject and occasion whereon to exhaust in the most rational as well as agreeable manner the sprightly copiousness of his invention so that i am almost led to flatter my self that our emasculating present taste of the italian luxury and wantonness of music will give way to a more passionate and animated kind of opera where not only the eye and ear may expect to be charmed but the heart to be touched and transported  it will be received as the effect of spleen or affectation to insinuate that the martial spirit of our nation is effeminated and gradually relaxed by the influence of this softening siren and yet cicero who was at least as good a judge as most of the members of our royal academy for encouragement of trifling has not scrupled to say plainly in his tract de legibus  that the good or evil in a state depends greatly on the music that is most encouraged in it for if it be too light and wanton the people are insensibly rendered foolish and disorderly and on the contrary if it be grave and masculine they become modest by its influence  the spartan plainness and austerity have been celebrated in every age and histories are full of instances of that wise peoples rigor against innovation in particulars which seemed to threaten them at what distance soever with the modish luxuries of their neighbors but the strongest impression which was ever made upon me in their favor was from the decree they passed against timotheus the milesian for an improvement he had introduced in music much like the admired concertos of our italian benefactors but these grave men of foresight discerned the consequences of such pretended refinements and provided against it by this timely edict with lylius gyraldus has inserted as he transcribed it from boethius  forasmuch as timotheus the milesian received into our city holding in contempt the ancient music and rejecting the harp with seven strings has introduced an harmony of many voices corrupting the ears of our youth by a multiplicity of strings and a music hitherto unknown dividing the simple notes into a variety of feints and quaverings we do therefore ordain that he shall be impeached and that his superfluous strings shall be broken to the end that strangers from his example may be wary of bringing among spartans the light and unmanly amusements which are practiced in less modest countries when i reflect on the power of music as it was practiced among the ancients and consider the miraculous instances of its effects on the passions of some princes who were most inflexible in their resolutions and when at the same time i consider that the music which had this prodigious influence was the reverse as i shall presently prove of that which now prevails in europe and which produces none of those transporting effects what less can i conclude than that all our boasted additions to this heavenly art are rather enlargements than improvements  there is a little piece of randolphs which of all his poems i am most pleased with and which gives us as it were in miniature the whole that can be said of music  music thou queen of souls  arise and string thy powerful lute and some sad requiem sing till rocks re murmur an awakened groan and listening tempests catch the mournful tone then on a sudden with excursive hand fly over the sounding chords with light command till oaks and struggling elms uprooted bound and a charmed forest lives and dances round then  in the midst of the transporting strain strike a sad note  and fix em trees again i said above that the strange effects reported of music in former times were the influence of a practice very different from the modern and i cannot more effectually strengthen that assertion than by observing i am confirmed in it by the opinion of dr wallis communicated on this subject to the royal society  the music of the ancients was more extensive than ours for poetry and dancing or measured motion were then accounted parts of music  now we know that verse if harmonious and passionate set to a plain tune and sung by a natural voice with some soft instrumental music such as not drowns or obscures but heightens the emphatick expressions will work strangely upon the ear and move all our passions in proportion to the tune and subject but especially if attended with suitable gesture and action for it is evident on the stage that proper acting gives great life to words now all this together which made up the ancient music must needs operate strongly on the fancy and affections  for if the deliberate reading of a romance if it happens to be well penned will produce mirth tears pity anger indignation according to the respective intents of it much more would it do so if accompined with all those powerful assistants  why may not all this be now done as well as then  no doubt it may and with equal effect too if the words were but elegantly adapted to the argument and disposed in places proper for their emphasis pronounced with a tuneful voice and inlivened by expressive gesture painting naturally the passion or condition of the mind and graphically delineating as it were to the eye as well as addressing to the ear the bounds distinctions and peculiar attributes of joy grief wonder fury jealousy compassion fear love hatred and the rest of those emotions which the acted mind is subject to  this would as certainly now as then produce extraordinary effects and especially upon a surprise where persons are not prejudiced or preengagd and so lie open to the meant impressions  our modern music is no more than what the ancients called harmonick which was but one part of theirs whose music as i said above consisted of words verse voice tune instrument and action  a very powerful combination  and can we expect from one piece the same influence as from the whole  the design of music among us seems to aim at exciting no particular passion but in general to please the ear and by a tuneful intermixture of different voices and parts with cadencies and concords produce an elegant sound which only those persons can discern who have distinguishing judgment in music while that much larger part of the audience which consists of those who have a rude and uncultivated ear remains only amused and confounded with a great noise which has nothing distinguishable to their capacity  it is true indeed that even this compound music admits of characters very different some are brisk elate and airy some sedate and grave others soft resigned and languid  but still that kind of harmony which is most powerful to excite particular passions or dispositions in the mind is the simple natural and uncompounded  how often have i been forced to go abroad when i had no mind to it or fall asleep in the middle of the day by a nurses languid tune lulling her babe to rest in a room within my hearing  nay continual reading in an even tone  the soft murmur of a pebbly brook  the falling of rain upon trees  shall have an irresistible power to induce a repose upon the spirits  and on the contrary an derman who is lame of the gout shall feel himself grow light and wanton at the briskness of a jig on a kit or violin exciting a disposition to dance that is almost too hard for his pain and gravity  nothing is plainer therefore than that simple harmony is more operative on the affections than an elaborate composition of full music  so that if it is the aim of music to please the ear the compositions of italian masters may deserve to be preferred as forming sweeter consorts than were known to the ancients among whom i find no footsteps of what we call several parts or voices such as base treble mean etc sung in consort answering each other to diversify and fill up the music  but if we mean by music to excite passion and move the heart to any moral or solid purpose we must apply a more touching simplicity and endeavor to act upon nature in a more natural and unaffected manner and this i doubt not a judicious composer may so happily effect that allowing for those hyperboles with which the ancient writers set off their music our modern may be found capable of producing as extraordinary effects as theirs  and this methinks is a mine of pleasure yet unopend and may deserve to be thought on with some attention by those whose profit would be the certain consequence of introducing a novelty so powerfully attractive but i shall say more concerning these things upon some future occasion  the plain dealer no    o imitatores servum pecus hor  veteres  miratur laudatque poetas  idem monday february         to the plaindealer sir there is a dishonorable kind of practice among the men who style themselves the wits which i can no longer forbear complaining against as an abuse that deserves the notice and correction of a plain dealer  you must needs have observed that our poets are like our politicians divided into opposite parties and draw their pens with great sharpness to the defiance of each others muses  among these warriors on both sides there are a turbulent set of people not soldiers but engineers who are known by the name of cannonturners they never trouble themselves to provide wit of their own but are sure by some stratagem to steal that of their enemies and apply it to a purpose the reverse of what it was intended for  the only difficulty they are at is to substitute the word tory in the place of the monosyllable whig without detriment to the measure of the verse or to crowd the unpliable stubbornness of presbyterian into the passive compass of jacobite for when these little difficulties are once happily adjusted they have turned the malice of their adversarys meaning directly against themselves and by killing with this good husbandry save the expense of artillery  but it were well mr plain dealer if these cannonturners would confine the exercise of their invertive talents to our private and domestic factions  on the contrary they are never so active as when we are at war with any of our neighbors the french in particular have been very great sufferers by them and have complained that these cannonturners are the only unfair fighters that this nation ever sent against them  i shall better clear to your apprehension what justice there may be in their complaint by producing one example of many where the wit of their own magazines has been purloind in a most unsoldierly manner and discharged upon them to their no small damage  monsieur maynard a french writer in the time of cardinal richlieus administration found himself forgotten or neglected having been a favorite in the former reign though this great cardinal was nobly liberal in the encouragement which he gave to men of merit monsieur maynard had a spirit too exalted to importune with personal addresses a minister whose levees were so overcrowded and to whom he was no otherwise known than by the fame of his writings he therefore sent him in the following verses a memorial so full of praise without flattery  satyr without malice  and submission without meanness that i have never met with a mixture of so artful a wit with so delicate a severity and it was impossible for it not to have produced the effect which was expected from it even though it had been addressed to a chief minister by many degrees duller than cardinal richlieu  i sick of a life possessed in vain i soon shall wait upon the ghost of our late monarch in whose reign none who had merit missed a post ii then will i charm him with your name and all your glorious wonders done the power of france  the spaniards shame the rising honors of his son iii grateful the royal shade will smile and dwell delighted on your name sweetly appeased his griefs beguile and drown old losses in new fame iv but when he asks me in what post i did your wished commands obey and how i shared your favor most  what would you please to have me say but now sir almost a century after the death of both poet and patron comes a famous english cannonturner or abettor of cannonturners named bernard lintot and from a magazine called a miscellany discharges all this wit against the honor of it is authors country  the first part being general it will be needless to trouble you with it but the three last stanzas run in this manner  iv the warrior ghosts will round me come to hear of famed ramillias fight while the vexed bourbons through the gloom retire to inmost realms of night v

had you i pray how like a coxcomb should i stand what would your lordship have me say i shall take up none of your time with observations on the lower turn and more ungenteel spirit with which the application of this borrowed wit is made which in the original is so nobly graceful all i would say farther on the subject is that since he who makes bold with another mans money will naturally be supposed to have had none of his own i am in pain upon these occasions least when the french wits observe the freedom we have taken with their property they should conclude us all to be poor rather than some of us ungenerous  i am sir your very humble servant francis fairplay   to the author of the plain dealer mr plain dealer i have seen with a great deal of pleasure some excellent specimens of the ancient hebrew poetry distinguished in your paper with the applause which is so justly due to them for every body who weighs these things with judgment must agree with a late writer that there is nothing so soft so tender and pathetick and at the same time nothing so grand so majestic so terrible and so harmonious as the poetic part of the bible  i send you one of their lyrick odes which is the song of moses on the overthrow of the egyptians in the red sea and i believe it will be readily allowed that there is more of the sublime in this hebrew ode than can be found among the writings of

singultus jurgia gliscunt lucret friday february         the following letter from the same learned and ingenious hand to which i am indebted for that which was published in a former paper no  0 concerning the difference observable in point of fortune between the professors of poetry and of painting contains so useful a lesson against a folly that is become too common among us that no subject could be more seasonable or stand more in need of a plain dealer the letter in its original was directed to a particular friend of the writers but produced an effect which renders it deserving of a more extensive and public notice  sir i shall now according to my promise which i made you on the seventh of this instant and which i hope came to your hands give you some account of the strange ravage which is made by excessive drinking in the bodies and minds and affairs of those who are addicted to that barbarous vice  nature has contrived it so that all her children as long as they retain their reason are fond of life and at the same time they all believe that life it self of which they are so fond is a grievous burden without the benefit of health but though all men are satisfied of the unspeakable value of health yet few are frugal managers of it but the drinking part of mankind are as prodigal of it as the squanderer is of money for no vice whatever does so much harm to the body or lays the foundation of so many diseases as excessive drinking gout stone cholick fevers consumptions vapors asthmas with a long et caetera  a certain friend of ours whom we love very well has drunk himself into no less than three of them viz gout asthma and vapors and yet he goes on in his old course as if the juice of the grape like that of the scoron could expel the venom which before it infused but here i think my self obliged to declare that i mean by excessive drinking a constant daily or frequent drinking to a greater quantity than is sufficient to cherish nature  all the rest of the vices together are not so often punished by sudden death as excessive drinking alone is which sometimes happens by the malignity of the vice it self oppressing and stifling nature and sometimes by the fatal accidents which attend upon it as false quarrels etc  our friend whom i mentioned above has no less than twice to my knowledge very narrowly escaped sudden death which had like to have happened both times by excessive drinking once formerly in lincolnsinnfields and another time lately at s  now as a death that gives no time for repentance ought to be looked upon as the greatest of all punishments excessive drinking ought to be regarded as the greatest of all vices because we ought to believe that divine justice has proportioned punishments to the crimes for which they are inflicted and because there is no vice by which he who uses it so immediately defaces or so totally destroys in himself the image of god which is reason i hope that upon reading this you will have the goodness to admonish our friend who has so narrowly escaped twice to beware of a third time  as the state of the mind depends upon that of the body and the motions of that particle of heavenly fire upon the motions of the animal spirits which in time of health move vigorously and regularly and weakly and irregularly in time of sickness it must necessarily be that that vice which is the occasion of most diseases in the body must be likewise the cause of most disorders in the mind and there is no vice that is so great an enemy to the understanding as excessive drinking or that so often entirely overturns it indeed drinking to excess while the fit continues sometimes strengthens the imagination but by the same degrees by which it raises the imagination it depresses the judgment the former of which is common to us with beasts and the latter with god and angels but then the day after drinking the very imagination languishes with the judgment and drinking to excess never fails in time to quench the imagination to impair the memory and to drown the judgment  i desire that you would admonish one of our friends capacity to take notice that bacchus is often a great leveller that he levels the understandings of wise men and fools of the blockhead and the man of sense and that therefore as it is the interest of fools to carry on this vice it is the interest of men of sense to avoid it  i desire that you would likewise put him in mind that the same drunken deity is often worse than a leveller that he is often a subverter of the order of things and pulls down the rich and exalts the poor that is he gives understanding to fools and makes men of sense madmen for fools having generally stronger nerves and less volatile spirits than men of great understandings or of beautiful imaginations the same quantity of spiritous liquor that will set fire to the phlegm of fools and by that means rouse their capacities will make men of sense either stupid or frantic  as there is no vice which more impairs the understanding and weakens the reason there is none which more inflames the passions and disorders the will several other vices are solitary and each of them shuns the company of the rest but excessive drinking is attended with the very worst of them that is with those which have the directest tendency to the misery and destruction of men as gaming quarrels riots murders etc  most other vices are compatible with several virtues but drunkenness runs counter to all the duties of life a great drinker is for the most part neither a good husband nor a good father nor a good son nor a good brother nor a good friend  but it is not virtue only that detests drunkenness it is often abhorred even by vice it self as by avarice hypocrisy ambition bigottry and lust as this unnatural sin of drinking is attended with several that bring misery and destruction on those who use them as has been said above it is often shunned by that human natural vice which tends to the propagation of mankind as much as it is by virtue for there is nothing so inconsistent or incompatible with excessive drinking as the cleanness elegance and delicacy of a courtly gallantry  as the right management of human affairs requires health of body and vigor and serenity of mind we ought not to wonder if a vice that breaks the rest in him impairs the understanding destroys the memory inflames the passions and debauches the will entirely unqualifies a man for doing what the world calls business and therefore hard drinking has ruined more english families than all the rest of our vices put together not by the immediate expense which attends upon the vice but by altering the very natures of the heads of families who use it and making them unfit for the management of their affairs of which they were very capable before for other vices indeed make men worse but a habitude of excessive drinking often alters men to that degree that they become the very reverse of what they were before and differ more from their former selves than from their present companions such a habit when it has been long contracted has often made the ambitious indolent the prudent inconsiderate the active idle and the industrious slothful and negligent so that their affairs are ruined for want of application or by being entrusted in the hands of those who turn them wholly to their own advantage and to the ruin of those who employ them  as personal vices are the cause of private calamities so national vices are the grounds of national sufferings and as no vice does more harm to particular constitutions than frequent drinking to excess or lays the foundation of more diseases and of more ill humors in them there is none of our public vices which does more harm to our national constitution or occasions more corruption in it than this pernicious habitude and as this custom in particular persons causes them to neglect their private affairs and either to leave them wholly undone or to leave them to be done by those who will make their proper advantage of them though to the ruin of those who entrusted them as has been said above the same thing is not unlike to happen to this drinking nation  to be satisfied of this if we may judge of the future by the past we need only cast an eye back upon our elections in which thousands of englishmen as far as in them lay have sold their own liberties and the liberty of their country for liquors esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage but then he sold only his own birthright and he sold it to his brother and he sold it to support nature in the extremity of hunger but thousands of our electors have sold as far as in them lay not only their own birthrights their own liberties but the liberties and birthrights of their brethren for nauseous loads to oppress and destroy nature i know indeed very well that upon those occasions in order to corrupt people there is a little of the solid made use of sometimes as well as a great deal of the liquid but i have a better opinion of some of my countrymen than to believe that they would sell their wives their children and all their posterity for a song if at the time when they did it they were cool enough to consider what it is they are about  thus my dear friend have i endeavored to show the mischief which excessive drinking does to particular persons in their bodies minds and affairs i should say something of the unreasonable apologies which the disciples of bacchus make for themselves but having run into more length than i first intended i shall defer what i had to say farther till i have heard how you relish what i have already writ  i am etc london september          the plain dealer no     modo vir modo foemina virg monday february         sir as i have taken notice in the course of your plain dealing that you are perfectly apprizd of the general disposition among those whom we call people of quality to patronize and distinguish merit i flatter my self that you will contribute what assistance may be in your power to the encouragement of a work i am at present engaged in and which the world may expect to see published very speedily  i intend in short to compile a history of dedications containing a particular account of all addresses of that kind which have been made to the noble patrons of the present age whether dukes marquesses earls viscounts simple barons or under what name or title soever known and distinguished together with certain edifying remarks upon their graceful manner of receiving and judicious liberality in rewarding such addressers from which a reasonable judgment may be formed concerning the unusal encouragement polite learning is like to meet with throughout the course of the present generation  great numbers have already sent me in memoirs of their own particular experience and i doubt not in the least but that i shall be able to compose a volume which will not only do justice to the very extraordinary times we live in but astonish and inflame posterity  if you mr plain dealer or any of your friends have wherewithal to oblige the world on so illustrious an occasion be communicative for the honor of your country and confirm me still more  your friend and constant reader humprhy pickthank   i must be plain with my industrious correspondent mr pickthank and let him know without ceremony or circumlocution that i have an irreconcileabe quarrel to the subject of his history and shall contribute no memoirs to its ornament  if he is desirous to know my reason i shall give it him in the words of a merry friend of mine who took occasion some few years since to dedicate to a great man his thoughts concerning dedications  your dedicators says this wag are a sort of intellectual tailors that cut out clothes for a great mans mind without ever taking measure of it  they have but two rules and those they never depart from first the dress must be gaudy and secondly it must never fit but they must make it of a vast dimension and cover it all over with tinsel methinks i should congratulate the men of quality on this advantage which it must of necessity be to them to have their characters drawn only by such as do not or dare not know them and will consequently be sure not to put their graces their lordships and their ladyships out of countenance a convenient piece of good breeding for which i hope they are thankful  as for my self when i see a long drift of excellencies and talents crammed down the throat of an innocent nobleman who has done nothing to deserve such ill usage i am not at all surpised at it because i am assured it is not meant to the disadvantage of the person of honor it is addressed to but is a mere declaration of the authors wants and a heavy complaint against hunger and nakedness  the only dedications therefore which i am for encouraging are those which may instruct the receiver that he is to consider them as bills of exchange drawn by the witty upon the great and payable at sight  and least the offering should be misunderstood or not recompensed as it ought to be through the deplorable ignorance of some people whose high quality has placed them above the reach of knowledge and the impulses of humanity i have for the benefit of my worthy companions in the labors of the standish drawn up a form which i would have annexed to all future dedications where the fortune is in any considerable degree more elevated than the understanding  the right honorable dives earl of widefield debtor to paul poorwit for the

but out of pure respect i was resolved you should have the refusal  i am my lord your lordships most obliged most obedient most devoted most etc paul poorwit   in this plain manner says my ingenious friend and old acquaintance would i have authors treat their patrons the said thirty pounds may probably be the poets whole stock and wits dealing the least upon credit either in buying or selling of any trading people in the world have the more occasion for ready money  a little reflection on the foregoing particulars will convince the laborious mr pickthank that nothing is more unreasonable than his expectation of my assistance toward setting forth a history of such dedications as i can by no means approve the examples of but am desirous to see suppressed in favor of a juster method which i have therefore recommended  to the gentleman that writes the plain dealer sir i am a young woman just turned of fourteen and my father is a doctor of physic but he loves poetry mightily and we have a great many wits come often to dine with us for my part i have no great skill yet what difference there may be between one sort of men and another but i listen when any of these wits are talking with my father because he says they can teach me things that i shall be the wiser for as long as i live  one of the prettiest of them all was reading to us yesterday some ingenious copies of verses out of a book of poems that is just come out and i think he told us it was writ by a gentleman whose name is baker  they were particularly delighted with one little poem among the rest at which they all laughed as if they were mad and said it was one of the cleanest turns they had met with and my father could not rest till he had taken a copy of it  i observed that my mother and my eldest sister blushed while they were laughing at it but i though i stole it out of my fathers pocket the same night and have read it over and over till i have got it by heart can make nothing of it and am vexed because i want understanding to find out the meaning of something that my sister who is but three years older pretended to look learnedly at as if she knew forsooth as much of the matter as anybody  i am ashamed to ask questions about it at home for fear of being found out to be sillier than i should be at my years  and therefore i bethought my self to beg the favor of you to show where the cleanness of that turn lies that my father and his wits were so highly diverted with  i know a place where they take in your paper and where i shall see your answer without any bodys knowing that it was i who writ to you about it  i never writ to a man before but my father and therefore pray dont wonder at any ignorance or mistake in  good sir your admirer and humble servant novinda the feather

being killed in the manner you said i resolve with this feather to chop off your head  ps there may be wit in this for any thing i know but if a man was for cutting my head off and had nothing in his hand but a feather i should think my self a great fool to be afraid of what he could do to me     madam when a young lady of so lively and industrious a curiosity becomes desirous to learn meanings she makes much swifter advances than you can easily imagine  not to rob you therefore of the honor of a discovery you cannot fail to make shortly by virtue of your own natural genius please only to wait till the week after your next birthday and if by that time you shall not be as knowing in this point as the young lady your eldest sister command all instruction in the power of  your most obedient servant the plaindealer   the plain dealer no     quid non mortalia pectora cogis auri sacra fames  virg friday february         the force of avarice is never so conspicuous and so much to be wondered at as when it taints the minds of persons eminent in quality and circumstance secured as one would think against all mean temptations by the large revenues of a state employment it is no such great matter of surprise when we see this tincture of covetousness prevailing in a mechanic one whose birth and education are upon a level one who has undergone a state of servitude who has learned to be scraping and penurious by habit and example and who by a conversation with dirt and servile gain makes the amassing a fortune to be the chief end of life but we expect from a generous birth and a liberal education sentiments suitable to their dignity  we see it is true this dirty passion often blotting the escutcheons of the noblest families and we find at the same time our respect for their quality turned into a contempt for their persons but how much more despicable does this vice appear when we find it lodged in the breast of him whose supposed merit and the favor of his prince have raised him to preside in justice we attach ideas of veneration to their characters who are oracles of law we look upon them as the storehouses of wisdom and the fountains of integrity and were they as it is said of the old persian emperors to appear in public but once in seven years the vulgar no doubt would carry up their respect to the pitch of adoration  but our deference for these great men is taken off when we see frailties breaking through their grandeur when they prostitute the sanctity of honor and conscience to wealth and unworthy extorsion my lord coke i remember somewhere speaking of extortion in a judge says it is there worse than robbery for robbery is apparent and has the face of a crime but extortion puts on the visor of virtue for expedition of justice  it is a very fine aphorism and worthy the consideration of all ages and countries that a judge ought to be seasoned with two sorts of salt the salt of wisdom lest he should appear a fool and the salt of conscience lest he should appear a devil i cannot help recollecting upon this occasion a passage of aelian who speaking of the egyptians tells us that they boasted to have received their system of laws from mercury and that their judges whenever they sat upon the decision of causes wore hanging upon their breasts by a chain of gold a sapphire image which was called truth but says the author i should think it better that instead of the material image dangling at their bosoms they had the essence of it stamped on their souls  i was led into this trace of thinking by perusal of those pamphlets which have lately been published concerning the famous lord bacon and of another i met with in the window of a member of parliament which is called the case of orphans considered from antiquity  the title page tells us that a part of of its subject is on the court of chancery having the disposition of orphans money as i observed some passages in it concerning the unreasonable trust which has been put in the masters of chancery i shall take the liberty of transcribing a few and making them a part of this days entertainment  i must freely confess says this author it is always my opinion that a lord chancellor was a most proper trustee and guardian of the interests of orphans and widows i have not altogether retracted this opinion but i am so diffident of my own weak judgment that strong clamor and strong arguments persuade me often not to be too positive or tenacious of my sentiments i am not so perfectly methinks reconciled to a chancellor and his masters having too intimate an understanding with each other and i begin to suspect it a degree of harmony in no wise essential to the promotion of equity  it has been as i am told but by a very modern order that the suitors moneys have been lodged in the hands of the masters and it may be to be wished that too many have not cause to be sorry an order of that kind ever took place  though there be a loud cry of deficiency in the suitors money so lodged i am not taking upon me to impeach the characters of those gentlemen but only to observe that that order seems to have been as absurd and unreasonable as it has proved unhappy in its consequences the posseson of large sums of money and the discretionary power of approving what securities they shall be placed out on is a trust of such a kind as might debauch the principles of minds not the most strongly entrenched in honesty against the assaults of avarice and advantage it gives a liberty which i hope was never taken of making interest of that money in which they have no property and for which they are barely trustees and at the same time of not paying one shilling of its produce to the right owners under color that they have not had any proper security proposed upon which they could certify it safe and fitting to place it out  were there not the unhappy deficiencies which are at this time talked of i think several cases of conscience might arise upon the possiblity of the masters conduct with regard to this trust suppose only for example during the late unaccountable fluctuation of stocks when the south sea frenzy was at the height and money yielded the interest of a whole year for the loan of a few hours any immense fortunes had been made by the clandestine application of those very moneys for which no securities could be found or those very moneys had been lost in an unwarrantable venture for private profit what reparation should have been made to the suitors or orphans whose estates in either case were so happily or unhappily employed would they have reaped the benefit of the first stockjobbing or was there the least reason that they should sit down with the loss of the latter i make this but a case of supposition and as it is scarce probable that the same frenzy should ever again possess us yet should it the wisdom of our parliament is providing that the moneys of orphans and other suitors engaged in chancery shall not be subject to such hazards  but so much for quotation as i have abovementioned the name of the lord chancellor bacon who was accused by the nation of bribery and extortion i shall add a a few words here with regard to his conduct under that accusation it has been reckoned very singular in his case and he has been looked upon as a man of many fears that he should desert his defense and by a submission and confession of his guilt throw himself on the favor of the parliament but my lord bacon who as it has been observed knew that all wounds ache with laying open and that circumstances are sufficient to blast a reputation was resolved to avoid the hazard of a public examination it may very often be wiser to carry defects private than to stand too peremptorily on a justification wherefore i look upon the saying to be of great weight that no man has so many faults as he that takes upon him to have none at all  this puts me in mind of a fable that i read in my younger years and which i shall relate here because i am resolved not to end with too much gravity  there was a knot of good companions that entered into a club under certain rules and orders for the government of the society one article among the rest was that whoever should enroll himself a member of that brotherhood with any corporal maim or blemish about him should forfeit a crown to the board and for so many defects so many crowns it fell out that one man in the company was observed to go limping and they called upon him for his forfeit the man put himself upon the test and was found in the search to have not only one leg longer than the other but a scurff all over his body upon this discovery they demanded another crown and then another for a glasseye he had they pressed him in the end so hard for the money that it came to stripping and upon that struggle they found he had a rupture so that the further he pushed his defense his contest become more chargeable the plain dealer no    animum curis nunc huc nunc dividit illuc  virg monday march        to the author of the plain dealer sir you were pleased in a late paper to thank heaven that all our lords are not lords of trade for my part i wish heartily that eight or nine gentlemen of my acquaintance were all lords they fall so naturally into airs of grandeur and are already so adroit in the exercise of authority that they would strangely become the dignity i wish em possessed of and i shall never be truly easy till i see em preferred to offices of much less trouble than their present and more proportioned to their merit and abilities  you must know sir that i am agent for one of our american colonies and owe to the duties of that station the opportunity of being perfectly well acquainted with the patience the experience and indefatigable application of most of those fast friends to the plantation interest to the ease the welfare add above all to the good government of their dear brethren in the western world  i have received a thousand proofs of the surprising tenderness and moderation with which they act in matters which carry any severity in their appearance and on the other hand of the kind vigor and resoluti with which they forward every motion that but tends to the encouragement or satisfaction of their countrymen in those remote but important settlements  i am not able therefore to express the gratitude i feel for benefits too long and too many to enumerate  but because we see things clearest when opposed against their contraries indulge me but so far as to tell the world a story for me which will teach the enemies of these great promoters of the public good to value them as they ought and see what differences there is between them and other people  one of the turkish sultans whose name i have forgot taking into his consideration the great fertility of egypt was resolved to give encouragement to the trade and plantations of that country to this end he sent over to the bashaw of grand cairo a set of sages with great salaries to whom references were to be made upon all transactions of that nature and by whose reports he was to guide himself in mercantile and commercial cases  it happened soon after their arrival that a petition was presented to the bashaw by the planters of cotton whose whole years expectation had been destroyed by an unusual inundation of the nile in commiseration of which deplorable accident they humbly prayed a remission of the tax upon cotton for that one year only  the bashaw according to his orders referred this petition to the sages who were with all convenient speed to examine its contents and report their opinion what might fitly be done upon the occasion  the sages justly mindful that the liberal salaries which were annexed to their office entitled the people for whose encouragement they were appointed to the most affectionate proofs of their favor and good nature were not wanting to lay hold on this inviting opportunity to convince the petitioners how greatly the establishment of so able a board of counselors was like to conduce to the interest not only of the cottonplanters but of all the plantations in general  they therefore most humbly certified to the bashaw that the loss of the cotton appeared indeed to have been very considerable but seemed rather an effect of the planters own negligence than of the rivers inundation since they could not but know there were many seeds and grains not liable in their growth to receive damage by inundations and in particular wool they said was waterproof  they were therefore humbly of opinion that it would be for the good of the plantationinterest that no regard should be shown to the prayer of the petitioners since they ought instead of cotton to have sown wool and thereby secured themselves against the misfortune which had ruined them  i know mr plain dealer that you are a man of business and will therefore take up no more of your time at present but referr to another occasion what observations i intend to make on the story which i have here sent you  i am sir your neverfailing reader and humble servant colon   to the plain dealer sir if ever there was such a thing as the most charming woman in the world i have found her out and am in love with her beyond all meaning thought or description i had naturally no genius to poetry but what cannot love make possible  my mistress whose wit is as amiable as her beauty is a great friend of the muses and used often to reproach me that i had never writ verses upon her  she went so far at last as to tell me downright that she would never be married to to a man who had not loved her to some tune  i readily guessed at her meaning and presented her the next morning with the following song which i assure you was of my own making  i as damon sat by sylvias side and watched her eyes with amorous pride he gently bowed his leaning head and while it pressed her charming breast thus the transported shepherd said ii thou smiling cause of rest and pain the youth who loves not lives in vain what charms have eyes where wishes meet where souls combine and two hearts join hope is unbounded  joy complete iii no lamb of all thy bleating care looks softer than thy passions are possessing thee  by thee possessed i fear no pain i wish no gain who that is in heaven would more be blessed now sir the occasion of my troubling you is only to know whether you can teach me any method of finding out what a woman has a mind to hide i cannot for my life guess whether she likes me or my song either  before i made it she was for being loved to some tune and now all i can get from her is that she will be admired beyond measure in my opinion these two things are inconsistencies but one that is in love is so apt to be mistaken that i will not take upon me to be positive till i know what you think of it and so in hopes of hearing from you very speedily i rest  ah no  i mean i remain  sir your most obedient servant myrtillo   the plain dealer no  00 nam dolor and morbus lethi fabricator uterque est  lucan friday march        to the author of the plain dealer sir a dear friend of mine having lately lost a hopeful and beloved child and remaining inconsolable thereupon i beg you will please to insert for the next paper the following abstract of plutarchs letter to his wife on a like occasion the sorrowing parent is your constant reader and i know no better way to calm the violence of her grief than by conveying to her by your means and under the sanction of your authority so many excellent and familiar things as flowed from that great man on this melancholy occasion which may at the same time inspire our sex with an ambition to imitate the virtues of plutarchs wife and so to deserve the applauses he gives her i am  sir your constant reader and admirer artemisia   plutarch to his wife all health the messenger you dispatched to tell me of the death of my little daughter it seems missed his way as he was going to athens but when i came to tanagra i heard of it by my niece i suppose by this time the funeral is over i wish that whatever happens as well now as hereafter may create you no dissatisfaction but if you have designedly let any thing alone depending upon my judgment i pray let it be without ceremony and timorous superstition which i know are far from you only dear wife let you and i bear our affliction with patience  i know very well and comprehend what loss we have had but if i should find you grieve beyond measure this would trouble me more than the thing it self for i had my birth neither from a stock nor a stone and you know it full well i having been assistant to you in the educacation of so many children which we brought up at home under our own care  this much lamented daughter was born after four sons which made me call her by your own name therefore i know she was dear to you and grief must have a peculiar pungency in a heart tenderly affectionate to children especially when you call to mind how witty and innocent she was void of anger and not querulous she was naturally mild and compassionate to a miracle and gave specimens of her humanity and gratitude toward any thing that had obliged her for she would pray her nurse to give suck not only to other children but to her very playthings as it were courteously inviting them to her table and making the best cheer for them she could now my dear wife i see no reason why these and the like things which delighted us so much when she was alive should upon remembrance of them affect us when she is dead  it is but just that the same arguments which we have oftentimes used to others should prevail upon ourselves at this so seasonable a time and that we should not supinely sit down and overwhelm the joys we have tasted with a multiplicity of new griefs a virtuous woman ought thus to think with herself that the tempest of the mind in violent grief must be calmed by patience which does not entrench on the natural love of parents toward then children as many think but only struggles against disorderly and irregular passions for we allow this love of children to discover itself in lamenting wishing for and longing after them when they are dead but the excessive inclination to grief which carries people on to unseemly exclamations and furious behavior is no less culpable than luxurious intemperance yet reason seems to plead in its excuse because instead of pleasure sorrow is an ingredient of the crime what can be more irrational i pray than to check excessive laughter and yet give a free course to tears which flow from the same fountain  formerly you discovered on a like occasion great constancy of mind when you lost your eldest son and again when the lovely chron left us for i remember when the news was brought me of my sons death as i was returning home with some friends and guests when they beheld all things in order and observed a profound silence every where as they afterward declared to others they thought no such calamity had happened but that the report was false so discreetly had you settled the affairs of the house at that time when no small confusion and disorder might have been expected and yet you gave this son suck yourself and endured the lancing of your breast to prevent the ill effects of a contusion  these are things worthy of a generous woman that loves her children whereas we see most others receive them in their hands as playthings with a feminine mirth and jollity and afterward if they chance to die they drench themselves in excessive sorrow not that this is any effect of their love for that gentle passion acts regularly and discreetly it proceeds from a desire of vainglory mixed with a little natural affection which renders their mourning barbarous and extravagant which thing aesop knew very well when he tells the story of jupiters giving honors to the gods for it seems grief also made her demands and it was granted that she should be honored but only by those who were willing of their own accord to do it  and indeed this is the beginning of sorrow everybody first gives her free access and after she is once settled and become familiar she will not be forced thence with their best endeavors therefore she must be resisted at her first approach nor must we surrender the fort to her by any exterior signs whether of apparel or shaving the hair or any other such like symptoms of mournful weakness which by degrees so enervate the mind and reduce her to such streights that quite dejected and besieged with grief the poor timorous wretch dare not be merry or see the light or eat and drink in company the inconvenience is accompanied by a neglect of the body with whatsoever relates to the elegance of humane life  whereas on the contrary the soul when it is disordered ought to receive aid from the vigor of a healthful body for the sharpest edge of the souls grief is rebated when the body is in tranquillity like the sea in a calm but where from an ill course of diet the body becomes dry and hot so that it cannot supply the soul with commodious and serene spirits but only breathes forth melancholy vapors which annoy her with sadness there it is difficult for a man though never so willing to recover the tranquillity of his mind after it has been disturbed with so many evil affections  but that which is most to be dreaded in this case does not at all affrighten me to wit the visits of foolish women and their accompanying you in your tears and lamentations by which they sharpen grief not suffering it either of itself or by the help of others to fade and vanish away for i am not ignorant how great a combat you lately entered when you assisted the sister of theon and opposed the women who came running in with horrid cries bringing fuel as it were to her passion when men see their neighbors house on fire every one contributes his utmost to quench it but when they see the mind inflamed with furious passion they bring fuel to nourish and increase it when a mans eye is in pain he is not suffered to touch it though the inflammation provoke him to it nor will they that are near him meddle with it but he who is galled with grief sits and exposes his distemper to every one like waters that all may poach in and so that which at first seemed a light or trivial smart by much fretting and provoking becomes great and incurable  i would have you endeavor to call to mind that time when our daughter was not as yet born to us then joining that time with this argue thus with your self we are now in the same condition as then otherwise dear wife we shall seem discontented at the birth of our little daughter if we own that our circumstances were better before it the two years of her life are by no means to be forgotten by us but to be numbered amongst our blessings in that they afforded us an agreeable pleasure shall we not esteem a small good because of a great evil or shall we ungratefully complain against fortune for what she has actually given us because she has not added what we wish for  certainly to speak reverently of the gods and to bear our lot with an even mind without accusing fortune always brings with it a fair reward and he who in such a case calls prosperous things to mind and turning his thoughts from dark and melancholy objects fixes them on bright and cheerful ones will either quite extinguish his grief or by allaying it with contrary sentiments will render it more feeble  true happiness consists in the right counsels of the mind tending to its own constant establishment and the changes of fortune are of no great importance to the felicity of our life if we are governed by exterior things and with the vulgar have a regard to casualties we suffer any kind of men to be judges of our happiness it will certainly ill become us to accuse our life if like a book it has but one blot in it and all the rest be fair and candid  do not you therefore take notice of the tears and moans of such as visit you at present condoling your misfortune for their tears and sighs are but of course rather consider how happy every one of them esteemed you for the children you have the house you keep and the life you lead for it would be an ill thing while others covet your fortune though sullied with this affliction that you should exclaim against what you enjoy and not be sensible from the taste of affliction how grateful you ought to be for the happiness which remains untouched or like some who collecting all the defective verses of homer passed over at the same time so many excellent parts of his poems so shall we peevishly complain of and reckon up the inconveniences of our life neglecting the benefits thereof or shall we imitate covetous and sordid misers who having heaped together much riches never enjoy what they have in possession but bewail it inconsolably if it chance to be lost  but if you lament the poor girl because she died unmarried and without offspring you have wherewithal to comfort your self in that you are defective in none of these things having had your share and these are not to be esteemed great evils where they are wanted and small benefits where they are enjoyed so long as she is gone to a place where she feels no pain she has no need of our grief for what harm can befall us from her when she is free from all hurt and surely the loss of great things abates the grief when it is come to this that there is no more ground of grief or care for them but thy timoxena was deprived but of small matters for she had no knowledge but of such neither took she delight but in such small things how then can you say that that is taken from her which she never was sensible of and which never so much as entered into her thoughts  as for what you hear others say who persuade the vulgar that the soul when once freed from the body suffers no inconvenience or evil nor is sensible at all i know that you are better grounded in the doctrines delivered down to us from our ancestors for the religious symbols are well known to us who are of the fraternity therefore be assured that the soul being incapable of death suffers in the body in the same manner as birds that are kept in a cage wherefore even when we first receive our breath twere good to pass the gates of death before too great a love of earthly things be engendered in the soul and it become soft and tender by being used to the body and as it were incorporated with it     the plain dealer no  0  lectorem delectando pariterque monendo hor monday march        to the author of the plaindealer sir while i intended to have sent you an essay on plaindealing i fell into a conversation which furnished me with it and the narrative will be thought a more lively entertainment the society was composed of some of your old standard friends whose agreeable characters gave life to your understanding  i was carried thither to have the honor of being introduced to the plain dealer but it seems you were taking observations from your watchtower of barbican concerning which i make no doubt we shall hear something to our advantage and so as it happened i missed the pleasure which had been promised me however as your admirer i beg to be admitted into the number of your correspondents while i inform you that the company i met were the clergyman the critic major steadfast ned volatile and your own dear patty amble  the good gentleman in black took occasion from our speaking of the title of your paper to distinguish a plain dealer from a rough dealer that is a man whose knowledge and generosity inspire him with a delight in befriending mankind from the brutal impertinent whose ignorance but affects meaning and prompts him to suppose he appears wisest when most insufferably shocking the virtues of plain dealing said he are by awkard imitators debased into illmanners and inhumanity the brute who boasts of his bluntness is a loud censurer of other mens conduct and never right in his own  his eloquence is a froth of expression without depth or perspicuity  while his depravity mistakes brutalities for beauties the graces of human life are rejected by him as frailties because his own nature is impenetrably obdurate he calls obstinacy magnanimity compassion for the afflicted is a weakness in the mind and a readiness to forgive injuries an affectation or deficiency of spirit  the plain dealer refining nature by principle acts the inquisitor within himself and throws out a light of example as well as instruction upon the world  the former insults the unfortunate with censure but the latter reproaching only the proud and prosperous corrodes not the wounds of the afflicted by insisting on past and irretrievable miscarriges yet by some gentle allusion to their actions he awakens a reflection that can arm them for their future safety  we judge of things impartially upon a surprise by such comparison and condemning our own faults in others are forced to stand selfconvicted when the recoil is made upon our selves  but the barbarity of a profound pedant is still worse if possible than that of a shallow impertinent the ignorance of the one can only move us to contempt but the learning of the other provokes our detestation though envy may hurt genius by urging it in the disguise of flattery upon too ardent and improper essays yet in the dogmatizing pedant it has shocked worth much more fatally at its first setting out and extinguished a spirit which no encouragement could rekindle a pedant ungratefully turns that force to the discouragement of learning with which learning has armed him to make war against ignorance  while the plain dealer reproves he sets merits against errors and the luster of the one deepens the shade of the other to display but the dark side a man either damps him with a terror that incapacitates him for action or disgusts him into a stubborn indulgence of those follies he would otherwise have grown ashamed of roughness in conversation being like persecution in religion proselytes are gained soonest by a gentle manner of persuasion and i am pleased with a saying that is recorded of king henry the fourth of france  a drop of honey draws more flies than a spoonful of vinegar  in short the force of a fine instruction ought to strike like a flash of lightning as the subtilty of the one is said to dissolve the bone without bruising the flesh the other with a surprise of influence shoots remorse through the heart before the temper can be ruffled into a disposition to repulse it in this light a plain dealer is a father or rather a friend which is yet dearer  a father may leave us wealth and titles from which we may derive authority or distinction but such a friend can teach us to be wise and wisdom illustrates obscurity and adorns dignity with an eminence superior to that of fortune it vests us too with the noblest power for it enables us to govern our passions  alexander justly preferred his master aristotle to his father philip the king said he but made me a prince the philosopher made me a man  i observed that your dear patty amble delighting to talk much took little pleasure in giving attention but that lady urges her sexs privilege when she declares an antipathy to plain dealing ah cried the charming coquet how preferable is flattery to plain dealing i know that in the common cant flattery is said to be gross that it is called the craft of the courtier the seducer of beauty and the vain promiser of a happiness which it never means to bestow but let me tell you they had done it more justice had they called it the soother of discontent the refiner of fancy the imbellishment of conversation the very inspirer of polite pleasures  what a delicacy of delight should we lose were that odious plain dealing to prevail mr volatile would no longer give the tattling of a lady the complaisant term of liveliness nor the major soften our sexs levities with the pretty title of innocent amusements our expense in dress equipage masquerades and opera subscriptions would lose the agreeable name of taste for that hideous one of extravagance so that our darling modes of thinking which we have so long been told are owing to our reason and discernment would then be forced to wear a much more mortifying title and be called our downright vanity  i was willing to take the advantage of this pause but could not resist the pleasure of listening to that everrambling everagreeable tongue what lover continued the enchanting trifler would not rather be flattered into hope then abandoned to despair by plain dealing the coxcomb delightfully deceives himself by fancying our very denials to be tokens of our future favors the man of sense who when a lover is of course to be mistaken believes the charmer he admires has a wit as penetrating as her eyes and vain of the real worth he possesses becomes fool enough in his turn to think merit a recommendation to the ladies  thus when you flatter us you appear agreeable when we flatter you we secure our conquests and when we both flatter ourselves we consult and preserve our quiet these are pleasures which plain dealing would entirely deface and abolish  but madam cried ned volatile as beaus and ladies admire things for their novelty we men of speculation approve them most for their antiquity  a man of dress is pleased with a swordknot and canestring after the newest fashion while a virtuoso prefers a rusty roman javelin to the white wand of a lordtreasurer  the herald derives the honor of families from their antiquity and since there can be no doubt but flattery is more ancient it must therefore be more honorable than plain dealing  plain dealing interrupted the critic had been more gracefully drawn in the favorite character of mr wicherleys comedy if his good qualities remaining equally strong had been softened to appear more amiable but his judgment is mixed with partiality and his wit with illmanners he is impatient of contradiction and exceeds in selfconceitedness the very coxcombs he contemns  as a lover his indecency checks our regard and seems to justify the illusage which he meets with  could plaindealing observed the major be forgiven among the great it would both adorn and defend them on the contrary double dealing which is an accomplishment they are fond of has been more dangerous to princes than the most open rebellion had tarquin never trusted the dissimulation of the first brutus the expulsion of his race had been prevented and i think it may easily be determined by the unprejudiced how far the admired last of that name deviated from his boasted honesty when he conspired against the man whose interest he espoused and whose particular affection had pardoned promoted and confided in him when in the person of that godlike caesar he assassinated his father his friend and his preserver  i had now an opportunity to offer my sentiments in my turn and ventured to interpose as follows  were plain dealing a court virtue it would free great numbers from the misery of a vain dependence and avoid the resentment of those whom double dealing disappoints or makes instruments of greatness proves often too weak a protection for the meanest adversary may become considerable in mischief however an angry multitude may vary in their tempers their passions like different arrows carry all the same sharpness and are commonly pointed at one mark  upon the whole if wisdom is better than cunning if honesty may be allowed the safest principle of policy there is then this difference betwixt double dealing and plain dealing the one confounds families and kingdoms and renders the guilty when discovered detestable even in the grave the other confirms justice banishes distrust from correspondence strengthens friendship in private and in public is the mark of a patriot and will transmit the possessors memory to the affection of future ages  i am sir your most humble servant r s   the plain dealer no  0  vilius argentum est auro virtutibus aurum hor friday march         to the plaindealer middle temple march        sir i am a young fellow left by my parents without any provision besides that of a good education nor have i any prospect of fortune but what i may by the assistance of that hope to raise in my profession you will certainly think i had other business to mind than being in love and yet sir that is the cause of my present application  i must own myself not able to withstand the charms of a certain young lady who is one of your readers she is at once mistress of the greatest sense knowledge wit and sweetness of temper qualities each of which by itself possessed to that eminent degree she now enjoys them all were sufficient to make whomsoever she honors with her choice completely happy she has for some time admitted me to the favor of visiting her and treats me on all occasions with the greatest civility i have heard her often say she thought the law to which by this time you perceive i belong the most genteel and honorable of all professions that she never would marry for money  and a hundred such things that a young fellow as i am is naturally vain enough to construe into encouragements but sir she is a great fortune and you know what ridicule a young man without any meets with who makes addresses of that kind and comes off unsuccessfully  i desire therefore you would take an opportunity in one of your papers to let her know that if she has any such thoughts as my wishes have flattered my hopes into a suspicion of her advances ought to be a great deal more than is usually judged reasonable for while i have the least doubt of her inclinations i had rather die a thousand deaths than by a mistaken presumption run the hazard of losing what alone can make life valuable to  sir your very humble servant sylvio   the case of my correspondent is pretty nice and as this seems to be a matter of the greatest importance to both parties i think i cannot bestow a paper better than in taking it into consideration and in giving some advice that may be of service to all who are in the same circumstances  if we consider the affair of marriage as it is now generally carried on in the world there are innumerable difficulties which damp pursuits of that kind in a young fellow who let him deserve ever so well in other respects wants what the world alone esteems merit an estate  some of these difficulties arise from the women themselves  there are few among them to be found who have any notion of enjoyments beyond mere sensual gratifications a masquerade affords them infinitely more pleasure than the brightest conversation a diamond has more charms than any of the moral virtues and i doubt not there are some who for the sake of riding in a coach and six would yoke themselves with a verier beast than any in their own equipage let any one traffic with them for the dear delights of wealth they will buy even at the highest price  that is they will pay the purchase in what they prize most  themselves  and though hardly any match on these considerations alone has ever yet proved happy they still go on  notwithstanding they are sure to repent they never fail to make the choice  how wretched is the faithful youth since womens hearts were bought and sold they ask not vows of sacred truth whenever they sgh they sgh for gold other women there are indeed whose minds of a less mercenary cast consider only the merit of their admirers who are capable of receiving that love which flows from esteem and of tasting happiness from rational enjoyments but how few of these enjoy the liberty of choosing for themselves how many groan under the tyranny of an avaritious parent who would no more part with his daughter than his land to any but the best purchaser how would he scoff at a young mans impudence who instead of paying her price should pretend to talk of her happiness  from thus much of the sex then moneyless merit seems entirely excluded the woman who has liberty as well as capacity to make a prudent choice is the only one with whom we can hope success and here arise new difficulties from another side the men are now our hindrance and one in my correspondents circumstances must expect himself to suffer for the general ill character of his sex men daily show themselves as little disinterested in their pursuits as women age folly and ill nature are no impediments to them provided there be but money  love and esteem are so frequently used as pretenses while the real affection is only for the fortune that women are alarmed at the first approach and a young fellow dares hardly love where prudence only permits him to love without incurring the odious title of a fortunehunter  if therefore my correspondent sincerely feels within himself that disinterested affection which he seems to act by i would advise him to take all possible methods to convince the lady of it i need not direct him how for if he is sincere his passion will discover it self in every word and action but by no means let him be hasty in his addresses  with a lady of her sense his modesty will add much to his influence true love springs not upon a sudden and should he urge his wishes too far before her inclination has improved itself into affection she might rationally construe his forwardness to proceed from other motives than the genuine effects of his personal and disinterested admiration  on the other side i must take upon me to remind the young lady that time is more in haste than she is and i would advise her if she is as i presume at her own disposal and if she is satisfied of the merit as well as the affection of our young lawyer as one of the sense he ascribes to her may soon be not to demur upon his want of fortune happiness in marriage does not depend on suitableness of estates but of tempers if there be but a competency on one side no matter on which it lies  love indeed should be reciprocal but there is no necessity that fortune should there is this more to be considered that besides the happiness of an agreeable partner for life which she will enjoy in common with him she will have the addition of a superior satisfaction in the noble and everpleasing reflection that she has entitled herself as well to his gratitude as his love by exalting a man of worth into eminence and prosperity who otherwise for want only of that which she abounded in might have had his genius depressed and been lost in obscurity  to the plain dealer buttons covent garden march        sir this place which once was the celebrated seat of wit is now deserted by all that sort of company and transformed into an old bailey in miniature the classics are elbowed out by the constables and instead of poems or essays nothing is heard of here but warrants and commitments most of the good company is frightened away to make room for the grave and those who dare stay croudle about the fire when a magistrate enters with as much terror as if they saw a ghost i beg you would deal a little plainly with these men of authority and advise them to reflect on the illegality of putting his majestys peaceful subjects into bodily dread if not on the highway yet in places designed to be as public for they strut about the room and shoot out their mittimuss like porcupines quills so that unless among other poetical licenses wit can plead an exemption from their cognizance they are unfit for the gay worlds society and ought to live by themselves and you may assure them if they provoke us much more we will bring the dead lion to life again and doubt not but with a few days good feeding he will be able to treat masqueraders who flant it in his skin as an ancestor of his did their predecessor in aesop  i am sir your humble servant timoret   i find among the letters which came to my hand in the last packet one epistle of so extraordinary a kind that to confess a plain truth it exceeds my capacity to judge rightly concerning it  i am not a stranger to the tradition which carries so much weight with the seafaring part of his majestys liegepeople that the apes and monkies of africa can speak like men when they have a mind to it  yet i am naturally not over credulous but since i am told there are among the directors of the guinea company proofs to be met with which make the truth of it unquestionable i am almost persuaded to give myself up to the belief of a thing which seems indeed to be very clearly made out by my underwritten correspondent  worthy sir i am a native of the western africa a subject of the king of tombuto by species i am no more than a monkey but i am in a fair way to be made a man for a fine young lady of a great fortune is fallen desperately in love with me and prefers me in the most open manner before all her other admirers  but in the midst of this unhopd felicity comes a feathery fool called a parrot to a house that is just over against us and has tattled himself into such eminence that they talk of a project on foot to remove him very shortly into a house of much more distinction  the competition i have observed among your great men or persons of quality who shall bid most for this empty prater has provoked me to discover a talent which is concealed with all possible caution by the laws of our mimick species  in short i am forced to cry out shame on these peoples unreasonable partiality  if my fop of a rival was nearer a kin to them than i am i should not wonder at their preference but since nature has given it on my side and my shape my air my countenance and in particular my parts and disposition all concur to demonstrate my affinity to these unjust judges while poll with all his impertinence can pretend to no other resemblance than what lies in his fine clothes and everlasting prattling without knowing a word of his own meaning these things i say duly considered you will not i hope impute to envy what arises merely from a modest consciousness of my own virtues but exert yourself in the behalf of overlooked if not oppressed merit i am  worthy sir your most obedient servant pugg ps my mistress takes in your paper and likes you mightily  she had just called for a pen and ink to write you a letter about the last opera when a lady came and took her out and has left me this opportunity of sending my case to the plain dealer     the plain dealer no  0   falsis terroribus implet  hor monday march         among many letters i have lately received the two following will furnish my readers with no disagreeable entainment  to the plaindealer sir i am seldom negligent in my attendance at the coffeehouse upon those days when you favor the world with your lectures  you very prudently entertain us with a great deal of variety which is doubtless the most ready and infallible means of improvement for if you altogether treated about religious or moral duties you would be disregarded by your gay readers and relished only by your rational but as we are ignorant of what you will discourse till we take up your papers we may out of curiosity be unawares catched by an admonition in masquerade under the disguise of a mere amusement   you have indulged no obscene or immoral reflections but have on the contrary discountenanced vice and supported religion with vivacity and frankness of spirit consequently the inconsiderate may by degrees be awakened into an exertion of the thinking faculty by which chiefly we are distinguished and support our boasted superiority over the brutal creation a virtuous reader of your paper can at worst but be rendered cheerful without violation of his innocence  and your writings being generally pleasing and very often useful i flatter my self that men are not so abandoned to ignorance as we are ready to imagine since they give such a kind acceptance to you essays which have no mean or ungenerous gratifications to recommend them   i learn from your plain dealing to be inoffensive in conversation i observe all that passes wherever i happen to be and endeavor at the same time to contract or extend my self till i am grown fit for my company though by the way we should resolutely preserve this most reasonable steadiness on no account whatever to humor a friend at the expense of our health our reputation or our virtue friend did i say i retract the appellation  for certainly if we think right that person who solicites us to actions inconsistent with reason with honor or with decency is undeserving of so sublime a character  but this single exception allowed for we should condescend to appear blind to the weaknesses of those we converse with  and he who acts otherwise will justly incur the censure of an odious and scornful austerity  a mans first care should be to avoid the reproaches of his own heart and his second to escape the ill wishes of other people  we learn with delight from such plain dealing as yours that a wise mans business is to subdue the roughness of passion into the calmness of a tranquil humility and that the more his knowledge is enlarged the more he will perceive wanting to be searched after tully tells us the mind of a wise man never swells nor becomes elated for my own part i fancied my self when i was young to be acquaint with every thing but now i can perceive my learning contracted with a narrow circle and almost obscured in a dark point when compared with that infinite and inexhaustible number of subjects to which i am an utter stranger in a word i am convinced that an illgrounded conceitedness of our own abilities is the most contemptible weakness of nature and even where it may seem justified by our real merit it renders odious and supportable the very virtue which occasions it  but to make a transition from what i learn from you to an information i intend to give you there is a pretty maxim in the guardian to think with the wise but talk with the vulgar which occurred strongly to my memory upon observing with what pleasure your late cambridge letter concerning some little feminine exravagancies was received in all places  give me leave therefore to entertain you with a strange and fearful discovery which it was lately my fortune to make upon passing a night or two in a country village  it was in a ramble last harvest i had the honor to wait on a widow as well stored as the fields were in a kind of progress to visit her tenants   after dinner one day i left the good company with their honest entertainers the farmer and his narrative family to accompany the inhabitants of the yard and enjoy the silent serenity of a very beautiful prospect which was bounded by the shade of trees and hills with ruined buildings at a little distance from the cottage  i was envying the happiness and quiet of these unbusy people and had wandered as it were insensibly over half a dozen styles into the remoteness of a hollow sandy way where i stood with great delight to observe the fall of a pretty rill which gushing out from among the rushes above rolled down the sandy bank and shaped it self a passage along the bottom of the road i walked in the gloominess that was spread all round had fitted this place above all i had ever seen for the abode of fantastic melancholy and whilst i was busied in thoughts of this nature i saw a country woman hasten toward me who waved her hand as she came forward and cried out to me to walk on  for i was standing at gooddy hubbard s watering place   as soon as the good woman came near enough to be asked what she meant i found that gooddy hubbard was a witch that lived in the wood and that if any cow horse or other cattle staid long enough in that place to drink of its enchanted water all the hay they should eat from that time forward would be turned into crooked pins and the poor beasts must certainly die after it i begged she would go along with me to show me the witchs house to which proposition she replied with inexpressible consternation she would not for the world be so presumptuous she added that it was about half a mile off and shook her head and assured me that the whole village trembled at the sight of this goody hubbard that for her own part very lately as she was gleaning in a field by the woods side the witch had appeared to her out of the hedge in the shape of the leaf of a tree and ran along before her and played gambols over and over in her path all the way as she came home again  i asked her whether she had found any ill consequence after so terrible an accident and she answered with great innocence and gravity that she had but too much reason to believe she was bewitched having many strange and wicked thoughts running ever day in her head about things she had never been troubled with till that unfortunate leaf fell in her way since she was a maid or but little better  i could not resist the temptation which these silly stories left me under of making a visit to the formidable gooddy hubbard whom i found in a little hovel which the charity of the lord of the manor had ordered to be built for her in the wood because the honest people of the village having taken it into their heads to make a witch of the poor old woman fell upon her as often as she came in their way and had two or three times endangered her life by scratching her with their nails till every body had fetched blood of her as the phrase is after which it seems no witch in england has power to hurt a hair of any persons head who takes this effectual way to disarm her  i came off with no other damage than the loss of all the money i had in my pocket which the influence of downright compassion compelled me to leave behind for the comfort of an afflicted creature whose unsupported age and wretchedness instead of the relief or pity which was due to them by nature had procured her the malicious rage and persecution of unthinking ignorance  i returned to my widow and after a long and pleasant conversation on the subject of witchcraft agreed heartily with her that there were such things as witches and took upon me to assure with a sigh and a downcast eye that i had my self suffered so severely by one of them that i never expected to become my own man again though i should live to the age of a patriarch   i am mr plaindealer your very humble servant philotheus   to the plain dealer sir casting my eye upon horace i found this excellent piece of advice leges and perscrutabere doctos as i generally put in practice what i read in pursuance to his advice i sent for a set of your papers and am now carefully perusing them i take the same method that lawyers generally do with their reports read the modern cases first so go upward till they come to the fountainhead but when i light upon some of your female correspondents it puts me in mind of the roman ladies of old they resemble them so much in spirit and passion that i verily believe many of their great great grandmothers lie buried in the campus martius or the capitol it is not incredible that after caesar had first entered britain some of their legionary ladies upon the fame of the britons unwearied courage might make a second roman invasion and with as good success as caesar after he had opened a passage for them  livy some where tells us that when the old gentlemen of rome were contriving a scheme to have more of their ladies good company at home the women rose up in arms to the great surprise of the roman state that they denied the senators a free passage to the house and that cato by name had like to have been carried off by the mob they claimed as their ancient rights and undoubted privileges almost as strange things as your mistress does in her late scheme for establishing a female parliament however upon a parley between both parties the women submitted the case to the senate where they always carried the majority though it is well known no lady sat in house nor was that at all surprising for if we examine history i believe we shall find the senate at that time consisted more of wits than of wise men over whom for the sake of politeness the women must have most influence nor is it less probable that their being in arms might frighten the old gentlemen  the use of bribery likewise had then newly been found out and i dare say there was no lady who had not about her wherewithal to purchase a vote such was the courage of the roman ladies of old and how exactly our moderns imitate them is i believe too plain to need describing happy therefore it is and much for the peace of great britain that our parliament has never attempted the moderation of their exorbitant hoops or the abridgement of their pinmoney for my part i must frankly confess i have no objection to make against mrs patty ambles proposal other men may have their fears from the supposed consequences of a female parliament but i think they are out in their politics  if a power grows always weaker the more it is divided let me be a republican in love and choose rather to pay obebience to five hundred of these pretty commons that live a slave to one sole tyrant and neither enjoy nor dare talk of my liberty  alas sir this is exactly the present case of  your humble servant politicus   the plain dealer no  0  quid deceat quid non quo virtus quo ferat error hor friday march         i fell lately into company with a class of young poets who affect to be admirers of tasso and were extravagant in their praise of a simile in his gierusalemme where the devil maligning the success of the christian arms is said to bite his lips and spurn up the floor of hell in bellowing rage like a wild bull when the dogs are baiting him  they made me promise that i would give them my impartial opinion and because they earnestly press to know it i will borrow the reflections of a friend on the subject of similes in general which contain whatever i would say were i to speak concerning the nature of this great ornament to poetry than which there is nothing more capable of being made either delightful or ridiculous according as it is used discreetly or at random  the use which a poet ought to make of comparisons is to illustrate the object represented that is to enlighten and enlarge the apprehension of the reader the nature therefore of the thing which is compared must correspond exactly with what it is compared to there must not only be an apparent resemblance but a visible proportion a thing low and inconsiderable may be like enough to something great and magnificent but then wanting dignity to appear in its company no poet of judgment should submit to make use of it  i will give the reader an instance of a very remarkable fault of this kind  sir richard blackmore in his prince arthur has been pleased to compare the devil looking down from a mountain on the british camp to a toad on the border of a walk looking up at the gardener  while with malignant eyes the apostate viewed their host with octas message pleased he stood stung deep with malice and with envy torn while all his veins like aetnas furnace burn the veins of the devil i suppose were not so much owing to sir richards forgetfulness that he was describing a spirit as to a politic design of reducing satan to downright flesh and blood that the reader conceiving a more humble opinion of him than he had been taught in his infancy might be the better prepared for the toad in the comparison  and streams of fire from his red eye balls flowed like lightning breaking from a lowering cloud as when a toad squat on a border spies the gardener passing by his bloodshot eyes with spite and rage inflamed dart fire around the verdant walks and on the flowery ground the bloated vermin loathsome poison spits and swollen and bursting with his hatred sits so the fallen angel etc fallen indeed if no abler to do harm to sir richards hero than his toad to the gardener where is the terrible power the wily restless malice the insatiate revengeful application of this dangerous enemy to mankind in sir richards humble simile  a toad may be poisonous but then he may be trod upon which is by no means the case of the devil if a poet who introduces satan thus enraged would imagine a comparison to aggrandize the horror of his readers conception it must certainly arise from nothing which we are to look down upon no little venomous inconsiderable creature the elements should war together on such occasions as these the skies should blaze with lightning the world reel with earthquakes the sea rise to heaven the poles crack with thunder and all nature groan with variety of convulsions  toad poison squat bloated spits vermin loathsome swollen bursting what image can arise from such expressions as these which is either like or agreeable  to say truth no simile at all should have been introduced in the place i have been complaining against the natural conception of a reader can represent to his fancy the idea of the devil looking angry from a mountain much better than any common image of things known can represent it to his memory a comparison is never to be made but where the object to be described is less known or less conceivable than something else which being of equal grandeur and importance will also illustrate and rivet it on the understanding  the descriptions and similes which we meet with in milton give us quite other ideas of this dreadful rebelangel  scarce had he ceased when the superior fiend was moving towered the shore his pondrous shield behind him cast the broad circumference hung on his shoulders like the moon etc  his spear to equal which the tallest pine hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast of some great admiral were but a wand he walked with to support uneasy steps over the burning marl again forth came in order the infernal peers midst them their mighty paramount who seemed alone the antagonist of heaven nor less than hells dread emperor with pomp supreme and godlike imitated state him round a globe of fiery seraphim enclosed   and again  satan above the rest in shape and gesture proudly eminent stood like a tower nor yet his form appeared less than archangel ruined and the excess of glory obscured as when the sun newrisn shorn of his beams looks through the misty air deep scars of thunder had intrencd his face care on his faded cheeks sat under brows of dauntless courage and considerate pride   having named mr milton i am well enough aware that sir richard may endeavor a justification from that great poets example who has made use in another place of this very simile of a toad when he also is describing satan but pray observe with what difference as well in the occasion as the conduct  satan after having changed himself into many different shapes to avoid a discovery by those angelick guards which were placed about paradise is met with at last by one of the parties  so saying on he led his radiant files dazzling the moon these to the bower direct in search of whom they sought him there they found squat like a toad close at the ear of eve besides his necessity of providing against discovery of which he was in no danger in sir richards poem he takes the shape of a toad as most proper while eve was asleep to approach her closely concealed among the flowers and sweet herbs on which she lay  assaying by his devilish art to reach the organs of her fancy there to forge illusions as he lists  observe here that the devil is in no rage when thus compared but on the contrary under much terror and endeavoring to deceive and circumvent and therefore obliged in policy to assume that form which was rather suitable to his end than answerable to his power but when he appears in his proper likeness the very angels are represented as terrified and starting back with amazement  him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touched lightly for no falsehood can endure touch of celestial temper but returns perforce to its own likeness  up he starts discovered and surpised as when a spark lights on a nitrous heap the smutty grain with sudden blaze diffused inflames the air so started up in his own shape the fiend back stepped the two fair angels half amazed so sudden to behold the grisly king nothing of this is little nothing diminishing the whole is natural terrible majestic surprising and becoming the dignity of the subject it relates to  a simile should if possible be alike in all its parts it is enough that some one quality of the comparison resemble some one part or nature of the object it is compared to  homer has been infinitely guilty of this error hurried as it were away with the rapidity of his imagination he seldom staid to weigh any more of a simile than that very part of it which suited his purpose not mindful enough that upon starting an object to which many qualities are common the apprehension of the reader is not perhaps at leisure to examine which particular quality includes the resemblance and therefore discerns not any likeness at all but with such trouble and application as totally destroy the very end of a simile for if the design of this ornament be to illustrate a description it ought not certainly to be found obscure in itself  there is in the noble greek poet abovementioned a famous comparison of ajax who retreats slow from an overpowering crowd of trojans to an ass in an enclosure surrounded and beaten by the sticks of the village but walking gravely notwithstanding toward the gap he came in at and stopping very frequently to eat in his way monsieur dacier bossu and all the french critics who are not converts to monsieur peraults observations have taken a great deal of pains to justify this simile of homers but in my opinion they are all mistaken not only in the defense but in the very accusation it is not so much the ass that deserves blame since he was in those days a beast of great quality it is rather that the resemblance is partial where it ought to have been total  the stiff reluctant receding of ajax from his enemies is certainly well hit in the obstinacy of the ass but where is that part of the comparison which should enliven to our imaginations his frequent return to slaughter his impatience of soul that fierceness indignation and revengeful intrepidity which the poets description had also prepared us to expect in his simile the ass without doubt was loath to depart as ajax but he was neither so apt to be angry nor so dangerous if he became so  comparisons to conclude this reflection can never be proper in passions or violent emotions of mind the imagination is then too much transported and inflamed to cast about for cool resemblances but in the mouth of the poet that is to say in the course of the narration and not in the speeches they are beautiful and necessary they describe passion well though they do not express it and to say all in a word where description alone appears too weak to imprint an idea on the mind of a reader there the only effectual remedy is to have recourse to a simile  the plain dealer no  0   est mollis flamma medullas interea and tacitum vivit sub pectore vulnus virg monday march         since love which in both sexes is the most irresistible of our passions has its strongest influence on woman i could never observe that cruelty and malicious savageness of jealousy which actuates the ladies against those whom they consider as their rivals without inwardly lamenting the weakness of their minds who had rather be lovely than happy and while they torment their pretty hearts with a thousand alarms and suspicions never take it into their heads to discover that they hate the object of their resentment for only thinking and loving as they do and that what they are pursuing with revenge ought rather to be met with compassion  but the honor of the sexs reason generosity and moderation seems to be redeemed in this particular by the noble spirits of two ladies from one of which i have had the pleasure to receive a letter so entirely new and writ with so much natural force and sweetness that it is impossible the reader should not feel the same effect from it that i did  i suppress for the sake of modesty and not without some reluctance and mortification to my vanity an introductory paragraph filled with the most obliging and gentile praises of the plain dealer and hasten at once into the subject of the letter  i am led observes this charming correspondent to imagine friendship the favorite passion of your soul because your sentiments seem finely turned for it  mine too as far as its inferior faculties permit is truly sensible of and devoted to it  but i never felt it so forcibly as i did the other day in a visit which i made to a young lady a dear and intimate friend in the country  she retired from me not long since to indulge a silent grief which i and every body had taken notice of but which she had endeavored to conceal from her acquaintance with a care as earnest as it was vain for her eyes and altered complexion made it evident to all who loved her and therefore delighted to look on her that there was something at her heart too melancholy for solitude and yet too engaged for society  the privilege of our intimacy introduced me to her chamber without notice or ceremony where i found her writing and alone  the subject which her thoughts were filled with had fixed her in so profound an attention that it gave me freedom and opportunity to stand a while and observe the beautiful distress of her mind which was lost and labored in a meaning sadness and prevented her from seeing or supposing that there was any body so near her  never was sorrow so majestical so sweetly noble  her lively features were softened into a languishment that was lovelier than health and more charming than transport  her eyes seemed to have conspired against the purpose of her hands for they streamed down tears upon the paper as if they would efface the mournful words as fast as she had written them and now and then a sigh such as love alone inspires swelled her conscious and distracted bosom  at last she saw me and trembled  she rose in confusion and came forward to embrace me which while she was doing she pressed into my bosom the paper she had been writing and with a violent burst of tears breaking suddenly from my neck flew down a pair of backstairs into the garden and left me speechless with astonishment  i found the paper addressed to me and i leave you to imagine whether my surprise was at all abated when i perused in it the following discovery of the unguessd cause of my dear friends retirement  oh my everlovd  my faithful friend  my heart is flowing to you with such shame and confessing penitence as they who are serene enough to enjoy the comforts of devotion address allpitying heaven with  my misery is so truly great that nothing but the sin of having concealed a thought from you could have given it the least addition  but let me hasten to impart to you the only grief i could have had a reason for hiding from you  i love  oh how shall my confusion preserve strength to go on while i add  that it is  your husband  let his perfection plead for me if you start at this declaration  and oh confess what you have experienced so undeniably  that none could have seen him as i have without being as guilty as i am  i was dull enough to imagine that friendship having possessed my heart would have guarded it against love but oh that thought has lost me  it was the fatal happiness of being near you that discovered to me the beauties of his mind  his respectful tenderness for you his impartial and distinguishing affection for his children  his contempt of the proud and ignoble and his compassion for the friendless and unhappy  oh how fatally is he accomplished  and how deserving your affection  conceal from him oh my friend the knowledge that he has made me wretched for yet my eyes and my actions have been so watchfully guarded that he is as much a stranger to it as all the world but yourself from whom to have concealed it appeared to me as criminal as not to have concealed it from your husband  this only dreadful cause should have torn me from your loved society  suffer me here to bury myself in the innocence of solitude till absence or death shall have put an end to the tyranny with which love has triumphed over me  i know you are too generous to expect on this sad occasion any dull or mean excuses  where the will is not guilty the misfortune is sufficient atonement but though you have no pretense for pardoning i flatter myself you will weep for me and in pity now and then see your ever faithful unhappy friend etc  i leave her noble letter and the influence it had on my soul to your beautiful imagination mr plain dealer who may convert it to the use and pleasure of your readers  truth itself takes new graces from your pen and even trifles become of importance when you adapt em to your purposes  do me the honor of your advice on so tender an occasion and when i hear how i ought to have acted you shall know in a second letter how i really did act and its consequences  i am with all duty for methinks there is a kind of filial reverence due to such a plain dealer as you are  sir your most obedient humble servant angeletta   i confess there is something so peculiarly refined so great minded and so generous in both these ladies that i am lost in admiration  all that i am able to say under my present amazement is that the man must be infinitely happy who is so beloved by two such lovers  he will become the envy of my readers and i am afraid he is mine already  when i hear of such women as these i own i wish my self young again  there is a justifiable delight in the admiration of beauty thus glorified  these are the delicate spirits that adorn and ennoble history the virtues of such charmers will flow down and extend their conquests over the hearts of unborn posterity  let virgil if he pleases boast of his penthesileas and camillas and tasso of his clorindas  for my part i am no admirer of those martial ladies who have led armies and instead of increasing unpeopled kingdoms  let me adore the female greatness that can triumph over nature despise the motives of selflove and vanity and smile at the assaults of malice ingratitude or jealousy faults which sometimes are to be met with in the softest and fairest bosoms  i shall devote a future paper to reflection on these generous friends  i am now interrupted by a letter of so different a turn that what most vexes me concernining it is that this too was writ by a woman  to the plane deelaur sur i must infoorm you i am just mared to a husband as will not let me dow as i used and as i will dow in spite of his noze  i wud have him to no as i

which i hope will offend no party  i cannot but deplore the little care which our marriage adventurers seem to take of their happiness they are ready enough in their shorter journies to inquire what company and would choose solitude rather than bad  what bold man is there who has courage enough to travel with an ape or a nurse with three or four children loaded with bells rattles drums birdcalls and squeaking trumpets  yet all these are music when compared with the voice of mrs flutterwing  i would not accompany her one mile of the stage of life for all the gugaws in her shop  though i am thought to be old for a bachelor i have the utmost honor for the ladies but i hope this cannot be called one  i am so angry with her that i can write no more  the plain dealer no  0   dei quantum instar in illo  vida friday march         the czar of russia is dead  i tell it not as news but i speak it with astonishment  the greatest spirit that ever glorified and exalted humane nature has stepped out of time into eternity and yet the world looks still the same the sun shines not paler  the season advances and blooms out with its usual regularity and every thing above and below wears the very face which it was used to wear before the death of this almost adorable monarch seemed to call for a night of universal sadness upon the luster of created glory  alas how inconsiderable a wretch am i then  what imports it how a million of us common thinkers live or where or when we die  since this godlike establisher and adorner of empire can have left nature as unconcerned for him as he found her and the world which seemed to tremble under the weight of his living pressure bears no changes in her form or motion to distinguish such a death as his was  what a mortifying check upon the extravagance of humane ambition is the shortness of that life which must give limits to our noblest purposes  we are sure to expire by the natural course of our days before the event of any vast undertaking can have taught us to what end we labored  while we mediate the superstructure we sink and die upon the foundation and leave posterity the license of supposing examining and deciding upon our schemes and actions with a latitude which could it be foreknown would curb the sallies of great minds and teach heroic virtue to be ashamed of a reward so precarious as fame and so dependant on the disposition of souls too narrow to take in purposes where events are left imperfect  how infinite had been the progress of this prodigious princes glory could he have looked forward on such a length of life as was allotted to the ancient patriarchs  but in this as in all objects of reflection it is easy for us to trace the wisdom of almighty power that proportions blessings to necessities and neither grants nor withholds in vain but adapts whatever is to that which ough to be  in the early ages of the world when arts and qualities were yet unknown there was a visible necessity that men should live those many hundred years which now we think of with amazement because their ignorance required a frequent return of observation and connexions of reiterated experience to establish even the rudiments of all that variety of knowledge which served their posterity as scaffolding to stand upon and so by lifting them at once the whole height which themselves had climbed to made their business in life so much less that life required to be proportionably shorter  but be this as it will the most sparkling ornament of mortality is now become immortal  the soul of peter the great perhaps associates and compares itself with those of caesar and of alexander  there is scope enough upon the shoreless ocean of eternity for all its sails to spread themselves and make new way for ever into knowledge and discovery  this earth however large a part of it he honored with his influence restrained imprisoned and held short his genius  he seemed to struggle like a close cagd eagle for enlargement more proportioned to the vastness of his qualities  he was truly gods vicegerent and irradiated the human nature with such lively beamings of the divine that as he obeyed he resembled the deity  he could not indeed create men but he newmoulded and inspired them  detached and single attributes of virtues which met full and perfect in the russian monarchs character have eternized the memory of ancient heroes and swelled history with their praises  the invention of new arts the establishment of new laws the adornment or enrichment of their country the reducing barbarism into civilized society the encouragement of learning the punishment of oppression the deliverance of their own country or the conquest of others  each of these seperately has been thought sufficient in all ages to make and immortalize a hero  what name then shall the grateful world invent and bestow to distinguish the possessor of more than all these virtues united  let us consider him distinctly and impartially in the varied lights of his patience his application his wisdom his justice his generosity his aspiring magnanimity and the intrepid firmness of his invincible resolution  in every one of these views we shall see him equal with the noblest spirits of antiquity and in some of them superior to all who have been called great before him  what he has done can either never be equaled or equaled only by what he has suffered  to look back upon the beginning of a life of continued wonders what dangers reproaches rebellions and ingratitude did he not meet with at home and  abroad what insults contempt and mortifycation  yet such was the steadfast patience and moderation of his nature that instead of being inflamed by his pride into rash and sudden resentment he was only stimulated by his reason into a generous determination to make himself too dreadful for scorn and become the protector of his despisers  that arrogant contempt which was shown by the late king of swedens permission to the czar when he passed by riga in the beginning of his meaning travels let it be weighed against the godlike forgiveness generosity and noble compassion with which this very czar interposed afterward and even to the check of his own victories prevented the impending ruin of that king of swedens hostile country  let one of these considerations i say be weighed against the other and then point out any example from history of so amiable a greatness so sincere and sweet a magnanimity  let his application be measured by the success of his unwearied labors  they who look into russia as it now is and remember what it was within twenty years past will scarce believe themseves free from the influence of some enchantment when they see cities of sixty thousand houses covering the shore where so lately a few fishermen dried their nets  when they behold a sea filled with his ships of war whom they can remember when he was not master of one single harbor  when they see nature reduced by art to yield occasions she was most repugnant to  distant seas taught to incorporate mountains forced to give way to rivers new engines and arts of war as well offensive as defensive  new customs new trades new souls and a face of universal knowledge and politeness smiling in all parts of a land which was so lately overrun with the darkest ignorance and barbarity  and when they shall be told that all these astonishing changes are the mere effects of one mans prodigious and unbounded mind what less can they say in answer than that such a man had been a god could his body have been rendered but as immortal as his fame is  was there an oppressor in europe whom his resolution did not mortify or an injured or afflicted prince whom his generosity did not pity the wings of his aspiring eagle shadowed both extremes of the christian world and the turks looked with horror on the vengeance which they saw so near them  and in this only particular i am sorry to observe that the author of the northen star was less a prophet than he imagined  death intercepted the glorious race when the goal was just in view and left the greeks not yet so happy as that writer had foretold them

atonement for the false prophecy i have charged him with in the above cited verses i acknowledge that he was more truly a prophet in the czars attempt upon persia by way of the caspian sea  as also in the present design of discovering the northeast passage nothing of which had been heard of till long after that poem was written the first edition of which was published in the year       the virgin

thine i perceive by the advertisements that a third edition of this poem is about to be published it is needless therefore to quote more of it to the purpose mentioned but i will take the liberty however of concluding my paper with the end of it because it speaks but what i mean when i meditate the praise of that great monarch whom i have the honor to be writing of  thou russian star that make

struggling in clouds a while confusion lay then died at once  and lost it self in day the plain dealer no  0  multa gemens magnoque animum labefactus amore virg monday march         to the plain dealer sir there are none of your essays which more entitle you to my esteem than those which you have been inspired with by the most generous and gentle passion that acts on and adorns humanity  i need not tell you after this that the passion i mean is love  you have eonfessd yourself a lover and if you had not i should have guessed it by the warmth and spirit of your sentiments when you attempt any thing on that subject  a warmth and spirit mr plain dealer which agree so ill with your grand climacterick that if it were not for the implicit reverence with which i conclude myself mistaken when you assert what i find difficult to believe i should suppose your age as chimerical as your situation and no more look for you among the old than upon the watchtower of barbican  but let that pass no matter whether you are old or no since i will admit that you are venerable  i reverence you for that reverence with which you speak of love and the ladies the light world mr plain dealer have no taste for the refined ideas which almost deify this sacred passion but let me perish if i would exchange the enjoyment of my mistresss soul for the most unbounded property in her angelick body the blessing is fullest i confess when both these go together but the first without the last can give me tenderness endearment and the delight of sweet reflection whereas the last without the first would in spite of all its transports carry with it an unsatisfying and reluctant void of thought which would rob it of its finest relish for who would dare to think at all when if he thinks he must be sensible that he is receiving from an unconsenting heart the last and dearest obligation which can spring from love and gratitude  the cold and grave perhaps may think that there is levity in loving to such sweet excess as i do i too once thought as they think  but time and the remembered converse of a woman softer than the first ideas of her sexs innocence and wiser and more solid than their last reflections when they leave a world that flattered them have taught me that there is no joy on earth so real and so lasting as the union of a soul so charmed as mine is with the soul that has so charmed it  absence mr plain dealer and a thousand obstacles i dare not name have interposed their cruel influence and i have almost cause to fear my tenderness and constancy are doubted even by the lovely object of them and yet i never pass a moment which takes not its pain or pleasure chiefly from the part her everpresent image bears in the occasion the memory of her dear interest in me gives spirit to my hope mitigation to my sorrow and moderation to my anger if i fear it is for her and if i wish it is to make her happy  she alleviates all my cares and yet she quickens and increases them she is my business when i have leisure and my leisure when i am in the midst of business she is the paradox and riddle of my life i have the misfortune to live absent from her yet is she never out of my company i am not  must not  cannot be here is and yet am only here is for ever  i remember when i had the blessing of seeing her oftner i once painted my souls full meaning in the following copy of verses to her or something not much unlike them  be so good as to insert them she sometimes sees your paper and they may awaken the remembrance of a passion she perhaps relaxes from  i hope her soul does justice to the impression which mine glows with but let her thoughts of me be kind or less partial than they have been i must never expect the power which i am sure i shall never wish for of redeeming myself from that sweet captivity in which her image holds the heart of  sir her faithful lover and your servant constantius   to the lovely belladora sweet enslaver can you tell ever i learnt to love so well how my wishless hours could move all unbusied by my love it is amazement now to me what could then a pleasure be but since you smiled new sense to give from that sweet hour i feel i live oh what fires his bosom warm whom soul and body join to charm endless transports dance along nobly soft or sweetly strong flaming fancy cool reflection fierce desire and awed subjection aching hope  and fear increasing struggling passions never ceasing wishing trembling soul adoring everblest and still imploring tell the cold the dull the tame who these dear disorders blame tell em that in honors race charmed by some such heavenly face lovers still the foremost ran loves a second soul to man ease is languid low and base love excites an active chase glory wealth ambition wit thoughts for boundless empire fit all at loves approach are fired ever bent and never tired he who feels not loves sweet pain lives at ease  but lives in vain little dream you what is due angel form to love and you it is from you i joy possess it is by you my grief grows less sadly pensive when alone i the shades of life bemoan if some voice your name impart care lies lightened at my heart every woe disarms its sting and every starting hope takes wing when my fancy brings to view works which wealth or power could do all my spurred excitements wake and fortune charms me for your sake oh i cry twere heaven possessed to make her great who makes me blessed in the morning when i rise if the sunshine strikes my eyes all that pleases in its view is my hope twill show me you when the sable sweep of night drowns distinction from my sight i no inward darkness find you are daylight to my mind all my dreams are lives of joy which in waking i destroy you a slave to custom made are of empty forms afraid but your happier image free from fantastic tyranny independent kind and wise shuns restraint and knows no ties oh the dear delightful pain who that sleeps thus would wake again it is lucky for this pleasant spark that his poetry is more agreeable to me than his purpose  an extraordinary use truly he has found out to put the gravity of the plain dealer to if it were not some comfort that he appears to think like a modest lover i should have been out of all patience to have had my sobriety so artfully made a stalking horse to the amorous plots of these young fellows and their sweethearts who tell one another their minds under pretense of writing to the plain dealer but as it is i forgive the stratagem merely for the sake of the poetry which i own i am pleased with because it is natural and seems to have flowed from the heart which is a warmer inspirer than helicon  the plain dealer no  0  justum and tenacem propositi virum  hor friday april        designing to be grave to day on the sober subject of resolution i will bribe my readers attention to a discourse less gay than useful by telling them a short story in the very front of my paper  saladin the sultan of egypt though he had dominions enough of his own was always ready when occasion offered to make free with other peoples  at his return without success from the siege of mosoul in syria he seized into his hands the whole lordship of emessa in prejudice to the right of nasir eddin the young prince who claimed it and this he did upon pretense that the late father of the youth had forfeited by giving countenance to consederacies against the soldans interest  saladin however ordered that proper care should be taken of the injured princes education and being desirous to observe what progress he made in his studies he was brought one day before the sultan who asked him with much gravity in what part of the alcoran he was reading  i am come replied the young prince to the surprise of all who were near him to that verse which informs me that he who devours the estates of orphans is not a king but a tyrant  the sultan was much startled at the turn and spirit of his repartee but after some pause and recollection returned the youth this generous answer  he who speaks with such resolution would act with so much courage that i restore you to your fathers possessions lest i should be thought to stand in fear of a virtue which i only reverence  such an influence has firmness even in words and appearance but when reduced into practice it is productive of innumerable benefits so that were i to be asked by a man of sense which would be his shortest road to felicity my answer should be the path which leads through constancy and resolution no other road but this and no other guide than conscience can carry him through his journey and bring him safe to the end he aims at  resolution in life is like action in oratory as demosthenes described it it is the first second and third thing necessary the soul is endowed with three powerful faculties the understanding the memory and the will but with regard to moral life they all three lie dead without the help of resolution resolution is their parent their midwife and their nurse it first impregnates them with activity then delivers them in their labors and nourishes the effects of those labors with perseverance what imports it to know either the good or the proper if we forget or overlook that knowledge or to what end do we remember what is great and heroic in others if resolution does not conform our will to cooperate with our understanding  resolution therefore is the spiritual union of the minds best faculties and may not improperly be called the soul of the very soul itself  it exercises the understanding into meditation meditation gives life to memory and reduces good will into habit and habitual good will inspires the memory and understanding to break beautifully forth into a series of good actions  for this reason i have often reflected that we stand more in need of being reminded than of being taught and that whoever would lead men to be good that is to be happy should rather inspire them with resolution to do what they know to be right than to learn what it is to do rightly moral arguments should be chiefly applied to the memory and are incentives to the will rather than aids to the understanding  this is evident methinks from the following considerations wisdom as it regards practical life is no more than a faculty of discerning what is good from what is evil what is to be embraced and what rejected  now if the wisest man upon earth by the dint only of resolution could bring himself to practice what a man of the most moderate faculties comprehends and distinguishes he would indeed be a wise man according to the genuine signification but as the world goes were we strictly to measure the capacities even of the wisest by their actions we should be mortified into a necessity of considering this vast globe but as a stage full of busy fools with scarce a steady purpose among them and however the philosophers may have declared a vacuum an absurdity in nature we should plainly discover one in sense among the agents of the intellectual world we must therefore conclude that the fault lies not in the understanding but the will nor proceeds from want of knowledge but deficiency of firmness and resolution mr dryden speaking of men in their thinking and contemplative faculty says somewhere to the praise of the meanest writers that he never read any argument so indifferently handled out of which a wise man might not gather something that was valuable and cardinal richlieu has observed concerning active and political life that he knew many to whom the direction of great kingdoms might be happily committed in the morning whom yet in the afternoon he would scarce trust with the administration of his henroost  a little common thief knows he should not commit injustice and understands well enough when he commits it  but wanting resolution to be publicly needy rather than privately dishonest he deviates from the real good and ventures upon the appearing  how often has the judge acted the felon upon the bench and robbed before their faces who accuse robbers at his tribunal he dares commit the very crime which he is seated there to condemn but he wants resolution to despise the bribe though he has not the felons necessity to plead in excuse of it the poor thief in this case as silly as he looks at the bar stands in need of no instructor but the judge himself as wise as he appears in his furs wants a remembrancer at his elbow to put him in mind of his duty  common gamesters know so well the ignominy of giving false judgment at a public hazardtable that they have generally resolution enough to resist very great secret temptations that way and have seldom been found guilty though custom and not conscience is the motive of their forbearance but how little history need we read to know that we have had dispensers of equity who have been in the utmost necessity of plaindealing monitors not indeed to instruct them but to put them in mind that equity was not iniquity  we all of us know but few or none of us think  we distinguish not the things that lie before us through the mistiness of avarice or any other intervening passion it cannot be said that we are unable to see but that we see without discernment  the understanding has eyes but irresolution has jaundicd them  how does ambition reduce and mislead those whom we call wise men into awkward condescensions which make them cheap in the very eyes of the vulgar how often have we seen pride and insolence assume the flexure of the sneaking candidate in order to strut immediately after in the abuse of entrusted office the farce of doctor faustus has been represented as light and ridiculous because its plot is no more than that while the conjurer enjoys his wand he enjoys his wishes that wand converts every thing into the accomplishment of his purposes but no sooner is his term of holding that white staff expired than the conjuration expires with it and he is the poorest weakest most despairing and most abandoned wretch alive this every spectator sees through and laughs at and yet how happy might it have been for some other wandholders of this kingdom if that poor farce had been acted before them instead of their duller state interludes in order to serve as a useful memorial that they should not misuse those wands like faustus that is play tricks till their time is out and then be delivered up to the devil  as little men become great by resolution and great men degenerate into little ones without it so admonitions to those duties which every little man knows are necessary notwithstanding to the wisest of this alexanders father philip demonstrated himself very sensible that princes servant knew no doubt as well as his master that a king was no more than a man but philip mindful that high fortune had often made light heads forget themselves commanded this servant to wake him every morning by this wellknown lesson in his ear  remember thou art but a man  now many would be apt to imagine that little profit could arise from such constant repetition of this short and needless intimation yet sir francis bacon who knew well both the great world and the little has left us the following axiom concerning it all  monitorial precepts concerning kings are in effect comprehended in these two remembrances  remember thou art a man  remember thou art god s vicegerent the one bridleth their power the other their will  in truth if alexander had affected to be no more than he was the son of philip instead of aspiring to divinity and the title of ammon he would have more than conquered the world for he would have conquered the very conqueror of it  resolution then is the only means to make a man completely happy and frequent admonition serves to keep resolution alive the lowest can scarce stand in need of a moral instruction but the highest may be greatly indebted for admonition and consequently all young men who propose to make any figure in public employments should give ear to a plain dealer who dares put them in mind of their weakness  a man who has firmness enough to see the worst of his own soul will soon have the satisfaction to find the prospect much bettered he will learn patience in ill fortune and abstinence in good he will be fortified with resolution to be humble just and charitable amidst the strongest inflations and indulgements of prosperity and disdain to be found envious dejected or revengeful amidst the bitterest resentments and solicitations of calamity such a man shall not only preserve an inward tranquillity but whatever the color of his fortune may be he will owe a luster to himself and cast it round him upon others he will not only be followed but beloved in his prosperity and in his adversity he will be lamented  the plain dealer no  0  glaucumque medontaque thersilochumque virg monday april        to the plaindealer sir it is with no small expectation that i observe you in some of your papers making excursions into the province of criticism it is a subject not only entertaining but instructive and there is no kind of knowledge in which those gay spirits who are loudest and most ready in giving judgment are so contemptibly and lamentably deficient as in the art of judging rightly  two improvements might be hoped for in the taste of most readers from a more general propagation of the knowledge of distinguishing clearly we should neither be ashamed to praise the merit of the obscurest rest of our cotemporaries nor afraid to censure the errors of the most popular among ancient writers  homers famous catalogue of grecian ships and their commanders would then i am apt to believe cease to pass for one of his sublimest and most poetical beauties its geographieal exactness would no longer be pleaded as a balance against the dryness and tediousness of its historical enumeration since it is no part of a poets business to teach the situation bounds and quality of countries little occasional descriptions of that kind it is true may sometimes be necessary and being artfully introduced and handled might not only diversify a poem but also render it delightful without which last quality the whole labor is lost and nothing certainly can delight that is tiresom and heavy  but the bigotry of a succession of unpoetical commentators men of learning without genius has heaped upon this catalogue such profuse and illjudgd encomium that the whole herd of imitators from the tassos of italy down to the blackmores of britain have lengthened out their hostile musterrolls to the terror and provocation even of the most patient of their gentle readers and some of these have been fortunate enough to meet with applause more extravagant even than homers for they have been compared with and preferred to homers witness ben johnsons commendatory vision printed before the old edition of drayton s battle of agincourt  there thou art homer  pray thee use the style thou have deserved and let me read the while thy cataloue of ships cxceeding his the catalogue here meant is of those ships which transported the english forces in our henry the fifths first attempt upon france  i will entertain the reader with this so highly applauded catalogue because it may deserve to stand as a proof what poor products we are to expect from a servile and implicit imitation  and first seven ships from rochester are sent the bonadventure george and the expense antilope henry elephant defense bottoms as good as ever spread a clue all having charge their voyge having been before southampton to take soldiers in twelve merchant ships of mighty burden all new off the stocks that had been rigged for stoad riding in thames by limehouse and blackwall that ready

radiant sun showed as if all the sea had been on flame then skiffs crays scallops and the like why these from every small creek covered all the seas this though a bald and unlovely imitation of homer is better i think in one sense than the original by so much as it is shorter for no man of reason will be persuaded to believe that in a poem of this kind such a tedious and dry list of a fleet though it preserves a particular piece of antiquity which is the commentators weak defense for homer can stand agreeably in the place of invention spirit fancy and the energy of poetry  such a barren and distinct enumeration gives a wearisom satiety to the mind and drags too hard on the attention when i read for so many leaves together not what persons do but who they are and whence they came without any of that enlivening variety of circumstance or description which should relieve the imagination it puts me in mind of our ancestors simple epitaphs honest people who thought it merit enough to have

north   among all these copious particularities there is nothing that deserved the telling if we except the great rarity that comes in the rear a man made a lord for his virtue that indeed must be owned to have been a wonder worth recording it was considered too it seems as an accident so unusual that the good man appears by the last verse to have been ashamed of his singularity and rather chose to stick fast to his old knightly title of sir edward than be pointed at as he passed the streets for a kind of miracle but here follows something which no poets list among them all can compare

i have been speaking of has as little to say for the actions of the greatest part of his captains as these very exact epitaphs for the olivers alices joans and andrews who occasioned them  i am sir your constant reader and humble servant etc   the plain dealer no   0 nos populo damus  sen friday april        to the author of the plaindealer oh dear mr plain dealer many a lady has been charmed into a passion for her future lover upon sight only of his picture but my fate is the very reverse of this for before i saw the picture of my florello i was almost in love with the original whereas now i am fallen absolutely in love with the picture and can scarce bear the sight of that odious lover of mine who sat for it  the picture you must know is a kind of paradox for it is drawn but in black and white and yet glows with the liveliest force and most natural mixture of strong coloring it is one of a valuable collection which was exposed to public sale last week under title of the universal passion part ii  would to heaven i knew the painter a hand so exquisite at touching should take me as often as i could possibly sit to him nay i would sooner be drawn by him than by apelles or titian or lilly or vandike or by any pencil ancient or modern except that only to which we owe so many envyraising pictures of my friend mrs arabella farmor  not but there is infinite difference between the two pieces and the lines indeed are strikingly distinguished in both  in the ladys they are sweet soft delicate in my florellos they are strong bold glaring florellos very life is not half so lively as this fine painters speaking representation of it  see the figure and the spirit the grace and passion of the picture  of late at whites was young florello seen how blank his look how discomposed his mien in grief sincere so hard it proves to feign sunk were his spirits for his coat was plain next day his breast regained its wonted peace his health was mended with a silver lace a curious artist long inured to toils of gentler sort with combs and fragrant oils whether by chance or by some god inspired so touched his curls his mighty soul was fired the wellswoln ties an equal homage claim and either shoulder has its share of fame his sumptuous watchcase though concealed it lies like a good conscience solid joys supplies he only thinks himself so far from vain st  pe in wit in breeding d  l  ne whenever by seeming chance he throws his eye on mirrors flushing with his tyrian dye with how sublime a transport leaps his heart but fate ordains that dearest friends must part in active measures brought from france he wheels and triumphs conscious of his learned heels to deal plainly with the plain dealer just after i had been reading this mortifying description of the man whom i had been weak enough to feel some little tenderness for his evil genius danced in with him and i blushed to my very forehead to reflect that i should owe to the lively painting of a satire my first discovery that the florello who had been so intimately my acquaintance was the reverse of a fine gentleman  pray publish this extraordinary cure in justice to the skill and reputation of the learned doctor who effected it and assist thereby the good wishes and the gratitude of  dear mr plain dealer your unknown humble servant clarastella   friday march         mr plaindealer as you are a gentleman of penetration and capable of rendering every thing that is offered to you in a brighter capacity than i am which occurred to me upon reading your paper of friday march the   th in relation to pugg s complaint against that feathery fool called a parrot in a house that is just over against him i i desire that in your next you would only give caution to a certain lady whose lodgings are opposite to mine that she does not indulge pugg as i have seen her in all that provoking and unmerited freedom of pawing her upon the mouth and bosom flesh and blood mr plain dealer is not able to bear it and if we must not cast the food of man to dogs i am sure it is much less lawful to bestow his right upon an ugly monkey  in short i am out of all manner of patience and if this lady will not be so kind as to keep my rival out of my sight i must be forced to brick up my windows or remove to a new lodging for i would not methinks be so unreasonable as to quarrel with pugg himself about it since he looks to confess the truth as if he was born to be the ladys favorite  i am sir your afflicted reader p a   march         sir you will much oblige one of your constant readers and very great admirers if you will but answer me this quere viz in your excellent plain dealer of august the   th      no    treating of love wherein is contained part of that lovely poem on the same subject i find these lines absent from her in whom alone we live life grows a bankrupt and no bliss can give friends are importunate and pleasures lost etc   now all the question is whether that is not a mistake of the printers putting importunate for impertinent or whether i in justice to you for giving this trouble should not write myself  wantof wit   to a lover who retires to solitude for a quiet and uninterrupted indulgment of his passion the very civilities and good offices of friendship are unwelcome and the pressure of them is importunately troublesome and this was doubtless the sense in which the author of that poem made use of the word importunate  impertinent had been less applicable as well as less elegant because it is the duty of a friend to be solicitous in advising and comforting us however uneasy he makes us by the effect of his disrelishd intention so that my correspondent will name himself more justly if in the next letter he favors me with he changes his subscription from wantofwit only to wantofattention  to the plain dealer sir i have perceived quite through the course of your papers that your tendency is not only to delight your readers but to inform and refine them upon this consideration i must persuade myself you will set the following subject in the strongest light which the more effectually to recommend it to you i assure you it is not fictitious but real matter of fact  there is a certain widow who has two sons and two daughters the former of which are arrived to the state which writes them men both brought up to creditable employments but neither of them capable of proceeding in their business without her assistance which though very able to give she refuses them  you will be more than a little surprised when i tell you there is a person beyond description rustical and unlovely who makes his awkward addresses to the wealth of this widow and that this is the consideration which she prefers to the welfare of her children who have urged her on their knees to regard not only their good but what the world will say of herself  deaf to all their intercessions she continually repulses them and is unalterably determined on her own and their ruin  now i would beg of you to tell me what motive can induce her to this and to account for it in a physical manner should not the moving wants and dependence of her own children prevail more upon her nature than the interested addresses of a stranger for i am afraid there are no incentives to love on either side and i am loath to give it its other name if sir you insert this as soon as you can in your paper you may do a real good and at the same time you will oblige one of your constanr readers  i am sir etc   my good friend tony jyngle whom i have not seen till lately since the death of sir portly rufus of which i gave my readers the melancholy history in one of my former papers was just come to visit me as i had received this letter from the publisher and upon hearing it read told me with much force of politeness and penetration that there were certain politic reasons against accounting in a physical manner for the motive which induces this unmanageable widow but he was of opinion it might do as as well if i accounted for it poetically and to that end he favored me within fifteen minutes and a half quarter with the following copy of verses which he intitles womans resolution oh  cried arsenia long in wedlock blessed her head reclining on her husbands breast should death divide thee from thy doting wife what comfort could be found in widowed life how the thought shakes me  heaven my strephon save or give the lost arsenia half his grave jove heard the lovely mourner and approved and should not wives like this said he be loved take the soft sorrower at her word and try how deeply rooted womans vows can lie twas said and done  the tender strephon died arsenia two long months  to outlive him tried but in the third  alas  became a bride   the plain dealer no      jovis omnia plena  virg monday april         to the author of the plain dealer sir the astonishing structure the immense but beautiful extent and order of creation demand not the notice only but the veneration of every reasonable being no less than infinite wisdom could conceive the plan nor less than almighty power erect the fabric our sight is struck with amazement when we look but upon a stately building the mere effect of human invention and yet to the shame of our stupidity be it spoken we can consider the earth we live on with indifference  we can walk under the lamps of heaven without being enlightened by the smallest glimmering of divine reflection nor to many do they argue any thing greater than chance which in other words is nothing  yet certainly no knowledge can be so delightful to the soul as this which is at the same time the noblest and most useful that can busy us in our short pilgrimage through the body nay the excellent mr ray has very pleasingly imagined that it may be part of our business and employment to all eternity to discover still deeper and deeper into the unfathomable works of god and contemplate the glory of his wisdom power and goodness  i am sensible you concur with me that the honor due to god should excite the noblest of our thoughts and actions because you have endeavored to make our lives in their good purposes and their luster resemble the celestial bodies and move for their own and for others benefit and since you have not refused to exert your genius toward refining enlarging and advancing our ideas of divine greatness so doubtless you will oblige your readers in the sequel of this letter with a trace of reflections for which we are indebted to the author of that excellent discourse the religion of nature delineated  i am sir your humble servant philotheus   what a vast field for contemplation is opened in those regions of matter about us in which there is not the least particle but carries with it an argument of gods existence not the smallest trifle but shows it nor the slightest motion produced the softest whisper of the air but tells it  the frame and constitution of the world the astonishing magnificence of it the various kinds of beings and the constancy observed in the productions of things and the uses for which they are produced do all show that there is some almighty designer at the top of all these things such marks they bear of his power and wisdom  in order to prove to any doubter the the grandeur of this fabric we need only bid him consider the sun with that insupportable glory that surrounds it the vast distance magnitude and heat of it the planets periodically moving in their several orbits about it with all their regular variety of aspects guarded some of them by secondary planets and as it were emulating the state of the sun and probably all these possessed by distinct and proper inhabitants  let him think of those surprising visits the comets make us the large trains of uncommon splendour which attend them the far country they come from and the curiosity and horror they excite not only among us but in the inhabitants of the worlds about us who also may be up as we are to see the entry and progress of these new ministers of the almighty  let him direct his eye and contemplation through those azure regions above him up to the fixed stars that radiant and numberless host of heaven and reflect but how unlikely it is that they should be placed there only to adorn and bespangle our canopy he will then instruct himself that they are so many other suns with their several regions and and dependant planets about them he will further discern by the help of glasses still more and more of these fixed lights and exalt himself to an apprehension of their unaccountable numbers and of the immensity of those spaces that lie retired beyond not our ken only but even our imagination  here on light fancys saily wings i rise awed and confounded through deep wilds of air millions of opening wonders strike my eyes and reasons finite view is dazzled there globes behind globes unnumberd hence appear the twinkling stars that from dim earth remote seem heavnset gems and scattered seeds of day here buoyant worlds midst seas of ether flote and over blue kingdoms hold a fiery sway in distant orbits round each reigning star huge earths and moons their cirly homage pay millions of countless miles are lost between and sickening thought grows tired to stretch so far how brightly vast each concave sphere is seen the enormous vaults with wheeling worlds glow round rolling oblique yet none their paths confound their crossing currents cause no clashing jars nor one the others progress bars wide round their central suns their tours they make yet no proud planet dares his line forsake partial an intercepted ray to break they take and lend by turns the streaming light and form in solemn silence day and night we need only consider these things which are now known almost to every body and by them we shall be taught that a structure so infinite must be the work of an infinite architect  but if we could take a particular view of all that astonishing compass which we have thus hastily run over how would wonders multiply upon us every part of every world is as it were made up of other worlds if we examine this our earth what scope is here for admiration  what variety of mountains hills valleys plains rivers seas trees plants what numberless tribes of different animals is it stocked with how unwearied are the inventions and works of one of these which is man and yet when they are all surveyed as nicely as they can be whether by our unassisted senses or the help of telescopical glasses the assistance of microscopes in the smallest parts of matter will go on to discover as many new wonders as those which have already been made known to us new kingdoms of animals new architecture and curiosity of workmanship and economy so that as before our conception fainted in those boundless journeys we were obliged to take through the expansive vastness of the universe here on the other hand we tire ourselves with fruitless researches into the principles and constituent parts of it both the beginnings and the end of things the least and the greatest all conspire to perplex us and which every way we prosecute our inquiries we still fall in with fresh subjects of amazement and fresh reasons to believe that there are more and more behind that will for ever escape our eagerest and most successful penetration we have philosophy indeed but the misfortune is it dwells but in the surface of nature   it appears then plainly enough in the parts and model of the world that there is a contrivance and a respect to certain reasons and ends why else is the sun posited near the middle of our system but for the more convenient dispensing of his influence to the planets moving about him why else does the plan of the earths equator intersect that of her orbit and make a proper angle with it but in order to diversify the year and create a useful variety of seasons many other things of this kind though a thousand times repeated will be always delightful observations to good men and true scholars none of whom can observe those vapors which ascend from the sea to meet in clouds above and fall back again after condensation without understanding the purpose of this providential distillation to be a division of the water from its grosser salts that by rains and dews it may return upon and supply the fountains and refreshing rivers nourishing the vegetables by showers which therefore descend not in cataracts but kindly drops as from a waterpot upon a garden  who can view the structure of a plant or an animal the indefinite number of their fibers and fine vessels their dependence upon larger and the several members upon them and the apt disposition of all these the provision that is made for reception and distribution of nourishment the effect of this nourishment in extension of the vessels stretching the vegetable or animal gradually to its full and determinate growth maintaining the motion of the several fluids repairing the decays of the body and comforting and preserving life who can take notice of the various faculties of animals their arts of saving and providing for themselves or the means by which they are provided for the uses of plants to animals and of some animals to others and of the generality of them to mankind the propagation of the several species out of their proper seeds without confusion the strong inclinations implanted for that purpose and the tenderness even of the fiercest to their young who i say can view all this and not confess a design and an omnipotent designer the meanest insect which scarce appears at all to our naked eye will when viewed through a microscope present a prospect a thousand times more curious and surprising than the finest piece of mechanism that ever was made by man for my own part as i cannot but acknowledge that i am fearfully and wonderfully formed i likewise believe as firmly that some superintendent hand has conducted and protected me from my birth to this present moment or that in the words of the most sacred of all writings  there is a god in whom i live move and have my being  who then that judges of this god by his works and his mercy will be afraid of that death which must bring us one stage nearer him nay who knows but that what we call death may be our real and proper life and this which we think our life a kind of dark and dreaming interval which death only comes to awaken and redeem us from for my part i look forward on the hour of my dissolution with the hope and expectation of escaping mariners who having been sinking all night long in a rudderless and foundring vessel discover with the dawn of the morning the opening coast of some lovely though unknown country i support life as my duty rather than enjoy it as my wish and will borrow another stanza from the same poem whence i took that above to express the sentiments i feel in my self after such a trace of serious reflections as those which compose this paper  but murmur not proud heart if here delayed a wandering pilgrim through this lifes cold shade i must not yet in heavens wide search rejoice o be the will of god not mine obeyed wait my impatient soul his wiser choice trust the strong hand by which those worlds were made and to his pleasure tune thy willing voice if i not yet shake off this earthly load sure there is business worth my lifes best aim and he who tires though on a lengthening road is faintly sould nor inns at last in fame for me suffice it to have taught my muse the tuneful triflings of our tribe to shun and raised her warmth such heavenly themes to choose as in past ages her best garlands won he who beyond the power of man could write would still fall short of him who acted well to flow in sound or turn a period right is but in fairy towers of praise to dwell but wrongs to pardon or good deeds requite is in substantial meaning to excel what though my wishes strain beyond my power that should but urge my speed to reach its goal whence on the wretched i may comfort shower and with eased pity feast my hungry soul be action then henceforth my lifes wide sphere oh there are things my heart even burns to do all has been said that is worth a wise mans ear but much may be performed that is greatly new the plain dealer no     quid mentem traxisse polo quid profuit altum erexisse caput pecudum si more pererrant claud friday april         i am though a great lover of trade a declared enemy to the company of vintners and profess that my indignation daily rises against them more and more in proportion as they daily deviate from their first laudable institution taverns were intended at their primitive erection as public refectories where men whose business called them abroad from their families and single gentlemen who had no familes at all might resort for a cheerful and necessary refreshment so that taverns stood in this town for much the same end as inns are commodiously situated up and down the country but by the use they are now converted to men are not refreshed there but debauched and taken off from the pursuit of their business  i was led into this subject on the eve of a late drunken holiday when returning home in a melancholy disposition at a later hour than usual i was unexpectedly saluted with an unlucky piece of news that a kinsman who notwithstanding all that a famous predecessor of mine had wittily remarked in ridicule of that silly practice would try to drive to himself home on the coachbox when he was scarce able to get into the coach without the help of its proper driver had by the way got so dangerous a fall that he was thrown almost out of the world and just as i was plunged into a profound meditation on this ill accident word was brought me that literatus and urbanus two bosom intimates having drank together to excess the latter lost his civility and the former his wits so far as to push on a dispute about a mere trifle till one of them was killed and his friend and murderer left behind to imbitter his surviving days with a remorse which the others death was preserable to  i was lost in the startling thought how dreadful it must be to drop out of a temporary into an eternal existence in so deplorable and unprepared a state which brought immediately to my remembrance what the old king says to hamlet in the tragedy  thus was i  cut off even in the blossoms of my sin no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head oh horrible most horrible this sensible and moving complaint so awfully placed in the mouth of a ghost strikes a considerate auditor with terror and leaves him warned and astonished but there is a scene in a comedy called the lying lovers that comes more immediately to this subject of a gentlemans stabbing his friend in the fury of his drunkenness and which if it had been read or heard with attention by urbanus would probably have prevented his own becoming a too real example of this unhappy truth that a man who in the present moment is master of the strongest reason possessor of the greatest honor and adorned with the finest sentiments of religion friendship and humanity may in two or three hours drinking be pushed forward by the rage of wine to act unheard of brutalities in direct opposition to the impulse of all its virtues i recommend this useful scene to the perusal of those endangered adventurers who are apt to be quarrelsome in their cups and yet dare rashly addict themselves to an habitual intemperance  the fatigue of so melancholy a meditation cast me into a disordered kind of sleep in which it furnished me as shakespeare says with the stuff of which dreams are made my imagination working busily upon the traces of my waking thoughts brought me into the company of a hoary and venerable matron whose eyes were so piercing bright that they seemed to have increased by age their faculty of penetration she told me that her name was caution and bidding me follow her she conducted me as the prophetess did aeneas into one of the regions of the nether world where the shades of all those who depart this life in the guilt of their debauches are doomed to inhabit  i found my self without being able to describe the method of my speedy conveyance thither in a vast place like an island encompassed with a moat of liquid fire where different crowds of people were under the torment of being forced to drink every moment till they were deprived of their senses and betrayed into extravagancies which never failed to fill their hearts with pain and remorse for some enormous transgression or other committed by them when so disordered  then the fury that administered the liquor had a power of recovering them by representing their past actions in a glass that served them instead of memory  when they had suffered the full pangs of sobriety and pained their observation with what they might have been and what they were the fury drenched them afresh with the intoxicating tide of torture and this was the repetition of a life whose circle composed a round of misery that never was to know an end each crowd was thus attended by some deputy of infernal vengeance  the first i took notice of was a company of gentlemen who before they began to drink were of robust make of body they had sanguine complexions and carried health in their whole appearance before these a devil in the dress of a drawer had placed a vast barrel of liquor of which when each had got his dose the effects of the poison began to work differently upon these poor patients that seemed lately in a state so florid some that were of the most gigantick size like father dominick in the spanish friar sunk two yards and a half in the wetting others again who were thin men were bloated by dropsies into the dimensions which the former had shrunk from  they who just before had vigor enough to outvoice their own huntinghorns were by a dose or two of that strange alterative liquor brought to squeak like those pipes which the boys make of an oatstraw  they who used to leap fivebargates quicksethedges and parkpalings could not wag a hand or a foot without crying out of the gout or the rheumatism these had been called in the world country squires and were active men in their time at the hunting down of a fox or crying up of a burgess  but it was dismal to behold what faces they made now when the fury showed them their own figures in the startling glass of reflection  the next place that old mother caution conducted me to was a gloomy walk which the farther we penetrated into it was the deeper darkened with the shade of juniper and eugh trees in the midst was a little thatched house as full as it could hold of earthen vessels stored with a juice that was but one remove from poison the poor wretches who frequented this dark hovel where mostly english and pleaded the privililege of their liberty for getting rid of their senses as freely as their countrymen of higher quality who paid dearer for the same right in proportion to their better circumstances and dealt in poisons of a slower operation many customers went in here but half dressed and came out again naked most of them labored under miseries and diseases without a name and some of them endeavored to hang themselves on the trees that gave a name to the fatal liquor   but i was transported in the next place i came to and flattered my imagination that i was got out of the infernal regions into those which were formed for delight and by the ancients called the elysian fields i was led into a noble edifice adorned with the most magnificent furniture gildings sculptures paintings glasssconces with hundreds of wax tapers lighted in them the roofs ecchoed and resounded with the finest music that could arise from the most elegant variety of the sweetest instruments here was an assembly of the most active and fineshapd gentlemen together with a set of the most seemingly modest and beautiful women that ever my eyes beheld  when immediately two devils in masquerade appeared to the company with the most complaisant and inviting airs imaginable  one of them led the gentlemen to a luxurious table adorned with crystals replenished with the strongest and richest wines of all growths and climates and dealt glasses round with profusion the other which was a she devil conducted the ladies in like manner to another table richly ornamented with silver equipages and vases of the finest china which were filled as she pretended with liquors that promoted sobriety but had really so different an effect that the fumes and vapors arising from their brimmers forced me to remove to a greater distance  this drinking scene being finished the word was given to mask and dance  but instead of forming a regular motion the whole company male and female without distinction of sex age or condition fell jumbled into one promiscuous heap upon which ensued horrid outcries and a confused clash of swords from men who were murdering one another about daughters wives and sisters so that in a moment methought like the shifting of a scene in dr faustus this fine apartment was changed into an hospital distinguished into little closets like cells  in these unhappy little cells were ladies under a course of torment a fury always holding before their eyes a picture of their departed beauty i took notice of one whose picture represented the smoothest satin skin with the finest tincture imaginable while the blubbering original was melting away in tears with cheeks swelled into carbuncles and spotted over with purple pimples another whose portrait displayed a loveliness almost angelical was staring on it with bloodshot eyes and a face so distorted with convulsions that she looked methought more frightful than the fury that attended her  i begged of caution to let me retreat from this melancholy mansion because it filled me with more horror than i was able to support to see the effects of such seeming pleasantry producing despair and real misery and such alluring beauty betrayed into such hideous and frightful deformity  caution was so obliging as to grant my petition in part but told me that as i must carry warning with me when i returned to the upper regions she was under a necessity of conducting me to several other places this made it impossible for me to hasten out of my dream and will not i hope expose me to the censure which we old people sometimes lie under of being tedious in our storytelling and talking rather by rule than by measure  in short i find i must dream on till i come to the end of my next paper  the plain dealer no      tollite barbarum morem verecundumque bacchum sanguineis prohibete rixis hor monday april         the vision continued i was as much deceived in the next place that old mother caution conveyed me to as i had been in the last  a magnificent square opened to my view whose four sides were formed by the finest architecture those stately palaces my guide told me were inhabited by persons of the highest rank and fortune and who were reckoned to have the most delicate taste of living she carried me into one that appeared the noblest in the quadrangle and there from a window toward the garden which is situated on an eminence that borders on delicious fields and commands an opening extent of country she showed me by the help of a prospective glass a dozen fair manortowns all surrounded by a pleasant variety of hills and dales plains and woods green meadows and corn fields richly waving with a promised harvest gardens and sweet parterres with fish ponds and canals that glittered through the trees all which she said was but a small portion of the earth enjoyed by this son of fortune who was master of that fine palace we stood in  this house had been it seems every day in the afternoon and every night and all the night long crowded from top to bottom with people of all sexes ages and countries who provided they had the merit of wanting nothing were welcome to partake of all the abundance of this place where nothing appeared but what was noble and delightful the earth from pole to pole was ransacked as were the air and water to supply this house with delicacies  but the owner who gloried in his hospitality without esteeming any one of his guests but in proportion as he professed an admiration of this ostentatious magnificence of living valued himself most upon the variety of his tasteful wines which merchants from all quarters of the world were hourly emptying in upon him they were distinguished by such different names that it would require as much study as would make a scholar in any other science to register and do justice to their titles colors tastes and the happy places which produced them different companies in every apartment had their signals and gave fire together and by their number it was reckoned that every leading glass that was turned up by the gay master poured out about a tun including servants computations by way of perquisite and emolument  caution at the sound of every health bid me view the manors from the garden window and i perceived a man in a black gown presenting a roll of parchment to another who was a jolly kind of fellow and steward it seems to the landlord armed with a letter of attorney to sign what deeds he should find necessary  no sooner was this parchment returned to the man in black but immediately the prospect shortened by the length of one whole village which vanishing from our sight left us no other land mark where it stood but a vast and fruitful crab tree  the healths went round so frequently and so merrily that the villages and manortowns disappeared like mists in a sunny morning till at last the gentleman in black with a train of frightful monsters at his heels entered fiercely the mansion house whence all the company ran hastily away and the louder the master called after them so much the faster they continued running  as soon as we were got into the square alas fuit ilium i mean the spot where the square had stood all the palaces were vanished and turned methought into an orchard of crabtrees with whose fruit a crowd of fine gentlemen who were running away in their shirts were pelted without mercy by red furies to whose favorites a number of vintners and lucky gamesters they had but just before transferred their birthright  it is impossible to express the anguish the despair of these unlanded gentlemen some tore down branches and accusing one another for the seduction of ill example formed a battle with dismembered crabtrees others hanged themselves among the boughs at the approach of illlookd ruffians who surrounded them in their new orchard  the next was an assembly of men of wit consisting of a poet an orator a philosopher a mathematician a divine a military officer the fine gentleman who entertained them all and an eunnch who sung in the opera  the poet recited a hymn to bacchus of his own composing  the orator with great gracefulness harangud upon the force of eloquence which he attributed to the warmth of wine  the philosopher set catos virtue before them as held steady by the strength of drinking  the divine averred that solomon said wine made the face of a man to shine and proved it very soberly by showing its effects upon his own illuminated countenance  the mathematician produced a pun and said he loved a full gage because it was the perfection of measure and to measure exactly was the duty of his prosession  the officer commended wine as a great inflamer of courage and quoted a dutch author in defense of the use of drinking in times of war and the faithful service of auxillary brandy  the fine gentleman expatiated on the advantage to be reaped by entertaining such polite company when assembled over a bottle and ordered the fury that attended them to put round the glass at which the eunuch began to sing and the whole company clapped their hands and roared out encore and bravo  no sooner had the glass gone round but the orator proposed method to be the foundation of argument and insisted that all should talk in their turns which as soon as any began to do he broke in upon his own rule and galloped with a bawling voice through divisions and subdivisions till he had disunited the whole company  the poet thought he had equal right to the use of his tongue and rose to assert it in an exorbitant manner just as he found he had lost the use of it  the philosopher cried out in vain that men must labor to subdue their passions and to convince them how easy it was fell into so violent a one himself that he knocked down the poor poet with a club called argumentum baccilinum for says he there is no other way of disputing against those who deny first principles  the divine seeing a philosopher turn murderer and talk at the same time of principles thundered out anathemas against disputing at all where the business they met for was drinking  the mathematician was muttering problems and tracing out a globe upon the table with his fingers dipped in the liquor that the scufflers had spilt upon it and the finebred gentleman to assist the depth of his important designs was pouring more wine to that which was spilt already lest he might want a supply of liquor but just as the figure was upon the point of being finished the officer swore it made dull company and rubbed it out with his sleeve the mathematician seeing his globe defaced cried the world was at an end to which the philosopher and divine agreeing and the rest of the company denying it they fell all together by the ears and squeezed the eunuch to death while he was trying the influence of his music against madness  when the fury was just going to restore them to their senses again that they might perform over the same exercise which they do it seems every hour just as strange sights are shown in fairs or as drunken men renew their waking debauches after a little interval of sleep in their lifetimes i left them with a pungent regret that there should be in liquor such a power of turning strength into weakness health into sickness beauty into deformity riches into poverty friendship into murder wisdom into folly and wit into madness  i waked with no small wonder at this sleeping ramble of my imagination but turning over a collection of old newspapers bound up in volumes from the restoration gradually downward i found them filled with yearly proofs that men act the very same follies waking in this world that i had been dreaming were done in the other  there i found accounts of men of great estates dead in a prison from the effects of drinking  quarrels every jot as fantastical as any i have been describing  there were accounts of men casting lots in their liquor which should be hanged and which the hangman  here were fine histories of others who in a ridiculous bravado had drank the health of the devil in a punchbowl seasoned with opium and launched down while the humor was on em to pay a visit to their grateful patron  i looked back as far as the time when certain wild beasts called mohocks had broke loose here in london and i found that it was no new thing for generals and common soldiers lords watchmen and drawers counts cobblers and hackneycoachmen to engage in no unequal matches together and fight with all the triumph of drunkenness nay what is more i found all this as duly repeated here as i dreamt it to be in the lower regions  while i was thus poring over my news papers and reflecting that the life of man tallied exactly as to its extravagance with the dreams of his disordered fancy i heard a noise in the street as if all barbican were in an uproar and looking out of my window i saw men with gilded staves and an air of exerted magistracy knocking down a set of roaring little heroes with leeks in their hats  inquiring into the matter i was told by an archwag smiling as if he derided my ignorance that it was nothing but a few welshmen who were got loyally drunk and did sober people a mischief in honor of the good saint their patron  i resolved then as extravagant as my thoughts seemed to me before and perfectly removed out of nature to pen them down since i found such persons did really exist as i had believed imagination could only shadow in the preposterous inconsistence of a dream  it may thought i be of use to show men who are addicted to this vice their pictures placed in the fullest point of absurdity and since most of them take hell to be a dream it is natural enough to expect that a dream of hell may divert them  the plain dealer no     pulvis and umbra sumus  hor friday april         among a numberless variety of similitudes by which the different wits of poets satirists philosophers and divines have endeavored to express the shortness and insignificance of humane life i am most pleased with that of lucian where he compares it to those little bubbles which are made by a shower of rain that falls upon some lake or river where they are broken as fast as they are formed and give way to others that immediately follow them  there is in this comparison the emptiness the smoke and the bustle as well as the weakness and brevity of life it is methinks a very mortifying picture of that step half stridden that sportingfield of fortune which st augustine has so comprehensively explained himself upon when he says it is a life ebbing with doubts flowing with hopes and beaten by miseries puffed up with luxury and made lean by abstinence distracted by wishes sharpened by cares and blunted by indolence arrogant in youth peevish in age restless in health and impatient in sickness and at last so overclouded by death that ceasing to be one would think it never was  i was insensibly attracted to this subject by my perusal of three epitaphs widely different in their designs for the first excites humility in highlife the second advises retirement and the third inflames to glory  that which recommends humility to the possessors of power and dignity is the translation of a latin inscription on the monument of a duke of brunswick in the cathedral church of that city  here great and good duke henry buried lies over their dead founder these proud arches rise his pious consort too the poors safe guide mixed with his dust clings closer to his side matilda daughter to great englands king whose virtues spite of death still bloom in spring king otho too their son here shares their rest by both fond parents arms again possessed and here  o grief of beauty near him lies the charmer of his heart and all mens eyes that lovely form whose smiles inflamed desire here food for worms can no soft woes inspire thou passenger whose eyes this marble view learn to be wise nor fleeting hopes pursue life is an evening breeze a murmuring breath that blows till sunset then grows calm in death the second epitaph which recommends as i said a retired life is that of similis a military officer of great experience in the time of the emperor adrian who obtained leave with no small difficulty to retire at last into the country and living there but seven years in a quiet and peaceful privacy enjoyed more solid satisfaction than he had ever reaped before from all his long life spent in hurry danger and distinction so that coming at last to die he appointed by his will this epitaph  should curious readers wish to know whose dust their feet are pressing similis famed in war lies low his countrys boast and blessing long did he toil and grasp and strive yet lost his time he fears for though till seventysix alive he lived but seven short years the third epitaph to give it at once the highest praise which can be given it is worthy its illustrious subject the great czar of russia it was sent me by a gentleman to whose hands it came in latin but i was so justly charmed with the sublimity of the sentiments that i could not resist the temptation of giving it to the ladies and other english readers in their own native language because i would have none of them robbed of the pleasure which i received in perusing it  hic jacent hic vir maximus tibi nihil debuit here under deposited peter alexiovitz great emperor of russia alexander caesar sun he had taugnt them to conquer

wisdom everlasting  the plain dealer no     scribimus indocti doctique  hor monday april         the three following letters being long enough to fill one paper it must be referred to another to say what may be necessary in answer to them  to the author of the plain dealer sir perceiving that it is customary for you to receive letters from our sex i am willing to throw myself into your protection in hopes of meeting with a favorable regard from you and that you may assist me in my distress  i am a young woman of some fortune and of no mean extraction and was some months ago the happiest woman in the world my story in short is this there was a young gentleman every way superior to myself thought fit to make his addresses to me at first i concluded from the inequality of our fortunes that he did it purely for a little diversion but by i know not what kind of infatuation i was soon persuaded to believe he was just and sincere in his pretensions from hence there sprang an intimacy between us which lasted a considerable time and which i never thought would have a period till death had separated us for ever but behold the vicissitudes and changes of life the unexpected turns of fortune which no humnn foresight can prevent when i thought myself almost arrived to the highest perfection of earthly happiness strephon the unkind strephon forsook me and bereft me of all my joys and hopes at once  it is to me very surprising that so intimate a correspondence which was carried on with so much pretended satisfaction on his part should now be so irksome to him as to make him avoid my company and even the very sight of me i cannot pretend to penetrate into his thoughts but i am sure his actions always carried in them the marks of a real and unfeigned passion he seemed ever studious to divert and please me and treated me with a civility and respect which is not common even in the most passionate lover it is now i think two months since he paid me a visit nor have i heard from him to let me know the reason of his absence which together with some private intimations i have had from others gives me sufficient grounds to believe he is false  and is it possible after such an uncommon behavior he should abandon nay despise the person he once appeared so much to admire are these his protestations of eternal love is this his friendship has he so soon forgot his vows of constancy and fidelity who even of the most wise and prudent could have suspected much less discerned deceit under the fair appearance of so much seeming honor and sincerity i was so far from distrusting him whom i thought the virtuous and generous strephon that i put my whole confidence in him and was innocently betrayed by the irresistible charms of his eloquence  i have wrote to him several times since he has left me but either my letters were intercepted or he is wholly regardless of them for i have not as yet received an answer nor can i by any means inform myself what has been the cause of his unkind separation for this reason i take this public opportunity both to ask your advice in so critical a juncture and to convince him of his disingenuous treatment of one for whom he pretended once to have the most unalterable veneration if you think fit to give this letter a place in one of your papers i know it will come to his hands and perhaps such a memorial under your authority and protection may have a greater influence over him than any common epistle i desire therefore you will insert it and oblige your most humble servant  delia pray correct it before it is printed     to the plain dealer sir it is a common observation that trees that blossom soonest are liable to be soonest frost nipt as if nature by observing the full growth of such forward virtues mistook the progress of years and measured maturity not by age but by character  i mourn the misery mr plain dealer of having lately lost a friend whose picture i will present you with as it is drawn to the life in my memory   in business there was a pleasure always triumphing over his hurry such a suavity and complacence in his behavior as attracted the heart before the head could have time to weigh him he was subservient to no passion but love which made him a friend to all mankind nor could those narrow limits of soul which contract mens friendships to their interests restrain his boundless generosity which made him every bodys who had miseries within the compass of his easing he had so feverish a thirst of obliging that an enemy would have called his liberality rather his disease than his ornament he sought for no reward but the prosperity of those he favored and if at any time it was not in his power to grant he was more ashamed and unsatisfied than the person whom he disappointed and by way of atonement injoined himself the penance of watching for some happier opportunity when he could meet the wish above half way and prevent its explanation  nor did this benevolence of his nature extend only to those within the sphere of his acquaintance whoseever misfortunes came to his knowledge made an equal and noble impression  for he impropriated all mens griefs till he had lessened them by comforts  if there were any so ungenerous as to make him their enemy he was as willing to forgive as they to offer the injury  judge then how happy must those few have been who were blessed with his intimacy whatever tenderness is conceived in nature from mothers to their newborn infants may deserve to pass as some faint image of his sweetness  his faith and his friendships were as lasting as his life was  with all these advantages never had man an humbler opinion of himself which was an armor that defended him against the flattery of fortune as his steadiness despised her malice to him to be high or low were accidents merely indifferent the one could neither exalt nor could the other depress his sentiments and had heaven thought fit to have exempted his body like his mind from infirmities he had been as well immortal as inestimable the fashionable vanities which allure and captivate young hearts could never get admittance into his masculine and discerning bosom always guarded by reason and virtue he renounced in the pride of his youth those enjoyments which others content themselves with disclaiming when the power of possessing them is either lost or abated oh i am left in a desert without this guide that my fond soul hung upon and nothing remains but the influence of his example that can be worth the wish of any man who had the blessing to be acquainted with him   in justice to his memory allow this little specimen of my departed friend a place in one of your papers and you will much oblige  your constant reader and wellwisher ned mournful   to the worshipful master plain dealer sir i have had such an overmind to see you that i came to town on purpose being a kind of plain dealer myself for thof i am a country fellow and no latin scollard yet i reckon myself the wisest in our whole parish except mayhap the parson and he is so churlish that one dare not deal plainly with him i believe you to be no proud man and that made me so bold as to come to seek you out being in hopes to have told our parson that i had conversed in my time with as learned a man as he  good master plain dealer be so kind as to tell a body in your next paper where you may be sound and rather than lose the sight of so goodnatured an old man i will come once more on purpose thof i should have no other business when i enquired after you i thought i should never have found you out but then at last i was told by a very young man that you was to be met with at the tower of barbican  zlids i was never so so glad in all my lifetime but soon after i found i had nothing to be glad on and i doubt the rogue put the citybite upon me for i have searched every crick and corner to find out such a tower and could get no news of it barbican i did find and the tower i did find but i could find no tower of barbican i have worn out two shoes by the bargain that were as good as any two pair i can get hereabouts pray if there be any such tower and you live in it i beseech you to order matters so that i may come to find it out  i read your papers and understand them as well as most other folks all but your top sentences which are generally so hard that they puzzle all our parish the best scollards of us put our heads together to find out their meaning and when we cannot agree about it we go to consult our parson and i am sorry to say it he pronounces a hard judgment upon them  he does not think it worth his trouble he says to understand heathen authors because those men were seldom good christians  but this shall not prevent my reading your papers for i have a better opinion of you than to think so profanely of any of your friends and acquaintance being in overgreat haste for the country have but just time to put you in mind of me and wishing you in good health as i am at this present writing blessed be god for it remain  worshipful sir your very sincere friend george gardener   the plain dealer no     pro captu lectoris habent sua fata libelli  monday may        to the author of the plain dealer sir turning over the works of shakespeare lately ushered into the world by an extravagant subscription and finding the six volumes though called shakespeares works contained not his venus and adonis his tarquin and lucrece and numberless other miscellaneous pieces which for richness of fancy and the many beautiful descriptions that adorn them are far from being inferior to some of his more celebrated labors i thought my self obliged to become a purchaser of the seventh volume also which appears to me to have no demerit to occasion its exclusion  you mr plain dealer whose lucubrations are so justly admired by all good judges of wit and taste will indulge me the transcription of a few of those numberless natural beauties which shine every where through these charming pieces and the rather because i have been informed that this volume which is so necessary and essential a part of the works of that inimitable author has not by some of the wits in leadingstrings been looked upon with equal favor because this edition of it was not midwifd into the world by the great names that have condescended for the emolument of the public to shine in the title page of the first six volumes but as this may take up more room than you will have to spare in one paper i shall now and then occasionally beg leave by your means to recommend to the implicit witlings of the age those beauties which might otherwise escape their observation  and as it is impossible where ever i open the book not to be surprised with the beauties of this great genius i will present your readers with the first that offered it self the exclamation the violated lucrece makes upon opportunity and time for contributing to her undoing  o opportunity thy guilt is great it is thou that executst the traitors treason thou settst the wolf where he the lamb may get whoever plots the sin thou pointst the season it is thou that spurnst at right at law at reason and in thy shady cell where none may spy her sits sin to seize the souls that wander by her thou make the vestal violate her oath thou blowst the fire

honey turns to gall thy joy to grief thy secret pleasure turns to open shame thy private feasting to a public fast thy smothring titles to a ragged name thy sugared tongue to bitter wormwood taste thy violent vanities can never last how comes it then vile opportunity being so bad such numbers seek for thee when will thou be the humble suppliants friend and bring him where his suit may be obtained when will thou sort an hour great strifes to end or free that soul which wretchedness has chained give physic to the sick ease to the pained the poor lame blind cry out halt creep for thee but they never meet with opportunity the patient dies while the physician sleeps the orphan pines while the oppressor feeds justice is feasting while the widow weeps advice is sporting while infection breeds thou grantst no time for charitable deeds wrath envy treason rape and murder rages thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages guilty thou art of murder and of theft guilty of perjury and subornation guilty of treason forgery and shift guilty of incest that abomination an accessory by thine inclination to all sins past and all that are to come from the creation to the general doom

murderst all that are o hear me then injurious shifting time be guilty of my death since of my crime why has thy servant opportunity betrayed the hours thou gavst me to repose cancelled my fortunes and inchained me to endless date of neverending woes times office is to find the hate of foes to eat up error by opinion bred nor spend the dowry of a lawful bed times glory is to calm contending kings to unmask falsehood and bring truth to light to stamp the seal of time on aged things to wake the morn and sentinel the night to wrong the wronger till he render right to ruinate proud buildings with thy hours and smear with dust their glittering golden towers to fill with wormholes stately monuments to feed oblivion with decay of things to blot old books and alter their contents to pluck the quills from ancient ravens wings to dry the old oaks sap and cherish springs to spoil antiquities of hammered steel and turn the giddy round of fortunes wheel why workst thou mischief in thy pilgrimage unless thou could return to make amends one poor retiring minute in an age would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends lending him wit that to bad debtors lends o this dread night would thou one hour come back i could prevent this storm and shun this wrack with this admirable flow of fancy and lively imagery does this unbounded genius forgetful indeed of her unfit condition for oratory whom he represents as thus copious while he is forciby carried away by the stream of his own charming imagination i shall only mention that the description the poet gives of her rising to the morn her last will her parley with her maid the maids sympathizing behavior and his admirable description of the groom she sent to collatine are beauties in their way that have no equal but in the same author but i cannot forbear recommending his description of the picture he makes the unhappy lady turn her eyes to of troy beleagurd by the greeks to avenge the rape of hellen which for strength of description surpasses any thing of the like kind and shows the excellency of the poets art above that of the painter as the soul is to the body since it is impossible the pencil of the latter can come up to what follows  a thousand lamentable objects there in scorn of nature art gave lifeless life many a dire drop seemed a weeping tear shed for the slaughtered husband by the wife the red blood reekd to show the painters strife and dying eyes gleamd forth their ashy lights like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights there might you see the laboring pioneer begrimd with sweat and smeared all with dust and from the towers of troy there would appear the very eyes of men through loopholes thrust gazing upon the greeks with little lust such sweet observance in this work was had that one might see those faroff eyes look sad in great commanders grace and majesty you might behold triumphing in their faces in youth quick bearing and dexterity and here and there the painter interlaces pale cowards marching on with trembling paces which heartless peasants did so well resemble that one would swear he saw them quake and tremble in ajax and ulysses o what art of physiognomy might one behold the face of either cypherd eithers heart their face their manners most expressly told in ajaxs eyes blunt rage and rigor rolled but the mild glance that she ulysses lent showed deep regard and smiling government there pleading might you see grave nestor stand as twere encouraging the greeks to fight making such sober actions with his hand that it beguiled attention charmed the sight in speech it seemed his beard all silver white waggd up and down and from his lips did fly thin winding breath which purld up to the the sky about him were a press of gaping faces which seemed to swallow up his sound advice all jointly listening but with several graces as if some siren did their ears entice some high some low the painter was so nice the scalps of many almost hid behind to jump up higher seemed to mock the mind here one mans hand leaned on anothers head his nose being shadowed by his neighbors ear here one being thronged bears back all swollen and red another smothered seems to pelt and swear and in their rage such signs of rage they bear as but for loss of nestors golden words it seems they would debate with angry swords for much imaginary work was there conceit deceitful so compact so kind that for achilles image stood his spear gripped in an armed hand himself behind was left unseen save in the eye of mind a hand a foot a face a leg a head stood for the whole to be imagined and from the walls of strong besieged troy when their brave hope bold hector marched to field stood many trojan mothers sharing joy to see their youthful sons bright weapons wield and to their hope they such odd action yield that through their light joy seemed to appear like bright things stained a kind of heavy fear i should transcribe the whole piece were i to give all the beauties of this admirable performance i shall only add that the description of hecuba and that of the deceitful sinon and the different passions and reflections of lucretia on viewing the different figures are such masterpieces that they leave us without words to express the wonder they inspire at the force of that genius whose production and glory they are your paper mr plain dealer crowded as it generally is with beauties will not be disgraced by these quotations so that i have nothing by way of apology to say but only to assure you that i am  your constant reader and admirer r s   the plain dealer no      pendent opera interrupta  virg friday may        i am sorry after so kind a reception as has been given to my speculations that any necessity should arise for my parting a little precipitately with my goodnatured readers but love however fashionable it is among sage writers to call it a weakness is well known to act with a strength that is irresistible and i need not inform those who have perused me long or with any tolerable degree of attention that patty amble holds an influence over me that is too hard for all my gravity and breaks like a butterfly through my cobweb resolutions  no longer ago than yesterday morning there was nothing farther from my thoughts than the discontinuance of my weekly labors but about an hour before dinner all my purposes received new colors and i am now no longer what i was before this short billet metamorphosd me  dear slavy at length i have determined to be only yours for ever and in gratitude for all those scarce deserved fine things your letter of last week obliged me with i will say after you next saturday morning whatever words you wish most ardently to hear me answer in  but this is absolutely upon condition that you put an end immediately to your plaindealing it is the most odious quality you have and you know i could never bear it  i have given you perhaps too short a warning but you must do as well as you can for pray heaven i hold in the mind if you take me not in the present humor of  your mistress one day more and then alas your servant martha amble   it would be unreasonable for any of my christian readers to expect a better excuse than this for my taking leave of them so abruptly  it is possible however that when our first hurry of business is a little over i may have leisure more than enough to talk on as i have done hitherto but under what name or shape i shall make my appearance is a matter i am wholly dark in  this only i am sure of and agree heartily with her in that it must be any thing rather than a plain dealer the aversion if i am not mistaken of every wife in christendom  but to soften as much as possible the abruptness of my departure it may not be amiss to spend a little conversation upon those agreeable correspondents and indulgent readers which in the course of this work i have met with next to the pleasure of doing good the greatest is to meet with approbation and assistance in our attempts toward it this has been my happiness and i hope it cannot be attributed to any reproachable weakness when i confess i feel a pang at parting with it barely to acknowledge amounts to gratitude in those people whom fortune does not enable to return a benefit that is at present my case my approaching fate will allow me to make no better a payment than thanks which therefore i desire may be heartily accepted  when i had written thus far an acquaintance whom in some of the preceding discourses i have recommended to the public for a pertness of conceit and flippancy of tongue happened to come into my room and taking up the paper ran it hastily over then throwing it down with a petulant sneer and a brisk voice cried out foregad considering your sentiments and circumstances grave sir i cannot help comparing you to a criminal taking leave of the byestanders with tears in his eyes before his execution  faith i long to see thee turned off thou wilt make the prettiest figure of a dangler ha ha  then changing his allegory continued his impertinence thus matrimony my good friend is a long and tiresome journey and the worst road that ever you traveled in  you seem uneasy but sure you cannot in conscience be displeased that i should take up plaindealing just where you left it off  if you are to make you amends i promise never to imitate you in any thing particularly your last resolution of committing that dreadful sin of matrimony  believe me friend the man that signs marriage articles gives it under his hand that he is a fool  to this i answered very gravely that before i left off plain dealing absolutely i was resolved to give him one lesson which might be of use to him in his practice you are to remember continued i that he who gives advice should always take care to do it in such a manner that his advice may not appear to be an insult upon the character or understanding of the person advised good breeding embellishes good sense and true politeness is no more than civilized plain dealing  but to pass by this volatile spark who if i divine aright will in every respect act like a modern fine gentleman that is continue a bachelor till sixty to show his wit and then marry his housekeeper to show his judgment let me return to the conversation which he interrupted though i must take so much notice of his opinion that i promise my readers if ever i appear again in public i shall amply and impartially consider it by which time perhaps my own observations and experience will better enable me to make a clear and satisfactory comment upon it  farewell then gentle readers be happy as i am shortly to be i have on my part endeavored to please and you on yours have shown some regard for my endeavors till i can again attend you i wish you heartily a more agreeable instructor but think not my persuading you to good humor at parting an inconsistence in my character for though i always abhorred flattery yet i never thought truth the worse for being agreeably dressed the common forms of civility though they are often the disguises of insincerity are no disgrace to an honest heart and a good intention where they are made use of to conceal our sentiments they are wicked and abominable where only to adorn innocent and agreeable at worst you ought only to consider me as one who without losing his sincerity
