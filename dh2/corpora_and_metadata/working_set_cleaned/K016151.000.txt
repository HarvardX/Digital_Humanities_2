the fatal extravagance a tragedy as it is acted at the theater in lincolnsinnfields  written by mr joseph mitchell    london printed for t jauncy at the angel without temple bar price one shilling  to the most noble prince james duke hamilton duke of brandon etc may it please your grace when i reflect on your dignity as first peer of scotland the oldest monarchy of europe i address you with dread and consider my own ambition of throwing my self and my first essay in tragedy under the protection of your illustrious name as a presumption which no apology can excuse unless i seek it in your goodness  but it is both natural and necessary for poets to court the favor of the great and the honor which your graces indulgence vouchsafes me on this occasion distinguishes you no less among the patrons of the muses than your high birth among the noble for the smaller my merit may be judged by the world the more glorious that humanity which excites your grace to encourage it till it is increased by your influence many a slip might have grown to a tall cedar if it had been pald round and watered instead of being trampled upon the most invisible spark may be gradualy blown to an illuminating blaze and give delight to its nourisher  how blessed should i conceive my self might i ever become worthy this regard of a patron the very dawn of whose life is breaking out upon the world with a stronger luster from his merit than it received from his state  i snatched this opportunity to acknowledge my devotion to your graces name and family and to stand out the first public predictor that your innate princely qualities will render you of more consequence to your country than the splendid advantages of your title and great power  so glorious a conjunction of happy circumstances must be the blessing of your graces own life the honor and good fortune of your friends and dependants and the universal admiration of the country that lays claim to you a country which i am sure you will adorn by your councils and your actions after a manner which has never yet been reached even by the brave and illustrious long line of your predecessors  may the kindest care of heaven preserve your important life from all dangers and ill accidents to be the ornament of your own age and the great example and emulation of posterity  i am with the profoundest duty and respect  may it please your grace your graces most obedient and most devoted humble servant joseph mitchell  the preface there are few men of learning except some of my own country misled by a zeal both indiscreet and unwarrantable who do not readily acknowledge poetry to be the daughter of religion and originally designed to tune mens minds to devotion this is evident from the many noble poems in the old testament to say nothing of other writings but the primitive simplicity becoming gradually lost as the art was applied to ends unworthy its institution the reformers were obliged to take advantage of mens passions by giving it a new turn which under the temptation of delight disguised the doctrine they recommended tragedy in particular was the perfection of the muses power till that became known there was wanting a kind of poetry which imitating the actions of mankind might work a readier and more sensible effect by a corvection of the passions the prevalence of vice it is true and mens natural propensity to resist good instruction allowed not a success to tragidy so universal as it merited but since no better help than this can be devised the friends of virtue and genius must use the means it affords them  in countries where christianity is received and established some may possibly imagine there is now no longer need of the assistance of tragedy but experience convinces us that many frequent the stage who would hardly be prevailed upon to receive counsel from the pulpit the clergy therefore should consider as auxiliaries and fellow laborers those poets who preach virtue from the press or the theater and since we seek not a share of their revenues for the pains we take in their service they ought at least in civility to allow us their countenance and acknowledgement is there a kirkman among my adversaries whose zeal is so militant as to fight without wages why then am i condemned who more generously go to war in a way they could not take themselves were they hindered from fighting against vice from the pulpit who is so rude as to blame an honest volunteer in a good cause or if one deserves to be a commander in chief why is he grudged preferment beyond the list and rate of an halfpayofficer  but some who are moderate because more wise than those i have had to do with confess the stage capable of being made useful yet condemn it on account of the abuses it indulges  would they destroy the being of an art because its use is corrupted they argue like those zealous indeed but weak reformers who were for demolishing churches that they might be sure to leave no images according to these mens way of reasoning every thing that is not perfect is dangerous and abominable for there is nothing so excellent where abuses may not enter preaching they know well is often abused will they allow me therefore to cry out that all preaching is unlawful  i writ the following short tragedy to give my countrymen of the kirk an example that sound and useful instruction may be drawn from the theater and that only the abuse is blameable i might indeed have referred my overrigid adversaries to other pieces of dramatic poetry already extant but some peculiarities in my case which the world is likely to know more of very soon obliged me to give a specimen my self of a play wherein nothing justly can be condemned by the rules of religion and virtue i am therefore not afraid to be tried by good christians and i hope to pass uncensured by good critics also notwithstanding the uncommon manner in which i have attempted it  five acts i know are customary but they can by no means be proved necessary on the contrary if any determinate number were to be appointed as a standard three acts seem better than five by the criticks own rule a beginning a middle and an end say these gentlemen are the stages of the drama a first act then would open and prepare the matter intended a second would perfect and heighten it to its summit and the third in a just and natural descent serves to clear up the embarrasments and bring on the catastrophe thus may three acts he defended by reason better than five from custom but i intend not hereby to promote the introduction of a new manner  this tragedy was writ so short for want of time to enlarge it by addition of other characters and episodical incidents yet because i would not be subject to the reproaches of mistaken petulance i thought it necessary to observe that if a dramatic story is complete in its preparation progress and conclusion it is of no great importance what number of acts it consists of  but one general error if i mistake not among writers of tragedy is a failure in their very principle they teach not a moral but describe some piece of history  the business of the stage if i apprehend it rightly is first to intend some general and useful instruction how men may avoid certain mischiefs in life by correcting those passions which must naturally produce them and then to find or invent some story which may serve as an example for strengthening that precept and show a man made miserable by effect of those passions which the writer would teach his audience to resist or keep guard against every thing in a tragedy which has not a direct and visible tendency to the moral it is writ for is superfluous and monstrous and however pompously embellished serves for nothing but to weaken the instruction and distract the attention and apprehension of an audience  i took the hint and only the hint as the reader may see of that story which i have fitted to the moral of the following little piece from shakespeares yorkshire tragedy which was put into my hands on purpose by my good friend mr hill to whom i take this occasion of expressing my gratitude in the most public manner i can all endeavors beside acknowledgments being vain to match the instances of his friendship and that uncommon humanity and frankness of spirit so peculiar to himself in his manner of bestowing favors but it is needless to tell the world how much i am obliged to him and what just sense i have of his generous regard to me they who know him well and what a waste of his important time he has made for my interest will be beforehand with my acknowledgements and enumerate the advantages which i could not miss from his friendship  i owe much in the scheme in the sentiments and language of this piece to the direction of that accomplished gentleman who has either no enemies or they are such because strangers to his good qualities for it is only necessary to know him to be by choice or obligation made inviolably his own  i embrace this opportunity of thanking him for his excellent prologue which so well prepared the audience for the representation nor can i help thanking him even for the epilogue though not less pleasant on my self than on my adversaries among the scots clergy for who would not be contented under a stroke or two of his satyr whose praise as juba says of cato i would rather have than worlds for my admirers  before i end this preface i must not forget to thank the generosity of my friends of all qualities who so nobly graced the action of my first endeavor in tragedy i should have very little merit not to improve on such encouragement  before so select and illustrious an audience the admirable mrs seymour and the gentlemen who so well performed the parts must have felt a satisfaction equal to that applause which their action deserved and met with  prologue written by aaron hill esquire spoken by mr ryan warmed by a kindred sense of englands woes a caledonian muse with pity glows from ruined hopes a saving moral takes and paints the unhappy for the happys sakes scotlands new taste our meaning scene supplies and a first flight on tragic pinions

rifing arts she grasps the boys and her old cant like falling stocks decays her longlost muse newlights her ancient flame and our scene blazes with recovered fame we teach to night  ah would twere not too late how rash believing avarice galls a state what private sorrows from wild hazards flow and how false hope produces certain woe this  the most natural business of the stage will all your generous hearts it is bopd engage none can their pity for those woes conceal which most who hear perhaps too deeply feel the rants of ruined kings of mighty name for pompous misery small compassion claim empires orturnd and heroes held in chains alarm the mind but give the heart no pains to ills remote from our domestic fears we lend our wonder but withold our tears not so when from such passions as our own some favorite follys dreadful fate is shown there the soul bleeds for what it feels within and conscious pity shakes at suffering sin o give attention to the moving scene and shun what yet may be by what has been the epilogue written by aaron hill esquire spoke by mrs seymour you have seen the play  and i will unfold the poet to whom  strayed sheep of a pure flock we owe it he is a chanceblessing  somewhat strangely flung us dropped  from the clouds of innocence  among us slipped through the kirks loose pale we gave him quarter  poor soul  he had like to have been the muses martyr when stage plays  and abominations  took him grace and the shepherds of the saints forsook him twas given thenceforth to satans power to win him  the root of the sound matter  was not in him yet though rebuked full sore  he is no huge sinner you will scarce see one of his pure brethren  thinner most sanctified of face troth  i am afraid if his looks lie not  the poor mans a maid the bard not carnalminded  say the curious how come the unfleshly folks to be so furious judge you the quarrel right  well briefly show it   good plays give good instruction  said the poet vanity cried the brethren  gross defilement and so the war broke out past reconcilement young bays provoked here drew his wrathful pen  shine forth said he my muse on those dark men and prove by dint of fair example whether much goodness is not learnt by coming hither but what he teaches be to him alone  i will teach a secret lesson of my own  say they of plays  that men learn nothing by em i stand  the stages champion  and defye em who that has seen to night how i a wife gave counsel fit to have saved my spouses life learns not this moral past all contradiction that disobedient husbands  meet affliction that he is most happy who his fetters eases and lots his wiser wife  do  what she pleases this for our sexes fame his play produccs  you see  all doctrines have their hidden uses to this  if the bluff

draught to give it as a cordial  give it whom start from thy burning orb thou conscious sun and chill thy selt to frost at my black purpose am i a parent a protector lover or has this devil that heaves about my heart transformed me to a fiend he has he has chain him some angel millions of fathoms down heap him with mountains least he rise again and in a husbands and a fathers breast brew horrid murders  i am my self once more  now let cool reasons undistracted search answer my bleeding soul which dreadful ill may best be born by nature  to leave our friends to grinding sorrow poverty and scorn with sense of his not feeling any pain who gave them all  or to quit life together and wanting power to bless make it some merit not to leave curses to surviving innocence i am mad again  reason her self betrays me and whispers that this last is cruelty and murder grows a mercy  enter louisa lou found you the cordial your little wanderers are ready dressed to act the pilgrim with us perhaps twill aid their fainting spirits yet untried in hardships  bell i cannot move  my feet bound down by nature rebel against my heart  oh if one moment one short thought longer she oppress me thus with melting innocent talk  i shall grow soft yield her to want and live to be a beggar  lou still you are doubtful  aside bell no  no  i am fixed  oh nature aside i left my closet open  on a table in that gold cup which was thy fathers present when thy first favorite boys last birthday came thoullt find the fittest cordial  i tried em all and what seemed properest for the boys and thee waits in that cup thy tasting   lou courtney stays long  all things are ready and i wish him here now for this boasted cordial  exit bell be firm my heart stop thy big beat thaw thaw this curdling blood that through my icy veins creeps cold as death and freezes in its passage  where is louisa but a few moments and she is no more now now the unsuspecting innocent lifts that last cup  now now she tastes a draught that snatches her for ever from my sight and robs me of her comfort never more shall her sweet voice enchant me never more shall her soft eyes look fondly into mine and shine with swimming languor  never never will her unwearied wit beguile my cares or hush me more to peace when passion shakes me open engulph me and conceal my shame befriending earth  or from thy yawning depth stream up a night of gloom to blot out memory and darken over reflection  i feel my blood cool and grow thick as melted lead flows heavy and hardens in it is motion  a little longer and i who have a heart already marble shall petrifie throughout and be a statue  lou my life my bellmour within bell ha it is her voice that calls me  it sounded not reproachful  lou look look my bellmour within these little strugglers will not quit the cordial but sip it to the bottom   bell torturing horror  aside enter louisa with an empty cup lou how could you be so rigid not to come when i twice called you twoud have been a scene of pleasure to observe with how much eagerness the little wranglers quarreled for the cup which having drank my self i brought to them i bid em taste it only  and told the pratlers it was their fathers present but that word transported them to lift their pretty hands and brought a war about me   bell furies tear me   lou did you not give permission they should taste it ere they began the journey  bell alas louisa a long long journey is indeed begun but endless as eternity  thy self and those dear infants  are poisoned by that cordial  lou poisoned by thee thou say it but to try me if twere thy wish that i should die thy love  at least thy pity would have given some warning death is a dreadful journey and requires much length of preparation   bell by those charms which i no more must gaze on and be blessed thou can not live an hour  a last long sleep will steal in cold advances over thy beauties and those two beamy suns which sparkle on me anon shall set in death  even while we talk the eternal shade will rise at once between us and sever us for ever  lou dreadful contraction of that short span which at its longest stretch was much too narrow to allow me scope to speak or look or think my love for thee what shall i say  a thousand tender thoughts struggle at once for vent  i cannot speak  death is too hasty  i have yet undone unspoke unthought a thousand weighty things o heaven my little ones  let me fly to them have i so short a time to gaze upon them yet never must seeem more  i cannot leave thee what shall i do  o bring my children hither fly with them to my arms  dear dying innocents oh bellmour bellmour why has this been done  bell that we might baffle woe and die together  and leave no beggars of our race behind us

dreadful scene are you returned to enter courtney court i have heard it all  and had not that concealed undreamt of dagger prevented my near vigilance had saved unhappy bellmour   bell not unhappy now  we slide united from the woes of life and wants too slow to reach us   court mistaken man the hand of heaven however from mortal eyes obsourd in clouds still points direct at justice not thy three children nor thy guiltless wife but thou alone art fallen whose single crime drew down a single vengeance  lou alas what mean you   bell thou little know the deadly means i used if thou conceivst me frustrated   court hear then with wonder  and trembling mark the mazy paths of providence seeking you on the gallerys garden side i in your closet spied a late filled cup with a small vial near it  to the neck there hung a label  by the name inscribed i saw with sad surprise it had held poison concluding you had newly mingled it with that rich draught it stood by  from a window i threw it on the garden  refilld the cup without its deadly mixture  and stood concealed to watch what happened  when louisa came and snatched it thence i followed her unmarked pleased to have been a means to intercept hers and her childrens death  the rest you know too well  bell angels surround thee with unceasing vigilance and for this friendship ward off every evil oh i have erred   lou oh too too partial blessing faint sweet with more than poisonous bitter mixed now bellmour tell me  was it not a crime to distrust heaven else thou had lived  and then we had all perhaps been blessed  cour you had indeed by a young kinsman landed from a ship that left her consort scarce a day behind woodly has heard suprizing news  your brother absent so many years and long thought dead returning rich from the remotest east died but in sight of land and has bequeathd his whole heaped wealth to bellmour  bell heaven i adore thee would i had trusted thy eternal wisdom thou best can clear thy mystic dispensations and make confusion end in beauteous order oh thou art just and dreadful is thy conduct punished with this severity of justice i feel and own thy mercy  now live louisa live and be happy  and forget  thy bellmour dies lou oh she swoons  alas she faints  this sudden turn of terror rushes too strong to be withstood by nature i will call her womn to her aid and watch her till time and thought by slow degrees bring comfort from this sad story let observers know that early riot ends in lasting woe mean and ignoble pleasures break the mind unnerve our judgment and our reason blind
