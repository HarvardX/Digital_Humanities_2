the royal exchange j gardener in charlesstreet westminster and j almon in piccadilly mdcclxiv  the duellist book i the clock struck twelve over half the globe darkness had spread her pitchy robe morpheus his feet with velvet shod treading as if in fear he trod gentle as dews at eventide distilled his poppies far and wide ambition who when waking dreams of mighty but phantastic schemes who when asleep never knows that rest with which the humbler soul is blessed was building castles in the air goodly to look upon and fair but on a bad foundation laid doomed at return of morn to fade pale study by the tapers light wearing away the watch of night sat reading but with oerchargd head remembered nothing that he read starving midst plenty with a face which might the court of famine grace ragged and filthy to behold gray avarice nodded over his gold jealousy his quick eye halfclosd with watchings worn reluctant dozd and mean distrust not quite forgot slumberd as if he slumberd not stretched at his length on the bare ground his hardy offspring sleeping round snord restless labor by his side lay health a coarse but comely bride virtue without the doctors aid in the soft arms of sleep was laid whilst vice within the guilty breast could not be physicd into rest thou bloody man whose russian knife is drawn against thy neighbors life and never scruples to descend into the bosom of a friend a firm fast friend by vice allied and to thy secret service tied in whom ten murders breed no awe if properly secured from law thou man of lust whom passion fires to soulest deeds whose hot desires over honest bars with ease make way whilst idiot beauty falls a prey and to indulge thy brutal flame a lucrece must be brought to shame who do a brave bold sinner bear rank incest to the open air and rapes fullblown upon thy crown enough to weigh a nation down thou simular of lust vain man whose restless thoughts still form the plan of guilt which withered to the root thy lifeless nerves cannot execute whilst in thy marrowless dry bones desire without enjoyment groans thou perjured wretch whom falsehood clothes even like a garment who with oaths do trifle as with brokers meant to serve thy every vile intent in the days broad and searching eye making god witness to a lie blaspheming heaven and earth for pelf and hanging friends to save thyself thou son of chance whose glorious soul on the four aces doomed to roll was never yet with honor caught nor on poor virtue lost one thought who do thy wife thy children set thy all upon a single bet risquing the desperate stake to try here and hereafter on a die who thy own private fortune lost do game on at thy countrys cost and grown expert in sharping rules first fooled thyself now preyst on fools thou noble gamester whose high place gives too much credit to disgrace who with the motion of a die do make a mighty island fly the sums i mean of good french gold for which a mighty island sold who do betray intelligence abuse the dearest confidence and private fortune to create most falsely play the game of state who do within the alley sport sums which might beggar a whole court and make us bankrupts all if care with good earl talbot was not there thou daring infidel whom pride and sin have drawn from reasons side who fearing his avengeful rod do wish not to believe a god whose hope is founded on a plan which should distract the soul of man and make him curse his abject birth whose hope is once returned to earth there to lie down for worms a feast to rot and perish like a beast who do of punishment afraid and by thy crimes a coward made to every generous soul a curse than hell and all her torments worse when crawling to thy latter end call on destruction as a friend choosing to crumble into dust rather than rise though rise you must thou hypocrite who do profane and take the patriots name in vain then most thy countrys foe when most of love and loyalty you boast who for the filthy love of gold thy friend thy king thy god have sold and mocking the just claim of hell were bidders found thyself would sell ye villains of whatever name whatever rank to whom the claim of hell is certain on whose lids that worm which never dies forbids sweet sleep to fall come and behold whilst envy makes your blood run cold behold by pitiless conscience led so justice wills that holy bed where peace her full dominion keeps and innocence with holland sleeps bid terror posting on the wind affray the spirits of mankind bid earthquakes heaving for a vent rive their concealing continent and forcing an untimely birth through the vast bowels of the earth endeavor in her monstrous womb at once all nature to entomb bid all that is horrible and dire all that man hates and fears conspire to make night hideous as they can still is thy sleep thou virtuous man pure as the thoughts which in thy breast inhabit and ensure thy rest still shall thy ayliff taught though late thy friendly justice in his fate turned to a guardian angel spread sweet dreams of comfort round thy head dark was the night by fate decreed for the contrivance of a deed more black than common which might make this land from her foundations shake might tear up freedom by the root destroy a wilkes and fix a bute deep horror held her wide domain the sky in sullen drops of rain forewept the morn and through the air which opening laid his bosom bare loud thunders rolled and lightning streamed the owl at freedoms window screamd the screechowl prophet dire whose breath brings sickness and whose note is death the churchyard teemed and from the tomb all sad and silent through the gloom the ghosts of men in former times whose public virtues were their crimes indignant stalked sorrow and rage blankd their pale cheek in his own age the prop of freedom hampden there felt after death the generous care sidney by grief from heaven was kept and for his brother patriot wept all friends of liberty when fate prepared to shorten wilkess date heaved deeply hurt the heartfelt groan and knew that wound to be their own hail liberty a glorious word in other countries scarcely heard or heard but as a thing of course without or energy or force here felt enjoyed adored she springs far far beyond the reach of kings fresh blooming from our mother earth with pride and joy she owns her birth derived from us and in return bids in our breasts her genius burn bids us with all those blessings live which liberty alone can give or nobly with that spirit die which makes death more than victory hail those old patriots on whose tongue persuasion in the senate hung whilst they this sacred cause maintained hail those old chiefs to honor trained who spread when other methods failed wars bloody banner and prevailed shall men like these unmentiond sleep promiscuous with the common heap and gratitude forbid the crime be carried down the stream of time in shoals unnoticd and forgot on lethes stream like flags to rot no  they shall live and each fair name recorded in the book of fame founded on honors basis fast as the round earth to ages last some virtues vanish with our breath virtue like this lives after death old time himself his scythe thrown by himself lost in eternity an everlasting crown shall twine to make a wilkes and sidney join but should some slavegot villain dare chains for his country to prepare and by his birth to slavery broke make her too feel the galling yoke may he be evermore accursed amongst bad men be ranked the worst may he be still himself and still go on in vice and perfect ill may his broad crimes each day increase till he cannot live nor die in peace may he be plunged so deep in shame that s  may not endure his name and hear scarce crawling on the earth his children curse him for their birth may liberty beyond the grave ordain him to be still a slave grant him what here he most requires and damn him with his own desires but should some villain in support and zeal for a despairing court placing in craft his confidence and making honor a pretense to do a deed of deepest shame whilst filthy lucre is his aim should such a wretch with sword or knife contrive to practice against the life of one who honored through the land for freedom made a glorious stand whose chief perhaps his only crime is if plain truth at such a time may dare her sentiments

repair and tottering from side to side menaced destruction far and wide nor able seemed unless made stronger to hold out four or five years longer four hundred pillars from the ground rising in order most unsound some rotten to the heart aloof seemed to support the tottering roof but to inspection nearer laid instead of giving wanted aid the structure rare and curious made by men most famous in

rippd and pulled down to the ground whether though afterages never shall raise a building to compare art if they should their art employ meant to preserve might not destroy as human bodies worn away battered and hasting to decay bidding the power of art despair cannot those very medicines bear which and which only can restore and make them healthy as before to liberty whose gracious smile shed peace and plenty over the isle our grateful ancestors her plain but faithful children raised this fane full in the front stretched out in length where nature put forth all her strength in spring eternal lay a plain where our brave fathers used to train their sons to arms to teach the art of war and steel the infant heart labor their hardy nurse when young their joints had knit their nerves had strung abstinence foe declared to death had from the time they first drew breath the best of doctors with plain food kept pure the channel of their blood  in their cheeks bad color rise and glory

and for a sons or husbands brow with eager fingers laurel wove laurel which in the sacred grove planted by liberty they find the brows of conquerors to bind to give them pride and spirits fit to make a world in arms submit what raptures did the bosom fire of the young rugged peasant sire when from the toil of mimic fight returning with return of night he saw his babe resign the breast and smiling stroke those arms in jest with which hereafter he shall make the proudest heart in gallia quake gods with what joy what honest pride did each fond wishing rustic bride behold her manly swain return how did her lovesick bosom burn though on parades he was not bred nor wore the livery of red when pleasure heightning all her charms she strained her warrior in her arms and begged whilst love and glory fire a son a son just like his sire such were the men in former times ere luxury had made our crimes our bitter punishment who bore their terrors to a foreign shore such were the men who free from dread by edwards and by henrys led spread like a torrent swelled with rains over haughty gallias trembling plains such were the men when lust of power to work him woe in evil hour debauched the tyrant from those ways on which a king should found his praise when stern oppression hand in hand with pride stalked proudly through the land when weeping justice was misled from her fair course and mercy dead such were the men in virtue strong who dared not see their countrys wrong who left the mattock and the spade and in the robes of war arrayed in their rough arms departing took their helpless babes and with a look stern and determined swore to see those babes no more or see them free such were the men whom tyrant pride could never fasten to his side by threats or bribes who freemen born chains though of gold beheld with scorn who free from every servile awe could never be divorced from law from that broad general law which sense made for the general defense could never yield to partial ties which from dependant stations rise could never be to slavery led for property was at their head such were the men in days of yore who called by liberty before her temple on the sacred green in martial pastimes often were seen  now seen no longer  in their stead to laziness and vermin bred a race who strangers to the cause of freedom live by other laws in other motives fight a prey to interest and slaves for pay valor how glorious on a plan of honor founded leads their van discretion free from taint of fear cool but resolved brings up their rear discretion valors better

printingpress arose each workman knew his task and each was honest and expert as leach hence learning struck a deeper root and science brought forth riper fruit hence loyalty received support even when banished from the court hence government was strength and hence religion sought and found defense hence englands fairest fame arose and liberty subdued her foes on a low simple turfmade throne raised by allegiance scarcely known from her attendants glad to be pattern of that equality she wished to all so far as could safely consist with social good the goddess sat around her head a cheerful radiance glory spread courage a youth of royal race lovelily stern possessed a place on her left hand and on her right sat honor clothed with robes of light before her magna charta lay which some great lawyer of his day the pratt was officd to explain and make the basis of her reign peace crowned with olive to her breast two smiling twinborn infants pressed at her feet couching war was laid and with a brindled lion played justice and mercy hand in hand joint guardians of the happy land together held their mighty charge and truth walked all about at large health for the royal troop the feast prepared and virtue was high priest such was the fame our goddess bore her temple such in days of yore what changes ruthless time presents behold her ruined battlements her walls decayed her nodding spires her altars broke her dying fires her name despised her priests destroyed her friends disgraced her foes employed herself by ministerial arts deprived even of the peoples hearts whilst they to work her surer woe feign her to monarchy a foe exiled by grief selfdoomd to dwell with some poor hermit in a cell or that retirement tedious grown if she walks forth she walks unknown hooted

trod the works of men and word of god whilst close behind on many a book in which he never deigns to look which he did not nay  could not read a bold bad man by power decreed for that bad end who in the dark scorned to do mischief set his mark in the full day the mark of hell and on the gospel stamped an l liberty fled her friends withdrew her friends a faithful chosen few honor in grief threw up

the man who meddles with a state whether to strengthen or oppose false are his friends and firm his foes how must his soul once ventured in plunge blindly on from sin to sin what toils he suffers what disgrace to get and then to keep a place how often whether wrong or right must he in jest or earnest fight risquing for those both life and limb who would not risque one groat for him under the temple lay a cave made by some guilty coward slave whose actions feared rebuke a maze of intricate and winding ways not to be found without a clue one passage only known to few in paths direct led to a cell where fraud in secret loved to dwell with all her tools and slaves about her nor feared lest honesty should rout her in a dark corner shunning sight of man and shrinking from the light one dull dim taper through the cell glimmering to make more horrible the face of darkness she prepares working unseen all kinds of snares with curious but destructive art here through the eye to catch the heart gay stars their tinsel beams afford neat artifice to trap a lord there fit for all whom folly bred wave plumes of feathers for the head garters the hag contrives to make which as it seems a babe might

private squeeze the levee vow with which no strange or recent case fools in deceive fools out of place corruption who in former times through fear or shame concealed her crimes and what she did contrived to do it so that the public might not view it presumptuous grown unfit was held for their dark councils and expelled since in the day her business might be done as safe as in the night her

whence seemed to rise joy in her breast a book of might most wonderful which black to white could turn and without help of laws could make the worse the better cause she read by flattering hopes deceived she wished and what she wished believed to make that book for ever stand the rule of wrong through all the land on the back fair and worthy note at large was magna charta wrote but turn your eye within and read a bitter lesson n  s creed ready even with a look to run fast as the coursers of the sun to worry virtue at her hand two halfstarvd greyhounds took their stand a curious model cut in wood of a most ancient castle stood full in her view the gates were barred and soldiers on the watch kept guard in the front openly in black was wrote the tower but on the back marked with a secretarys seal in bloody letters the bastile around a table fully bent on mischief of most black intent deeply determined that their reign might longer last to work the bane of one firm patriot whose heart tied to honor all their power defied and brought those actions into light they wished to have concealed in night begot born bred to infamy a privy council sat of three great were their names of high repute and favor through the land of bute the first entitled to the place of honor both by gown and grace who never let occasion slip to take right hand of fellowship and was so proud that should he meet the twelve apostles in the street he would turn his nose up at them all and shove his savior from the wall who was so mean meanness and pride still go together side by side that he would cringe and creep be civil and hold a stirrup for the devil if in a journey to his mind he would let him mount and ride behind who basely fawned through all his life for patrons first then for a wife wrote dedications which must make the heart of every christian quake made one man equal to or more than god then left him as before his god he left and drawn by pride shifted about to the other side was by his sire a parson made merely to give the boy a trade but he himself was thereto drawn by some faint omens of the lawn and on the truly christian plan to make himself a gentleman a title in which form arrayed him though fate never thought on it when she made him the oaths he took it is very true but took them as all wise men do with an intent if things should turn rather to temporize than burn gospel and loyalty were made to serve the purposes of trade religions are but paper ties which bind the fool but which the wise such idle notions far above draw on and off just like a glove all gods all kings let his great aim be answered were to him the same a curate first he read and read and laid in whilst he should have fed the souls of his neglected flock of reading such a mighty stock that he oerchargd the weary brain with more than she could well contain more than she was with spirits fraught to turn and methodize to thought and which like illdigested food to humors turned and not to blood brought up to london from the plow and pulpit how to make a bow he tried to learn he grew polite and was the poets parasite with wits conversing and wits then were to be found amongst noblemen he caught or would have caught the flame and would be nothing or the same he drank with drunkards lived with sinners herded with infidels for dinners with such an emphasis and grace blasphemed that potter kept not pace he in the highest reign of noon bawled bawdry songs to a psalm tune lived with men infamous and vile truckd his salvation for a smile to catch their humor caught their plan and laughed at god to laugh with man praised them when living in each breath and damned their memries after death to prove his faith which all admit is at least equal to his wit and make himself a man of note he in defense of scripture wrote so long he wrote and long about it that even believers gan to doubt it he wrote too of the inward light though no one knew how he came by it and of that influencing grace which in his life never found a place he wrote too of the holy ghost of whom no more than of a post he knew nor should an angel show him would he or know or choose to know him next for he knew twixt every science there was a natural alliance he wrote to advance his makers praise comments on rhimes and notes on plays and with an allsufficient air placed himself in the critics chair usurped over reason full dominion and governed merely by opinion at length dethroned and kept in awe by one plain simple man of law he armed dead friends to vengeance true to abuse the man they never knew examine strictly all mankind most characters are mixed we find and vice and virtue take their turn in the same breast to beat and burn our priest was an exception here nor did one spark of grace appear not one dull dim spark in his soul vice glorious vice possessed the whole and in her service truly warm he was in sin most uniform injurious satire own at least one sniveling virtue in the priest one sniveling virtue which is placed they say in or about the waist called chastity the prudish dame knows it at large by virtues name to this his wife and in these days wives seldom without reason praise bears evidence  then calls her child and swears that tom was vastly wild ripened by a long course of years he great and perfect now appears in shape scarce of the human kind a man without a manly mind no husband though he is truly wed though on his knees a child is bred no father injured without end a foe and though obliged no friend a heart which virtue never disgraced a head where learning runs to waste a gentleman wellbred if breeding rests in the article of reading a man of this world for the next was never included in his text a judge of genius though confessed with not one spark of genius blessed amongst the first of critics placed though free from every taint of taste a christian without faith or works as he would be a turk amongst turks a great divine as lords agree without the least divinity to crown all in declining age enflamed with church and partyrage behold him full and perfect quite a false saint and true hypocrite next sat a lawyer often tried in perilous extremes when pride and power all wild and trembling stood nor dared to tempt the raging flood this bold bad man arose to view and gave his hand to help them through steeled against compassion as they past he saw poor freedom breathe her last he saw her struggle heard her groan he saw her helpless and alone whelmed in that storm which feared and praised by slaves less bold himself had raised bred to the law he from the first of all bad lawyers was the worst perfection for bad men maintain in ill we may perfection gain in others is a work of time and they creep on from crime to crime he for a prodigy designed to spread amazement over mankind started fullripend all at once a perfect knave and perfect dunce who will for him may boast of sense his better guard is impudence his front with tenfold plates of brass secured shame never yet could pass nor on the surface of his skin blush for that guilt which dwelt within how often in contempt of laws to sound the bottom of a cause to search out every rotten part and worm into its very heart has he taken briefs on false pretense and undertaken the defense of trusting fools whom in the end he meant to ruin not defend how often even in open court has the wretch made his shame his sport and laughed off with a villains ease throwing up briefs and keeping fees such things as though to roguery bred had struck a little villain dead causes whatever their import he undertakes to serve a court for he by heart this rule had got power can effect what law cannot fools he forgives but rogues he fears if genius yoked with worth appears his weak soul sickens at the sight and strives to plunge them down in night so loud he talks so very loud he is an angel with the crowd whilst he makes justice hang her head and judges turn from pale to red bid all that nature on a plan most intimate makes near to man all that with grand and general ties binds good and bad the fool and wise knock at his heart they knock in vain no entrance there such suitors gain bid kneeling kings forsake the throne bid at his feet his country groan bid liberty stretch out her hands religion plead her stronger bands bid parents children wife and friends if they come thwart his private ends unmoved he hears the general call and bravely tramples on them all who will for him may cant and whine and let weak conscience with her line chalk out their ways such starving rules are only fit for coward fools fellows who credit what priests tell and tremble at the thoughts of hell his spirit dares contend with grace and meets damnation face to face such was our lawyer by his side in all bad qualities allied in all bad counsels sat a third by birth a lord o sacred word o word most sacred whence men get a privilege to run in debt whence they at large exemption claim from satire and her servant shame whence they deprived of all her force forbid bold truth to hold her course consult his person dress and air he seems which strangers well might swear the master or by courtesy the captain of a colliery look at his visage and agree halfhangd he seems just from the tree escaped a rope may sometimes break or men be cut down by mistake he has not virtue in the school of vice bred up to live by rule nor has he sense which none can doubt who know the man to live without his life is a continued scene of all that is infamous and mean he knows not change unless grown nice and delicate from vice to vice nature designed him in a rage to be the wharton of his age but having given all the sin forgot to put the virtues in to run a horse to make a match to revel deep to roar a catch to knock a tottering watchman down to sweat a woman of the town by fits to keep the peace or break it in turn to give a pox or take it he is in faith most excellent and in the words most full intent a true choice spirit we admit with wits a fool with fools a wit hear him but talk and you would swear obscenity herself was there and that profaneness had made choice by way of trump to use his voice that in all mean and low things great he had been bred at bilingsgate and that ascending to the earth before the season of his birth blasphemy making way and room had marked him in his mothers womb too honest for the worst of men in forms are honest now and then not to have in the usual way his bills sent in too great to pay too proud to speak to if he meets the honest tradesman whom he cheats too infamous to have a friend too bad for bad men to commend or good to name beneath whose weight earth groans who has been spared by fate only to show on mercys plan how far and long god bears with man such were the three who mocking sleep at midnight sat in counsel deep plotting destruction against a head whose wisdom could not be misled plotting destruction against a heart which never from honor would depart is he not ranked amongst our foes has not his spirit dared oppose our dearest measures made our name stand forward on the roll of shame has he not won the vulgar tribes by scorning menaces and bribes and proving that his darling cause is of their liberties and laws to stand the champion in a word nor need one argument be heard beyond this to awake our zeal to quicken our resolves and steel our steady souls to bloody bent sure ruin to each dear intent each flattering hope he without fear has dared to make the truth appear they said and by resentment taught each on revenge employed his thought each bent on mischief racked his brain to her full stretch but racked in vain scheme after scheme they brought to view all were examined none would do when fraud with pleasure in her face forth issued from her hiding place and at the table where they meet first having blessed them took her seat no trifling cause my darling boys your present thoughts and cares employs no common snare no random blow can work the bane of such a foe by nature cautious as he is brave to honor only he is a slave in that weak part without defense we must to honor make pretense that lure shall to his ruin draw the wretch who stands secure in law nor think that i have idly planned this fullripe scheme behold at hand with three months training on his head an instrument whom i have bred born of these bowels far from sight of virtues false but glaring light my youngest born my dearest joy most like myself my darling boy he never touched with vile remorse resolved and crafty in his course shall work our ends complete our schemes most mine when most he honors seems nor can be sound at home abroad so firm and full a slave of fraud she said and from each envious son a discontented murmur ran around the table all in place thought his full praise their own disgrace wondering what stranger she had got who had one vice that they had not when strait the portals open flew and clad in armor to their view m   the duellist came forth all knew and all confessed his worth all justified with smiles arrayed the happy choice their dam had made the end
