judgment upon the pictures that are now exhibited in the gallery but attempts to point out new subjects for future exhibitions and in the delineation of new subjects attention is paid to the principle laid down by our late great painter in his notes to the translation of fresnoy by mr mason that palpable situation is preferable to curious sentiment as the painter speaks to the eye  the shakspeare gallery as mused the prophet near mild chebars stream ezekiel chap  th  and prayed his god to dart the enlightning gleam abruptdescending from his airy height a form angelic rufhs upon his sight with smiling lip he cheered the hallowed sire and bad his soul to heavens best gift aspire then with strong hand he grasped his silver hair and swift conveyed him through the yielding air along the unknown region of the sky the dread mysterious deep abyss on high there inspiration her bright cloud withdrew and poured her visions on his daring view then on his rapturekindled eye arose those forms of splendour those terrific shows with which be peopled his celestial dream and swelled his proud magnificence of theme to englands leading bard thus genius came envelopd in a robe of holy flame and bore him with a whirlwinds rapid force beyond the solar road and starry course from which far towering and tremendous height while now he hovers with suspended flight the poet viewed as on a spacious plain of human passions the long shadowy train twas then the favored bard received the lore whose mystic veil was never removed before that revelation to his instinct given that ray from god the energy of heaven to his illumined sight was then consigned the deep recesses of the human mind the evervarying path of tortuous art and the dark passage to the tyrants heart thumbrageous winding of the thorny road that leads to quickeyd jealousys abode the gathering storms that over resentment roll the swelling waves that toss the fearsul soul the calm that breathes around the infants rest the rugged cavern of the murdrers breast the dread materials by the furies brought with which are forged despairs tempestuous thought the shaft that mingling pleasure with the pain bathes in the blood that warms the lovers vein oh thou the imperial genius of our land take a fresh garland from thy countrys hand triumphs unknown she hastens to proclaim and stamp a newborn era on thy fame too long as with the iron power of fate has custom bolted the historic gate enlightened boydell bursts the opposing bar on their rude hinge the ponderous portals jar while the rapt arts salute with loud acclaim this rich accession to their rising name genius of painting thy bright car ascend bid glowing energy thy steps attend triumphant ride through the unrifled land and seize thy plunder with victorious hand often have we heard the pure of taste complain of mawkish portraitures eternal reign of exhibitions which the art disgrace and pall the eye with many a vacant face let miniature erect her fairy school andmid her gewgaws unmolested rule let her bright dome each pleased narcissus seek to her let beauty hold her summer cheek let her delineate on her ivory plane the nuptial simper of the happy swain from these we turn to scenes of higher aim where eaglegenius soars to nobler game where fancy reason taste in one conjoined unfold the workings of the impassioned mind now to the laurelld academic band to every artists emulative hand munificence upholds her sacred prize and bids the daring reach it from the skies while expectation lifts the thought on high methinks i view with a prophetic eye

swayed by rigors rule shall mark the wonders of the albion school another gallery is to be erected for the purpose of receiving the whole collection when complete  if time should ever obliterate the

be pleased with knowing the opinion mr burke passed on this poem when it first appeared the imagery in which our great orator conveys his sentiment forms a new and sublime allusion to shakspeare in a

sacrata regit they whom in life the bond of friendship bound here in dread union press the funeral ground the rise and fall of the northern poetry a poem in two parts to the earl of orford dear sir i am ambitious of inscribing this poem to you as a small return for the warm commendation you bestoed upon it when the poem was first published this also gives me an opportunity which i readily embrace of paying a public testimony to the exalted regard with which i remain  your faithful humble servant edward jerningham  advertisement the materials that form the first part of the following poem are taken from the scandinavian poetics the edda in the remarks on the third fable of the edda are these words a powerful being had with his breath animated the drops out of which the first giant was formed this being whom the edda affects not to name was entirely distinct from odin who had his birth long after the formation of the giant ymir  this first agent or genius whom the edda affects not to name is supposed in the following poem to create from his own immediate power the system of the scaldic mythology as it would have been impossible to introduce the whole system without running into a tedious enumeration the principal features of it are only retained sufficient it is presumed to give some idea of the character of the northern poetry among other omissions the reader will find that no mention is made of gimle the mansion of bliss that was appropriated to the reception of the virtuous nor of nastrande the abode of the impious these places not being supposed to exist in their full extent till the general destruction of the world whereas the hall of odin and the caves of hela were peculiarly the elysium and the tartarus of the runic poetry they are perpetually referred to in the ancient songs of the scalds and the wild system of these contrasted abodes seems well calculated to encourage that spirit of war and enterprise which runs through the whole scandinavian minstrelsy  some expressions taken from the edda may appear obscure without an explanation  in the language of the scalds the world is styled the great vessel that floats on the ages  the rainbow the bridge of the gods  to drink the blood of friendship alludes to a ceremony performed by two warriors when they enter into an alliance of friendship they made incisions in their arms or breast and tasting each others blood they mutually swore that the death of the first of them who fell in battle should not pass unrevenged  to celebrate the mass of weapons was to fight against the christians whose religious sentiments the scandavians held in contempt as thinking them adverse to the spirit of war  the valkeries are a female troop whom odin sends to the field of battle upon invisible steeds their function is to choose such as are destined to slaughter and conduct their spirits to the paradise of the brave  fenris is a large wolf who is to break his chains at the general conflagration and to swallow the sun  the rise and fall of the northern poetry part i when urged by destiny the eventful year sailed through the portal of the northern sphere of scandinavia the rude genius rose his breast deeplabring with creations throes thrice over his head a powerful wand he whirled then called to life a new poetic world first through the yawning waves that roared around uprising slow from out the gulf profound amidst the fury of the beating storm the giant ymir heaved his horrid form now on the stormy cloud the rainbow glows where gay diversity her coloring throws beyond the sun the power now cast his eyes and bade the splendid city asgard ise obedient to the loud creative call she rises circled with a crystal wall her sapphire mansions crowned with opal towers over which the power a flood of radiance showers now a more daring task the genius planned he seized the rapid lightning in his hand and as around the broken rays he flung from the fallen spires the gods of asgard sprung see the dread ash exalt its lofty head and over a wide extent its umbrage shed there twelve of asgards gods in close divan sit in strict judgment on the deeds of man amidst the waving boughs enthroned on high an eagle sends around his watchful eye three virgin forms in snowy vests arrayed stand in the deep recesses of the shade the rich endowments of whose radiant mind are by the power to different acts consigned he gives to thee sage urda to restore the splendid deeds of times that are no more and faithful as the echo to the sound repeat transactions that were once renowned clear to thy view vernandi are unfurled the various scenes that fill the extensive world to thee o skulda the dread power is given to read the counsels in the breast of heaven with daring forecast pierce the abyss of time and

pillar of the state next at the awful powrs commanding call arose to view great odins festive hall engraved with sunbeams on the crystal gate appeared   here they refude in splendid state who as they slept in death reclined their head on valors bier the battles rugged bed who to the bliss the intrepid claim aspired who welcomed pain and with a smile expired now as the genius waves his hallowed hand the valkeries appear a female band prompt to the storm of lances to repair on viewless steeds to scour the fields of air mark as they hover over the crowded plain the chosen chiefs the deathdevoted train the power now formed the cowards dewlling place the seat of pain and mansion of disgrace deep under earth he fixed the drear abode through which the rueful stream of anguish flowed loud roar the surges through the gulf profound while cavernd echoes murmur back the sound close at the gate sat deaths terrific maid her meagre form in sable weeds arrayed awreath of living snakes entwine her head and thus with shrilling voice the spectre said haste to my caves ye impotent of heart who meanly shrink from valors daring part ye too who lingering on with feeble breath crept through the languor of old age to death see on the horrid battles bleeding plain the ravenbrood rejoicing over the slain yet then in vain they gorge the grateful food death smites them at the dire repast of blood when lo their pinions to the wondering view combining into one vast texture grew the gory heads conjoined in one dread fold around the frame a grisly margin rolled now selfupborne the sable banner flings bold to the wind its wideexpanding wings exalt the genius cries thy plumes on high wave thy dark signal to the warriors eye thintrepid youth beneath thy magic shade thro slaughtered heaps to victory shall wade though the ravenbanner is not mentioned in the edda it is of great antiquity it was supposed to be endued with some magical power and to insure success  now from a rock on which the genius stood he marked below a slowlywaving wood then raised his awful voice  hail hallowed gloom where thought is reared and fancy decks her plume who holdst within thy vast sequestered bower a numerous train that wait the ripening hour resign thy charge yield to demanding time the living fathers of the runic rhyme swift at his word the ancient sire surveyed tumultuous rushing from the solemn shade armed with the powerful harp an ardent throng the mighty founders of the northern song twas then the power resumed  ye chosen band at natures furnace take your faithful stand there forge the verse amidst the fiercest glow and thence the thunderbolts of genius throw rouse rouse the tyrant from his flattering dream full at his vices wield the daring theme till over his cheek shall flash intruding shame that blushing dawn of virtues rising flame now on the bosom of the listening youth impress engrave the sacred form of truth bid them as varying life unfolds to view be still through all her scenes to honor true true to the man on friendships list enrolled thentrusted secret of his sold untold woe to that chief and blasted be his fame whose mean soul chills affections holy flame forgetting that he once with zeal impressed drank the pure drops that flowed from friendships breast now to the realm ye hallowed bards impart this truth and touch with joy the human heart in mans too transient perishable frame a glowing unabating fire proclaim which as that frame lies mouldering into clay shall through the encircling ruin burst its way thus when a torrent of impetuous rain drowns the low nest that trusted to the plain high soars the bird beyond destructions flow and owns no kindred with the wreck below then over some stately tombs dim entrance bend and from the daring harp unerring send as from the sounding bow with vigor sped the darts of harmony that wake the dead   be too of prophecy the dreadful lords and strike the solemn deep mysterious chords skilld to reveal futuritys dark laws inforce the song with many an awful pause in sounds that terrify the soul disclose veiled in the womb of time destructive woes say whirlwinds shall provoke the roaring main say stars shall drop like glittering gems of rain say fenris bursting from his timeworn chains shall bear wild horror through the runic plains doomd while the course of havoc he shall run with jaws outstretchd to rend the falling sun say the gigantic ship the floating world shall on the iron rock of ruin hurled sink  like a dream that rushing from the mind leaves not a glimmering of its pomp behind ye bold enthusiasts join the warlike train when true to fame they seek the hostile plain bid the loud harp delight the valiant throng and add the forceful eloquenc of song thinnd of his numbers mark the struggling chief encircled close and severed from relief now strike the cheering harp  it is heard no more lost in the conflicts wild increasing roar yet strike again yet strike the note profound i to the chief will waft the inspiring sound till through the pressure of the battles storm he over the slain a rugged path shall form thus on the main when frozen fragments sail and with huge mounds oppose the giant whale the oceans lord enraged at the delay thro stubborn crashing icerocks bursts his way now round some deathstruck chief in silence throng while thus he breathes his own historic song  though gashd with wounds unwounded is my fame in the wars field i chased the flying game wrapped in the jealous veil of lingering night did we not chide the times reluctant flight did not our voices hail the morning ray shouting the matins of the important day when foreign streamers glittered to our view how swift our weapons from the scabbards flew twas joy to see the riven helmets fly twas joy to swell confusions thundering cry twas joy to see extending all around the hostile banners spread the lowly ground methought the danish field thus mantled over heaved

future state where to his wondering vision shall expand adornd with heroes a refulgent land ye glowing masters of the scaldic song in the first rude ages rocks and trees supplied the materials for

snowflood hurries down the mountains side the sun bright sailing midst his ardent beams melts the rude havoc into various streams which rushing through the naked vales below rouse vegetation as they

0    a christian cathedral was erected on its ruins fourscore years after at the introduction of christianity the interposition of angels and the appearance of ghosts grew familiar to the scandinavian poetry which was afterward enriched by allegories and by the accession of new images which flowed to it through various channels particularly from the east  see richardsons differtation  when colleges were founded and the general attention was directed to classical learning the wild conceptions of the scaldic minstrels gradually fell into disuse  this short analysis contains the subject of the

sending to the soul its note profound the admiring numbers next the altar viewed crowned with the image of the holy rood displaying the sublime awards of heaven a bleeding deity  a world forgiven  the awestruck bards stood bound as with a spell while from their grasp the chilled harp lifeless fell the lowly valley and the hill sublime echoed no more the battlebreathing rhyme thus an eclipse by terrors hand imbrownd wrapped in concealment the poetic ground but time at length the hovering veil withdrew when all the gorgeous scenery burst to view the genius joyd to see his ancient store enriched with many a form unknown before the clouds recede while opening skies display the angelic hierarchy in proud array rank rising above rank in order due the splendid consistory meets his view now spirits of another form appear and from the yawning gravestheir shadows rear here glides a ghastly shade intent to shed a scene of terror round the murdrers bed there midst the solemn silence of

near the village of mascon on the river graone the head of this convent in the time of abelard was distinguished for his learning and humanity history elevates him above the vulgar herd of monks by the appellation of the venerable peter he extended his generous protection to the unfortunate abelard when he was under the censure of the court of rome  saint bernard also is connected with the story of paraclete this great man stands eminently forward in the picture of the twelfth century born with a mind too restless and enterprising to be confined within the circle of monastic occupations he rushed into the tumult of active life and took the lead in some of the most important transactions of that period with an undisciplined ardour peculiar to his character he precipitated his country into that ruinous measure the second crusade behold him at another time hastening to the contest that held all europe in suspense which exhibited two contending candidates for the popedom the authority and vehemence of bernard overpowered the pretensions of anacletus and innocent was seated on the papal throne the enemies of this celebrated abbot never impeached his moral character but it must be allowal that in his zeal against the innovation of new opinions he has sometimes left unregarded the superior duty of charity a letter of his to the cardinal guido the popes legate in france contains the most intolerant and sanguinary counsel  abelard in the following epistle lays a considerable stress upon his sentence of excommunication in the dark ages that spiritual humiliation was felt as the greatest calamity the relation the parent the lover the friend suspended their endearing offices and withdrew from the degraded offender  the following poem has been distinguished by a
