under the royal exchange and charles corbett at addisons head over against st dunstans church in fleetstreet       price one shilling  a reply to mr douglasss short account of midwifery etc mr douglass his short account of the state of midwifery in london and westminster in which he has endeavored to cast a cloud of reproach over the characters of those that practice this noble and necessary branch of physic but particularly my own need not have remained so long unanswered could i have persuaded myself it had deserved it  malicious productions are generally best despised but lest silence should be looked upon as an argument of guilt as in these cases by the weak it sometimes is and mr douglass should be encouraged to deal farther in calumny and aspersion i am at length induced to give him a reply which i shall at once enter upon without farther preface or preamble  to begin then with his dedication the only motives of dedications seem to be either to submit ones performance to a proper judge to make some small return of gratitude for benefits received or else to curry favor now as the honorable and worthy lady to whom mr douglass has dedicated his book cannot possibly be supposed to be a judge of its merit and in all probability never conferred the least favor upon the author the reader cannot well be mistaken in conjecturing what was mr douglasss true drift in his dedication  his quibble how a man can be a wife without being an hermaphrodite whether a maid may not be taught the art of delivering women and yet be no wife that widows lay women and yet are not wifes and his query about girlmidwifes are too low and trifling to deserve a serious answer and seem rather to be the product of a pert sufficiency than a sound judgment they are rather indications of one who was willing to cut himself out work for criticizing at all events than of a cool and sober reasoner  in answer to his i shall beg leave to put the following queries    if the term midwifery is properly applied to the practice of that art when in the hands of either sex why may not either man or woman so practicing be in propriety of speech called a midwife   is not the word midwifery rather expressive of practice on a wife who only is presumed to want the assistance of a man or woman in the present case than of the sex of the person practicing   on receding from the common form and custom of speech in this case is not the supposed absurdity exchanged for unintelligibility that is what idea can be fixed to what etymology found for the new term midman and midwoman the word midman he owns himself is not an overneat expression and it certainly carries to use his own words more nonsense in the very front of it than the term he has endeavored to explode custom or use has always the effect of a law  quem penes arbitrium est and jus and norma loquendi  hor and what is language but a customary and received use of words so that we may see the term manmidwife may be defended both from custom and propriety and will doubtless be in use long after mr douglass himself shall be forgotten  in page   mr douglass falls very foul on the character of the celebrated dr chamberlen representing him as puzzling and confounding the art he professed to the advantage of most of the greatest families in this kingdom rather than improving it and very indecently and unjustly too brands him as an artful and insinuating translator he says he rather darkens than explains his authors  mauriceaus meaning and confidently affirms all the additional knowledge he was the author of to be only to tell the world that he and his family can assist women in labor better than any body else and gives him the mean epithet of a nostrummonger  page   he pronounces every thing with an ipse dixit like a second aristotle and sets himself up at once both for judge and jury the late learned dr friend in his epistle to dr mead about purging in the small pox gives dr chamberlen a very different character from mr douglass speaking of him as one most skilful in the art he professed  hist   whence we may plainly see how different the character of the same person is when drawn by real and pretended judges  p   he taxes him with perverting mr mauriceaus design by his translation and having his own literest at heart more than that of the midwomen as he ridiculously terms them  he accuses him of coaxing the midwomen and yet in the same sentence coaxes them himself and pays a fulsome compliment to the qualifications of the town midwomen above those in the country p   the town midwomen may possibly some of them become his pupils when he gives his intended lectures and so ought in prudence to be well spoken of but those in the country being too remote for this extraordinary advantage will for aught i can see in his opinion still labor under the imputation of being unqualified till his scheme for having midmen to instruct the midwomen in country places can take effect unless their affairs can permit them to take a journey to lad lane where it seems the only person proper to instruct them is to be met with  upon dr chamberlens saying that in countries and places where advice is not seasonably to be had midwifes are compelled to do their best as god shall enable them p   which is a common expression for a conscientious discharge of their duty according to the best of their abilities mr douglass takes occasion here to cut a very indecent joke upon the deity by asking if god has any where promised to give any more assistance to a country than a town midwoman in the next place he substitutes god and the doctor acting as two equal beings and then to prove that the divine godhead will reward us with the knowledge of any useful art in proportion to our own honest diligence and assiduity which in holy writ he has assured us he will or which is the same thing to prove a point of revelation he quotes a passage from a heathen poet dii laborantibus omnia vendunt thereby making mention of false gods in the plural number for what the true and one god only can perform risum teneatis upon dr chamberlens advising the good women not to blame those who are not backward in dangerous cases to desire advice lest it cost them dear he indecently asks if it does not always cost them dear when they do alluding i presume to the gratifications usually given in such cases notwithstanding he advances a little farther that a surgeon ought to be well satisfied for any improvement in or invention relating to a manual operation p  0 is not delivery wherever the help of either man or woman is required in the strictest sense a manual operation and if so why must not a physician be rewarded for his trouble as well as a surgeon but self like oil will be always uppermost  in the same page the  th the plot of mr douglasss whole performance begins to open when he says that the midwomens want of knowledge is more their misfortune than their fault because they have not yet had such proper opportunities of informing themselves as they ought to have but now it must hereafter be their fault more than their misfortune if they are not better qualified after knowing where the source of all knowledge in midwifery is to be found this is the first act of mr douglasss farce and in the succeeding ones the plot will unravel itself more and more so as to be well understood by the dullest reader unless i am much mistaken  he asking  page   whether physicians dont always make a sad outcry and are not alarmed as if their craft was in danger when surgeons use pen and ink except in pauper cases is an indecent and false reflection on the gentlemen of the faculty herein he brands physic that glorious science with the ignominious name of a craft as if it were only a knavish combination of men to get money and at the same time openly taxes them with covetousness and hardness of heart in denying their advice to paupers it is well known that all the gentlemen of that profession whose advice is worth having are very charitable and willing to relieve the distressed poor without any view or expectation of gratification and where he can give me an instance of one surgeons curing a wound setting a fracture or reducing a dislocated limb for nothing i will undertake to bring him five physicians in this town that have attended in the most noisome and contagious distempers without the least desire of reward nay so far from it they have relieved the poor they have thus generously cured with money and other necessaries out of their own private bounty but i shall leave this to the resentment of those to whom it belongs  in the same page he says that the doctor allows midwives are compelled to do their best as god shall direct them to which he replies now supposing god should direct one of them to make use of a crotchet in a fit case and after a proper manner must she be tried for her life for it which is another shocking joke upon the godhead equal if not superior to that before observed  here too is another coax to the london midwomen that the hardiest of them would tremble upon his belief at the very thought of a crotchet unless they were fully instructed how to use it but poor unfortunate country midwomen he cannot pretend to answer for them they are at too remote a distance from lad lane to come to his lectures and if upon this melancholy occasion i may be allowed to borrow a scrap of latin from him proh dolor o lack olack  page   mr douglass asks if dr chamberlen s cobweb is not easily seen through now were i disposed to ill nature with how much more justice might i apply this saying to his own  page    he seems to own my observation on dr chamberlens secret just but i was unwilling like mr douglass to make any farther remark upon it and thought what i said sufficient without an unmannerly freedom  page    he bestows upon dr chamberlen the ignominious title of a magisterial and dictatorial writer  not content with this in the next page    he very heartily calls him a fulsome repeater a nauseous recommender of his nostrum a writer that has not made one remark to the advantage of midwomen and one who seems to have had nothing else in view but to tell them when they ought to send for him and to let them know that he etc could serve them better than any body else all which may be reckoned as proofs of mr douglasss want of candor and good manners and now to make use of his own words utrum horum p     page  0 he owns that surgeons who have made any considerable discovery in manual operations which cannot be made universally useful as medicines may and really are unless they are fully and distinctly explained should always communicate gratis the fruits of their labor and expense no says he they ought to be handsomely rewarded not only for the real service they have done but to encourage industry in others why then does he accuse me for keeping the use of the fillet a secret which is in the strictest sense a manual operation and one that cannot be made universally useful as medicines may indeed he has here spoke my own private sentiments in this we entirely agree and i presume he will hardly hereafter ask me why i dont communicate it he himself it seems from his own words cannot expect it gratis so that he must first tell me what he will be pleased to offer before we can come to any other terms however for his comfort i promise him to be more reasonable than he says dr chamberlen was with the french kings physician p    and to be contented with less than ten thousand crowns though in proportion to the superiority mr douglass always seems to think surgeons have over physicians i ought at least to insist upon twenty thousand  page    he says dr chamberlen is insolent and there very heartily ranks doctors apothecaries shavers and nostrummongers all together but has wisely left the surgeons and consequently himself out of the number as being superioris sortis still to borrow a little more of his learning to doctors and apothecaries and now the town has been informed of their superior merit i hope no body will dare after this public notification to refuse them their proper homage upon pain of mr john douglasss displeasure  in the same page he puts a question which no body ever denied whether the good which surgeons do their patients be not as evident as the sun e g when they cut for the stone perforate the scull reduce a luxation etc but it is doubtful it seems from baglivi whether the cures supposed to be performed by physicians even those of the first rank are mostly owing to nature or the medicines etc which they directed no one that i know of has ever questioned the good which surgeons do in their own proper profession but i am afraid when they go beyond their last they will doubly verify baglivis saying of the physicians and do more harm than they are capable of foreseeing surgeons he observes only practice midwifery in france and so says he they ought to do every where else what then in his wisdom he will propose to be done with such physicians as are engaged in this profession i know not unless he will generously procure them to be promoted to the dignity of shavers among which he just now chose to rank them for which the faculty ought doubtless to be extremely thankful  a little after he accuses the doctor of going out of his ken but why only because he pretends to advise the surgeons and in the next page    to be even with him for this presumption affirms that the doctor did not understand that very little part of surgery the method of cutting childrens gums so well as the very nurses  in the same page he hints as if the doctor was not apprisd of the use of the crotchet and in the next page    concludes that mr mauriceau was a good and faithful surgeon and chamberlen only a  doctor with a long dash before it it is to be hoped mr douglass may so far overcome his modesty as in the next edition of his elaborate performance to fill up the blanks that are in this if the antithesis here is to hold good and mr mauriceau was a good and faithful surgeon which i will not deny the contrary character must necessarily fall upon dr chamberlen as a physician but how far mr douglass is capable of judging of the qualifications of a physician or who set him up for a censor i must leave the faculty to determine  page    he sums up the whole he has to say in relation to dr chamberlen in telling us that his main design in his preface and notes upon mr mauriceaus book was to puzzle rather than instruct the midwomen or midmen and to persuade them that he and the rest of the nostrummongers as he ignominiously calls them could serve them better than any other artists  now is not this a very fine character of a physician who was allowed by all proper judges to be a man of great honor and abilities if what he would insinuate be believd must not the doctor appear viler than a common pickpocket or streetrobber wilfully to puzzle and mislead people in matters relating to life and death but what seems to stick most upon mr douglasss stomach as a thing he can no ways digest is the doctors recommending physicians as fitter persons to deliver women than surgeons will mr douglass pretend to say that the surgeons have more knowledge learning and abilities than the gentlemen of the faculty if not how come surgeons to be more qualified for the art of midwifery than physicians but self is here to be concerned and mr douglass seems inclind for the common good to turn those illiterate people the physicians out of practice pointing out the occupation he thinks them most fit to be employed in under the laudable profession of shavers  from dr chamberlen mr douglass proceeds to mr giffard surgeon another late writer in midwifery for it seems they must all feel his critical lash but as i shall leave the defense of mr giffard to his publisher and reviser the ingenious dr hoddy who is much more capable of doing it than myself i shall be short in my remarks on this head  first then upon mr giffards ingenuously relating that a manmidwife had worked upon a poor woman and left her in a worse condition than he found her he makes this paultry witticism in a parenthesis that midmen are not at all witches any more than the midwomen  page    a little after upon mr giffards saying that the fate of those children whose placenta offers first is death if a proper person be not at hand to deliver them immediately he subjoins who can be so proper or likely to be in the way as a skilful midwoman and yet at the same time he observes that as long as they want skill to perform it the child must die before a midman can be brought now where the good women are to meet with this extraordinary skill the reader will see in the sequel  again upon mr giffards heartily saying that mischiefs may be prevented by a skilful operator if sent for in time he replies but much better if a skilful operatrix attended thereby giving the old women the preference before the surgeons which as it does not seem to have been mr douglasss drift must be looked upon as an unwary concession  page    he asks what signifies finding fault with the midwives in every page without attempting a remedy and page    affirms that it is our way to haul the midwomen in head and shoulders guilty or not guilty to which i shall only reply that one if not the only method of attempting a remedy is to find fault where they deserve it and strictly without favor or prejudice to show them their errors without which they will never be much improved but that we haul them in as he expresses himself head and shoulders guilty or not guilty is what mr douglass ought first to have proved before he had so roundly and uncharitably chargd us with it  page  0 he asks if our women are not as capable of being taught as the french women i answer in the affirmative and beg he would tell me who ever made a question of it  page    upon mr giffards observing what indeed is but too true that the menmidwifes being sent for so late too often proceeds from the ignorance or selfsufficiency of the midwife he excuses them by affirming that it is oftener from the modesty of the women covetousness or real poverty of the men etc thus you fee his pupils the midwomen are infallible and the saddle is to be placed on any horse rather than the right one had mr douglass long practiced the art of midwifery he would have been sufficiently sensible that many menmidwives have been hindered from being sent for in cases of the utmost extremity where the sufferers were willing enough to have had superior advice and the husbands neither covetous nor poor  page    he says it is true that women may be taught the method of touching with very little trouble now if he makes the same concession in relation to the other branches of midwifery it is to be hoped his lectures may be heard at a very little expense which is a consequence possibly he was not aware of  from mr giffard mr douglass advances to take notice of my own essay upon midwifery first published in      and after i have dwelt so long in defending the character of the two forementioned gentlemen whose shades are no way able to answer for themselves i hope i shall not be thought too partial if i should now endeavor to defend my own against mr douglasss trifling and unjust aspersions  in the first place he charges me with complimenting the midwomen because i wrote a book for their improvement and thought that all the treatises hitherto written on this subject were calculated more for the instruction of my own sex than the other page    this he affirms to be a mistake because he says madam du tertre composed her book for the use of the midwives apprentices in the hotel dieu and madam lovys burgeoiss book was translated into english and put forth for the sole use of midwives now as to the first i presume it never was translated from his own pretensions to undertake it and i do not pretend to understand the french language as to the other i never saw it or heard of it before  upon my saying that i have daily during the space of above twenty years practice seen many fatal mistakes committed by midwives he asks what sort of midwives these must have been who committed fatal mistakes every day for above twenty years together by daily i did not think i should be understood every particular day but that i had frequently seen such fatal practices as himself doubtless would had he ever been conversant in the practice of that art he would have the world believe him so expert in nor can i help observing in this place that mr douglass cannot be a proper person to instruct others as not being master of the art himself he then puts a quere how are the civil magistrates to be apprizd of their malpractice if the honest testimonies of such as are called in upon them and are witnesses and judges of it are not to be regarded how are the women themselves to be made sensible of their errors if their superiors are denied the liberty of reproving them when faulty and freely professing the truth if the men are to be blamed for their integrity and impartiality and accused of hauling the women in head and shoulders guilty or not guilty whenever they blame the midwives for their faults mr douglasss quere in relation to the civil magistrates is like for ever to remain unanswered  again upon my delivering it as my opinion that such mistakes could not have happened had they ever read a treatise so properly adapted to their capacities and at the same time so full and plain as i hoped my own to be he asks with his wonted candor whether if they had read madam du tertres little book they would not have found it more properly adapted to their capacities as full and plain and her sentiments more accurately expressed to which i reply as having never seen nor been able to understand her book if i had that i cannot tell though at the same time i must in justice to myself observe that i cannot see what relation this has to the matter in dispute nor can madam du tertres little book being as full and plain or more accurately expressed than mine hinder mine from being full and plain too which is all that i have asserted  besides if forty persons as well as madam du tertre had made the same improvements and observations in practice and wrote them in a language i do not understand how does that detract from or lessen any thing i advance a candid person would think that it rather confirmd it  in the next place he taxes me with having the same aim he has the assurance to assert dr chamberlen had namely to tell the midwomen when and in what particular cases to send for my superior advice and not to instruct them how to give better assistance themselves after the very indecent freedom he has taken with the character of dr chamberlen i cannot wonder at any he can take with mine as most willingly owning my own inferiority but before mr douglass had taxed me with this uncharitable way of proceeding he ought to have been better acquainted with me than he seems to be and to have proved that i have not laid down any rules for the improvement and advantage of midwives will he affirm that i have advanced nothing toward their instruction if so let him ingenuously prove it not by low and impertinent cavils but cool and sober arguments and not arrogate to himself the offices of both judge and executioner in a cause wherein he appears only as an accuser and i doubt not but that before i have done pleading the court of impartial readers will look upon his prosecution as entirely malicious and readily grant me a copy of my indictment does not he own that madam du tertre and myself have advanced the same methods of practice and does not he highly extol many things in her treatise which are found in mine since then we have lived in different ages and have never had the least knowledge of one another how can that practice be esteemed bad in me which is reckoned so extraordinary in madam du tertre  page    he accuses me of first coaxing and then threatening the midwives as dr chamberlen did before me because i say i have ever found the most experienced midwives the most ready to call in farther assistance and that they find their account in it whilst it is quite otherwise with those who from too great an opinion of their own judgment and abilities run great hazards or at the best call us in too late and so lose their good name and justly suffer in their reputation that the best midwives send early for advice upon appearance of danger and difficulty the suffering fair readily consents to it and by this means both lives are saved pray who can see any thing in this passage like coaxing or threatening or indeed any thing else but plain and known truth i would desire to know who coaxes the women when he immediately asks if the suffering fair would not have been much more obliged to her midwoman if she had performed the work herself and thereby saved both the uneasiness and expense of superior advice of the first part of this accusation then he appears to be guilty himself and the reader need not be at a loss for the reason of it but as for threatening that was not mr douglasss intention at a time when he was bespeaking them for his pupils for it must be a very silly bird indeed that according to the proverb bewrays its own nest he likewise desires to know if these two speeches were not picked out of dr chamberlens preface i answer no but must beg leave to subjoin that i shall never have the worse opinion of myself for thinking alike with so great a man notwithstanding mr douglass is pleased to give him the title of a puzzling confounding insinuating insolent nostrummonger  upon my faying that i have an invention of my own to extract children when the head presents and sticks in the passage with the fillet which i must beg leave to be silent in as the great dr chamberlen was before me in choosing to conceal the method whereby he could extract children in this case without hooks where other artists are forced to use them he adds was there ever such an excuse beard of because the great dr chamberlen says he acted a very ungenerous part in this affair therefore mr chapman must be excused for doing just the same thing then he asks whether i might not as well have said that the doctor had been guilty of simony or sacrilege and was not punished for it and therefore i might for the same reason expect the same grace in case i should ever take it in my head to commit the same crimes not remembering his former declaration page  0 of his being far from thinking that the public has any right to expect that every private man who at a considerable expense and assiduous study makes any considerable discovery in manual operations which cannot be made universally useful as medicines may and really are etc should communicate gratis the fruits of his labor and expense besides at the same time that i keep the fillet a secret i frankly own the forceps to be preferable for which i give my reasons how then can the concealment of the former be an injury to any  a little after page    he taxes me with being mistaken in affirming that i was the second englishman who wrote originally and professedly on this subject now i never affirmed that i was the second englishman etc only said if i was not mistaken etc essay on midwifery first edit preface last page but one this i afterward was sensible of and accordingly heartily owned it in my second edition in this following words second edit preface p    when i published the first edition of this work i thought myself at least the second englishman who had written professedly on the subject i have since found i was mistaken etc so that mr douglass himself is here guilty of a mistake if not a wilful misrepresentation though whether i was right or wrong in this it is nothing to the subject matter and at best but a low and trifling cavil  upon my saying if the child offers any other part than the head be it what it will the hand is to be passed gently into the womb the feet are to be searched for the child to be turned and that way brought forth and page  0 having farther observed that a child presenting with its head is often to be turned and delivered with the feet first and in all other postures whatever always with the feet first mr douglass proceeds but suppose a foot or the feet present what need have we then to pass the hand into the womb to fetch them and suppose the buttocks present and are so low in the passage that they cannot be pushed back without danger is it not much easier and quicker to slip the fingers over the bend of the thigh or over the ossa ilia and draw it forward in that posture than to run the risque of forcing them back to come at the feet and then triumphantly concludes it to be plain from these quotations that i notwithstanding my    years practice was perfectly unacquainted with this case though madam du tertre describes it very accurately i have said in my first edition except when it presents with the feet etc and in my second have mentioned the buttocks and when the child may be brought away in that posture page    i own there by making that case an exception that this had slipped me in the first so that nothing is more plain than that i was not unacquainted with the case though mr douglass is pleased with his usual candor to accuse me of being perfectly so no person can possibly imagine a case of that nature should never happen to me in twenty seven years extensive practice and though i forgot to take notice of it in the essay yet i have sufficiently mentioned it in my treatise so that if the former had been much more imperfect in this respect than it is yet as it stands corrected in the latter it must certainly be very unfair and ungenerous to fix upon any but the last edition  upon my giving an account of having with my finger dilated and cast back the mouth of the womb and so released a little prisoner he asks if madam du tertres finger would not have released the prisoner as soon and as safely as mine page    upon my saying again that more than two inches of the string itself from the navel is unnecessary whereas i have commonly known midwives leave five or six he adds that madam du tertre likewise advises the string to be tied two inches from the childs navel and then triumphs in the following manner where now is the mighty secret he makes such a fuss about is it any thing more than an old woman told us before he was born page    upon saying too that it is my constant practice to pass my hand immediately after the birth in order to extract the placenta he enquires what there is so extraordinary in it that it deserves to be noted so emphatically as my constant practice is and then asks if madam du tertre etc did not so page    again he twits dr maubray as well as myself with madam du tertre as likewise in page    and lastly page    upon my declaring my unwillingness to put a person upon her labor too early which god knows is too often done he asks if madam du tertre would not as carefully have avoided putting her upon her labor before her time as i did  as for madam du tertre and myself being of the same opinion i cannot possibly see how he can fairly turn that to my disadvantage since what is right in madam du tertre can never be wrong in me so that instead of doing me an injury which i think was plainly his intention by such trifling insinuations he has paid me a handsome compliment in owning my practice to be the same with madam du tertres whom he seems to be so very fond of  to return page    after repeating what i have said in relation to the folly of dipping the infants hand when hanging out of the womb in cold water rubbing it with ice or touching it with a wet cloth which some ignorant midwives practice he desires to be informed how many midwives i have ever known guilty of these fooleries i answer too many and it is probable had mr douglass long practiced the art of midwifery he would have met with the same  a much greater instance of his being but little conversant in this art he gives us in the very next page where upon my saying that few midwives are sufficiently apprizd of the unhappy symptom there mentioned viz a violent flooding he declares that he differs so far from me in this assertion that in his opinion there is not one midwife in a thousand who knows not that a violent flooding will either occasion abortion or death i confess few if any midwives can be so totally ignorant as not to know that flooding will occasion death if no stop be put to its fury yet many are apt to flatter themselves that the sufferer may be delivered by her natural pains till it is too late as appears from several cases i have cited few to what i could have given which shows they were not sufficiently apprizd of the danger and i hope i may be excused being so full on this head as many have been before me since it is a thing of such vast consequence in practice  but to return back to mr douglasss observation in relation to what i advanced about the navelstring page    i thought it proper to mention what i have there said as i had very often found the leaving so much of the string to be a common practice and indeed the custom of most midwives in the country i never once mentioned it as a secret so the fuss about it as he elegantly words it is with himself  again as to his quere whether it is not every bodys practice to pass their hand immediately and examine if there are any more children and if no more to fetch the placenta i answer no not even among the assistants of my own sex much less with the women for i assert that few of them take this method  few midwives even in this town pass their hand if i may give credit to their declaration and my own experience and fewer yet in the country so that the woman in whose case this is mentioned had really stood but a bad chance had an ignorant midwife been called in upon her as i have there affirmed here mr douglass has certainly burnt his fingers and taken hold of one of the best observations in my whole book which may serve to show his extraordinary judgment that few midwives in this town do pass their hand is an affirmation i dare submit to the chief of the profession pray whence comes it that we are so often sent for to extract the placenta  is not what i have wrote on this subject matter of instruction to midwives and therefore as it is against my own interest it must be judged to be honest at least which i trust will have no small weight in my favor  if i have written any thing that will not stand the test but that my herculean antagonist does not pretend to why do not proper judges disprove me if nothing but what will stand the trial why must i be loaded with such trifling and malicious cavils really i think no one more unhappy than he who snarls and shows his teeth yet cannot bite and i at once despise and pity such a person  all midwives are not du tertres and why i should not say this is my constant practice i know not nor do i see wherein i could offend any person thereby and nothing surely but calumny and ill nature could ever have suggested a censure from this how wrongfully then does he accuse me of having condemned the midwives unjustly because i affirm that if an ignorant midwife had been concerned in the case abovementioned who had only taken the first child and afterbirth the last would probably have been left behind and either violent flooding or a bad fever would have ensued and as the woman was before ill and extremely weak it would very likely have cost her her life is not what i have said true can what is here spoken of an ignorant midwife belong to a good one and would not one ignorant of her profession have occasioned in all probability the misfortune i there mention for i say again that few do pass their hand upon the whole then i think i may with most justice retort his own words upon him and apply what he says of the midwives to myself viz that guilty or not guilty it is all one i must be hauld in and condemned for an imaginary as well as a real fault page  0  page    he relates the case of my being sent for to a gentlewoman who kept a tavern at ipswich viz that the child was dead and the mother flooding that when two midwives and a surgeon just then set out in the profession had all used their endeavors to little or no purpose i was called in and delivered her in a minute that i left her under the care of dr beeston but that she died in six or seven days upon this he very heartily observes that i have not indeed told this young gentlemans name though i have described him so well that he doubts there is not a man in all ipswich nor perhaps twenty miles round but can tell who i mean and then craftily insinuates what injury might not such a tale do a worthy young fellow and twits me with being inconsistent with myself in relation to the advice i gave in page     of my first edition namely that we should not take an unkind advantage of a slip or accident that may happen to befall a brother in his practice  i hope i cannot fairly be charged with being inconsistent with myself or taking an unkind advantage of a brother whereas the publication of my essay was many years after the case referred to and the young surgeon there mentioned had in all probability either given up that branch of practice or was well established in it  in the next page he cites a passage from my preface wherein i say that the dignity of this art will appear to every person in a much more advantageous light if we reflect on the learning of the professors of it and then ignominiously subjoins e g dr c  dr m  dr w  dr g  dr a  dr b  dr gregoire tota notus in urbe etc it is much to be wished that mr douglass had condescended so far as to have filled up this formidable catalogue of blanks that the gentlemen he there reflects upon might have a fair opportunity of defending themselves from such scurrilous treatment is this being consistent with himself to charge me with detracting from a young surgeons character in so favorable a manner as not to give even the initial letter of his name when in the very next paragraph he uncharitably and maliciously insults the reputation of no less than seven physicians as he himself seems to own by giving them all the title of doctor but if by this he would only aim at those who would willingly impose themselves upon the world as such he should have told us their real names that gentlemen of learning and character may not suffer thereby there being several physicians of reputation in this city the initial letters of whose names are the same he has thought fit to set down  upon my saying that the improvements these great men have made in this art have effectually wiped away the load of slander and ignominy with which this profession was formerly branded he has the assurance to ask for i can call it nothing else if ninety nine in a hundred a pretty large proportion truly of these great men i talk of have not kept their improvements to themselves with this insinuating doubt if ever they made any  now if this be not scurrilous treatment i know not what can possibly be so but this is not all he proceeds farther and asks if most of them now as well as myself dont pretend to have secrets and if they dont endeavor to puzzle at the same time they make a show of instructing others dont they says he likewise very seldom if ever consult together as they always ought to do in difficult or dangerous cases and then asks what can hinder them except the fear of discovering the insignificancy of their pretended secret or their real ignorance what intolerable usage is here what opinion must bystanders have of the profession when one who would impose himself upon the town as a judge represents the professors of it as a set of crafty puzzling ignorant people how far his fellow citizens are to thank him for deterring by false and malicious hints those who are already from a mistaken and blameable modesty too averse to the assistance of menmidwives in cases of extremity where a faithful wife or hopeful heir may perhaps be lost is what i think every reasonable man may determine but i shall leave him to the resentment of those worthy gentlemen he has so much insulted and only observe farther on this head that i well hoped and still with reason do that the late and present practitioners had wiped off the load of scandal that was used to blacken this profession and designed a just compliment to them but nothing can stand good where envy and ill nature meet and indeed if they have not done it i can only be accused of being too complaisant which is a fault i must do mr douglass the justice to own he has no where in his book been guilty of unless once to his friend and countryman dr mitchell as will presently be made appear  upon my saying in the second edition of my book that i did not send my papers to the press till i had got a friend to revise and correct the diction which i believe is not an usual thing he desires to he informed if i can be a tolerable judge of diction myself who have suffered my friend to write womanmidwife womenmidwives etc and then blames me or my corrector for calling dr maubray an ingenious and laborious author endeavoring at the same time to set the doctor in a very ridiculous light now allowing dr maubray to be as silly a writer as mr douglass would have him he must own at least that i have some goodnature in me to which mr douglass seems to be a stranger to allow him a character he did not well deserve i shall always endeavor to speak with modesty and respect of my superiors not following mr douglasss example in recommending and puffing myself to the town as the only dictator left in my profession  after mr douglass has vented his spleen upon the doctor he triumphs in the following manner pray does such a writer as this deserve the epithets of ingenious and laborious wherein does his ingenuity appear wherein is his labor of any use pray can any thing expose a mans judgment more than laughing or hissing praising or finding fault in the wrong place page     without doubt mr douglass has penetration enough to avoid those sands in which he sees others sink and so great a reformer as himself can never be suspected of being guilty of those faults he so vehemently reproves in others but to judge him now by his own words he reprimands me for calling dr maubray an ingenious and laborious author and at the same time gives the late dr mitchell the epithets of a just tart reverend and learned writer after what i have advanced above in relation to mr douglasss very ill usage of the gentlemen of the faculty it may seem odd perhaps that i should here question the reputation of any gentleman myself nor should any thing have induced me to it had i not here a very fair opportunity to display mr douglasss great partiality in order to which i appeal to all the physicians in this town to whom the learned dr mitchell as he calls him was but too well known whether he was not the great physicalfool of the age the standing jest of all his acquaintance though some men of sense thought him too low even for that and as for his sooterkin dissected wherein mr douglass says he has so justly and tartly reprimanded dr maubray who certainly deserved it for such a false and credulous surmise as the existence of the suyger or sucher had dr mitchell been able to have done it it is too well known for its execrable stupidity to need any examination in this place for the truth of which i will stand by the determination of the most partial reader that ever perused this extraordinary performance excepting only mr douglass who if he went through it with a grave and composed countenance is i believe the only one that ever did mr douglass too assures us that he was utriusque medicinae doctor p    greatly to the honor of both the professions no doubt pray was not desiring him to show his diploma which some gentlemen of top reputation thought to be a sham one a standing jest at childs was it not always produced with the utmost shame and reluctance  now to retort mr douglasss words upon himself which may be done with the utmost justice pray does such a writer as this deserve the epithets of just tart reverend or learned risum teneatis wherein does his tartness or learning appear pray can any thing expose a mans judgment more than laughing or hissing praising or finding fault in the wrong place and pray who would think mr douglass a judge of learning himself who calls such a writer as this a learned one  but to return what had i to do with dr maubrays treatise beyond what belonged to my subject he might be very learned and laborious yet erroneous too as i prove he was in relation to the forceps in which being obliged to be close upon him i thought i could do no less than do him justice where i found him right i had no business rudely to rake into his ashes neither was i answering or writing against his book besides i showed him the more respect from hearing him well spoken of by better judges than mr john douglass or myself nor could i imagine a piece of just civility would ever have been made so illnaturd an use of by any much less by the doctors own countryman had i treated dr maubray with the ungentlemanlike freedom mr douglass has dr chamherlen he might then and i doubt not would have fallen upon me for that too so that civil or uncivil guilty or not guilty i must be hauld in as he says the midwomen are by the head and shoulders page    he hopes i will explain the doctors account of men being changed into women in my next edition for he owns as it stands in the doctors book it is far beyond his comprehension and that the account he gives of it is so sublime that it rather puzzles than instructs him but in the name of wonder what is all this to me what have i to do to explain in any author that which is foreign to my subject if i am to answer for all the silly or wrong things that are advanced in authors i shall have enough to do with a witness  he says i make a great splutter elegant indeed about breaking the membranes of the second child in order to bring it away by the feet as if i had discovered something new but however to make me some amends he immediately pays me a great compliment by observing that dr maubrays words on this occasion which he says are perfect nonsense are very different from mine which as it is the only place in his whole book wherein he seems to have any tolerable opinion of me i would not be thought so ungrateful as not to take some notice of it i never imagined that in this case i had discovered any thing new and what i there said was for the information of women who most of them if not all leave the birth of the second child to nature so that i think his own very genteel splutter might have been as well omitted  in the same page he asks who ever called the flowing of the waters a flooding but myself and observes that every body else means a dangerous flux of blood by a flooding i never did call the flowing of the waters a flooding it is a base and false charge pray have not i taken notice that the flowing of the waters was wrongfully called a flooding what mr douglass then has here said might have been let alone i could as easily have called it nonsense as himself  again because i honestly and earnestly recommend the careful extraction of the placenta which can never be left behind without the greatest danger he observes page    after his laconick manner that i make a great rout about it for three pages together as if no body had known any thing of the matter before and upon my saying that i am glad to find dr maubray recommending so safe a practice he asks if i can find any body who does not recommend it as well as dr maubray and myself let who will recommend or disrecommend it i am sure i have found several that dont practice it to the endangering of their patients lives and to prevent such ill consequences for the future was the reason of my making such a rout about it or rather so faithfully and earnestly recommending it  i still assert that the placenta is often left by midwives and for their instruction alone it was i spoke so much about it howthen can what i have said be called a rout but mr douglass must necessarily be elegant if he writes at all  he affirms in the same page    that i have censured dionis which i think i have done with a deal of justice for saying that the placenta in an abortion of two or three months may be left to come away of itself and then replies that undoubtedly this may very often be done without any danger though he adds that it is certainly saper to bring it away at first if sent for in time etc which seems to me to be nonsense for if it he safer to bring it away at first how can it be left without any danger does not the word safer naturally imply a  danger in its being left behind if not how can one practice be safer than the other if the child has been come away some time he says he should give himself no trouble about it till a flooding appeared and affirms that he knew it once left whole by the obstinacy of the mother who could by no means be persuaded to have it taken away between the fourth and fifth month and yet she did very well whether the words i knew it once were here meant to signify his own practicing of this art i cannot determine but he himself seems to think this practice wrong by blaming the woman with obstinacy for not consenting to have it taken away indeed as he says she might notwithstanding this have done well but then it was certainly great odds she might not and her recovery was doubtless more owing to good luck than any thing else  he says the experienced mr giffard is also of the same opinion when he observes that of two evils the greater ought to be shunned there being less danger in leaving part of the afterbirth which will very often without doing any great harm come away with the lochia than in using any force in extracting it by which we very often hurt the womb without doubt of two evils the lesser ought always to be chosen but i think mr giffards words are here to be taken with great restriction for his saying that the remaining part of the placenta will often come away with the lochia implies that it will not always do so and that it will do no great harm plainly intimates that it may do some the womb to be sure is never to be hurt in extracting the placenta and when it cannot be got away without doing more harm than the retention of it may occasion which i believe but seldom happens it must doubtless be left behind but then this is nothing to the necessity of its being always taken away which is what i have so earnestly recommended will mr douglass affirm that it is ever safer to have it retained than extracted i hope he will not pretend to give this advice in his lectures lest mankind should be but little indebted to him and the state of midwifery after his mighty endeavors to reform it be left in a much worse condition than he found it this ought to be looked upon as one of the most certain maxims in practice that where it can possibly be done the womb ought to be cleared and nothing suffered to be included in it lest a fever or flooding should ensue which are but too commonly the consequences of such a neglect  a little after he says i give one instance of a child i delivered with the buttocks foremost and then asks how does this quadrate with what i say page    of the same book if the child offers any other part than the head the hand is to be passed into the womb the feet searched for and the child to be turned and brought forth by them here he wilfully omits an exception i make in the very next line thus but there is one case to be excepted viz when the child presents the buttocks and is far advanced in that posture even beyond the labia it is then to be extracted as it lies which i should choose to perform by passing a finger or two of one hand or if possible of both hands to the groin and thus bring the child away rather than attempt the feet this however can be done only when the child is small or the woman large otherwise the woman is to be laid on her back with her hips raised and her shoulders low and then the child to be returned so as the feet may be commanded  in the same page after having repeated what i said in case of a child that was extracted with its face lying toward the os pubis page     of my second edit that i was unwilling to have recourse to art he proceeds is it not the art of midwifery which the midwomen have been taught the only thing which distinguishes them from other women are not they obliged to make use of their art at every labor they are called to why then does he so often make use of the words art and artists and only apply them to himself and some other men will not any one who reads madam du tertres little book be convinced that she has shown more art and better diction than either dr maubray or  does her being a woman make it improper to say she had recourse to art or that she was an artist  i shall only observe here that all the common assistance was before given and as all artists well know the expulsion now lay wholly upon nature except the taking hold of the head which i was unwilling to come to if nature would have finished her work herself but what harm there is in making use of the terms art and artists i profess myself utterly incapable to comprehend as to his query why i keep the fillet a secret after i have owned it to be neither so speedy nor so secure a method as the forceps page    i shall only answer that i was fairly and honestly resolved to own as much and that i had already done it in the body of my treatise so how insignificant this remark is will appear to every reader  but in relation to his charging me with the cut of the forceps being but an indifferent one page  0 i think i am not to answer for the fault of the engraver since the form and dimensions the use and advantage are the same whether well represented or not  again as to his asserting that i endeavor to fob him off with saying that all other peoples fillets are for the foot and mine only for the head i heartily disown it i never yet said that all other peoples were for the foot etc but only that i did not believe the manner of passing it over the head to he so universally known and practiced which i still have as much reason to believe as ever and if so why must not i have the liberty to mention it  page    after repeating two instances wherein mr giffard and myself have complained of malpractice he subjoins could a turk believe there were any wholesome laws in a country where such barbarities were not severely punished to which i shall only reply as i have once before observed how can the guilty be punished for them or how can their faults ever come to the cognizance of the public if those who are witnesses of them and heartily relate them must have a noise and clamor raised against them for so doing and be represented as a set of partial designing men hauling in the women by the head and shoulders and accusing them whether guilty or not  in the instance of malpractice there mentioned i have observed that a physician was sent for who had lately taken upon him to practice midwifery but was so little acquainted with the art that he neglected the only thing necessary in that case viz a speedy delivery by turning the child which words marked here in italick he reprints in capital letters as pointing out i presume my indecent usage of a gentleman or the faculty but if such a representation of bad practice as this deserves to be distinguish in capitals where shall we find letters or paper large enough to display his own gross usage of dr chamberlen and other physicians  page    mr douglass makes a very ungentleman like reflection on many great and worthy gentlemen of the faculty of physic and asks where these doctors could be admitted to their degrees must it not says he have been in some popish country where orthodoxy is reckoned a better recommendation than the knowledge of diseases where visiting chapels three or four times a day is thought more conducive to the making a good physician than frequenting the hospitals as often among the rest he here ungenerously reflects on one who when he wrote this had the honor to be related to i mean his own brother lately dead at st christophers who i have been told took his degree in france but what has the religion of a country to do with art and science have not several extraordinary men in the profession nay some of the greatest ornaments of it taken their degrees in popish countries to mention no more than his favorite baglivi whom he justly styles incomparable  i shall dwell no longer on this ungenerous subject than whilst i put the following queries to him    whether his witty reflections on degrees taken in a popish country are not a monstrous mixture of impertinence illmanners and falsehood   whether a man is better qualified for practice in england who has been complimented with a degree from leyden a scots university or by the princes nomination when at cambridge or oxford than some gentlemen i could mention who studied in foreign countries were regularly graduated and are even licensed by the college at london   whether visiting churches is incompatible with visiting hospitals are well timed acts of devotion lawful objections against the qualifications of a physician   where did he know degrees conferred on the account of orthodoxy preferable to other qualifications page    he asks if we dont want a proper school for midmen as well as for midwomen by which at least he intimates that midwomen do and now the plot begins to open but if men want a proper school as well as women how comes it that mr douglass will not condescend to instruct them too why does he publish proposals for midwomen only page    thereby excluding the poor unhappy men from the benefit of his assistance surely the reader will not be so unmannerly as to suppose what he does in relation to the physicianmidwives not consulting together page    and think that it is the fear of his discovering the insignificancy of his pretended lectures or his own real ignorance utrum horum  upon my relating that a woman had been twice or thrice delivered by a man of children that always presented with the head which the operator took a fatal freedom with viz using the hook he asks how i could tell who was not present but that all these children were dead so that in one place he blames me for not finding fault with people where they deserve it page    and now he condemns me because i do and endeavors to excuse the person in a fault though he was not present himself and consequently can know nothing of the matter is this being consistent with himself as he asks me page   so that to use his own words does he expect to fob the reader off so page  0 and must not he think him very weak and illiterate if he believed him a little farther he asks if a man ought not to be very sure before he accuses another after this manner to apply which to himself ought not he to have been sure of the truth of what dr chamberlen mr giffard and myself had asserted before he had accused us of condemning the women guilty or not who does he expect should inform him will the women be ingenuous and honest enough to confess their own malpractice and how can he tell who was not present whether we have accused them unjustly or not as for his thinking me to blame for not saying whether this fatal freedomtaker was a doctor or an ayothecary midman probably i may bethought much more culpable when i tell him that it was a surgeon midman but as to the truth of this relation i have all the reason in the world to believe the children were living if credit may be given to no less than three matrons who were present at the several labors and all asserted the fact this indeed was that persons constant practice to children in that case viz to fetch them with the hook whether living or dead  in the same page he excuses me in a great measure though perhaps not intentionally for having slipped the mention of a childs advancing with the buttocks in my first edition by observing that dr nicholls has omitted the it in the following remarkable passage in omni malo situ ut and in rebus desperatis pedibus extrahetur foetus compend anat now if dr nicholls whom he very justly styles excellent has forgot to animadvert upon this particular surely i who am so much his inferior may be excused the same  having thus as he thinks triumphed over dr chamberlen mr giffard and myself he proceeds to make what he calls deductions from the premises and after expatiating upon the havoc that is oftentimes made among his majestys subjects by the ignorance of midwomen he asks if calling of names such as rude rough negligent ignorant foolish obstinate etc which we have so liberally bestowed upon them will make them more prudent or judicious or enable them in any degree to give better assistance themselves and then replies in the negative where midwives are really rude rough negligent obstinate ignorant etc ought they not to be properly reproved and reprimanded for it how will they otherwise know their faults surely this open treatment of them is a very improper method of getting them all at our beck as he craftily insinuates and i heartily agree with him page    that nothing can better deserve the attention even of the legislature itself but how is the legislature to be informed of the true state of their practice if we are not to have the honest liberty of professing and asserting the truth will the midwomen as he styles them come and accuse themselves or is the legislature to provide a remedy for an evil of which they have no knowledge or information the verdict of the regularly instructed experienced and knowing professors of this art is likely to be much set by in the eye of the legislature if mr douglasss opinion of them is to be of any weight who has unjustly and maliciously represented them as a set of designing puzzling crafty covetous hardhearted insolent ignorant nostrummongers is this remedying die evil he so loudly complains of to deter our wives and daughters from regular assistance by his calumnious insinuations and make them fling themselves into the hands of women only the ignorance of whom he himself a little after confesses to be undoubtedly the principal if not the sole cause of these dire events  page    is it charity and humanity which he pretends so much to profess  page    that has induced him to this surely no  p     page    and    he confesses that our wives and children are cruelly massacred by ignorant hands and that numbers have been and daily are destroyed by the ignorance of midwives have writers in midwifery then accused them unjustly and hauld them in by the head and shoulders whether guilty or not  page    he desires to know if these gentlemen complainants have proposed any other method to prevent for the future this calamitous this dismal this inhuman practice except to send for one of them upon every little trifling difficulty then he proceeds is not this making mere nurses of the midwomen and   fools i suppose he means of their patients is it not telling them plainly that they neither do nor shall ever know any more of the matter by any information they will give them than what they knew before just to receive a child which drops into their hands  lastly he accuses us of making mere jackcalls of them to hunt about in search of our prey and then send for us to devour it p    now is not the very reverse of all this true have not these gentlemen complainants as he calls them proposed the best methods to prevent this inhuman practice do not they instruct them faithfully in their writings and endeavor to make midwives instead of nurses of them do they desire the midwives to send for them upon every little trifling difficulty and are they not cases of real difficulty and danger they desire to be called in upon does not he allow himself  page  0 that in many cases instruments are absolutely necessary that they ought to send directly for a surgeon instead of fatiguing the mother and endangering both her and her child by needless delays and fruitless attempts are we to be blamed then for informing them in what circumstances to send for us is it not rather our duty to do it would he have women midwives only concerned in cases of extremity is instructing them in the most approved methods of practice and the manner of turning children with the greatest safety the same thing as telling them that they shall never know any more of the matter than they did before and is honestly exhorting them to send for superior assistance in order to save a fellow creature from an untimely death making them like jackcalls to hunt about for our prey and then send for us to devour it or rather must not he be besides himself or at least think his readers so to be gulled by such notorious falsehoods  but page  0 surgeons are directly to be sent for why not such physicians as practice this art have not they as much knowledge experience charity and integrity as the surgeons are they not as capable of attaining to perfection in manual operations and of using proper instruments with as much judgment and dexterity as the surgeons why then must not they be concerned too but as dr baynard says upon another occasion oh self self what a selfish thing art thou hist of cold bathing ed   p       page    he says that the unskilfulness of midwives is owing to their want of a proper education and not to their want of capacity and asserts that it is more their misfortune than their fault i think in many respects the contrary will hold good for can it possibly be more their misfortune than their fault that they have not got such instruction as is in their power from books that have been written for this purpose how many are there to be met with that never give themselves the trouble of perusing them for their information is not this manifestly more their fault than misfortune and owing rather to their indolence and good opinion of their own sufficiency than a want of means for their instruction  mr douglass thinks  page    this fatal distemper may be cured and all its bad consequences for the future avoided if it was put in the power of the midwomen to qualify themselves thoroughly and at a moderate expense in all the parts of their most necessary office before they are permitted to practice in order to attain this most desirable end mr douglass proposes first the erecting an hospital in london and westminster at the public expense by donation or subscriptions as several almshouses infirmaries hospitals etc of far less consequence to the commonweal have been and are daily carried on for the reception of about two or three hundred poor women who are big with child secondly that a proper number of midwomen be appointed to attend them thirdly that two surgeons midmen be appointed to assist these midwome in all extraordinary cases and to demonstrate the structure of the parts concerned explaining the art of touching etc in set lectures at least three times a week to all the midwomen and their apprentices who please to attend fourthly that every young woman who designs to practice midwifery be obliged to attend these courses during her apprenticeship then go and practice for a set time under those expert women in that hospital afterward let them be examined as to the skill and knowledge they have acquired in their profession by two surgeons and six or seven other persons appointed by his majesty because he does not think it reasonable that so many peoples bread should depend on the humor and caprice of any two men only and if approved to receive from them a certificate of their fitness to practice in london or any where else fifthly that until fit hospitals can be built and endowed a midman be appointed in every city or countrytown in england to read the foresaid lectures to all the midwomen in the county and demonstrate to them the truth of their doctrines on the poor of the neighborhood of which there are plenty every where  i shall forbear making any remarks upon this scheme lest mr douglass should put a bad construction on it and shall only observe that i shall be as glad to see a proper hospital erected or any other measures concerted for the improvement of midwifery as himself and shall be as ready to contribute any thing in my power toward the instruction of midwives twas this reason alone that induced me to write my essay on the improvement of midwifery wherein i have heartily informed them according to the best of my power and can mr douglass be thought to have the real interest of this profession at his heart when he fells foul upon dr chamberlen mr giffard and myself for endeavoring to improve it and because we reprimand the guilty and ignorant and desire them to send for superior advice in cases of extremity and not sacrifice the life of the mother or child and oftentimes both to their own sufficiency does not he allow the midwives himself to be oftentimes very ignorant  page    and would not he have them instructed as before observed  page  0 in the knowledge of those cases where instruments are absolutely necessary that they may send directly for a surgeon etc now if there is many times a necessity for calling in better assistance of which no man in his senses can doubt why must we be so much blamed for honestly enforcing the same advice are we for this to be stigmatized as people who will not instruct them and represented as a set of crafty designing men who had rather puzzle and confound than illustrate and improve the art we profess is it not a little surprising that mr douglass should expect the town to have any opinion of his probity or take any notice of his scheme or himself who can be guilty of using others in such an unjust and scurrilous manner though as i observed before i should be glad to see any scheme put in execution for the real good and improvement of midwifery yet i cannot be so sanguine in relation to mr douglasss proposal as he himself seems to be viz that in very few years there would hardly be an ignorant midwoman in england page     the profession might certainly receive great advantage but to extirpate ignorance to that degree is a very hard task indeed when mr douglass has performed this wonderful feat i would have him undertake to find out the longitude and square the circle  but mr douglass having some reason to doubt whether the public would take any notice of this scheme or not has proposed another expedient in the interim and that is to give a course of midwifery to midwomen only for the men it seems are to be deprived of this vast advantage wherein he promises that the principal operations of that art shall be briefly explained page ult and for their greater encouragement assures them that he is no less than the goddess of midwifery and the only one that is able to instruct them   dea sum auxiliaris opemque exoratafero here mr douglass has openly acknowledged himself to be but an oldwoman which is the first modest concession i have met with throughout his book how far that threatening parenthesis in page    viz that they who did not readily embrace the opportunity would not only be deservedly blamed but ought to be punished by the civil magistrate may influence women to come to those lectures i must leave  those who pretend to instruct others in any art ought to he well versed in it themselves and as midwifery is a manual operation so it cannot well be acquired but by a due course of practice whether mr douglass has been much conversant in this profession i will not take upon me to determine though i confess i never heard any pretensions he had to midwifery before he advertised the printing of his book indeed he tells us in page    that he knew the placenta once left behind which does not amount to any proof of his practicing himself for he might know that by relation without ever having really exercised this art but in page    he goes farther and informs us that he has found the scissura rimae ab vulva ad anum by repeated experience not to be at all dangerous etc which he might have experienced as a surgeon and not professedly as a manmidwife it being commonly a surgeons business and for which mr douglass might frequently have been consulted there is no other passage to be met with in his whole book wherein he gives us the least hint of his having practiced himself from whence i think we may fairly conclude that mr douglass has bat very lately taken up this profession otherwise surely he would not have omitted to have said something of his long practice and experience in order to bespeak the more favorable opinion of himself among the good women before mr douglass had made any proposals for lectures to the town he ought at least to have cleared up this doubt whether or no be ever delivered a woman in his life if not the reader may judge how fit he is to take upon him the instruction of others he doubts not p  0 but the midmen will object and say that the midwomen want both capacity and strength instruct them as you please to perform what he proposes to which he immediately replies that this is only an artful and groundless insinuation and affirms ore rotundo plenis buccis as he chooses to express himself that it is not want of capacity docility strength or activity but merely want of fit and full instructions in all the parts of their office which disables them to perform it in all cases excepting where instruments are necessary with as much ease safety and expedition as the most dextrous midman etc must not this gentleman be in great want of matter to show his abilities upon to haul in the midmen making an objection they probably never so much as thought of before he had proceeded to this he ought first to have told us ore rotundo plenis buccis as he affects to write who ever doubted of the womens want of docility strength etc nor do i see what this observation was brought in upon unless it was for the sake of this paultry scrap of latin that the women might take him for a great scholliard and admire his profound knowledge in that learned language like scrub in the play who affirms that though he does not understand latin yet he thinks there is something very pretty in the sound of it as to their want of fit instructions in their profession i have before observed that they have more opportunities of information from books that have from time to time been printed for the improvement of the art of midwifery than many of them through indolence and selfsufficiency ever made use of as is very plain from their running counter in practice to the rules there laid down and i am much deceived if they may not meet with as much or more information from books for the value of three or four shillings as they will from lectures of so many guineas besides the great probability of what they hear in lectures slipping out of their memory whilst a book is always at hand and ready to give them constant and repeated instruction if they will but be at the trouble of consulting it  page    he asks if all ages have not produced women who have made a figure in the most sublime parts of learning and in all manner of curious and useful arts but what necessity for this query who ever doubted it and then subjoins and also illiterate thickheaded priests lawyers and physicians but what have the lawyers and priests done to disoblige mr douglass that they must be hauld in too by the head and shoulders in a book of midwifery but all it seems must feel his critical lash  he hints page    that at the time of delivery it is least proper for men to come near the women forgetting that but a few pages before  page    he blames the women as obstinate and unseasonably modest for not being willing to admit a midman but great wits they say have short memories  but to draw toward a conclusion what is all that mr douglass has said in relation to myself what has he detected in me that is wrong or what has he advanced from the writings of his oldwoman which i have not  as to informing midwives and directing them when to call in superior assistance what have i left unsaid or what direction can be farther given them some of the chief of the profession of my own sex have told me i have been too open so that i am found fault with on both sides but this gives me no uneasiness i have a satisfaction in doing what i judged to be my duty and acting the part of an honest man which my enemies can never be able to rob me of my way is to walk in the path which providence has put me in as inoffensively as possibly i can ever to give the wall to my superiors and never to jostle my inferiors into the kennel or to affront any person but if a bully draws upon me i never fly but defend myself with proper force  i never said or did any thing to deserve this mighty mans displeasure and yet spurred on by an envious jealous fury he has attacked me but alas his arm is too weak and his thrusts are easily parried not to mention that by too much heat he has over lunged  having now laid the whole of mr douglasss objections before the reader i will not suppose that his main drift after all his fuss and splutter about the reformation of midwifery was purely to set himself up as the only dictator in this profession and to inform the good women that he was better able to give them lectures than any body else i shall pass over the artful methods he has made use of to insinuate himself into public favor by running down and discommending every body else it seems they are all a set of puzzling designing men rather confounding and darkening than illuminating their profession but mr douglass has no design his candor modesty and good usage of all he speaks of will not so much as admit of any such suspicion to be sure he had no view of throwing a cloud of infamy and ignorance over his neighbors character that his own might appear to the better advantage the tenderness he shows for other peoples reputation cannot fail of endearing him to the town and making every body as tender of his i will not so much as mention what perhaps some people may say that the motto in the front of his book ought to be inverted and read non aliis sed sibi but the justice and impartiality of this author are of all his good qualities the most extraordinary nor can the reader well pass over the following remarkable instances of them there is for example plain dr hody and the ingenious and experienced mr will giffard surgeon page    the disingenious page    stupid page    and absurd page    dr maubray and the just tart reverend and learned dr mitchell utriusque medicinae doctor page    the puzzling confounding artful insinuating darkening pag   perverting interested coaxing threatening page   cobwebspinning emusing page   magisterial dictatorial p    sulsom nauseous page    sneering insolent page    imperious page    nostrummonger page      and    dr chamberlen and that accurate anatomist and consummate accoucher his own brother dr james douglass  though to be serious on this head i cannot think his worthy brother has any reason to thank him for such a fulsom compliment the truly learned are always modest and a gentleman of dr james douglasss well known merit and abilities can never stand in need of a such a paultry puff as this  mr douglass has gone long with this wondrous birth the first account we had of this gentlemans pregnancy was several months before he was delivered which at length on the   th of april      we had notice of some think it a monstrous others an abortive birth all agree that it was not come to its full perfection but be that as it will the mountain was long in labor and at length like that in the fable brought forth a mouse  before i take my leave i cannot but observe that this book is printed for and sold only by the author in ladlane near guild hall at the price of two shillings though it contains but    pages and that in a loose print which is only double the usual price of pamphlets of that size indeed such a production as this dees not happen often and it is but fitting that an extraordinary performance should be bought at an extraordinary price which brings to my mind a remarkable observation i remember to have read in the grubstreet journal of may        in relation to mr douglass proposals for a new osteology tacked to his trifling remarks on a piece upon the same subject by an ingenious author to whom i am well informed mr douglass lay under the highest obligations viz that he was much displeased with him for making twenty per cent of his money because he had entered into the same design with a view of getting five and twenty himself baiting and worrying him with all the boisterousness of pedantry and rusticity at the same time that he exposes his own nakedness  thus far i have persuaded myself to proceed in my remarks on mr douglasss trifling and malicious cavils nor would i have him think because he came off unanswered in his paultry attempt to depreciate that valuable work the author not thinking it worth his while to give him an answer that therefore he is always to escape with impunity  mr douglass seems to be in haste to dispose of the present edition of his book probably because he has some fresh observations to oblige the town with in a future edition of that elaborate work  but lest he should imagine me ready to answer any farther such false and dirty aspersions as he may think fit to fling upon me i here assure him once for all that i have affairs of much more consequence to mind nor can i give him a better general answer than what i am told the aforesaid gentleman sent him when being asked by an acquaintance of mr douglass if he would not give a reply he cooly answered whenever i have as little business or as much malice as bimself i will set about it  finis advertisement whilst my papers were in the press i happened to meet with a small book entitled the midwife rightly instructed etc by j dawkes surgeon in which the author has treated me in so gentlemanlike a manner and wholly different from mr douglass quoted me so fairly and honestly in the main that i am sorry i am obliged in justice to myself to take notice of a great mistake he made in reading one part of my treatise and giving it in quite different words than i had made use of viz in page    he says let any one consider the difficulty that must attend the getting down the arms in doing which according to mr chapmans advice both the hands must be at the same time as well as the childs body in the vagina from which the woman must necessarily suffer an additional pain etc  my words are these page    of my first edition and page    of my second edition viz the child is to be drawn gently down till advanced to the armpits or thereabouts when the arms are to be fetched one at a time by the fingers of the hand on that side now this is to be performed in a very little time and with great ease that which he mentions is impossible
