not unacquainted that ever since this book was first promised by way of advertisement to the world it was greedily coveted by a great many persons of any tempers for the same reason that it has been condemned by those of a more formal class who thought it was calculated partly to introduce a great many new and diverting curiosities in the way of superstition and partly to divulge the secret intrigues and amors of one part of the sex to give the other part room to make favorite scandal the subject of their discourse and so to make one half of the fair species very merry over the blushes and the mortifications of the other half but when they come to read the following sheets they will find their expectations disappointed but i hope i may say too very agreeably disappointed they will find a much more elegant entertainment than they expected instead of making them a bill of fare out of patchwork romances of polluting scandal the good old gentleman who wrote the adventures of my life has made it his business to treat them with a great variety of entertaining passages which always terminate in morals that tend to the edification of all readers of whatsoever sex age or profession instead of seducing young innocent unwary minds into the vicious delight which is too often taken in reading the gay and bewitching chimeras of the caballists and in perusing the enticing fables of newinvented tricks of superstition my ancient friend the writer strikes at the very root of these superstitions and shows them how they may be satisfied in their several curiosities by having recourse to time who by the talent of the secondsight which he so beautifully represents how nature is so kind frequently to implant in the minds of men born in the same climate with myself can tell you those things naturally which when you try to learn your selves you either run the hazard of being imposed upon in your pockets by cheats gypsies and common fortunetellers or else of being imposed upon in a still worse way in your most lasting welfare by having recourse to conjurers or inchanters that deal in black arts and involve all their consulters in one general partnership of their execrable guilt or lastly of imposing worst of all on your own selves by getting into an itch of practicing and trying the little tricks of female superstition which are often more officiously handed down by the tradition of credulous nurses and old women from one generation to another than the first principles of christian doctrine which it is their duty to instill early into little children but i hope when this book comes to be pretty generally read among you ladies as by your generous and numerous subscriptions i have good reason to expect that it will afford a perfect remedy and a thorough cure to that distemper which first took its rise from too great a growth of curiosity and too large a stock of credulity nursed prejudicially up with you in your more tender and infant years  whatever young maid hereafter has an innocent but longing desire to know who shall be her husband and what time she shall be married will i hope when she has read in the following sheets of a man that can set her right in the knowledge of those points purely by possessing the gift of the secondsight sooner have recourse innocently to such a man than use unlawful means to acquire it such as running to conjurers to have his figure shown in their enchanted glasses or using any of those traditional superstitions by which they may dream of their husbands or cause visionary shapes of them to appear on such and such festival nights of the year all which practices are not ordinarily wicked and impious but downright diabolical i hope that the next twenty ninth of june which is st john baptists day i shall not see the several pasture fields adjacent to this metropolis especially that behind montague house thronged as they were the last year with well dressed young ladies crawling busily up and down upon their knees as if they were a parcel of weeders when all the business is to hunt superstitiously after a coal under the root of a plantain to put under their heads that night that they may dream who should be their husbands in order to shame them out of this silly but guilty practice i do intend to have some spies out on that day that shall discover who they are and what they have been about and i here give notice to the public that this illacted comedy if it be acted at all this year must begin according to the rule of their superstition on that day precisely at the hour of twelve and so much for the pretty weeders but as you ladies have had several magical traditions delivered to you which if you put in exercise and practice will be greatly prejudicial to your honor and your virtue let me interpose my counsels which will conduct you innocuously to the same end which some ladies have labored to arrive at by these impieties give me leave first to tell you that though what you aim at may be arrived to by these means yet these means make that a miserable fortune which would have been a good one because in order to know human things beforehand you use preternatural mediums which destroy the goodness of the courses which nature her self was taking for you and annexes to them diabolical influences which commonly carry along with them fatalities in this world as well as the next you will therefore give me your pardon likewise ladies if i relate some other of these practices which bare relation of it self after what i have said before seems to me sufficient to explode them  another of the nurses prescriptions is this upon a st agness night the   st day of january take a row of pins and pull out every one one after another saying a pater noster or our father sticking a pin in your sleeve and you will dream of her you shall marry ben johnson in one of his maskes makes some mention of this and on sweet st agnes night please you with the promised sight some of husbands some of lovers which an empty dream discovers now what can be more infinitely profane than to use the prayer of our lord instituted in such a way  there is another prescription which is as follows you must lie in another county and knit the left garter about the rightleggd stocking let the other garter and stocking alone and as you rehearse these following verses at every comma knit a knot this knot i knit to know the thing i know not yet that i may see the man that shall my husband be how he goes and what he wears and what he does all days and years accordingly in your dream you will see him if a musician with a lute or other instrument if a scholar with a book etc now i appeal to you ladies what a ridiculous prescription is this but yet as slight a thing as it is it may be of great importance if it be brought about because then it must be construed to be done by preternatural means and then those words are nothing less than an application to the devil  mr awbrey of the royal society says a gentlewoman that he knew confessed in his hearing that she used this method and dreamt of her husband whom she had never seen about two or three years after as she was one sunday at church up pops a young oxonian in the pulpit she cries out presently to her sister this is the very face of the man i saw in my dream sir william somess lady did the like  another way is to charm the moon thus as the old nurses give out at the first appearance of the moon after newyearsday some say any other new moon is as good go out in the evening and stand over the sparrs of a gate or style looking on the moon here remark that in yorkshire they kneel on a groundfast stone and say all hail to the moon all hail to thee i prithee good moon reveal to me this night who my husband shall be you must presently after go to bed the aforesaid mr awbrey knew two gentlewomen that did thus when they were young maids and they had dreams of those that married them  but a great many of the wittiest part of your sex laugh at these common superstitions but then they are apt to run into worse they give themselves up to the reading of the cabalistical systems of sylphs and gnomes and mandrakes which are very wicked and delusive imaginations  i would not have you imagine ladies that i impute these things as infirmities and frailties peculiar to your sex no men and great men too and scholars and even statesmen and princes themselves have been tainted with superstitions and where they infect the minds of such great personages they make the deeper impression according to the stronger and more manly ideas they have of them their greater degree of strength in the intellect only subjects them to greater weaknesses such was even the great paracelsus the wonder and miracle of learning in the age wherein he lived and such were all his followers scholars statesmen divines and princes that are talismanists  these talismans that paracelsus pretends to owe to the excogitation and invention of honest art seem to me to be of a very diabolical nature and to owe their rise to being dedicated by the author to the heathen gods thus the cabalists pretending to a vast penetration into arts and sciences though all their thoughts are chimeras and extravagancies unless they be helped by preternatural means say they have found out the several methods appropriated to the several planets they have appropriated gold to the sun on the sunday silver to the moon on the monday iron to mars on the tuesday quicksilver to mercury on the wednesday tin to jupiter on the thursday copper or brass to venus on the friday and lead to saturn on the saturday the methods they take in forming these talismans are too long to dwell upon here but the properties which they pretend belong to them are that the first talisman or seal of the sun will make a man beloved by all princes and potentates and cause him to abound with all the riches his heart can wish the second preserves travelers from danger and is favorable to merchants tradesmen and workmen the third carries destruction to any place where it is put and it is said that a certain great minister of state ordered one of these to be carried into england in the times of the revolution of government caused by oliver cromwell the fourth they pretend cures fevers and other diseases and if it be put under the bolster it makes the proprietor have true dreams in which he sees all he desires to know the fifth according to them renders a man lucky and fortunate in all his businesses and undertakings it dissipates melancholy drives away all importunate cares and banishes panick fears from the mind the sixth by being put into the liquor which any one drinks reconciles mortal enemies makes them intimate friends it gains the love of all women and renders the proprietor very dextrous in the art of music the seventh makes women be easily brought to bed without pain and if a horseman carries it in his left boot himself and his horse become invulnerable  this paracelsus and his learned followers say is owing to the insluence of the stars but i cannot help arguing these acts of diabolical impiety but as these arts are rarely known among the midling part of mankind i shall neither open their mysteries nor inveigh against them any farther  the persons who are most to be avoided are your ordinary fortunetelling women and men about this town whose houses ought to be avoided as a plague or a pestilence either because they are cheats and impostors or because they deal with black arts none of them that i know having any pretensions to the gift of a secondsight among many a few of the most notorious that i can call to mind now are as follow the first and chiefest of these mischievous fortune tellers is a woman that does not live far from the old bailey and truly the justice hall in that place is the properest place for her to appear at where if she was tried for pretending to give charms written upon paper with odd scrawls which she calls figures she would be probably convicted and very justly condemned and doomed to have her last journey from the old bailey to newgate and from newgate to tyburn the other is a fellow that lives in moorfields in which place those who go to consult him ought to live all their lifetimes at the famous palaces of the senseless men he is the successor of the famous dr trotter whose widow he married and from being a tailor and patching mens garments he now cuts fl with his sheers upon  considers the heavens as a garment and from the spangles thereupon he calculates nativities and sets up for a very profound astrologer the third is an ignorant fellow that kaws out strange predictions in crowalley of whose croaking noise i shall here take no notice he having been sufficiently mawld in the most ingenious spectators these and such counterfeits as these i would desire all gentlemen and ladies to avoid the only two really learned men that i ever knew in the art of astrology were my good friends dr williams and mr gadbury and i thought it necessary to pay this esteem to their manes let the world judge of them what it will i will here say no more nor hinder you any longer gentlemen and ladies from the diversion which my good old friend who is now departed this life has prepared for you in his book which a young gentleman of my acquaintance revised and only subscribe my self  yours etc duncan campbell  the contents chap i mr campbells descent family birth etc page   also an account of mr archibald campbells

relating to mr campbells private life p  0  the first objection against the existence of spirits and the refutations thereof p   0 the second objection against the existence of witches p   0 the appendix the history of the life and surprising adventures of mr duncan campbell the introduction of all the writings delivered in a historical manner to the world none certainly were ever held in greater esteem than those which give us the lives of distinguished private men at full length and as i may say to the life such curious fragments of biography are the rarities which great men seek after with eager industry and when found prize them as the chief jewels and ornaments that enrich their libraries and deservedly for they are the beauties of the greatest mens lives handed down by way of example or instruction to posterity and commonly handed down likewise by the greatest men since therefore persons distinguished for merit in one kind or other are the constant subjects of such discourses and the most elegant writers of each age have been usually the only authors who choose upon such subjects to employ their pens and since persons of the highest rank and dignity and genij of the most refined and delicate relish are frequently curious enough to be the readers of them and to esteem them the most valuable pieces in a whole collection of learned works it is a wonder to me that when any mans life has something in it peculiarly great and remarkable in its kind it should not move some more skilful writer than my self to give the public a taste of it because it must be at least vastly entertaining if it be not which is next to impossible immensly instructive and profitable withal  if ever the life of any man under the sun was remarkable this mr duncan campbells which i am going to treat upon is so to a very eminent degree  it affords such variety of incidents and is accompanied with such diversity of circumstances that it includes within it what must yield entire satisfaction to the most learned and admiration to persons of a moderate understanding the prince and the peasant will have their several ends of worthy delight in reading it and mr campbells life is of that extent that it concerns and collects as i may say within it self every station of life in the universe besides there is a demand in almost every page that relates any new act of his for the finest and closest disquisitions that learning can make upon human nature to account how those acts could be done by him for he daily practiced and still practices those things naturally which puts art to the rack to find out how nature can so operate in him and his fleshly body by these operations is a living practical system or body of new philosophy which exceeds even all those that have hitherto been compounded by the labor and art of many ages  if one that had speculated deep into abstruse matters and made it his study not only to know how to assign natural reasons for some strange new acts that looked like miracles by being peculiar to the individual genius of some particular admired man but carrying his enquiry to a much greater height had speculated likewise what might possibly be achieved by human genius in the full perfection of nature and had laid it down as a thesis by strong arguments that such things might be compassed by a human genius if in its true degree of perfection as are the hourly operations of the persons life i am writing he would have been counted a wild romantic enthusiast instead of a natural philosopher some of the wisest would be infidels to so new and so refined a scheme of thinking and demand experiment or cry it was all against reason and would not allow the least tittle to be true without it yet the man that had found out so great a mystery as to tell us what might be done by human genius as it is here actually done would have been a great man within himself but wanting farther experimental proof could lay no claim to the belief of others or consequently to their esteem but how great then is the man who makes it constantly his practice actually to do what would not otherwise have been thought to be of such a nature as might ever be acquired by mortal capacity though in its full complement of all possible perfection he is not only great within himself he is great to the world his experiments force our belief and the amazing singularity of those experiments provokes both our wonder and esteem  if any learned man should have advanced this proposition that mere human art could give to the deafman what should be equal to his hearing and to the dumbman an equivalent for his want of speech so that he should converse as freely almost as other hearing or talking persons that he might though born deaf be by art taught how to read write and understand any language as well as students that have their hearing would not the world and many even of the learned part of it say that nothing could be more extravagantly wild more mad and frantic the learned dr wallis geometry professor of oxford did first of all lay down this proposition and was counted by many to have overshot the point of learning and to have been the author of a whimsical thesis and i should not have wondered if after a mans having asserted this might be done before it was actually done some blind devout people in those days had accused him of heresy and of attributing to men a power of working miracles the notion of the antipodes was by the most learned men of the age in which st augustine lived and by the great st austin himself treated in no milder a manner yet if the ability of teaching the deaf and the dumb a language proved a truth in experience afterward ought not those to turn their contempt into admiration ought not those very people to vote him into the royal society for laying down this proposition who before it proved true in fact would have been very forward to have sent him to bedlam the first instance of this accomplishment in a dumb person was proved before king charles ii by this same dr wallis who was a fellow of the royal society and one of the most ingenious of that society  but notwithstanding this should i come afterward and say that there is now living a deaf and dumb man and born so who could by dint of his own genius teach all others deaf and dumb to read write and converse with the talking and hearing part of mankind some would i warrant very religiously conclude that i was about to introduce some strange new miraclemonger and impostor into the world with a design of setting up some new sect of antichristianism as formidable as that of the brachmans should i proceed still farther and say that this same person so deaf and dumb might be able also to show a presaging power or kind of prophetical genius if i may be allowed the expression by telling any strange persons he never saw before in his life their names at first sight in writing and by telling them the past actions of their lives and predicting to them determined truths of future contingencies notwithstanding what divines say that in futuris contingentibus non datur determinata veritas would not they conclude that i was going to usher in a new mahomet since therefore there does exist such a man in london who actually is deaf and dumb and was born so who does write and read and converse as well as any body who teaches others deaf and dumb to write and read and converse with any body who likewise can by a presaging gift set down in writing the name of any stranger at first sight tell him his past actions and predict his future occurrences in fortune and since he has practiced this talent as a profession with great success for a long series of years upon innumerable persons in every state and vocation of life from the peeress to the waiting woman and from the lady mayoress to the milliner and sempstress will it not be wonderfully entertaining to give the world a perfect history of this so singular a mans life and while we are relating the pleasant adventures with such prodigious variety can any thing be more agreeably instructive in a new way than to intersperse the reasons and account for the manner how nature having a mind to be remarkable performs by him acts so mysterious  i have premised this introduction compounded of the merry and the serious with the hopes of engaging many curious people of all sorts to be my readers even from the airy nice peruser of novels and romances neatly bound and finely gilt to the grave philosopher that is daily thumbing over the musty and tattered pieces of more solid antiquity i have all the wonders to tell that such a merry kind of a prophet has told to entertain the fancies of the first gay tribe by which means i may entice them into some solid knowledge and judgment of human nature and i have several solid disquisitions of learning to make accounting for the manner of these mysterious operations never touched upon before in due form and order by the hands of the ancient or modern sages that i may bribe the judgment of this last grave class so far as to endure the intermixing of entertainment with their severer studies  chap i mr campbells descent family birth etc of the goodness and antiquity of the name and family of this gentleman no body can ever make any question he is a campbell lineally descended from the house of argyll and bears a distant relation to the present duke of that name in scotland and who is now constituted a duke of england by the style and title of the duke of greenwich  it happens frequently that the birth of extraordinary persons is so long disputed by different people each claiming him for their own that the real p where he first took breath grows at last dubious and thus it fares with the person who is the subject of the following sheets as therefore it is my proposal to have a strict regard to historical faith so am i obliged to tell the reader that i can with no certainty give an account of him till after he was three years old from which age i knew him even to this day i will answer for the truths which i impart to the public during that time and as for his birth and the circumstances of it and how the first three years of his life passed i can only deliver them the same account i have received from others and leave them to their own judgments whether it ought to be deemed real or fabulous  the father of our mr duncan campbell as these relate the story was from his infancy of a very curious inquisitive nature and of an enterprizing genius and if he heard of any thing suprizing to be seen the difficulty in practice was enough to recommend to him the attempting to get a sight of it at any rate or any hazard it is certain that during some civil broils and troubles in scotland the grandfather of our mr campbell was driven with his wife and family by the fate of war into the isle of schetland where he lived many years and during his residence there mr archibald campbell the father of our duncan campbell was born  schetland lies northeast from orkney between  0 and    degrees of latitude the largest isle of schetland by the natives called the mainland is sixty miles in length from southwest to the northeast and from sixteen to one mile in breadth  the people who live in the smaller isles have abundance of eggs and fowl which contributes to maintain their families during the summer  the ordinary folks are mostly very nimble and active in climbing the rocks in quest of those eggs and fowl this exercise is far more diverting than hunting and hawking among us and would certainly for the pleasure of it be followed by people of greater distinction was it not attended with very great dangers sufficient to turn sport into sorrow and which have often proved fatal to those who too eagerly pursue their game mr archibald campbell however delighted extremely in this way of fowling and used to condescend to mix with the common people for company because none of the youths of his rank and condition were venturesome enough to go along with him  the most remarkable experiment of this sort is at the isle called the noss of brassah the noss standing at sixteen fathom distance from the side of the opposite main the higher and lower rocks have two stakes fastened in each of them and to these there are ropes tied upon the ropes there is an engine hung which they call a cradle and in this a man makes his way over from the greater to the smaller rocks where he makes a considerable purchase of eggs and fowl but his return being by an ascent makes it the more dangerous though those on the great rock have a rope tied to the cradle by which they draw it and the man safe over for the most part over this rock mr archibald campbell and five others were in that manner let down by cradles and ropes but before they could be all drawn back again it grew dark and their associates not daring to be benighted were forced to withdraw and mr campbell was the unfortunate person left behind having wandered too far and not minded how the day declined being intent on his game he passed that night you may easily guess without much sleep and with great anxiety of heart the night too as he lay in the open air was to add to his misfortune as boisterous and tempestuous as his own mind but in the end the tempest proved very happy for him the reader is to understand that the hamburghers bremeners and hollanders carry on a great fish trade there accordingly a holland vessel that was just coming in the sound of brassah was by this tempest driven into a creek of the rock which nature had made into a harbonr and they were providentially saved from the bottom of the sea by a rock from which humanly speaking they could expect nothing but destruction and being sent to the bottom of that sea as never could a man be taken hold of with so sudden and surprising a disaster so no body could meet with a more sudden and surprising relief than mr campbell found when he saw a ship so near he made to the vessel and begged the hollanders to take him in they asked him what he would give them or said the barbarous sailors we will even leave you where you are he told them his disaster but they asked money and nothing else would move them as he knew them a self interested people he bethought himself that if he should tell them of the plenty of fowls and eggs they would get there he might not only be taken in a passenger but made a partner in the money arising from the stock it succeeded accordingly when he proposed it the whole crew were all at work and in four hours pretty well stored the vessel and then returning on board set sail for holland they offered mr campbell to put him in at his own island but having a mind to see holland and being a partner to learn their way of merchandise which he thought he might turn to hi country mens advantage he told them he would go the voyage out with them and see the country of those who were his deliverers a necessary way of speech when one has a design to sooth barbarians who but for interest would have left him unredeemed and for ought they knew a perpetual sole inhabitant of a dreadful rock encompassed round with precipices some three hundred fathom high not so the islanders who are wrongly called a savage set of mortals no they came in quest of him after so bitter a night not doubting to find him but fearing to find him in a lamentable condition they hunted and ransacked every little hole and corner in the rock but all in vain in one place they saw a great slaughter of fowls enough to serve forty families for a week and then they guessed though they had not the ill fortune to meet the eagles frequently noted to hover about those isles that they might have devoured part of him on some precipice of the rock and dropped the remnant into the sea night came upon them and they were afraid of falling into the same disaster they went to relieve mr campbell from they returned each to their proper basket and were drawn up safe by their respective friends who were amazed that one basket was drawn up empty which was let down for mr campbell and that there was not the least intelligence to be had concerning him but the suppositious story of his having been devoured by eagles the story was told at home and with the lamentation of the whole family and all his friends he was looked upon to be murdered or dead  return we now to mr archibald campbell still alive and on board the holland vessel secure as he thought within himself that from the delivery he lately had by the gift of providence he was not intended to be liable to any more misfortunes and dangers of life in the compass of so small a voyage but his lot was placed otherwise in the book of fate than he too fondly imagined his time of happiness was dated some pages lower down and more rubs and difficulties were to be encountered with before his stars intended to lead him to the port of felicity just as he arrived within sight of amsterdam a terrible storm arose and in danger of their lives for many hours they weathered out the tempest and a calm promising fair afresh they made to the coast of zealand but a new hurricane prevented the ship from coming there also and after having lost their masts and rigging they were driven into lapland there they went a shore in order to carren and repair their ship and take in provisions while the ship was repairing by the dutch our islander made merry with the inhabitants being the most inclined to their superstitious customs he there became acquainted with a very beautiful woman who fell in love with him and after a very short space of time he married her about the time when the ship departed his wife who was very rich was big with child of a son namely mr duncan campbell he wrote a letter by the master of the vessel to his parents in schetland concerning the various adventures he had met with which was delivered the june following about the time of fishing to his parents and several persons had copies thereof and for ought i know some retain them to this very day sure i am that many remember the particulars of this surprising affair who are now living in that island  the letter being very remarkable and singular in all its circumstances i shall present it the reader word for word as it was given into my hands together with some others which he wrote afterward in all which i am assured by very credible persons and undoubted authorities there are not the least alterations but what the version of it from the then scotch manner of expression into a more modern english dress made absolutely necessary  my dearest father the same odd variety of accident which put it out of my power to be personally present with you for so long a time put it likewise out of my power to write to you at last fortune has so ordered it that i can send a letter to you before i can come my self and it is written expressly to tell you the adventures i have met with which haved etained me this tedious space of time from my dear father and because the same captain of a ship that brings you this might as easily have brought your son to speak for himself i shall in the next place lay before you the necessity there is for my stay a little longer among the strange natives of the country where i now inhabit and where i am in a manner become naturalized  you have no doubt of it been informed by my companions some of whom i hope got safe back again if not all that i was lost where many a brave man has perished before me by going over the high precipices of the mountain brassah in a basket sliding down by a rope i must suppose i have given you the anguish of a father for a son who you thought had lost his life by such a fool hardy attempt and i implore your pardon with all the power of filial contrition penitence and duty you have always showed me such singular marks of paternal affection that i know your receipt of this letter will fill your heart with joy and cause you to sign me an absolution and free pardon for all the errors i have committed and think the sufferings i have undergone for my rashness and indiscretion a sufficient atonement for my crime of making you by my undutifulness a partner of my sorrows to free you the more from this uneasiness i know i need only tell you that every grief of mine is gone excepting one which is that i must still lose the pleasure of seeing you a little longer there was never surely a more bitter night than that which must by me be for ever remembered when i was lost in the mountain of brassah where i must for aught i know have lived for ever a wild single inhabitant but that the storm which made the night so uneasy to me rendered the first approach of daylight beyond measure delightful the first providential glimpse of the morning gave me a view of a ship driven by the tempest into a creek of the rock that was by nature formed like a harbor a miraculous security of deliverance as i thought both for the ships crew and my self i made all the haste i could you may be sure to them and i found them to be dutchmen that were come for fish but in lieu of fish i instructed them to load it with eggs and fowl which we compassed very happily in a short space of time and i was to be a sharer with the captain in the lading and bargained to go for holland to see the sale and the nature of traffic but when we were at sea after much bad weather we made toward zealand but we were driven upon the coast of finland by a new storm and thence into lapland where i now am and from whence i send you this letter  i could not come into a place so properly named for my reception as i had been undutiful to you and fortune seemed to make me an exile or a banished man by way of punishment for the vices of my youth so lapland which is a word origiginally derived from the finland word lappi that is exiles and from the swedish word lap signifying banished from which two kingdoms most of our inhabitants were banished hither for not embracing the christian religion was certainly the properest country in the world to receive me  when first i entered this country i thought i was got into quite another world the men are all of them pigmies to our tall brawny highlanders they are generally speaking not above three cubits high insomuch that though the whole country of lapland is immensly large and i have heard it reckoned by the inhabitants to be above a hundted german leagues in length and fourscore and ten in breadth yet i was the tallest man there and looked upon as a giant the district in which i live now is called uma lapmark  you must understand sir that when i landed at north cape in kimilapmark another district of lapland there was at that time a most beautiful lady come to see a sick relation of her fathers who was prefect or governor of uma lapmark which is a post of great distinction  this lady by being frequently in the company of french merchants who traffic now and then in that province of uma lapmark understood french and having heard of a man six foot and a half high desired to see me and when i came she happened mightily to like my person and she talked french which when i answered she made great signs of joy that she could communicate her sentiments to me and she told me who she was how rich and that not one in the company besides could understand a syllable we said and so i might speak my mind freely to her she told me the customs of the country that it was divided into cantons like our shires and those cantons into rekars or certain grounds allotted to families that are just like our clans as she was beyond measure beautiful she was extremely good humoured a thing rarely to be met among lapland women of a better stature than her country women and very rich and of good birth i thought it would be a prodigious turn of fortune for a man in my circumstances if i could make any progress in her heart which she seemed a little to open to me in such a manner for the beginning as if such a successful event if managed with prudence might not be despaired off souls that are generous are apt to love and compassion is the best introducer of love into a generous bosom and that was the best stock i had to go upon in my courtship i told her of all my calamities my dangers and my escapes the goodness of my birth as being allied to one of the greatest nobles in our island and still she would ask me to tell it her over again though every time i told it just at such and such passages she was forced to drop the tears from her eyes in fine i grew more in love with her out of a sense of gratitude now than by the power of her charms before the matter in a few days went so far that she owned to me i had her heart as to marriage i did not then know the custom of the nation i thought that if it proved only dangerous to me i loved her so well that i intended to marry her though the law was to pronounce me dead for it but i did not know whether it might not be perilous for her too to engage in such a state with me and i resolved in that case rather to be singly unhappy than to involve her in distress and make her the fair companion of my woes i would not tell her so for fear she should out of love hide from me those dangers and therefore using a kind sort of dissimulation i conjured her to tell me the laws and customs of marriages in that country to a tittle and that nothing should hinder us from happiness she told me exactly as i find since our marriage said she will be very hard to compass provided we follow the strict rule of the country for our women here are bound not to see the man who makes their addresses to them in some time his way of courtship is to come to the parents and his nearest friends and relations must make her father presents and supplicate him like a king to grant him his daughter the courtship often lasts two or three years and sometimes has not its effect at last but if it has the woman is dragged by her father and brother to church as unwilling to go to be married which is looked upon as a greater part of modesty in her according to the greater disinclination she shows my father and brother said she will both be against it you have no relations in this country to move your suit i cannot be so hypocritical as to be dragged unwillingly to him i own i desire for my lawful husband and therefore as i have an inclination to you and i dare own i have i will not follow those methods which i disapprove i have talked with several swedes and several polite frenchmen about their manner of espousals and i am told that when souls are naturally united by affection the couple so mutually and reciprocally loving though they had rather have their parents leave if likely to be got yet unwilling to be disappointed only go to the next ministers and marry for better for worse this way i approve of for where two persons naturally love each other the rest is nothing but a modest restraint to their wishes and since it is only custom my own reason teaches me there is no error committed nor any harm done in breaking through it upon so commendable an occasion i have added she a thousand raindeer belonging to me beyond my fathers power of taking away and a third share in a rekar or clan that is ten leagues in compass in the byar or canton of uma lapmark this is at my own disposal and it is all your own if you please to accept of it with me our women are very coy when they are courted though they have never so much an inclination to their suitor but good reason and the commerce i have had with persons of politer nations than ours is teach me that this proceeds entirely from vanity and affectation and the greatest proof of a womens modesty chastity and sincerity certainly consists contrary to the general corrupted opinion in yielding up her self soon into the arms of the man she loves for she that can dally with a heart she prizes can give away her heart when she is once baulked to any man even though she dislikes him you must judge my dear father i must be touched with a woman that was exceeding beautiful beyond any of her nation and who had thoughts as beautiful as her person i therefore was all in rapture and longed for the matrimony but still loved her enough to propose the question i resolved to her viz if it would not be in her nation accounted a clandestine marriage and prove of great damage to her  to this she answered with all the wisdom which could be expected from a woman who had given such eminent tokens of her judgment on other points amidst a nation so barbarous in its manners and so corrupt in its principles as lapland is i am said she answerable to my father for nothing by our laws having no portion of him but only what was presented me by my relations at my birth according to custom in lands and raindeer my father is but deputy governor it is a swede who is the governor of uma and if i pay to him at every mart and fair the due tribute which must either consist of fifty raindeer or one hundred and fifty rixdollars he will have the priest that marrys us present at the court of justice according to our custom and keep us in possession of our rights that we may be enabled to pay tribute to the crown of sweden indeed before the abolition of the birkarti which were our native judges we could not have married thus without danger to us both but now there is none at all  my dear father you must easily imagine that i could not help embracing with all tenderness so dear and so lovely a woman in fine i am married to her i have lived very happily hitherto and am now grown more happy for she is big with child and like before my letter comes to your hands to make you a grandfather of a pretty boy you will perhaps wonder that i name the sex of the child before it comes into the world but we have a way in lapland of finding that out which though some judicious people call superstitious i am really persuaded of by experience and therefore i indulged my dear wifes curiosity when she signified to me she had a mind to make the usual trial whether the child she was going to be delivered of would be a boy or a girl  you must understand  my dear father the people here judge of the sex of the child by the moon unto which they compare a bigbellied woman if they see a star appear just above the moon it is a sign it will be a boy but if the star be just below the moon they conecture her to be big with a girl this observation and remark of laplanders has i know been accounted by some and those wise and judicious men too to be ridiculously superstitious but i have been led into an easy belief of this mystery by a mistress that is superior to wisdom it self constant and therefore probably infallible experience i therefore indulged my wife in this her request and went with her to the ceremony the star appeared above the moon which prognosticates a boy which i wish may and i scarce doubt will prove true and when she is brought to bed i will send you word of it it is remarkable likewise that a star was seen just before the moon which we also count a very good omen for it is a custom likewise here in lapland to consult the moon as an oracle about the health and vigor of the child if a star be seen just before the moon we count it a sign of a lusty and well grown child without blemish if a star comes just after we reckon it a token that the child will have some defect or deformity or die soon after it is born  having thus told you the manners of the country i live in at present as much at large as the space of a letter will permit and related to you my own happy circumstances and the kindly promises of the heavens that are ushering in the birth of my child i would not have you think that i addict my self to the superstitions of the country which are very many and groundless and arising partly from the remainder of pagan worship which is still cultivated among some of the more obstinate inhabitants i have on the contrary since i married her endeavored to repay my wifes temporal blessings to me with those that are endless instructed her in all the points of religion and made her perfectly a christian and she by her devotion and prayers for me makes me such amends for it that i hope in us two st pauls saying will be verified viz that the woman shall be sanctified in her husband and the husband shall be sanctified in his wife  however i must take notice in this place with all due deference to christianity that though i am obliged to applaud the prudence and piety of charles the ninth of sweden who constituting swedish governors over this country abrogated their practice of superstitions and art magic upon pain of death yet that king carried the point too far and intermingled with these arts the pretensions to the gift of a second sight which you know how frequent it is with us in scotland and which i assure you my wife though she durst not publicly own it for fear of incurring the penalty of those swedish laws does as it were inherit for all her ancestors before her have had it from time immemorial to a greater degree than ever i knew any of our country women or country men  one day this last week she distracted me between the extremes of joy and sorrow she told me i should see you shortly and that my coming son would grow to be one of the most remarkable men in england and scotland for his power of foresight but that i should speedily lose her and meet with difficulties in my own country in the same manner as my father meaning you sir had done before me and on the same account viz of civil broils and intestine wars in scotland  these unfortunate parts of her relation i would not conceal from you because the veracity of her notions should appear if they are true though you may be sure i much wish they all may prove false to the very last excepting that wherein she tells me my son will be greatly remarkable and that i shall shortly see my dear father which i daily long for and will endeavor to do as soon as possible pray remember me to all friends being  honored sir your most dutiful and loving son archibald campbell   the second letter i am now the happiest man alive the prosperous part of my wifes predictions which i mentioned to you in my last is come in some measure to pass the child she has brought me proves a boy and as fine a one as i ever beheld if fondness for my own makes me not blind and sure it cannot be fondness because other plain circumstances joined at his birth to prove it a more than ordinary remarkable one he was born with a cawl upon his head which we count one of the luckiest signs that can be in nature he had likewise three teeth ready cut through the gums and we reckon that an undeniable testimony and promise given to the world by nature that she intends such a person for her extraordinary favorite and that he is born for great things which i daily beg of heaven may come to pass  since i have known for some months what it is to be a father it adds a considerable weight to those affections which i had for my wife i thought that my tenderness for her was at the height of perfection before which shows how little we know of those parts of nature that we have yet never tried and of which we have not yet been allotted our share to act upon the stage of life i find that i did love her then as well as a husband could love a wife that is a wife without a child but the love to a wife that has a child is a feeling wonderful and inexpressibly different a child is the seal and the pledge of love meditating upon this has likewise doubled my affection to you i loved you before as a son and because as such i felt your tenderness but my love is much increased now because i know the tenderness which you felt for me as a father with these pleasing images of thought i often keep you nearer company at this vast distance than when i lived irregularly under your eye these reflections render a solitary life dear to me and though i have no manner of acquaintance with her relations who hate me as i am told nor indeed with almost any of the inhabitants but my own domestics and those i am forced to deal with yet i have as much methinks as i wish for unless i could come over to schetland and live with you which i the more ardently desire because i think i and my wife could be true comforts to you in your advanced years now i know what living truly is i am daily persuading my wife to go with me but she denies me with kind expressions and says she owes too much to the place however less pleasant in it self than other climates where she had the happiness of first joining hands with me in wedlock ever to part from it but i must explain how i ask and how she refuses i resolved never directly and downrightly to ask her because i know she can refuse me nothing and that would be bearing hard upon the goodness of her will but my way of persuading her consists in endeavoring to make her in love with the place by agreeable descriptions of it and likewise of the humane temper of the people so that i shortly shall induce her to signify to me that it is her own will to to come with me and then i shall seem rather to consent to her will than to have moved it over to my own these hopes i have of seeing my dear father very shortly and i know such news would make this letter which i therefore send more acceptable to him to whom i will be  a most dutiful and affectionate son till death archibald campbell p s if i cannot bring my wife to change this country for another i have brought her to that pitch of devotion that whenever providence which notwithstanding her predictions i hope will be long yet shall call her to change this world for another it will be happy with her there she joins with me in begging your blessing to me her self and our little duncan whom we christened so out of a respect to the name you bear     the third letter my dear father i am lost in grief  i had just brought my wife her that was my wife for i have none now i have lost all joy in the mind of coming over to be a comfort to you but now grief will let me say no more than that i am coming to beg comfort from you and by this i prepare you to receive when he comes a son in tears and mourning  archibald campbell p s i have a babe not much above two years old must bear the hardships of traveling over the ice and all through muscovy for no ships can stir here for many months and i cannot bear to live in this inhospitable place where she dyed that only could make it easy to me one moment beyond the first opportunity i have of leaving it she is in heaven that should make me easy but i cannot i am not so good a christian as she was i am lost and ruined     chap ii after the death of mr duncan campbells mother in lapland his father archibald returned with his son to scotland his second marriage and how his son was taught to write and read mr archibald campbell having buried his lapland lady returned to scotland and brought over with him his son mr duncan campbell by that time he had been a year in his own country he married a second wife a lady whom i had known very well for some years and then i first saw the boy but as they went into the western islands i saw them not again in three years she being quite contrary to the cruel way much in use among stepmothers very fond of the boy was accustomed to say she did and would always think him her own son the child came to be about four years of age as she has related to me the story since and not able to speak one word nor to hear any noise the father of him used to be mightily oppressed with grief and complain heavily to his new wife who was no less perplexed that a boy so pretty the son of so particular a woman which he had made his wife by strange accidents and adventures and a child coming into the world with so many amazing circumstances attending his birth should lose those precious senses by which alone the social commerce of mankind is upheld and maintained and that he should be deprived of all advantages of education which could raise him to the character of being the great man that so many concurring incidents at his nativity promised and betokened he would be  one day a learned divine who was of the university of glascow but had visited oxford and been acquainted with the chief men of science there happening to be in conversation with the mother in law of this child she related to him her sons misfortunes with so many marks of sorrow that she moved the good old gentlemans compassion and excited in him a desire to give her what relief and consolation he could in this unhappy case his particular inclination to do her good offices made him reccollect that at the time he was at oxford he had been in company with one doctor wallis a man famous for learning who had told him that he had taught a born deaf and dumb man to write and to read and even to utter some sounds articulately with his mouth and that he told him he was then going to commit to print the method he made use of in so instructing that person that others in the like unfortunate condition might receive the same benefits and advantages from other masters which his deaf and dumb pupil had received from him a dumb man recovering his speech or a blind man gaining his sight or a deaf one getting his hearing could not be more overjoyed than mrs campbell was at these unexpected tidings and she wept for gladness when he told it the good gentleman animated and encouraged her with the kindest promises and to keep alive her hopes assured her he would send to one of the chief booksellers in london to enquire after the book who would certainly procure it him if it was to be got and that afterward he would peruse it diligently make himself master of doctor wallis his method and though he had many great works upon his hands at that time he would steal from his other studies leisure enough to complete so charitable an office as teaching the dumb and deaf to read and to write and give her son who was by nature deprived of them the advantages of speech as far as art would permit that natural defect to be supplied by her powerful interposition  when the mother came home the child who could hear no knocking and therefore it must be by a strange and inexplicable instinct in nature was the first that ran to the door and falling in a great fit of laughter a thing it was not much used to before having on the contrary rather a melancholy cast of complexion it clung round its mothers knees incessantly embracing and kissing them as if just at that time it had an insight into what the mother had been doing for it and into its own approaching relief from its misery  when the mother came with the child in her hand to the father to tell him the welcome news the child burst afresh into a great fit of laughter which continued for an unusual space of time and the scene of such reciprocal affection and joy between a wife and her own husband on so signal an occasion is a thing easier to be felt by parents of a good disposition imagining themselves under the same circumstance with regard to a child they loved with fondness than to be expressed or described by the pen of any writer but it is certain whenever they spoke of this affair as any body who knows the impatience of parents for the welfare of an only child may guess they must be often discoursing it over and wishing the time was come the boy who used seldom so much as to smile at other times and who could never hear the greatest noise that could be made would constantly look wishfully in their faces and laugh immoderately which is a plain indication that there was then a wonderful instinct in nature as i said before which made him foretaste his good fortune and if i may be allowed the expression the dawnings as it were of the second sight were then pregnant within him  to confirm this the happy hour of his deliverance being come and the doctor having procured mr walliss book came with great joy and desired to see his pupil scarce were the words out of his mouth when the child happened to come into the room and running toward the doctor fell on his knees kissed his hand eagerly and laughed as before which to me is a demonstration that he had an insight into the good which the doctor intended him  it is certain that several learned men who have written concerning the second sight have demonstrated by uncontestable proofs and undeniable arguments that children nay even horses and cows see the second sight as well as men and women advanced in years but of this i shall discourse at large in its proper place having allotted a whole future chapter for that same subject of second sightedness  in about half a year the doctor taught his little dumb pupil first to know his letters then to name any thing whatsoever to leave off some savage motions which he had taken of his own accord before to signify his mind by and to impart his thoughts by his fingers and his pen in a manner as intelligible and almost as swift through the eyes as that is of conveying our ideas to one another by our voices through the condites and portholes of the ears but in little more than two years he could write and read as well as any body because a great many people cannot conceive this and others pretend it is not to be done in nature i will a little discourse upon doctor walliss foundation and show in a manner obvious to the most ignorant how this hitherto misterious help may be easily administered to the deaf and the dumb which shall be the subject of the ensuing chapter  but i cannot conclude this without telling the handsome saying with which this child when not quite six years old as soon as he thought he could express himself well paid his first acknowledgment to his master and which promised how great his future genius was to be when so witty a child ripened into man the words he wrote to him were these only altered into english from the scotch  sir it is no little work you have accomplished my thanks are too poor amends the world sir shall give you thanks for as i could not have expressed my self without your teaching me so those that can talk though they have eyes cannot see the things which i can see and shall tell them so that in doing me this you have done a general service to mankind  chap iii the method of teaching deaf and dumb persons to write read and understand a language it is i must consess in some measure amazing to me that men of any moderate share of learning should not naturally conceive of themselves a plain reason for this art and know how to account for the practicability of it the moment they hear the proposition advanced the reasons for it are so obvious to the very first consideration we can make about it it will be likewise as amazing to me that the most ignorant should not conceive it after so plain a reason is given them for it as i am now going to set down  to begin how are children at first taught a language that can hear are they not taught by sounds and what are those sounds but token and signs to the ear importing and signifying such and such a thing if then there can be signs made to the eye agreed by the party teaching the child that they signify such and such a thing will not the eye of the child convey them to the mind as well as the ear they are indeed different marks to different senses but both the one and the other do equally signify the same things or notions according to the will of the teacher and consequently must have an equal effect with the person who is to be instructed for though the manners signifying are different the things signified are the same  for example if after having invented an alphabet upon the fingers a master always keeps company with a deaf child and teaches it to call for whatsoever it wants by such motions of the fingers which if put down by letters according to each invented motion of each finger would form in writing a word of a thing which it wanted might not he by these regular motions teach it is eye the same notions of things as sounds do to the ears of children that hear the manner of teaching the alphabet by fingers is plainly set down in the following table  when the deaf child has learned by these motions a good stock of words as children that hear first learn by sounds we may methinks call not improperly the fingers of such a dumb infant its mouth and the eye of such a deaf child its ear when he has learnt thus far he must be taught to write the alphabet according as it was adapted to the motions of his fingers as for instance the five vowels a e i o u by pointing to the top of the five fingers and the other letters b c d etc by such other place or posture of a finger as in the abovementioned table is set forth or otherwise as shall be agreed upon when this is done the marks b r e a d and so of all other words corresponding with such fingers conveys through his eyes unto his head the same notion viz the thing signified as the sound we give to those same letters making the word bread do into our heads through the ears  this once done he may be easily taught to understand the parts of speech as the verb the noun pronoun etc and so by rules of grammar and syntax to compound ideas and connect his words into a language the method of which since it is plainly set forth in doctor walliss letter to mr beverly i shall set it down by way of extract that people in the same circumstances with the person we treat of and of the like genius may not have their talents lost for want of the like assistance  when once a deaf person has learned so far as to understand the common discourse of others and to express his mind tolerably well in writing i see no room to doubt but that provided nature has endowed him with a proper strength of genius as other men that hear he may become capable upon further improvement of such further knowledge as is attainable by reading for i must here join with the learned doctor wallis in asserting as to the present case before us that no reason can be assigned why such a deaf person may not attain the understanding of a language as perfectly as those that hear and with the same learned author i take upon me to lay down this proposition as certain that allowing the deaf person the like time and exercise as to other men is requisite in order to attain the perfection of a language and the elegance of it he may understand as well and write as good language as other men and abating only what does depend upon sound as tones cadencies and such punctilios no whit inferior to what he may attain to if he had his hearing as others have  an extract from dr wallis concerning the method of teaching the deaf and dumb to read it is most natural as children learn the names of things to furnish him by degrees with a nomenclator containing a competent number of names of things common and obvious to the eye that you may show the thing answering to such a name and these digested under convenient titles and placed under them in such convenient order in several columns or other orderly situation in the paper as by their position best to express to the eye their relation or respect to one another as contraries or correlatives one against the other subordinates or appurtenances under their principle which may serve as a kind of local memory  thus in one paper under the title mankind may be placed not confusedly but in decent order man woman child boy girl  in another paper under the title body may be written in like convenient order head hair skin ear face forehead eye eyelid eyebrow cheek nose nostril mouth lip chin neck throat back breasts side rightside leftside belly shoulders arm elbow wrist hand back palm finger thumb knuckle nail thigh knee leg shin calf ancle foot heel sole toe  and when he has learned the import of words in each paper let him write them in like manner in distinct leaves or pages of a book prepared for that purpose to confirm his memory and to have recourse to it upon occasion  in a third paper you may give him the inward parts as skull brain throat windpipe gullet stomach guts heart lungs liver spleen kidney bladder urine vein blood bone marrow flesh fat etc  in another paper under the title beast may be placed horse stonehorse gelding mare colt bull ox cow calf sheep ram wether ewe lamb hog boar sow pig dog mastiff hound greyhound spaniel bitch whelp puppy hare rabbet cat mouse rat etc  under the title bird or fowl put cock capon hen chick goose gander gosling duck drake swan crow kite lark etc  under the title fish put pike eel plaice salmon lobster crab oyster crawfish etc  you may then put plants or vegetables under several heads or subdivisions of the same head as tree root body bark bough leaf fruit oak ash apple tree peartree vine etc fruit apple pear plum cherry grape nut orange lemon flower rose tulip gilofer herb weed grass corn wheat barley rye pea bean  and the like of inanimates as heaven sun moon star element earth water air fire and under the title earth clay sand gravel stone metal gold silver brass copper iron steel lead tin pewter glass under the title water put sea pond river stream under that of air put light dark mist fog cloud wind rain hail snow thunder lightning rainbow under that of fire coal flame smoke soot ashes  under the title clothes put woollen cloth stuff linen holland lawn lockarum silk satin velvet hat cap band doublet breeches coat cloak stocking shoe boot shirt petticoat gown etc  under the title house put wall roof door window casement room  under room put shop hall parlour dining room chamber study closet kitchen cellar stable etc  and under each of these as distinct heads the furniture or mensils belonging thereunto with divisions and subdivisions as there is occasion which i forbear to mention that i be not too prolix  and in like manner from time to time may be added more collections or clauses of names or words conveniently digested under distinct heads and suitable distributions to be written in distinct leaves or pages of his book in such order as may seem convenient  when he is furnished with a competent number of names though not so many as i have mentioned it will be seasonable to teach him under the titles singular and plural the formation of plurals from singulars by adding s or es as hand hands face faces fish fishes etc with some few irregulars as man men woman women foot feet tooth teeth mouse mice lowse lice ox oxen etc  which except the irregulars will serve for possessives to be afrer taught him which are formed by their primitives by like addition of s or es except some few irregulars as my mine thy thine our ours your yours his her hers their theirs etc  and in all those and other like cases it will be proper first to show him the particulars and then the general title  then teach him in another page or paper the particulars a an the this that these those  and the pronouns i me my mine thou thee thy thine we us ourours ye you your yours he him his she her hers it it is they them their theirs who whom who is  then under the titles substantive adjective teach him to connect these as my hand your head his foot his feet her arm arms our hats their shoes johns coat williams band etc  and in order to furnish him with more adjectives under the title colors you may place black white gray green blue yellow red etc and having showed the particulars let him know that these are called colors the like for taste and smell as sweet bitter sour stink  and for hearing sound noise word  then for touch or feeling hot warm cold cool wet moist dry hard soft tough brittle heavy light etc  from whence you may furnish him with more examples of adjectives with substantives as white bread brown bread green grass soft cheese hard cheese black hat my black hat etc  and then inverting the order substantive adjective with the verb copulative between as silver is white gold is yellow lead is heavy wood is light snow is white ink is black flesh is soft bone is hard i am sick i am not well etc which will begin to give him some notion of syntax  in like manner when substantive and substantive are so connected as gold is a metal a rose is a flower they are men they are women horses are beasts geese are fowls larks are birds etc  then as those before relate to quality you may give him some other words relating to quantity as long short broad narrow thick thin high tall low deep shallow great big small little much little many few full empty whole part piece all some none strong weak quick slow equal nnequal bigger less  then words of figure as straight crooked plain bowed concave hollow unequal round square threesquare sphere globe bowl cube die upright sloping leaning forward leaning backward like unlike  of gesture as stand lie sit kneel sleep  of motion as move stir rest walk go come run leap ride fall rise swim sink drawn slide creep crawl fly pull draw thrust throw bring fetch carry  then words relating to time place number weight measure money etc are in convenient time to be showed him distinctly for which the teacher according to his discretion may take a convenient season  as likewise the time of the day the days of the week the days of the month the months of the year and other things relating to the almanac which he will quickly be capable to understand if once methodically shown him  as likewise the names and situation of places and countries which are convenient for him to know which may be orderly written in his book and showed him in the map of london england europe the world etc  but these may be done at leisure as likewise the practice of arithmetic and other like pieces of learning  in the mean time after the concord of substantive and adjective he is to be showed by convenient examples that of the nominative and verb as for instance i go you see he sits they stand the fire burns the sun shines the wind blows the rain falls the water runs and the like with the titles in the top nominative verb  after this under the titles nominative verb accusative give him examples of verbs transitive as i see you you see me the fire burns the wood the boy makes the fire the cook roasts the meat the butler lays the cloth we eat our dinner  or even with a double accusative as you teach me writing or to write john teaches me to dance thomas tells me a tale etc  after this you may teach him the flexion or comugation of the verb or what is equivalent thereunto for in our english tongue each verb has but two tenses the present and the preter two participles the active and the passive all the rest is performed by auxiliaries which auxiliaries have no more tenses than the other verbs  those auxiliaries are do did will would shall should may might can could must ought to have had am be was and if by examples you can insinuate the significatation of these few words you have taught him the whole flexion of the verb  and here it will be convenient once for all to write him out a full paradigm of some one verb suppose to see through all those auxiliaries  the verb itself has but these four words to be learned see saw seeing seen save that after thou in the second person singular in both tenses we add est and in the third person singular in the present tense eth or es or instead thereof st th s and so in all verbs  then to the auxiliaries do did will would shall should may might can could must ought to we join the indefinite see and after have had am be was the passive particle seen and so for all other verbs  but the auxiliary am or be is somewhat irregular in a double form  am art is plural are was wast was plural were  be be be plural be were were were plural were  be am was being been  which attended with the other auxiliaries make us the whole passive voice  all verbs without exceptions in the active participle are formed by adding ing as see seeing teach teaching etc  the preter tense and the participle are formed regularly by adding ed but are often subject to contractions and other irregularities sometime the same in both sometime different and therefore it is convenient here to give a table of verbs especially the most usual for those three cases which may at once teach their signification and formation as boil boiled roast roasted roasted bake baked baked etc teach taught taught bring brought brought buy bought bought etc see saw seen give gave given take took taken forsake forsook forsaken write wrote written etc with many more fit to be learned  the verbs being thus dispatched he is then to learn the prepositions wherein lies the whole regimen of the noun for diversity of cases we have none the force of which is to be insinuated by convenient examples suited to their different significations as for instance of a piece of bread a pint of wine the color of a pot the color of gold a ring of gold a cup of silver the mayor of london the longest of all etc  and in like manner for off on upon to unto till until from at in within out without into out of about over under above below between among before behind after for by with through against concerning and by this time he will be pretty well enabled to understand a single sentence  in the last place he is in like manner to be taught conjunctions which serve to connect not words only but sentences as and also likewise either or whether neither nor if then why wherefore because therefore but though yet etc and these illustrated by convenient examples in each case as because i am cold therefore i go to the fire that i may be warm for it is cold weather  if it were fair then it would be good walking but however though it rain yet i must go because i promised with other like instances  and by this time his book if well furnished with plenty of words and those well digested under several heads and in good order and well recruited from time to time as new words occur will serve him in the nature of a dictionary and grammar  and in case the deaf person be otherwise of a good natural capacity and the teacher of a good sagacity by this method proceeding gradually step by step you may with diligence and due application of teacher and learner in a years time or thereabouts perceive a greater progress than you would expect and a good foundation laid for further instruction in matters of religion and other knowledge which may be taught by books  it will be convenient all along to have pen ink and paper ready at hand to write down in a word what you signify to him by signs and cause him to write or show how to write what he signifies by signs which way of signifying their mind by signs deaf persons are often very good at and we must endeavor to learn their language if i may so call it in order to teach them ours by showing what words answer to their signs  twill be convenient also as you go along after some convenient progress made to express in as plain language as may be the import of some of the tables as for instance  the head is the highest part of the body the feet the lowest part the face is the forepart of the head the forehead is over the eyes the cheeks are under the eyes the nose is between the cheeks the mouth is under the nose and above the chin etc  and such plain discourse put into writing and particularly explained will teach him by degrees to understand plain sentences and like advantages a sagacious teacher may take as occasion offers itself from time to time  this extract is mostly taken out of the ingenious dr wallis and lying hid in that little book which is but rarely inquired after and too scarcely known dyed in a manner with that great man and as he designed it for the general use of mankind that labored under the misfortune of losing those two valuable talents of hearing and speaking i thought it might not be amiss in the life of so particular a dumb person as i am writing to give them this small but particular fragment of grammar and syntax  it is exactly adjusted to the english tongue because such are the persons with whom the dr had to deal and such the persons whose benefit alone i consult in this treatise  one of the chief persons who was taught by dr wallis was mr alexander popham brotherinlaw if i am not mistaken to the present earl of oxford and he was a very great proficient in this way and though he was born deaf and dumb understood the language so well as to give under his hand many rare indications of a masterly genius  the uncle of his present sardinian majesty as i have been credibly informed had the want of the same organs and yet was a perfect statesman and wrote in five or six different languages elegantly well  bishop burnet in his book of travels tells us a story almost incredible but tells it as a passage that deserves our belief it is concerning a young lady at genoa who was not only deaf and dumb but blind too it seems into the bargain and this lady he assures us as a truth could by putting her hand on her sisters mouth know every thing she said  but to return back to england we have many rare instances of our own countrymen the principal of whom i shall mention as their names occur to my memory sir john gaudy sir thomas knotcliff sir  gostwick sir henry lydall and mr richard lyns of oxford were all of this number and yet men eminent in their several capacities for understanding many authors and expressing themselves in writing with wonderful facility  in hattongarden there now lives a miracle of wit and good nature i mean the daughter of mr loggin who though born deaf and dumb and she has a brother who has the same impediments yet writes her mind down upon any subject with such acuteness as would amaze learned men themselves and put many students that have passed for wits to a blush to see themselves so far surpassed by a woman amidst that deficiency of the common organs if any body speaks a word distinctly this lady will by observing narrowly the motion of the speakers lips pronounce the word afterward very intelligibly  as there are a great many families in england and ireland that have several and some even have five or six dumb persons belonging to them and as a great many more believe it impossible for persons born deaf and dumb to write and read and have thence taken occasion to say and assert that mr campbell could certainly speak i could never think it a digression in the history of this mans life to set down the grammar by which he himself was taught and which he has taught others two of which scholars of his are boys in this town partly to confute the slander made against him and partly for the help of others dumb and deaf whose parents may by these examples be encouraged to get them taught  chap iv young duncan campbell returns with his mother to edinburg the earl of argyles overthrow the ruin of mr archibald campbell and his death young duncans practice in prediction at edinburg while yet a boy our young boy now between six and seven years of age half a highlander and half a laplander delighted in wearing a little bonnet and played thinking it looked very manly in his countrymen and his father as soon as he was out of his hanging sleeves and left off his boys vest indulged him with that kind of dress which is truly antique and heroic in this early part of his nonage he was brought to edinburgh by his mother in law where i my self grew afresh acquainted with her his father being then but lately dead just after the civil commotion and off and on have known him ever since and conversed with him very frequently during that space of time which now is about three or four and thirty years so that whatever i say concerning him in the future pages i shall relate to the reader from my own certain knowledge which as i resolve to continue anonymous may perhaps not have so much weight and authority as if i had prefixed my name to the account be that as it will there are hundreds of living witnesses that will justify each action i relate and his own future actions while he lives will procure belief and credit to the precedent ones which i am going to record so that if many do remain infidels to my relations and will not allow them exact the fate of many as credible and more important historians than my self i can however venture to flatter my self that greater will be the number of those who will have a faith in my writings than of those who will reject my accounts as incredible  having just spoke of the decease of mr archibald campbell the father of our young duncan campbell it will not be amiss here to observe how true the predictions of his lapland mother were which arose from second sight according to the notices given by the childs father to its grandfather in his letter from lapland even before it was born which snews that the infant held this second sighted power or occult faculty of divination even by inheritance  in the year      the duke of monmouth and the earl of argyle sailed out of the ports of holland without any obstruction the earl of argyle in may with three ships for scotland and monmouth in june with the same number for england  the earl setting out first was also the first at landing argyll having attempted to land in the north of scotland and being disappointed by the vigilance of the bishop of the orcades landed in the west and encamped at dunstafne castle in the province of lorn which had belonged to him he omitted nothing that might draw over to him all the malcontents in the kingdom whom he thought more numerous than they afterward appeared to be he dispersed about his declarations wherein after protesting that he had taken up arms only in defense of religion and the laws against an injust usurper so he styled king james the second he invited all good protestants and such scotch as would assert the liberty to join him against a prince he said was got into the throne to ruin the reformation and to bring in popery and arbitrary power next he sent letters to those he thought his friends among whom was mr archibald campbell who according to the vast deference paid by the scots to their chief joined him tho in his heart of a quite different principle to call them to his assistance he detached two of his sons to make inroades in the neighborhood and compel some by threats others by mighty promises to join him all his contrivances could not raise him above three thousand men with whom he encamped in the isle of boot where he was soon in a manner besieged by the earl of dunbarton with the kings forces and several other bodies commanded by the duke of gordon the marquess of athol the earl of arran and other great men who came from all parts to quench the fire before it grew to a head  the earl of argyle being obliged to quit a post he could not make good went over into a part of the country of his own name where having hastily fortified a castle called ellingrey he put into it the arms and ammunition taken out of his ships which lay at anchor under the cannon of a fort he erected near that place there his rout began for going out from the castle with his forces to make an incursion one of his parties was defeated by the marquess of athol who slew four hundred of his men and captain hamilton who attacked his ships with some of the kings and took them without any resistance  the earl of dunbarton advancing toward him at the same time by long marches while he endeavored to secure himself by rivers surprised him passing the clyde in the village of killern as he was marching toward lenox dunbarton coming upon them at night would have staid till the next day to attack the rebels but they gave him not so much time for they passed the river in the night in such confusion that being overcome with fear they dispersed as soon as over argyle could scarce rally so many as would make him a small guard which was soon scattered again dunbarton having passed the river and divided his forces to pursue those that fled argyle had taken guides to conduct him to galloway but they mistaking the way and leading him into a bog most of those that still followed him quitted their horses every man shifting for himself  argyle himself was making back alone toward the clyde when two resolute servants belonging to an officer in the kings army meeting him though they knew him not bid him surrender he fired at and missed them but they took better aim and wounded him with a pistol ball then the earl drawing his two pistols out of the holsters quitted his horse that was quite tired and took the river a country fellow who came with those two that had first assaulted him pursued him with a pistol in his hand the earl would have fired one of his but the flint failing he was dangerously wounded in the head by the peasant he discovered himself as he fell senseless crying out unfortunate argyle this nobleman how far soever he may be thought misled in principle was certainly in his person a very brave and a very gallant hero they made have to draw him out and bring him to himself after which being delivered up to the officers the erring unfortunate great man was conducted to edingburgh and there beheaded  many gentlemen that followed the fortunes of this great man though not in his death they shared in all the other calamities attending his overthrow they most of them fled into the remotest isles and the obscurest corners of all scotland contented with the saving of their lives they grew exiles and banished men of their own making and abdicated their estates before they were known to be forfeited because for fear of being informed against by the common fellows they commanded they durst not appear to lay their claims of this number was mr archibald campbell and this new disaster wounded him deep into the very heart after so many late misadventures and sent him untimely to the grave he perfectly pined away and wasted he was six months dying inch by inch and the difference between his least breath and his way of breathing during all that time was only that he expired with a greater sigh than he ordinarily fetched every time when he drew his breath  every thing the lapland lady had predicted so long before being thus come to pass we may the less admire at the wonders performed by her son when we consider this faculty of divination to be so derived to him from her and grown as it were hereditary  our young prophet who had taught most of his little companions to converse with him by finger was the head at every little pastime and game they played at marbles which he used to call childrens playing at bowls yielded him mighty diversion and he was so dexterous and artist at shooting that little alablaster globe from between the end of his forefinger and the knuckle of his thumb that he seldom missed hitting plum as the boys call it the marble he aimed at though at the distance of two or three yards the boys always when they played coveted to have him on their side and by hearing that he foretold other things used to consult him when they made their little matches which were things of great importance in their thoughts who should get the victory he used commonly to leave these trifles undecided but if ever he gave his opinion in these trivial affairs the persons fared well by their consultation for his judgment about them was like a petty oracle and the end always answered his prediction but i would have my reader imagine that though our duncan campbell was himself but a boy he was not consulted only by boys his penetration and insight into things of a high nature got air and being attested by credible witnesses won him the esteem of persons of mature years and discretion  if a beautiful young virgin languished for a husband or a widows mind was in labor to have a second venture of infants by another spouse if a housekeeper had lost any thing belonging to her master still little duncan campbell was at hand he was the oracle to be applied to and the little chalked circle where he was diverting himself with his playfellows near the cross at edinburgh was frequented with as much solicitation and as much credit as the tripos of apollo was at delphos in ancient times  it was highly entertaining to see a young blooming beauty come and slily pick up the boy from his company carry him home with as much eagerness as she would her gallant because she knew she should get the name of her gallant out of him before he went and bribe him with a sugar plumb to write down the name of a young scotch peer in a green ribbon that her mouth watered after  how often after he has been wallowing in the dust have i my self seen nice squeamish widows help him up in their gilded chariots and give him a pleasant ride with them that he might tell them they should not long lie a lone little duncan campbell had as much business upon his hands as the parsons of all the parishes in edinburgh he commonly was consulted and named the couples before the minister joined them thus he grew a rare customer to the toyshop from whence he most an end received fees and rewards for his advices if lady betty such a one was foretold that she should certainly have beau such a one in marriage then little duncan was sure to have a hobbyhorse from the toyshop as a reward for the promised fop if such a widow that was ugly but very rich was to be pushed hard for as she pretended though in reality easily won little duncan upon ensuring her such a captain or such a lieutenant colonel was sure to be presented from the same childs warehouse with a very handsome drum and a silvered trumpet  if a seampstress had an itching desire for a parson she would upon the first assurance of him give this little apollo a pastboard temple or church finely painted and a ring of bells into the bargain from the same toyoffice  if a housekeeper lost any plate the thief was certain to be catched provided she took little master into the storeroom and asked him the question after she had given him his belly full of sweetmeats  neither were the women only his consulters the grave merchants who were anxious for many ventures at sea applied to the boy for his opinion of their security and they looked upon his opinion to be as safe as the insurance office for ships if he but told them though the ship was just set sail and a tempest rose just after on the ocean that it would have a successful voyage gain the port designed and return home safe laden with the exchange of traffic and merchandise they dismissed all their fears banished all their cares set their hearts at ease and safe in his opinion enjoyed a calm of mind amidst a storm of weather  i my self knew one count cog an eminent gamester who was a person so far from being of a credulous disposition that he was an unbeliever in several points of religion and the next door to an infidel yet as much as he was a stranger to faith he was mastered and overpowered so far in his incredulity by the strange events which he had seen come frequently to pass from the predictions of this child that he had commonly daily access to this boy to learn his more adverse and more prosperous hours of gaming at first indeed he would try when the child foretold him his ill fortune whether it would prove true and relying upon the mere hazard and turn of the dye he had always as he observed a run of ill luck on those forbidden days as he never failed of good if he chose the fortunate hours directed by the boy one time above all the rest just before he was departing from edinburgh and when the season of gaming was almost over most persons of wealth and distinction withdrawing for pleasure to their seats in the country he came to young duncan campbell to consult and was extremely solicitous to know how happily or unluckily he should end that term as we may call it of the gamesters weighty business viz play there being a long vacation likely to ensue when the gaming table would be empty and the box and dice lie idle and cease to rattle the boy encouraged him so well with his predictions on this occasion that count cog went to the toyshop brought him from thence a very fine ivory t totum as children call  pretty set of painted and gilded little nine pins and a bowl and a large bag of marbles and alloys and what do you think the gamester got by this little present and the prediction of the boy why without telling the least title of falsehood within the space of the last weeks play the gains of count cog really amounted to no less than twenty thousand pounds sterling neat money  having mentioned these persons of so many different professions by borrowed names and perhaps in a manner seemingly ludicrous i would not have my reader from hence take occasion of looking upon my account as fabulous if i was not to make use of borrowed names but to tell the real characters and names of the persons i should do injury to these old friends of his who first gave credit to our young seer while i am endeavoring to gain him the credit and esteem of new ones in whose way it has not yet happened to consult him for many persons are very willing to ask such questions as the foregoing ones but few or none willing to have the public told they asked them though they succeeded in their wish and were amply satisfied in their curiosity i have represented them perhaps in a ludicrous manner because though they are misterious actions they are still the actions of a  and as the rewards he received for his advices did really and truly consist of such toys as i mentioned so could they not be treated or in a more serious manner without the authors incurring a magiserial air of pedantry and showing a mind as it were of being mighty grave and sententious about trifles there are however some thing of greater weight and importance  by him in a more advanced stage of life which will be delivered to the public with that exactitude and gravity which becomes them and in some of those relations the names of some persons that are concerned shall be printed because it will not at all be injurious to them or because i have their leave and they are still living to testify what i shall relate  in the mean time as the greatest part of his nonage was spent in predicting almost innumerable things which are all however reducible to the general heads abovementioned i will not tire the reader with any particulars but instead of doing that before i come to show his power of divination in the more active parts of his life and when after removing from edinburgh to london he at last made it his public profession i shall account how such divinations may be made and divert the reader with many rare examples taken from several faithful and undoubted historians of persons who have done the like before him some in one way and some in another though in this he seems to be peculiar and to be if i may be allowed the expression a species by himself alone in the talent of prediction that he has colleded within his own individual capacity all the methods which others severally used and with which they were differently and singly gifted in their several ways of foreseeing and foretelling  this art of prediction is not attainable any otherwise than by these three ways first it is done by the company of familiar spirits and genii which are of two sorts some good and some bad who tell the gifted person the things of which he informs other people   dly it is performed by the second sight which is very various and differs in most of the possessors it being but a very little in some very extensive and constant in others beginning with some in their infancy and leaving them before they come to years happening to others in a middle age to others again in an old age that never had it before and lasting only for a term of years and now and then for a very short period of time and in some intermitting like fits as it were of vision that leave them for a time and then return to be as strong in them as ever and it being in a manner hereditary to some families whose children have it from their infancy without intermission to a great old age and even to the time of their death which they often foretell before it comes to pass to a day nay even to an hour   dly it is attained by the diligent study of the lawful part of the art of magic  before i give the reader an account as i shall do in three distinct discourses   st concerning the intercourse which familiar spirits viz the good and bad genii have had and continue to have to a great degree with some select parts of mankind   dly concerning the wonderful and almost miraculous power of a second sight with which many beyond all controversy have been extraordinarily but visibly gifted and   dly concerning the pitch of perfection to which the magic science has been carried and promoted by some adepts in that misterious art i will premise a few particulars about the genii which attended our little duncan campbell and about the second sight which he had when yet a child and when we may much more easily believe that the wonders he performed and wrote of must have been rather brought about by the intervention of such genii and the mediation of such a sight than that he could have invented such fables concerning them and compassed such predictions as seemed to want their assistance by the mere dint of a childs capacity  one day i remember when he was about nine years of age going early to the house where he and his mother lived and it being before his mother was stirring i went into little duncan campbells room to divert myself with him i found him sitting up in his bed with his eyes broad open but as motionless as if he had been asleep or even if it had not been for a lively beautiful color which the little pretty fair silver haird boy always had in his cheeks as if he had been quite dead he did not seem so much as to breath the eylids of him were so fixed and immovable that the eylashes did not so much as once shake which the least motion imaginable must agitate not to say that he was like a person in an exstacy he was at least in what we commonly call a brown study to the highest degree and for the largest space of time i ever knew i who had been frequently informed by people who have been present at the operations of second sighted persons that at the sight of a vision the eylids of the person are erected and the eyes continue staring till the object vanishes i isay sat myself softly down on his bedside and with a quiet amazement observed him avoiding diligently any motion that might give him the least disturbance or cause in him any avocation or distraction of mind from the business he was so intent upon i remarked that he held his head sideways with his mouth wide open and in a listening posture and that after so lively a manner as at first general thought made me forget his deafness and plainly imagine he heard something till the second thought of reflection brought into my mind the misfortune that shut up all passage for any sound through his ears after a steadfast gaze which lasted about seven minutes he smiled and stretched his arms as one recovering from a fit of indolence and rubbed his eyes then turning toward me he made the sign of a salute and hinted to me upon his fingers his desire for pen ink and paper which i reached him from a little desk that stood at his bedsfeet  placing the paper upon his knees he wrote me the following lines which together with my answers i preserve by me for their rarity to this very day and which i have transcribed word for word as they form a little series of dialogue  duncan campbell i am sorry i cant stay with you but i shall see my pretty youth and my lamb by and by in the fields near a little coppice or grove where i go often to play with them and i would not lose their company for the whole world for they and i are mighty familiar together and the boy tells me every thing that gets me my reputation among the ladies and nobility and you must keep it secret  my question i will be sure to keep it secret but how do you know you are to meet them there to day did the little boy appoint you  duncan campbell yess he did and signified that he had several things to predict to me concerning people that he foreknew would come to me the week following to ask me questions  my question but what was you staring at when i came in  duncan campbell why at that little boy that goes along with the lamb i speak of and twas then he made me the appointment  my question how does he do it does he write  duncan campbell no he writes sometimes but oftener he speaks with his fingers and mighty swift no man can do it so quick or write half so soon he has a little bell in his hand like that which my mother makes me a sign to shake when she wants the servants with that he tickles my brain strangely and gives me an incredible delight of feeling in the inside of my head he usually wakes me with it in the morning when he comes to make me an appointment i fancy it is what you call hearing which makes me mighty desirous i could hear in your way it is sweeter to the feeling methinks than any thing is to the taste it is just as if my head was tickled to death as my nurse used to tickle my sides but it is a different feeling for it makes things like little strings tremble in my temples and behind my ears now i remember i will tell you what it is like that makes me believe it is like your hearing and that strange thing which you that can speak call sound or noise because when i was at church with my mother who told me the bells could be heard ringing a mile off as i was kneeling on the bench and leaning over the top of the pew and gnawing the board every time the man pulled the rope i thought all my head beat as if it would come to pieces but yet it pleased me methought rather than pained me and i would be always gnawing the board when the man pulled the rope and i told my mother the reason the feeling of that was something like the little bell but only that made my head throb as if it would break and this tickles me and makes as it were little strings on the back of my ears dance and tremble like any thing is not that like your way of hearing  if it be it is a sweet thing to hear  it is more pleasant than to see the finest colors in the world  it is something like being tickled in the nose with a feather till one sneezes or like the feeling after one strikes the leg when it has been numb or asleep only with this difference that those two ways give a pain and the other a pleasure i remember too when i had a great cold for about two months i had a feeling something like it but that was blunt dull confused and troublesome is not this like what you call hearing  my question it is the finest kind of hearing my dear it is what we call music but what sort of a boy is that that meets you and what sort of a lamb  duncan campbell oh though they are like other boys and other lambs which you see they are a thousand times prettier and finer you never saw such a boy nor such a lamb in your lifetime  my question how big is he as big as you are and what sort of a boy is he  duncan campbell he is a little little pretty boy about as tall as my knee his face is as white as snow and so are his little hands his cheeks are as red as a cherry and so are his lips and when he breaths it makes the air more perfumed than my mothers sweet baggs that she puts among the linen he has got a crown of roses cowslips and other flowers upon his head such as the maids gather in may his hair is like fine silver threads and shine like the beams of the sun he wears a loose veil down to his feet that is as blue as the sky in a clear day and embroidered with spangles that look like the brightest stars in the night he carries a silver bell in one hand and a book and pencil in the other and he and the little lamb will dance and leap about me in a ring as high as my head the lamb has got a little silver collar with nine little bells upon it and every little piece of wool upon its back that is as white milk is tied up all round it in puffs like a little misses hair with ribbons of all colors and round its head too are little roses and violets stuck very thick into the wool that grows upon its forehead and behind and between its ears in the shape of a diadem they first meet me dancing thus and after they have danced sometime the little boy writes down wonderful things in his book which i write down in mine then they dance again till he rings his bell and then they are gone all of a sudden i know not where but i feel the tickling in the inside of my head caused by the bell less and less til i dont feel it at all and then i go home read over my lesson in my book and when i have it by heart i burn the written leaves according as the little boy bids me or he would let me have no more but i hear the little bell again the little boy is angry with me he pulled me twice by the ear and i would not displease him for any thing so i must get up and go immediately to the joy and delight of my life  i told him he might if he would promise me to tell me further another time he said he would if i would keep it secret i told him i would and so we parted though just before he went he said he smelt some venison and he was sure they would shortly have some for dinner and nothing was so sure as that my man had my orders to bring a side of venison to me the next day to mrs campbells for i had been hunting and came thither from the death of a deer that morning and intended as usual to make a stay there for two or three days  there are i know many men of severe principles and who are more strict grave and formal in their manner of thinking than they are wise who will be apt to judge of these relations as things merely fabulous and chimerical and not contented with being disbelievers by themselves will labor to insinuate into others this pernicious notion that it is a sign of infirmity and weakness in the head to yield them credit but though i could easily argue these sir gravities down though a sentence or two would do their business put them beyond the power of replying and strike them dumb yet do i thing it not worth my while their greatest and most wonted objection against these eudemons and kakodemons being that it arises all from the work of fancy in persons of a melancholic blood if we consider the nature of this childs dialogue with me will it not be more whimsically strange and miraculous to say that a child of nine years old had only a fancy of such things as these of which it had never heard any body give an account and that it could by the mere strength of imagination predict such things as really after came to pass than it is when it does so strangely predict things to believe the child does it in the manner itself owns it does which is by the intervention of a good demon or a happy genius departing therefore from these singular wise mens opinions who will believe nothing excellent can happen to others which it has not been their lot to enjoy a share of i shall take my farewell hastily of them without loosing my own time or theirs in the words of the ingenious and learned monsieur le clerc acerbos homines non moror indignos quippe qui haec studia tractent aut quorum judicii ulla ratio habeetur  i shall rather see how far these things have lain open to the eyes of and been explained by the ancient sages i will relate who among them were happy in their genii and who among the moderns whose examples may be authorities for our belief i will set down as clearly as i can what perception men have had of genii or spirits by the sense of seeing what by the sense of hearing what by the sense of feeling touching or tasting and in fine what perception others have had of these genii by all the senses what by dreams and what by magic a thing rarely to be met with at once in any single man and which seems particular to the child who was the subject of our last little historical account when i have brought examples and the opinions of wise philosophers and the evidence of undeniable witnesses which one would think sufficient to evince persons of the commerce men have with spirits if they were not past all sense of conviction i shall not so much to corroborate what i say as to shame some wiseacres who would by their frail reason scan all things and pretend to solve the mysteries ascribed to spirits as facts merely natural and who would banish from the thoughts of men all belief of spirits whatsoever i shall i say in order to put to shame these wiseacres if they have any shame left produce the opinions of the fathers as divines show the doctrines of spirits in general to be consistent with christianity that they are delivered in the scripture and by christian tradition in which if they will not acquiesce i shall leave them to the labyrinth of their own wild opinions which in the end will so perplex their judgments of things that they will be never able to extricate themselves and these different heads will be the subject of the chapter ensuing and will or i am greatly mistaken form both an instructive edifying and entertaining discourse for a reader really and truly intelligent and that has a good taste and relish for sublime things  chap v an argument proving the perception which men have and have had by all the senses as seeing hearing etc of demons genii or familiar spirits it is said in the ninth book of the morals of aristotle it is better to come at the probable knowledge of some things above us in the heavens than to be capable of giving many demonstrations relating to things here below this is no doubt an admirable proposition and speaks the lofty aims of that sublime mind from whence it proceeded among all the disquisitions in this kind none seem to me more excellent than those which treat concerning the genii that attend upon men and guide them in the actions of life a genius or demon of the good kind is a sort of mediate being between humane and divine which gives the mind of man a pleasant conjunction with angelick and celestial faculties and brings down to earth a faint participation of the joys of heaven that there have been such fortunate attendants upon wise men we have many rare instances they have been ascribed to socrates aristotle plotinus porphyrius jamblicus chicus scaliger and cardan the most celebrated of all these ancients was socrates and as for his having a genius or demon we have the testimonies of plato xenophon and antisthenes his contemporaries confirmed by laertius plutarch maximus tyrius dion chrysostonius cicero apuleius ficinus and others many of the moderns besides tertullian origin clemens alexandrinus austin and others and socrates himself in platos theage says by some divine lot i have a certain demon which has followed me from my childhood as an oracle and in the same place intimates that the way he gained his instruction was by hearing the demons voice nothing is certainly so easy as for men to be able to contradict things though never so well attested with such an air of truth as to make the truth of the history doubted by others as well as themselves where no demonstrative proof can be brought to convince them this has been the easy task of those who object against the demon of socrates but when no demonstrative proof is to be had on either side does not wisdom incline us to lean to the most probable let us then consider whether the evidences are not more credible and witnesses of such a thing are not persons of more authority than these men are who vouchsafe to give no reason but their own incredulity for maintaining the contrary and whether those therefore by the right rule of judging ought not much sooner than these to gain over our assent to their assertions  we will however laying aside the histories of those ancient times the sense whereof by various readings and interpretations being put upon the words is rendered obscure and almost unintelligible descend to more modern relations the facts whereof shall be placed beyond doubt by reason of the evidences we will bring to attest them and shall consequently prove the perception men have of spirits or genii by every sense  section i we will first begin as to the perception of spirits by the sight  mr glanvil in his collections of relations for proving apparitions spirits etc tells us of an irish man that had like to have been carried away by spirits and of the ghost of a man who had been seven years dead that brought a medicine to his bedside  the relation is thus  a gentleman in ireland near to the earl of orrerys sending his butler one afternoon to buy cards as he passed a field to his wonder he espied a company of people sitting round a table with a deal of good cheer before them in the midst of the field and he going up toward them they all arose and saluted him and desired him to sit down with them but one of them wisperd these words in his ear  do nothing this company invites you to hereupon he refused to sit down at the table and immediately table and all that belonged to it were gone and the company are now dancing and playing upon musical instruments and the butler being desired to join himself with them but he refusing this also they all fall to work and he not being to be prevailed with to accompany them in working any more than in feasting or dancing they all disappeard and the butler is now alone but instead of going forwards home he returns as fast as he could drive in a great consternation and was no sooner entered his masters door but he fell down and lay sometime senseless but coming again to himself he related to his master what had passed  the night following there comes one of his company to his bedside and tells him that if he offered to stir out of the doors the next day he would be carried away hereupon he kept within but toward the evening having need to make water he adventured to put one foot over the threshold several standing by which he had no sooner done but they espied a rope cast about his middle and the poor man was hurried away with great swiftness they following him as fast as they could but could not overtake him at length they espied an horseman coming toward him and made signs to him to stop the man whom he saw coming near him and both ends of the rope but nobody drawing when they met he laid hold of one end of the rope and immediately had a smart blow given him over his arm with the other end but by this means the man was stopped and the horseman brought him back with him  the earl of orrery hearing of these strange passages sent to the master to desire him to send this man to his house which he accordingly did and the morning following or quickly after he told the earl that his spectre had been with him again and assured him that that day he should most certainly be carried away and that no endeavors should avail to the saving of him upon this he was kept in a large room with a considerable number of persons to guard him among whom was the famous stroaker mr greatrix who was a neighbor there were beside other persons of quality two bishops in the house at the same time who were consulted concerning the making use of a medicine the spectre or ghost prescribed of which mention will be made anon but they determined on the negative  till part of the afternoon was spent all was quiet but at length he was perceived to rise from the ground whereupon mr greatrix and another lusty man clapped their arms over his shoulders one of them before him and the other behind and weighed him down with all their strength but he was forcibly taken up from them and they were too weak to keep their hold and for a considerable time he was carried into the air to and fro over their heads several of the company still running under him to prevent his receiving hurt if he should fall at length he fell and was caught before he came to the ground and had by that means no hurt  all being quiet till bedtime my lord ordered two of his servants to lie with him and the next morning he told his lordship that his spectre was again with him and brought a wooden dish with gray liquor in it and bid him drink it off at the first sight of the spectre he said he endeavored to awake his bedfellows but it told him that that endeavor should be in vain and that he had no cause to fear him he being his friend and he that at first gave him the good advice in the field which had he not followed he had been before now perfectly in the power of the company he saw there he added that he concluded it was impossible but that he should have been carried away the day before there being so strong a combination against him but now he could assure him there would be more attempts of that nature but he being troubled with two sorts of sad fits he had brought that liquor to cure him of them and bid him drink it he peremptorily refusing the spectre was angry and upbraided him with great disingenuity but told him however he had a kindness for him and that if he would take plantane juice he should be well of one sort of fits but he should carry the other to his grave the poor man having by this somewhat recovered himself asked the spectre whether by the juice of plantane he meant that of the leaves or roots it replied the roots  then it asked him whether he did not know him he answered no it replied i am such a one the man answered he had been long dead i have been dead said the spectre or ghost seven years and you know that i lived a loose life and ever since i have been hurried up and down in a restless condition with the company you saw and shall be to the day of judgment then he proceeded to tell him that had he acknowledged god in his ways he had not suffered such severe things by their means and further said you never prayed to god that day before you met with this company in the fields  this relation was sent to dr henry more by mr e fowler who said mr greatrix told it several persons the lord orrery also owned the truth of it and mr greatrix told it to dr henry more himself who particularly inquired of mr greatrix about the mans being carried up into the air above mens heads in the room and he did expressly affirm that he was an eyewitness thereof  a vision which happened to the ingenious and learned dr done may not improperly be here inserted mr isaac walton writing the life of the said doctor tells us that the doctor and his wife living with sir robert drury who gave them a free entertainment at his house in drury lane it happened that the lord hay was by king james sent in an ambassy to the french king henry iv whom sir robert resolved to accompany and engaged dr done to go with them whose wife was then with child at sir roberts house two days after their arrival at paris dr done was left alone in that room in which sir robert and he and some other friends had dined together to this place sir robert returned within half an hour and as he left so he found dr done alone but in such an ecstasy and so altered in his looks as amazed sir robert to behold him insomuch that he earnestly desired dr done to declare what had befallen him in the short time of his absence to which dr done was not able to make a present answer but after a long and perplexed pause did at last say i have seen a dreadful vision since i saw you i have seen my dear wife pass twice by me through this room with her hair hanging about her shoulders and a dead child in her arms this i have seen since i saw you to which sir robert replied sure sir you have slept since i saw you and this is the result of some melancholy dream which i desire you to forget for you are now awake to which dr donnes reply was i cannot be surer that i now live than that i have not slept since i saw you and am as sure at her second appearing she stopped and looked me in the face and vanished rest and sleep had not altered dr donnes opinion the next day for he then affirmed this vision with a more deliberate and so confirmed a confidence that he inclined sir robert to a faint belief that the vision was true who immediately sent a servant to drury house with a charge to hasten back and bring him word whether mrs done were alive and if alive what condition she was in as to her health the twelfth day the messenger returned with this account that he found and left mrs done very sad and sick in bed and that after a long and dangerous labor she had been delivered of a dead child and upon examination the abortion proved to be the same day and about the very hour that dr done affirmed he saw her pass by in his chamber mr walton adds this as a relation which will beget some wonder and well it may for most of our world are at present possessed with an opinion that visions and miracles are ceased and though it is most certain that two lutes being both strung and tuned to an equal pitch and then one played upon the other that is not touched being laid upon the table at a fit distance will like an echo to a trumpet warble a faint audible harmony in answer to the same tune yet many will not believe that there is any such thing as a sympathy with soals etc  section ii i shall next relate some little histories to show what perception men have had of spirits by the sense of hearing for as wierus says spirits appear sometimes invisibly so that only a sound voice or noise is perceived by men viz a stroke knocking whistling sneezing groaning lamenting or clapping of the hands to make men attent to enquire or answer  in luthers colloquia mensalia etc set forth in latin at francfort anno      it being a different collection from that of aurifaber which is translated from high dutch into english we have the following relation  it happened in prussia that as a certain boy was born there presently came to him a genius or what you please to call it for i leave it to mens judgments who had so faithful a care of the infant that there was no need either of mother or servant and as he grew up he had a like care of him he went to school with him but so that he could never be seen either by himself or any others in all his life afterward he traveled into italy he accompanied him and whenever any evil was like to happen to him either on the road or in the inn he was perceived to foretell it by some touch or stroke he drew off his boots as a servant if he turned his journey another way he continued with him having the same care of him in foretelling evil at length he was made a canon and as on a time he was sitting and feasting with his friends in much jollity a vehement stroke was struck on a sudden on the table so that they were all terrified presently the canon said to his friends be not afraid some great evil hangs over my head the next day he fell into a great fever and the fit continued on him for three whole days till he died miserably  captain henry bell in his narrative prefixed to luthers table printed in english anno      having acquainted us how the german copy printed of it had been discovered under ground where it had lain hid fifty two years that edition having been suppressed by an edict of the emperor rudolphus ii so that it was death for any person to keep a copy thereof and having told us that casparus van spar a german gentleman with whom he was familiarly acquainted while he negotiated affairs in germany for king james i was the person that discovered it anno      and transmitted it into england to him and earnestly desired him to translate the said book into english says he accordingly set upon the translation of it many times but was always hindered from proceeding in it by some intervening business about six weeks after he had received the copy being in bed with his wife one night between twelve and one of the clock she being asleep but himself awake there appeared to him an ancient man standing at his bedsside arrayed all in white having a long and broad white beard hanging down to his girdle who taking him by his right ear said thus to him sirrah will you not take time to translate that book which is sent unto you out of germany i will shortly provide for you both place and time to do it and then he vanished hereupon being much affrighted he fell into an extreme sweat so that his wife awaking and finding him all over wet she asked him what he ailed he told her what he had seen and heard but he never regarded visions nor dreams and so the same fell out of his mind but a fortnight after being on a sunday at his lodging in kingsstreet westminster at dinner with his wife two messengers were sent from the whole counselboard with a warrant to carry him to the gate house westminster there to be kept till further order from the lords of the council upon which warrant he was kept there ten whole years close prisoner where he spent five years of it in translating the said book having good cause to be mindful of the old mans saying i will shortly provide for you both place and time to translate it  though the perception of spirits chiefly affects the hearing and seeing faculties yet are not the other senses without some participation of these genial objects whether good or evil for as st austin says the evil work of the devil creeps through all the passages of the senses he presents himself in figures applies himself to colors adheres to sounds introduces odors infuses himself in savors and fills all the passages of intelligence sometimes cruelly tormenting with grief and fear sometimes sportingly diverting man or taunting with mocks and on the other hand as the learned wabter hilton a great master of contemplative life in his scale of perfection sets forth that appearances or representations to the corporeal senses may be both good and evil  but before i conclude upon this head to give still more weight and authority to the perception men have had of these genii both by the senses of hearing and seeing i will relate two very remarkable fragments of history of this kind told us by persons who demand our credit and done within the memory of our grandfathers and fathers  the first is concerning that duke of buckingham who was stabbed by felton august the twenty third       mr lilly the astrologer in his book entitled monarchy or no monarchy in england printed in quarto      having mentioned the duke of buckingham writes as follows since i am upon the death of buckingham i shall relate a true story of his being admonished often of the death he should die in this manner  an aged gentleman one parker as i now remember having formerly belonged unto the duke or of great acquaintance with the dukes father and now retired had a demon appeared several times to him in the shape of sir george villiers the dukes father this demon walked many times in parkers bedchamber without any action of terror noise hurt or speech but at last one night broke out in these words mr parker i know you loved me formerly and my son george at this time very well i would have you go from me you know me very well to be his father old sir george villiers of leicestershire and acquaint him with these and these particulars etc and that he above all refrain the council and company of such and such whom he then nominated or else he will come to destruction and that suddenly parker though a very discreet man partly imagined himself in a dream all this time and being unwilling to proceed upon no better grounds forbore addressing himself to the duke for he conceived if he should acquaint the duke with the words of his father and the manner of his appearance to him such apparitions being not usual he should be laughed at and thought to dote in regard he was aged some few nights past without further trouble to the old man but not very many nights after old sir george villiers appeared again walked quick and furiously in the room seemed angry with parker and at last said mr parker i thought you had been my friend so much and loved my son george so well that you would have acquainted him with what i desired but i know you have not done it by all the friendship that ever was betwixt you and me and the great respect you bear my son i desire you to deliver what i formerly commanded you to my son the old man seeing himself thus solicited promised the demon he would but first argued it thus that the duke was not easy to be spoken withal and that he would account him a vain man to come with such a message from the dead nor did he conceive the duke would give any credit to him to which the demon thus answered if he will not believe you have this discourse from me tell him of such a secret and named it which he knows none in the world ever knew but myself and him mr parker being now well satisfied that he was not asleep and that the apparition was not a vain delusion took a fit opportunity and seriously acquainted the duke with his fathers words and the manner of his apparition the duke laughed heartily at the relation which put old parker to a stand but at last he assumed courage and told the duke that he acquainted his fathers ghost with what he found now to be true viz scorn and derision but my lord says he your father bid me acquaint you by this token and he said it was such as none in the world but your two selves did yet know hereat the duke was amazed and much astonished but took no warning or notice thereof keeping the same company still advising with such counselors and performing such actions as his father by parker countermanded shortly after old sir george villiers in a very quiet but sorrowful posture appears again to parker and said mr parker i know you delivered my words to george my son i thank you for so doing but he slighted them and now i only request this more at your hands that once again you repair to my son and tell him that if he will not amend and follow the counsel i have given him this knife or dagger and with that he pulled a knife or dagger from under his gown shall end him and do you mr parker set your house in order for you shall die at such a time mr parker once more engaged though very unwillingly to acquaint the duke with the last message and so did but the duke desired him to trouble him no further with such messages and dreams and told him he perceived he was now an old man and doted and within a month after meeting mr parker on lambeth bridge said now mr parker what say you of your dream who only returned sir i wish it may never have success etc but within six weeks after he was stabbed with a knife according to his fathers admonition beforehand and mr parker died soon after he had seen the dream or vision performed  this relation is inserted also in the great lord clarendons history and in sir richard bakers chronicle the lord clarendon in his history vol   l   having given some relations says that amongst others there was one meaning this of parker which was upon a better foundation of credit than usually such discourses are founded upon and he tells us that parker was an officer in the kings wardrobe in windsor castle of a good reputation for honesty and discretion and then about the age of fifty years or more this man had in his youth been bred in a school in the parish where sir george villiers the father of the duke lived and had been much cherished and obliged in that season of his age by the said sir george whom afterward he never saw about six months before the miserable end of the duke of buckingham the apparition was seen after the third appearance he made a journey to london where the court then was he was very well known to sir ralph freeman one of the masters of the requests who had married a lady that was near allied to the duke and was himself well received by him he informed the duke with the reputation and honesty of the man and sir ralph freeman carried the man the next morning by five of the clock to lambeth according to the dukes appointment and there presented him to the duke who received him courteously at his landing and walked in conference near an hour with him and sir ralphs and the dukes servants at such a distance that they heard not a word but sir ralph always fixed his eyes on the duke who sometimes spoke with great commotion and disorder and that the man told sir ralph in their return over the water that when he mentioned those particulars that were to gain him credit the dukes color changed and he swore he could come to that knowledge only by the devil for that those particulars were known only to himself and to one person more who he was sure would never speak of them so far the lord clarendon  i will now subjoin an authentic relation which mr beaumont tells us at the end of his book of genii or familiar spirits printed in the year   0  he had just before received from the mouth of the then bishop of gloucester himself it is as follows word for word  sir charles lee by his first lady had only one daughter of which she died in childbirth and when she died her sister the lady everard desired to have the education of the child and she was by her very well educated till she was marriageable and a match was concluded for her with sir william perkins but was then prevented in an extraordinary manner upon a thursday night she thinking she saw a light in her chamber after she was in bed knocked for her maid who presently came to her and she asked why she left a candle burning in her chamber the maid said she left none and there was none but what she brought with her at that time then she said it was the fire but that the maid told her was quite out and said she believed it was only a dream whereupon she said it might be so and composed herself again to sleep but about two of the clock she was awakened again and saw the apparition of a little woman between her curtain and her pillow who told her she was her mother and that she was happy and that by twelve of the clock that day she should be with her whereupon she knocked again for her maid called for her clothes and when she was dressed went into her closet and came not out again till nine and then brought out with her a letter sealed to her father brought it to her aunt the lady everard told her what had happened and desired that as soon as she was dead it might be sent to him but the lady thought she was suddenly fallen mad and thereupon sent presently away to chelmsford for a physician and surgeon who both came immediately but the physician could discern no indication of what the lady immagined or of any indisposition of her body notwithstanding the lady would needs have her let blood which was done accordingly and when the young woman had patiently let them do what they would with her she desired that the chaplain might be called to read prayers and when prayers were ended she took her gittar and psalmbook and sat down upon a chair without arms and played and sung so melodiously and admirably that her musickmaster who was then there admired at it and near the stroke of twelve she rose and sat herself down in a great chair with arms and presently fetching a strong breathing or two immediately expired and was so suddenly cold as was much wondered at by the physician and surgeon she died at waltham in essex three miles from chelmsford and the letter was sent to sir charles at his house in warwickshire but he was so afflicted with the death of his daughter that he came not till she was buried but when he came he caused her to be taken up and to be buried by her mother at edmunton as she desired in her letter this was about the year one thousand six hundred and sixty two or sixty three and this relation the right reverend the lord bishop of gloucester had from sir charles lee himself and mr beaumont printed it in his book abovementioned from the bishops own mouth  the relations which i have given above are not like the trifling accounts too often given of these things and therefore causing grave ones to be ridiculed in common with them they are of that nature that whoever attempts to ridicule them will instead of turning them into jest become the object of ridicule himself  the first story which has in it such amazing circumstances and such uncommon and dreadful incidents concerning the butler in ireland is as the reader sees attested by no less a personage than an earl of orrery two bishops and many other noblemen and gentlemen being present and eyewitnesses of what the earl said what greater testimony would the most incredulous have they say such things are told for interest what interest could an earl and many noblemen have in promoting such an imposture the incredulous say likewise great and learned men delight sometimes in putting frauds upon the world and after laugh at their credulity would a number of noble laymen choose two prelates to carry on such a fraud and would two pious bishops probably combine with several and some servants there present in spreading such a deceit it is past believing and it demands the strictest of moral faith that can be given to the most unquestioned history that the pen of man ever wrote  the second story is founded first upon the experience of one of the most ingenious men of that age dr done and then upon the proof made by his friend sir robert drury who could at first scarce believe it and shall we doubt the credit of men whose company for their credit be it spoken a british ambassador was proud of gaining  the third story is told by luther himself who began the great work of the reformation  the fourth is told by one that was a kings public minister and told from his own trial of the matter where he could have no interest in the telling it  the fifth is related by those great historians the lord clarendon and sir richard baker as a truth relied upon by themselves and fit to be credited by their readers  the sixth and last was related to mr beaumont by the lord bishop of gloucester who received the account from sir charles lee himself to whose granddaughter the matter happened  men who will not believe such things as these so well attested to us and given us by such authorities because they did not see them themselves nor any thing of the like nature ought not only to deny the demon of socrates but that there was such a man as socrates himself they should not dispute the genii of caesar cicero brutus mark anthony but avow that there were never any such men existing upon earth and overthrow all credible history whatsoever mean while all men but those who run such lengths in their fantastical incredulity will from the facts abovementioned rest satisfied that there are such things as evil and good genit and that men have sometimes a commerce with them by all their senses particularly those of seeing and hearing and will not therefore be startled at the strange fragments of histories which i am going to relate of our young duncan campbell and look upon some wonderful adventures which he performed by the intervention of his familiar demon or genius as falsehoods only because they are uncommon and surprising more especially since they were not done in a corner but by an open way of profession of a predictor of things in the face of the metropolis of london where he settled young as will appear in the progress of his life however some people notwithstanding all this may allege that though a man may have a genius appear to him so as to convey into his mind through his senses the knowledge of things that are to come to pass yet this happens but on very eminent and extraordinary occasions the murder for example of a prime minister and the favorite of a monarch in such a manner as it was performed on the great buckingham by felton was a thing so uncommon that it might perhaps deserve by the permission of heaven an uncommon prediction the others likewise are instances eminent in their way particularly that of the lady everards niece for that young lady being then marriageable and a treaty for that end being on foot with sir william perkins the divine providence foreseeing that such a state might call away her thoughts hitherto bent on him and spiritual affairs and fix them on the trifles of this world might perhaps permit her to be called by a holy mother to the state of happiness she before her enjoyed least her daughters mind should change and she go into the ways of a sinner but if these supereminent these scarce and rare examples may be admitted of mans holding a conversation with the spiritualized beings of another world it will however be far below the dignity of humane reason methinks to make such large concessions to people who pretend to converse that wonderful way as to allow them the credit of being able to do it upon every slight occasion and every indifferent occurrence of human life  i cannot help acknowledging that a man of wisdom may at first thought make such an objection but reflection will presently retract it and the same good sense that taught him to make an objection so well upon the first thought will teach him upon second thoughts to acquiesce in the answer  infants may have no doubt the benefit of such an attending genius as well as people more advanced in years as may be seen in one of the instances which is a very famous one relating to the boy born in prussia who was attended by one constantly from the time of his birth to his death besides it is a mistake in the understanding to immagin that death which is the determination and end of life is of more consequence to be known than the manner of regulating that life for in reality according to the right way of considering death or the determination of a mans life derives its importance from the steps which he took in the due regulation of it and therefore every the least step proper to be taken for the due regulation of life is of more consequence to be known than the death of a person though this at first sight carries the face of significance and the other nothing better than the look of a trifle marriage for example is a step in life of the utmost importance whether we consider that estate with regard to this or the next world death is but the finishing of one person but marriage may be the introducing of many into the world with happiness it is therefore a thing of more importance to be known beforehand and consequently more worthy of the communication of a genius to the man with whom he conversed possidonius tells us that a certain rhodian dying nominated six of his equals and said who should die first who next and so on and the event answered the prediction why then though some people are apt to make a jest of it may not a man by the intervention of his good genius tell a woman that is to have six husbands who she shall have first who next and so on and the event answer the prediction if men of learning may acquire such knowledge as to attain to extraordinary things by their ordinary faculties why may not ordinary things be taught others in this extraordinary way for will anybody say that it is easier for a man to accommodate himself to the knowledge of a demon or genius than for a demon or genius to accommodate himself to the knowledge of a man certain it is indeed that if this good genius that induces a man with a prophetic kind of science be any thing resembling a good angel the primary end of his being permitted to direct mankind must consist in things relating more to their welfare hereafter yet i know not why they may not sometimes inspire or openly direct them in human knowledge and in things relating to human life so they are of a good tendency more especially since such a good inspiration may be a counterballance to the bad knowledge which some have been inspired with by evil spirits i would not be thought to go too far in a point of this nature and have therefore though perhaps i could say much more if i followed entirely my own private opinion and would venture to introduce it here in order to communicate it to others and make it a public one said no more on this head than what divines generally teach  but the most unxeceptionable mistress that teaches these things to be in nature is experience if we had very many people gifted this way the extraordinary thing would have been become ordinary and therefore i cannot help wondering that it should be so ordinary a thing for wise men themselves to wonder too much at things because they are extraordinary and suspect them as frauds because they are uncommon  there has scarce been any period of time in which some person of this prophetic class has not existed and has not been consulted by the greatest of men and their predictions found at the long run to come true ignorant men always rise to their belief of them by experience and the most learned men submit their great opinions to experience but your men of midling talents who make up their want of reason with bustling obstinacy and noisy contradiction have been and still continue to be their own opposers and without discovering the reason for what they say they content themselves with having the laugh on their sides and barely affirming without proving that it is a kind of ideal juggle and intellectual legerdemain by which these modern predictors impose things upon the eye of reason as the corporeal eye is imposed upon by slight of hand but it is a strange thing that men of such quick reason cannot give us a sample of the frauds thus i remember to have read i cannot tell where a story of some courtiers who when a great artist of legerdemain was to act before the king pretended to be so quick sighted that nothing he did should escape their discovery were left by his nimble fingers in the dark and forced at last with blushes to own they had no better eyes than other people in a word if people will be led by suspicions and remote possibilities of fraud and contrivance of such men all historical truth shall be ended when it consists not with a mans private humor or prejudice to admit it now therefore to prove by experience and undeniable testimonies that these kind of genii will submit to little offices in order to bring men to greater good i will give the reader three or four curious passages that will set the reasonable reader at ease and prepare him for reading the passages of mr campbells life with pleasure and as a fine history of wonderful facts that though they seem to surpass belief yet ought to have his credit  what in nature can be more trivial than for a spirit to employ himself in knocking on a morning at the wainscot by the bedshead of a man who got drunk over night according to the way that such things are ordinarily explained and yet i shall give you such a relation of this that not even the most devout and precise presbyterian will offer to call in question for mr baxter in his historical discourse of apparitions writes thus  there is now in london an understanding sober pious man often one of my hearers who has an elder brother a gentleman of considerable rank who having formerly seemed pious of late years does often fall into the sin of drunkenness he often lodges long together here in his brothers house and whenever he is drunk and has slept himself sober something knocks at his bedshead as if one knocked on a wainscot when they remove his bed it follows him besides other loud noises on other parts where he is that all the house hears they have often watched him and kept his hands least he should do it himself his brother has often told it me and brought his wife a discreet woman to attest it who avers moreover that as she watched him she has seen his shoes under the bed taken up and nothing visible to touch them they brought the man himself to me and when we asked him how he dare sin again after such a warning he had no excuse but being persons of quality for some special reason of worldly interest i must not name him  two things are remarkable in this instance says mr baxter first what a powerful thing temptation and fleshly concupiscence is and what an hardened heart sin brings men to if one rose from the dead to warn such sinners it would not of itself persuade them  secondly says mr baxter it poses me to think what kind of spirit this is that has such a care of this mans soul which makes me hope he will recover do good spirits dwell so near us or are they sent on such messages or is it his guardian angel or is it the soul of some dead friend that suffers and yet retaining love to him as dives to his brethren would have him saved god yet keeps such things from us in the dark  so far we have the authority of the renowned and famous mr baxter who makes this knocking of the spirit at the bedshead though what we commonly call frivolous an important errand  another relation of this kind was sent to mr john beaumont whom i myself personally know and which he has inserted in his account of genit or familiar spirits in a letter by an ingenious and learned clergyman of wilshire who had given him the relation likewise before by word of mouth it is as follows  near eighty years since in the parish of wilcot which is by the devizes in the vicars house there was heard for a considerable time the sound of a bell constantly tolling every night the occasion was this a debauched person who lived in the parish came one night very late and demanded the keys of the church of the vicar that he might ring a peal which the vicar refused to let him have alleging the unseasonableness of the time and that he should by granting his desires give a disturbance to sir george wroughton and his family whose house adjoined to the churchyard upon this refusal the fellow went away in a rage threatening to be revenged of the vicar and going some time after to the devizes met with one cantle or cantlow a person noted in those days for a wizard and he tells him how the vicar had served him and begs his help to be even with him the reply cantel made him was this does he not love ringing he shall have enough of it and from that time a bell began to toll in his house and continued so to do till cantells death who confessed at fisherton goal in sarum where he was confined by king james during his life that he caused that sound and that it should be heard in that place during life the thing was so notorious that persons came from all parts to hear it and king james sent a gentleman from london on purpose to give him satisfaction concerning the truth of the report mr beaumont had likewise this story as he tells from the mouth of sir george wroughtons own son with this remarkable circumstance that if any in the house put their heads out of the window they could not hear the sound but heard it immediately again as soon as they stood in the room  the reader here sees that good and bad genit exercise themselves upon very little functions knocking at bedsheads and ringing of bells for proof of this we have the testimonies of two divines of a man of quality and probity and the same satisfaction that a learned king had who sent to inquire into the matter and after this there can be i think no room for doubt  but to carry the point still nearer home inasmuch as i know some will leave no stone unturned to make the extraordinary actions which the person whose life i write has performed appear impostures and inasmuch as for this end they may say that though many people may have been gifted in this extraordinary manner yet not so as to make a profession of it and therefore from thence they take their suspicions i shall in this place to remove every nicest scruple they can have touching this affair give the reader one instance of this kind likewise before i proceed with my history  there lived not many years since a very aged gentlewoman in london in waterlane by fleet street whose name was pight who was endowed with a prophetic spirit and the ingenious mr beaumont whom i personally knew and who had a familiar genius himself gives the world this account of her she was very well known says he to many persons of my acquaintance now living in london among others a gentleman whose candor i can no way suspect has told me that he often resorted to her as to an oracle and that as soon as he came into her presence she would usually tell him that she knew what he was coming for for that she had seen his spirit for some time before and without his saying any thing to her she would commonly tell him what the business was which he came to consult her about and what the event of it would be which he always found to fall out as she said and many other persons now living can testify the like experience of her as to themselves  before i conclude this chapter i am willing to give the public one further little history of the like kind with the foregoing ones with this only difference that if it be valued according to the worth the world has always attributed to the very ingenious person whom it concerns it will be far the most famous of them all and therefore fittest to finish this chapter and to crown this part of the work in which we are showing that persons have had a perception of genii or spirits not visible at the same time to others  the famous torquatus tasso prince of the italian poets and scarce inferior to the immortal virgil himself and who seems to enjoy the intermingled gifts of the most accurate judgment of this latin poet and the more fertile and copious invention and fancy of the greek one homer strongly asserted his own experience in this kind his life was written and published in french anno      by d c d d v who in his preface tells us that in what he writ he has followed chiefly the history given us in italian by john baptista manso a neapolitan gentleman who had been a very intimate friend to tasso in his life among other things he acquaints us that tasso was naturally of that melancholic temperament which has always made the greatest men and that this temperament being aggravated by many hardships he had undergone it made him sometimes beside himself and that those melancholic vapors being dispatched he came again to himself like those that return from fits of the falling sickness his spirit being as free as before that near his latter end he retired from the city of naples to his friend manso at bisaccia a small town in the kingdom of naples where manso had a considerable estate and passed an autumn there in the diversions of the season  and here the french author gives us an account of tassos sensible perception of a genius as follows as after these amusements he usually retired to his chamber to entertain himself there with his friend manso the latter had the opportunity to inquire into one of the most singular effects of tassos melancholy of this heroic melancholy as i may call it which raised and brightened his spirit so far it was from depressing or rendering it obscure and which among the ancients would have reasonably caused them to have ascribed a familiar demon to him as to socrates they were often in a warm debate concerning this spirit with which tasso pretended to have so free a communication i am too much your friend said manso to him one day not to let you know what the world thinks of you concerning this thing and what i think of it myself is it possible that being enlightened as you are you should be fallen into so great a weakness as to think you have a familiar spirit and will you give your enemies that advantage to be able to prove by your own acknowledgment what they have already published to the world you know they say you did not publish your dialogue of the messenger as a fiction but you would have men believe that the spirit which you make to speak there was a real and true spirit hence men have drawn this injurious consequence that your studies have embroiled your imagination so that there is made in it a confused mixture of the fictions of the poets the inventions of the philosophers and the doctrine of religion  i am not ignorant answered tasso of all that is spread abroad in the world on the account of my dialogue i have taken care diverse times to disabuse my friends both by letter and word of mouth i prevented even the malignity of my enemies as you know at the time i published my dialogue men could not be ignorant that i composed it for the young prince of mantua to whom i would explain after an agreeable manner the principal mysteries of the platonic philosophy it was at mantua itself after my second flight from ferrara that i formed the idea of it and i committed it to paper a little after my unfortunate return i addressed it to this prince and all men might have read in the epistle dedicatory the protestation i there make that this dialogue being writ according to the doctrine of the platonicks which is not always conformable to revealed truths men must not confound what i expose there as a philosopher with what i believe as a christian this distinction is by so much the more reasonable that at that time nothing extraordinary had happened to me and i spoke not of any apparition this can be attested by all those with whom i lodged or whom frequented in this voyage and therefore there is no reason for confounding the fiction of my dialogue with what has happened to me since i am persuaded of all you say to me replied manso but truly i cannot be of what you believe at present concerning yourself will you imagine that you are in commerce with a spirit and i ask you of what order is that spirit shall we place him in the number of the rebels whom their pride precipitated into the abyss or of the intelligences who continued firm in faith and submission to their creator for there is no mean to take in the true religion and we must not fall into the extravagances of the gnomes and silphs of the cabalists  now the spirit in question cannot be a demon you own that instead of inspiring you any thing contrary to piety and religion he often fortifies in you the maxims of christianity he strengthens your faith by profound reasonings and has the same respect with you for sacred names and things neither can you say that it is an angel for though you have always led a regular life and far from all dissoluteness though for some years past you have applied yourself after a particular manner to the duties of a true christian you will agree with me that these sorts of favors are not common that a man must have attained to a high degree of sanctity and not be far from the pureness of celestial spirits to merit a familiar converse and bear a harmony with them believe me there is nothing in all these discourses which you imagine you have with this spirit you know better than any man those symptoms which the black humors wherewith you are tormented causes in you your vapors are the source of your visions and yourself would not judge otherwise of another person to whom a like thing should happen and you will come to this in your own respect also if you will make a mature reflection and apply yourself to blot out by an effort of reason these immaginations which the violence of your evil effect causes in you you may have reason replied tasso to think so of the things that pass in me but as to myself who have a sensible perception of them i am forced to reason after another manner if it were true that the spirit did not show himself to me but in the violent assault of my vapors if he offered to my immagination but wandering and confused species without connection or due sequel if he used to me frivolous reasonings which ended in nothing or it having begun some solid reasoning he broke it off on a sudden and left me in darkness i should believe with you that all things that pass are but mere dreams and phantoms but it is quite otherwise this spirit is a spirit of truth and reason and of a truth so distinct of a reason so sublime that he raises me often to knowledges that are above all my reasonings though they appear to me no less clear that he teaches me things which in my most profound meditations never came into my spirit and which i never heard of any man nor read in any book this spirit therefore is somewhat of real of whatsoever order he be i hear him and see him nevertheless for its being impossible for me to comprehend and define him manso did not yield to these facts which tasso would have passed for proofs he pressed him with new questions which were not without answers since you will not believe me on my word said tasso to him another day after having well disputed i must convince you by your own eyes that these things are not pure imaginations and the next day conversing together in the same chamber manso perceived that on a sudden he fixed his eyes toward the window and that he stood as it were immovable he called to him and oggd him many times but instead of answering him see there the spirit says tasso at last that has been pleased to come and visit me and to entertain himself with me look on him and you will acknowledge the truth of what i say  manso somewhat surprised cast his eyes toward the place he showed him and perceived nothing but the rays of the sun passing through the glass nor did he see any thing in all the chamber though he cast his eyes round it with curiosity and he desired him to show him the spirit which he looked for in vain while he heard tasso speak with much vehemence he declares in a letter which he writ concerning this to the admiral of naples that he really heard no other voice but tassos own but they were sometimes questions made by him to the pretended spirit sometimes answers that he made to the pretended questions of the spirit and which were couched in such admirable terms so efficacious concerning subjects so elevated and so extraordinary that he was ravished with admiration and dared not to interrupt him he hearkened therefore attentively and being quite beside himself at this mysterious conversation which ended at last by a recess of the spirit as he found by the last words of tasso after which tasso turning himself to him well said he are your doubts at last dissipated on the contrary answered manse i am more imbroiled than ever i have truly heard wonderful things but you have not showed me what you promised me you have seen and heard resumed tasso perhaps more than  he stopped here and manso who could not recover himself of his surprise and had his head filled with the ideas of this extraordinary entertainment found himself not in a condition to press him farther mean while he engaged himself not to speak a word to any man of these things he had heard with a design to make them public though he should have liberty granted him they had many other conversations concerning this matter after which manso owned he was brought to that pass that he knew not what to think or say only that if it were a weakness in his friend to believe these visions he much feared it would prove contagious to him and that he should become at last as credulous as himself  dr beaumont who is still living and with whom i have had formerly some acquaintance myself has set down among the others this relation at large concerning tasso and gives this reason for it because says the doctor i think it contains a sufficient answer to what many learned friends have said to myself on the like occasion  perhaps it may not be ungrateful to the reader if i subjoin here the short elogium writ on tasso by the famous thuanus which is as follows  torquatus tasso died about the forty fifth year of his age a man of a wonderful and prodigious wit who was seized with an incurable fury in his youth when he lived at the court of ferrara and nevertheless in lucid intervals he writ many things both in verse and prose with so much judgment elegancy and extreme correctness of style that he turned at length that pity which many men had conceived for him into an amazement while by that fury which in others makes their minds outrageous or dulls them after it was over his understanding became as it were more purified more ready in inventing things more acute in aptly disposing them after they were invented and more copious in adorning them with choice words and weight of sentences and that which a man of the soundest sense would scarce excogitate at his leisure with the greatest labor and care immaginable he after a violent agitation of the mind set beside itself naturally performed with a wonderful felicity so that he did not seem struck with an alienation of mind but with a divine fury he that knows not these things which all men know that have been in italy and concerning which himself sometimes complains though modestly in his writings let him read his divine works and he must necessarily conclude either that i speak of another man than tasso or that these things were written by another man than tasso  after having given my readers so many memorable accounts concerning the perception men have had in all ages and still continue to have of genii or familiar spirits by all the senses as seeing hearing etc which accounts have been attested by men of the greatest learning and quality if any of them still remain dissatisfied i am contented and desire them for their punishment to lay down the book before they arrive at the more pleasant parts of it which are yet to come and not to read one tittle further these unbelieving gentlemen shall then be at liberty according as their different spirits dictate to ridicule me in the same manner as many more learned and greater men than i have been satyrizd before my time by persons of a like infidel temper who would fain pass incredulity upon the world as wisdom and they may with all the freedom in nature bestow upon me those merry appellations which i very well know such extraordinary freethinkers immagin to belong of right to any author that either believes himself or would possess the world with an opinion and belief that there is such a thing as the holding commerce and conversation in this habitable world with genit and familiar spirits i shall only first tell them all i have to say to terminate the dispute between them and me  those who to give themselves the air and appearance of men of solid wisdom and gravity load other men who believe in spirits with the titles of being men of folly levity or melancholy are desired to learn that the same folly as they are pleased to term it of opinion is to be found in the greatest men of learning that ever existed in the universe let them in order to be convinced of this read apuleiuss book de deo socrat censorinuss book de die not c   porphyrius in his book de abstinentia agrippa in his treatise de occult phil l   c    and also c    natalis comes in his myth l   c   maraviglia in his pseudomantia dissertation   and    and animadversion  0 plato in his timaeus and cratylus ammianus marcellinuss history book    hieronimus cardanus in his book de vita propria c    the great kircher in his oedipus oegyptiacus vol   p     pausanius in cliac poster that immortal orator cicero lib   de divinatione lib   de natura deorum the histoire prodigieuse written by pere arnault and a book entitled lux etenebris which is a collection of modern visions and prophesies in germany by several persons translated into latin by jo amos comenius printed at amsterdam      and if they will be at the pains of having due recourse to these quotations they will find that all these men whose learning is unquestionable and most of whom have been in a firm and undisputed possession of fame for many centuries have all unanimously agreed in this opinion how foolish soever they may think it that there ever was and ever would be a communication held between some select men and genii or familiar spirits i must therefore desire their pardon if i rejoice to see them remain wise by themselves and that i continue to be esteemed by them a fool among so much good company  others out of a mere contempt of religion or cowardly for fear of being thought pusillanimous by men turn bravos to heaven and laugh at every notion of spirits as imbibed from the nurse or imposed upon us by priests and may top these lines upon us with an elegant and a convincing magisterial sneer though the divine socrates was of our opinion and even experienced it to be true having a genius himself  the priests but finish what the nurse began and thus the child imposes on the man these bring into my mind a saying of sir roger lestrange on seneca which i must apply to socrates i join in opinion with a christian heathen while they remain heathen christians  the third sort out of a pretended veneration to religion and divinity may call me superstitious and chimerical to them i answer i will continue chimerical and superstitious with st austin who gives the same opinion in his civitate dei with ludovicus vives let them be solider and more religious divines than st austin in disowning it thus i bid these austere critics heartily farewell but let my better natured readers go on and find a new example of this conversation being held with the genii by our duncan campbell  chap vi a narrative of mr campbells coming to london and taking upon him the profession of a predictor together with an account of many strange things that came to pass just as he foretold to proceed on regularly with the life of young duncan campbell i must let the reader know that he continued thus conversing with his little genius as is set forth above in the dialogue he had with me and predicting many things of the like nature as i have described till the year      when he was just fourteen years of age and then he left scotland  but before i come to speak of the manner of his departure from thence his half native country inasmuch as his father was of that country and he had his education there what education he could have being deaf and dumb i must let the reader know that in the year      my very good friend mrs campbell his mother in law died and left him there at edinburgh an orphan of twelve years of age  he was i may venture to say the most beautiful boy of that age i ever knew and the sensible reader who considers a child of good birth with the misfortunes of being deaf and dumb left fatherless and motherless in the wide world at twelve years old without any competency for his maintenance and support without any relations in a manner that knew him or assisted him all the little fortune his father had having been lost in the civil commotions in scotland as i have related above need not hear me describe the compassion i and many more had for him because such a reader must certainly feel in his own bosom the same lively acts of pity and commiseration at the hearing of such a mishap as i had at the seeing it or at least as i have now revived afresh within me at the relating it  however it came so to pass that a person of the name of campbell and who was a distant relation of the boy though he himself was but in indifferent circumstances was resolved to see him provided for one way or another in a manner somewhat suitable to his condition and till that time to take the best care of him himself that he was able  several ladies of quality who had known his perfections coveted to make the boy one of their domestics as a page or a playfellow to their children for though he could not speak he had such a vivacity in all his actions such a sprightliness of behavior and such a merriment accompanying all his gestures that he afforded more entertainment than the prettiest and wittiest little pratlers at those years are wont to do mr campbell had certainly accepted of some of these fortunate offers for his little cousin which were many of them likely to prove very advantageous if it had not been put in his head by some friends particularly myself that if he had a mind to dispose of the boy in that manner the best way he could take would be to present him to the late earl of argyle who for his name sake and for his fathers sake as well as the qualifications and endowments of the boy would more naturally according to all probability take a greater pleasure and delight in him and consequently provide better for him and with a more lasting care than any other person of quality that had a sudden liking to him which might change and took him as a stranger out of a bare curiosity mr campbell was by these reasons overruled in the disposal of his little dumb prophetical cousin as he called him and resolved that an offer should be made of him to the present illustrious duke of argyles most noble father but it so unfortunately happened that the earl making very much a longer stay at london than was expected mr campbell the uncle sent our young duncan campbell his nephew handsomely accouterd and with a handsome sum of money in his pocket by sea with captain meek of kircaldie to london with letters of recommendation to the earls favor and just a few days before young duncan arrived in london the earl was set out on his journey to his seat in scotland  i had now left him for near three years not having seen him since about a year after his mothers death and then coming to london i had by mere accident an appointment to meet some scotch gentlemen at the buffalo at charing cross there happened at that time to be a great concourse of scotch nobility there at an entertainment and one of the ladies and gentlemen passing by and seeing one of my friends desired him to come in and told him both he and his companions should be very welcome to partake of the diversion the lady told him they had got a lovely youth a scotch miracle among them that would give us exquisite delight and write down to us all the occurrences of our future lives and tell us our names upon our first appearance the moment i heard of it duncan campbell came into my head but as it is a thing not rare to be met with in scotland for second sighted persons to tell such things and as the earl of angyle was in the north i thought little duncan had been under his protection and with him and did not dream of meeting with him there and accordingly told my friend before i went in that i believed i knew a lad in scotland would exceed this in foresight let him be as dexterous in his art as he would  as soon as i entered the room i was surpised to find myself encompassed and surrounded by a circle of the most beautiful females that ever my eyes beheld in the center of this angelick tribe was seated a heavenly youth with the most winning comeliness of aspect that ever pleased the sight of any beholder of either sex his face was divinely fair and tinged only with such a sprightly blush as a painter would use to color the picture of health with and the complexion was varnished over by a blooming like that of flourishing fruit which had not yet felt the first nippings of an unkind and an uncivil air with this beauty was joined such a smiling draught of all the features as is the result of pleasantry and good humor his eyes were large full of luster majestic well set and the soul shone so in them as told the spectators plainly how great was the inward vivacity of his genius the hair of his head was thick and reclined far below his shoulders it was of a fine silver color and hung down in ringlets like the curling tendrils of a copious vine he was by the women entertained according to the claim which so many perfections joining in a youth just ripening into manhood might lay to the benevolent dispositions of the tender sex one was holding the basin of water another washing a hand a third with a towel drying his face which another fair had greedily snatched the pleasure of washing before while a forth was disposing into order his silver hairs with an ivory comb in an hand as white and which a monarch might have been proud to have had so employed in adjusting the crown upon his head a fifth was setting into order his crevat a sixth stole a kiss and blushed at the innocent pleasure and mistook her own thoughts as if she kissed the angel and not the man and they all rather seemed to adore than to love him as if they had taken him not for a person that enjoyed the frequent gift of the second sight but as if he had been some little prophet peculiarly inspired and while they all thus admired and wondered they all consulted him as an oracle the surprise of seeing a young man so happy amidst the general concurring favors of the fair made me be for a while lost in a kind of delightful amazement and the consideration of what bliss he was possessed made me scarce believe my own eyes when they told me it was duncan campbell who i had left an unhappy orphan at edinburgh but so it was though he was much altered in stature being now shot up pretty fast in his growth since i had seen him and having gained a kind of a fixed comportment such as we may daily observe in those who are taking leave of their minority and stepping into a stage of maturer life  the first remarkable thing i knew him do in london being in this splendid company where there were so many undoubted witnesses of quality too that had ocular proof of his predictions at that public tavern i choose to record it here in the first place according to its due order it was in the year school  among this angelical class of beauties were dr wlwds lady and daughter upon earth there was not sure a more beautiful creature than the daughter was she was the leading light of all the sparkling tribe and otways character suits her exactly for she was among ten thousand eminently fair one would imagine prosperous and lucky fortune was written upon her face and that nothing unhappy could be read in so fair a book and it was therefore the unanimous consent of all that by way of good omen to the rest his predictions should begin to be opened luckily that day and that therefore he should first of all be consulted about her  accordingly the mother to be satisfied of his talent before she proceeded to any other questions asked him in writing if he knew the young lady her name and who she was after a little ruminating and pondering upon the matter and taking an exact view of the beauty he wrote down her name told mrs wlwd she was her daughter and that her father was a doctor convinced by his so readily telling the name and quality of persons he had never seen in his lifetime that fame had not given a false character of his capacity she proceeded in her questions as to her future fortune he gazed a fresh at her very eagerly for some time and his countenance during that time of viewing her seemed to be rufled with abundance of disturbance and perplexity we all imagined that the youth was a little touched at the heart himself with what he saw and that instead of telling hers he had met in her bright eyes with his own destiny the destiny of being for ever made a slave and a captive to so many powerful and almost irresistible charms  at length after having a long debate within himself which we thought proceeded from the struglings of love and passion he fetching a great sigh which still convinced us more took the pen and wrote to mrs wlwd that he begged to be excused and that his pen might remain as dumb and silent as his tongue on that affair by this answer we concluded one and all that our former conjectures were true and we joined in pressing him the more earnestly to deliver his real and sincere opinion concerning the accidents upon which the future fortunes of her life were to turn and depend he showed many mighty reluctances in the doing it and i have often since considered him in the same anguish as the late great dr ratcliff who was endeavoring by study to save a certain fair one whom he loved with a vehemence of temper and who was as his reason told him got far away beyond the reach of the art of physic to recover at last he wrote in plain terms that his backwardness and unwillingness to tell it arose from his wishes that her fortune would be better than his certain foreknowledge of it told him it would be and begged that we would rest satisfied with that general answer since it was in so particular a case where he himself was a wellwisher in vain to the lady about whom he was consulted the young lady herself thinking that if she knew any disasters that were to befall her she might by knowing the nature of them beforehand and the time when they were likely to happen be able by timely prudence and forecast to avert those evils with many beseechings urged him to reveal the fatal secret after many struggles to avoid it and as many instances made to him both by mother and daughter for the discovery of his prescience in that point he complied with very great difficulty and blotting the paper with tears that trickled fast from his eyes he gave her the lamentable scroll containing the words that follow viz i wish it had not fallen to my lot to tell this lady whom every body that but once looks at her must admire though they must not have leave to love that she is not much longer to be possessor of that lovely face which gains her such a number of adorers the small pox will too soon turn a ravisher and rifle all those sweets and charms that might be able to vanquish a king and to subdue a conqueror of mighty battles her reign is doomed alas to be as short as it is now great and universal i believe she has interval beauties of the mind not the least inferior to those external excellencies of the body and she might perhaps by the power of her mind alone be absolute queen of the affections of men if the small pox threatened not too surely to be her further enemy and not contented to destroy the face was not perversely bent to destroy the whole woman but i want words to express my sorrow  i would not tell it if you did not extort the baneful secret from my bosom  this fair creature whose beauty would make one wish her immortal will by the cruel means of the small pox give us too sudden a proof of her mortality  but neither the mother nor herself ought too much too repine at this seeing it appears to be the decree of providence which is always to be interpreted as meant for our good and seeing it may be the means of translating her the sooner only to her kindered angels whose beauty she so much resembles here on earth and to be among the lowest class of whom is better than being the greatest beauty of the world here below and wearing an imperial crown  while i comfort you i cannot help the force of nature which makes me grieve myself and i only give you because you compel me to it so particular and so exact an answer to so particular and so exacting a question  the mother who took the paper was prudent enough to conceal from the daughter what he said but nature would force its way and bubled from her eyes and the daughter perceiving that pressed hard to see it and wept at the consideration that hard fate though she knew not particularly what way was to befall her never surely was any thing so beautiful in tears and i obtained of the mother to see the writing  at last in general terms to free her from a suspense of mind it was told her that some trouble should happen to her that would diminish her beauty she had courage enough to hear that misfortune with disdain and crying if that be all i am armed i dont place much pride in that which i know age must shortly after destroy if trouble did not do it before and she dried up her tears and if what mr bruyere says be true viz that the last thing a celebrated woman thinks of when she dies is the loss of her beauty she showed an admirable pattern of female philosophy in bearing such a cruel prediction with such unspeakable magnanimity as exceeded even the patience of stern stoism considering she was a woman to whom beauty is more dear than life  if any evil that is impending over peoples heads could be evaded by foreknowledge or eluded by art she had the fairest opportunity of having this prediction annulled which would have been more to the satisfaction of the predictor than knowing it verified than ever any woman had her mother was specifically told that the fatal distemper should be the small pox her father was and is still a very eminent physician and distempers of that kind especially are much more easily prevented by care than cured by art and by art more easily set aside when there is a timely warning given to a physician to prepare the body against the danger of the poison than when the distemper has once caught hold of a body at unawares when it is unpurgd of any gross humors that may accompany it but neither the foreknowledge and caution of the mother nor the skill and wisdom of the great physician her father were sufficient to ward off the approaching harm that was written in the books of fate not many suns had finished their yearly courses before she was forced to submit to the inevitable stroke of death after the infectious and malicious malady had first ravaged her beauty rioted in all her sweets and made an odious deformed spectacle of the charmer of mankind the death of the daughter worked hard upon the mothers bowels and dragged her speedily after her with a broken heart to the grave  this lady whose fortune so great and so distinguished an assembly had chosen to hear as a happy forerunner and lucky omen of all their own which were to be asked afterward in their turns proving so contrary to their expectations already unfortunate in the prediction and having been in tears about the matter disheartened all the rest of the beauties from consulting him further that day the person who kept the tavern by name mrs irwin alleged that as some people were very fortunate and others unfortunate upon the same day so one lady might be before told a mishap one minute and another lady all the prosperity in nature the very next minute following and therefore that what the unfortunate lady had heard was not to be taken as ominous or as what could malignantly influence the day neither ought it to be the least hinderance to any who had the curiosity of being let into the secrets of time beforehand however whether the ladies were convinced or no if she prevailed over their belief in that point she could not prevail over their humor which though they might not believe the former prediction ominous to themselves was naturally awed for fear of the like peradventure for a time and so it was agreed nemine contradicente as a witty lady wrote it down that no more petitions should for that day be presented by any of that company to his dumb yet oracular majesty mrs irwin however would have her way said she did not presume to such honor as to call herself of that company and that therefore she might consult him without breaking through the votes of the assembly many endeavored to dissuade her but as she was passionately fond of knowing future events and had a mighty itch to be very inquisitive with the oracle about what might happen not only to herself but her posterity it was agreed that he should have the liberty of satisfying her curiosity since she presumed her fortune was sure to be so good and was so forward and eager for the knowledge of it but alas such is too often the fantastical impulse of nature unluckily depraved that it carries often into wishes of knowing what when known we would be glad to unknow again and then our memory will not let us be untaught  mrs irwin was at that time in a pretty commodious way of business every thing in plenty round about her and lived more like a person of distinction that kept such a cellar of wine open house and a free table than like one who kept a tavern she brought in her three pretty children that were then almost babies the youngest having not long been out of the nurses arms or trusted to the use of its own legs these children she loved as a mother should love children they were the delight of her eyes all day and the dream of her imagination all night all the passions of her soul were confined to them she was never pleased but when they were so and always angry if they were crossed her whole pride was centered in them and they were clothed and went attended more like the infants of a princess than of a vintners relict the fortune of these was what she had near at heart and of which she was so eager of being immediately apprized her impatience was proportionable to the love she had for them and which made her wish to foreknow all the happiness that was like to attend them she sat cheerfully down presented one to him and smiling wrote the question in general terms viz is this boy to be happy or unhappy a melancholy look once more spread itself all over the face of the predictor when he read the too inquisitive words and he seemed mightily to regret being asked a question to which he was by his talent of foreseeing compelled to give so unwelcome an answer the color of the poor woman flushed and vanished alternately and very quick and she looked not quite like the picture of despair but a disconsolate woman with little hopes on one hand and great doubts and dismal fears on the other she professed she read great evil in the troubles of his face thanked him for his good nature told him that they all knew that though he could foretell he could not alter the acts and decretals of fate and therefore desired him to tell her the worst for that the misfortunes were they never so great would be less dreadful to her than remaining in the state of fear and suspension he at last wrote down to her that great and unexpected and even unavoidable accidents would involve the whole family in new calamities that the son she asked him about would have the bitterest task of hardship to go through withal while he lived and that to finish all more unhappily he would be basely and maliciously brought to an untimely end by some mortal enemy or other but that she should not trouble herself so much on that head she would never see it for it would happen some years after she was departed from the world this melancholy account closed up the book of predictions for that day and put a sad stop to all the projected mirth and curiosity now i must tell the reader how and when the event answered the prediction and in a few words it was thus poor mrs irwin by strange accidents decayed in the world and dying poor her sons were forced to be put out apprentices to small trades and the son whom the abovementioned prediction concerned was for stealing one cheese from a man in the haymarket severely prosecuted at the old bailey and on wednesday the twenty third of december      hanged at tyburn with several other criminals  the two foregoing passages are of so tragical a nature that it is time i should relieve the minds of my readers with some histories of ladies who consulted him with more success and advantage to whom his predictions were very entertaining when they so came to pass in their favor the relation whereof will consequently be agreeable to all readers who have within them a mixture of happy curiosity and good nature  two ladies who were the most remarkable beauties in london and the most courted turned at the same time their thoughts to matrimony and being satiated i may say wearied with the pleasure of having continually after them a great number and variety of adorers resolved each about the same time to make a choice of their several men to whom they thought they could give most happiness and from whom they might receive most their names for they are both persons of distinction shall be christallina and urbana christallina was a virgin and urbana a young widow christallina engrossed the eyes the hearts and the sighs of the whole court and wherever she appeared put any court lady out of her place that had one before in the heart of any youth and was the celebrated toast among the beau monde urbanas beauty made as terrible havoc in the city all the citizens daughters that had many admirers and were in fair hopes of having husbands when they pleased themselves as soon as urbana had lost her old husband found that they every day lost their lovers and twas a general fear among the prettiest maids that they should remain maids still as long as urbana remained a widow she was the monopolizer of city affection and made many girls that had large stocks of suitors bankrupts in the trade of courtship and broke some of their hearts when her charms broke off their amors  well but the day was near at hand when both the belles of the court and the city damsels were to be freed from the ravages which these two tyrants triumphant in beauty and insolent in charms made among the harvest of love each had seen her proper man to whom the enjoyment of her person was to be dedicated for life but it being an affair of so lasting importance each had a mind to be let into the knowledge of the consequences of such a choice as far as possible before they stepped into the irrevocable state of matrimony both of them happened to take it into their heads that the best way to be entirely satisfied in their curiosity was to have recourse to the great predictor of future occurrences mr duncan campbell whose fame was at that time spread pretty largely about the town christallina and urbana were not acquainted with each other only by the report which fame had made of beauty they came to mr campbells on the same day and both with the same resolution of keeping themselves concealed and under masks that none of the company of consulters who happened to be there might know who they were it happened that on that very day just when they came mr campbells rooms were more than ordinarily crowded with curious clients of the fair sex so that he was obliged to desire these two ladies who expressed so much precaution against and fear of having their persons discovered to be contented with only one room between them and with much ado they complied with the request and condescended to sit together incog distant compliments of gesture passed between them the dress and comportment of each making them appear to be persons of figure and breeding and after three or four modish courtesies down they sat without so much as once opening their lips or intending so to do the silence between them was very formal and profound for near half an hour and nothing was to be heard but the snapping of fans which they both did very tuneably and with great harmony and played as it were in consort  at last one of the civil well bred mutes happening to sneeze the other very gracefully bowed and before she was well aware out poppd the words  bless you madam the fair sneezer returned the bow with an  i thank you madam they found they did not know one anothers voices and they began to talk very merrily together with pretty great confidence and they taking a mutual liking from conversation so much familiarity grew thereupon instantly between them that they began not only to unmask but to unbosom themselves to one another and confess alternately all their secrets christallina owned who she was and told urbana the beau and courtier that had her heart urbana as franckly declared that she was a widow that she would not become the ladies rival that she had pitched upon a second husband an alderman of the city just by that time they had had their chat out and wished one another the pleasure of a successful prediction it came to christallinas turn to visit the dumb gentleman and receive from his pen oracular answers to all the questions she had to propose well he accordingly satisfied her in every point she asked him about but while she was about this one of mr campbells family going with urbana to divert her a little the widow railed at the virgin as a fool to immagin that she should ever make a conquest of the brightest spark about the court and then let she some random bolts of malice to wound her reputation for chastity now it became the widows turn to go and consult and the same person of mr campbells family in the mean time entertained christallina the maid was not behind hand with the widow she railed against the widow represented her as sometimes a coquette sometimes a lady of pleasure sometimes a jilt and lifted up her hands in wonder and amazement that urbana should immagin so rich a man as an alderman such a one should fall to her lot thus urbana swore and protested that christallina could never arrive at the honor of being the wife to the courtly secretarius let mr campbell flatter her as he would and christallina vowed that campbell must be a downright wizard if he foretold that such a one as urbana would get alderman stiffrump for a husband provided a thing so improbable should come to pass  however it seems duncan had told them their own names and the names of their suitors and told them further how soon they were both to be married and that too directly to their hearts content as they said rejoicingly to themselves and made their mutual gratulations  they went away each satisfied that she should have her own lover but christallina laughed at mr campbell for assigning the alderman to urbana and urbana laughed at him for promising the courtier to the arms of christallina  this is a pretty good figure of the tempers of two reigning toasts with regard to one another  first their curiosity made them from resolving to be concealed discover one another wilfully from utter strangers grow as familiar as old friends in a moment swear one another to secrecy and exchange the sentiments of their hearts together and from being friends become envious of each others enjoying a similitude of happiness the compliments made on either side face to face were upon the turning of the back turned into reflections detraction and ridicule each was a selflover and admirer of her own beauty and merit and a despiser of the others  however duncan campbell proved at last to be in the right urbana was wrong in her opinion of christallinas want of power over secretarius and christallina was as much out in her opinion that urbana would miss in her aim of obtaining stiffrump for they both proved in the right of what they thought with regard to their own dear single persons and were made happy according to their expectations just at the time foretold by mr campbell  christallinas ill wishes did not hinder urbana from being mistress of alderman stiffrumps person and stock nor did urbanas hinder christallina from showing herself a shining bride at the ring in secretariuss gilded chariot drawn by six prancers of the proud belgian kind with her half dozen of liveries with favors in their hats waiting her return at the gate of hydepark  both loved and both envied but both allowed of mr campbells foreknowledge  having told you two very sorrowful passages and one tolerably successful and entertaining i shall now relate to you another of my own knowledge that is mixed up with the grievous and the pleasant and checkered as it were with the shade and the sunshine of fortune  though there are vicissitudes in every stage or life under the sun and not one ever ran continually on with the same series of prosperity yet those conditions which are the most liable to the signal alterations of fortune are the conditions of merchants for professed gamesters i reckon in a manner as men of no condition of life at all but what comes under the statute of vagabonds  it was indeed as the reader would guess a worthy and a wealthy merchant who was to run through these different circumstances of being he came and visited our mr campbell in the year   0  he found him amidst a crowd of consulters and being very eager and solicitous to know his own fortune just at that critical juncture of time he begged of him if possible to adjourn his other clients to the day following and sacrifice that one wholly to his use which as it was probably more important than all the others together so he wrote down that he would render the time spent about it more advantageous to mr campbell and by way of previous encouragement threw him down ten guineas as a retaining fee  mr campbell who held money in very little esteem and valued it so much too little that he has often had my reprehensions on that head paused a little and after looking earnestly in the gentlemans face and reading there as i suppose in that little space of time in general according to the power of the second sight that what concerned him was highly momentous wrote him this answer that he would comply with his requests adjourn his other clients to the day following and set apart all the remnant of that till night for inspecting the future occurrences of which he had a mind to be made a master  there is certainly a very keen appetite in curiosity it cannot stay for satisfaction it is pressing for its necessary repast and is without all patience hunger and thirst are not appetites more vehement and more hard and difficult to be repressed than that of curiosity nothing but the present now is able to allay it a more expressive picture of this i never beheld than in the faces of some and the murmurs and complaints of others in that little inquisitive company when the unwelcome note was given about signifying an adjournment for only twenty four hours  the color of a young woman there came and went a hundred times if possible in the space of two minutes she blushed like a red rose this moment and in the switch of an eyelash she was all over as pale as a white one the suitor whose name her heart had gone pit a pat for the space of an hour to be informed of from the pen of a seer was now deferred a whole day longer she was once or twice within an ace of swooning away but he comforted her in particular by telling her though he said it only by way of jest that the day following would be a more lucky day to consult about husbands than the present that she came on the answer was a kind of cordial to her hopes and brought her a little better to herself  two others i remember sisters and old maids that it seems were misers women ordinarily dressed and in blue aprons and yet by relation worth no less than two thousand pounds each were in a peck of troubles about his going and leaving them unsatisfied they came upon an enquiry after goods that were stolen and they complained that by next morning at that time the thief might be got far enough off and creep into so remote a corner that he would put it beyond the power of the devil and the art of conjuration to find him out and bring him back again the disturbance and anxiety that was to be seen in their conntenances was just like that which is to be beheld in the face of a great losing gamester when his all his last great stake lies upon the table and is just sweeping off by another winning hand into his own hat  the next was a widow who bouned because as she pretended he would not tell her what was best to do with her sons and what profession it would be most happy for them to be put to but in reality all the cause of the widows fuming and fretting was not that she wanted to provide for her sons but for herself she wanted a second husband and was not half so solicitous about being put in a way of educating those children she had already as of knowing when she should be in a likelihood of getting more this was certainly in her thoughts or else she would never have flouncd about in her weed from one end of the room to the other and all the while of her passion smile by fits upon the merchant and leer upon a young pretty irish fellow that was there the young irishman made use of a little eyelanguage she grew appeased went away in quite a good humor skutled too airily down stairs for a woman in her clothes and the reason was certainly that she knew the matter before which we took notice of presently after the irishman went precipitately after her down stairs without taking his leave  but neither were the two misers for their gold the virgin for a first husband nor the widow for a second half so eager as another married woman there was for the death of her spouse she had put the question in so expecting a manner for a lucky answer and with so much keen desire appearing plainly in her looks that no big bellied woman was ever more eager for devouring fruit no young hasty bridegroom just married to a beauty more impatient for night and enjoyment than she was to know what she thought a more happy moment the moment of her husbands last agonizing gasp as her expectation was the greatest so was her disappointment too and consequently her disorder upon his going and leaving her unresolved she was frantic raging and implacable she was in such a fury at the delay of putting off her answer to the day following that in her fury she acted as if she would have given herself an answer which of the two should die first by choking herself upon the spot with the indignation that swelled in her stomach and rose into her throat on that occasion it may look like a romance to say it but indeed they were forced to cut her lace and then she threw out of the room with great passion  but yet had so much of the enraged wife left beyond the enraged woman as to return instantly up stairs and signify very calmly she would be certain to be there next day and beseechd earnestly that she might not meet with a second disappointment  all this hurry and bustle created a stay a little too tedious for the merchant who began to be impatient himself especially when word was brought up that a fresh company was come in but mr campbell was denied to them and to put a stop to any more interruptions the merchant and the dumb gentleman agreed to slip into a coach drive to a tavern in the city and settle matters of futurity over a bottle of french claret  the first thing done at the tavern was mr campbells saluting him upon a piece of paper by his name and drinking his health the next paper held a discourse of condoleance for a disaster that was past long since namely a great and considerable loss that happened to his family in the dreadful conflagration of the city of london in the third little dialogue which they had together he told the merchant that losses and advantages were general topics which a person unskilled in that art might venture to assign to any man of his profession it being next to impossible that persons who traffic should not sometimes gain and sometimes lose  but said mr duncan campbell i will sketch out particularly and specify to you some future misfortunes with which you will unavoidably meet it is in your stars it is in destiny that you should have some trials and therefore when you are forewarned take a prudent care to beforearmd with patience and by longanimity and meekly and resignedly enduring your lot render it more easy since impatience cannot avert it and will only render it more burdensome and heavy he gave these words to the merchant who pressed for his opinion that moment by your leave resuming the pen said the dumb gentleman in writing we will have this bottle out first and tap a fresh one that you may be warmed with courage enough to receive the first speculative onsett of ill fortune that i shall predict to you with a good grace and that may perhaps enable you to meet it when it comes to reduce it self into action with a manful purpose and all becoming resolution the merchant agreed to the proposal and put on an air of the careless and indifferent as well as he could to signify that he had no need to raise up an artificial courage from the auxiliary forces of the grape but nature when hard pressed will break through all disguises and not only notwithstanding the air of pleasantry he gave himself which appeared forced and constrained but in spite of two or three sparkling and enlivening bumpers a cloud of care would ever and anon gather and shoot heavily cross his brow though he labored all he could to dispel it as quickly and to keep fair weather in his countenance well they had cracked the first bottle and the second succeeded upon the table and they called to blow a pipe together this pipe mr campbell found had a very ill effect it is certainly a pensive kind of instrument and fills a mind any thing so disposed with disturbing thoughts black fumes and melancholy vapors as certainly as it does the mouth with smoke it plainly took away even the little sparks of vivacity which the wine had given before so he wrote for a truce of firing those sort of noxious guns any longer and they laid down their arms by consent and drank off the second bottle a third immediately supplied its place and at the first glass the opening of the bottle mr campbell began to open to him his future case in the following words sir you have now some ventures at sea from such and such a place to such a value dont he discomforted at the news which you certainly will have within three months but twill be false at last that they are by three different tempests made the prey of the great ocean and enrich the bottom of the sea the palace of neptune a worse storm than all these attends you at home a wife who is and will be more the tempest of the house wherein she lives the high and lofty winds of her vanity will blow down the pillars of your house and family the hightide of her extravagance will roll on like a resistless torrent and leave you at low water and the ebb of all your fortunes this is the highest and the most cutting disaster that is to befall you your real shipwreck is not foreign but domestic your bosom friend is to be your greatest foe and even your powerful undoer for a time mark what i say and take courage it shall be but for a time provided you take courage it will upon that condition be only a short and wholesome taste of adversity given to you that you may relish returning prosperity with virtue and with a greater return of thanks to him that dispenses it at pleasure to mankind remember courage and resignation is what i advise you to use it as becomes you in your adversity and believe that as i foretold that adversity so i can foretell a prosperity will again be the consequence of those virtues and the more you feel the one ought not to cast you down but raise your hopes the more that he who foretold you that so exactly could likewise foretell you the other the merchant was by this put into a great suspense of mind but somewhat easier by the second prediction being annexed so kindly to the first fatal one they crowned the night with a flask of burgundy and then parting each went to their respective homes  the reader may perchance wonder how i who make no mention of my being there as in truth i was not at the tavern should be able to relate this as of my own knowledge but if he pleases to have patience to the end of the story he will have entire satisfaction in that point  about half a year after the merchant came again told him that his prediction was too far verified to his very dear cost and that he was now utterly undone and beyond any visible means of a future recovery and doubting least the other fortunate part of the prediction was only told him by way of encouragement for groundless doubts and fears always attend a mind implungd in melancholy besought him very earnestly to tell him heartily and sincerely if there was no real prospect of good and rid him at once of the uneasiness of such a suspension of thought but pray too said he with all the vehemence of repeated expostulation satisfy me if there are any further hopes on this side the grave  to this duncan campbell made a short but a very significant reply in writing may the heavens preserve you from a threatening danger of life take care only of yourself great and mighty care and if you outlive friday next you will yet be great and more fortunate than ever you was in all the height of your former most flourishing space of life he colored inordinately when duncan campbell said friday and conjured him to tell him as particularly as he could what he meant by friday he told him he could not particularize any further but that great danger threatened him that day and that without extraordinary precaution it would prove fatal to him even to death he shook his head and went away in a very sorrowful plight friday past saturday came and on that very saturday morning came likewise the joyful tidings that what ventures of his were given over for lost at sea were all come safe into the harbor he came the moment he received those dispatches from his agent to mr duncan campbells apartment embraced him tenderly and saluted him with much gladness of heart before a great room full of ladies where i happened to be present at that time crying out in a loud voice before he knew what he said that mr campbell had saved his life that friday was his birthday and he had intended with a pistol to shoot himself that very day the ladies thought him mad and he recovered from his exstacy said no more but sat down till mr campbell dismissed all his clients and then we three went to the tavern together where he told me the whole little history or narrative just as is above related  the fame which mr duncan campbell got by the foregoing and several other predictions of the like kind was become very large and extensive and had spread itself into the remotest corners of this metropolis the squares rung with it it was whispered from one house to another through the more magnificent streets where persons of quality and distinction reside it caught every house in the city like the news of stock from exchangealley it run noisily through the lanes and little thoroughfares where the poor inhabit it was the chat of the teatable and the babble of the streets and the whole town from the top to the bottom was full of it whenever any reputation rises to a degree like this let it be for what art or accomplishment or on what account soever it will malice envy and detraction are sure to be the immediate pursuers of it with full mouth and to hunt it down if possible with full cry even the great nostradamus though favored by kings and queens which always without any other reason creates enemies was not more pursued by envy and detraction for his predictions in paris and throughout france than our duncan campbell was in london and even throughout england various different and many were the objections raised to blot his character and extenuate his fame that when one was confuted another might not be wanting to supply its place and so to maintain a course and series of backbiting according to the known maxim  throw dirt and if it does not stick throw dirt continually and some will stick  neither is there any wonder for a man that has got applauders of all sorts and conditions must expect condemners and detractors of all sorts and conditions likewise if a lady of high degree for example should say smiling though really thinking absolutely what she says for fear of being thought overcredulous  well i vow some things mr campbell does are surprising after all they would be apt to incline one to a belief that he is a wonder of a man for one would imagine the things he does impossible  why then a prude with an assumed supercilious air and a scornful tihee would in order to seem more wise than she was reply laud madam it is more a wonder to me that you can be imposed upon so  i vow to gad madam i would as soon consult an almanackmaker and pin my faith upon what he pricks down or believe like my creed in the cross which i make upon the hand of a gypsy  lard madam i assure your laship he knows no more than i do of you  i assure you so and therefore believe me  he has it all by hearsay  if the lady that believed it should reply that if he had notice of every stranger by hearsay he must be a greater man than she suspected and must keep more spies in pay than a prime minister the prudes answer would be with a loud laugh and giggling out these words  lard madam i assure you nothing can be more easy and so take it for granted because she was inclined to say so and had the act of wisdom on her side forsooth that she appeared hard of belief which some call hard to be put upon and the other lady credulous which some though believing upon good grounds are called and so thought foolish the prudes answer would be thought sufficient and convincing  thus malice and folly by dint of noise and impudence and strong though empty assertions often run down modesty and good sense among the common people it is the same but only done in a different manner for example an ordinary person that had consulted might say as he walked along there goes the dumb gentleman who writes down any name of a stranger at first sight steps up a blunt fellow that takes stubborness for sense and says  that is a confounded lie he is a cheat and an impostor and you are one of his accomplices he will tell me my name i suppose if you tell it him first he is no more dumb than i am he can speak and hear as well as us i have been with those that say they have heard him i wish i and two or three more had him in our stable and i warrant you with our cartwhips we would lick some words out of his chops as dumb as you call him  i tell you it is all a lie and all a bite  if the other desires to be convinced for himself by his own experience  the rougher rogue who perhaps has stronger sinews than the other answers if you lie any further i will knock you down and so he is the vulgar wit and the mouth of the rabblerout and thus the detraction spreads below with very good success as it does above in another kind  as there are two comical adventures in his life which directly suit and correspond with the foregoing reflections this seems the most proper place to insert them in the first consists of a kind of mobbway of usage he met with from a fellow who got to be an officer in the army but by the following behavior will be found unworthy of the name and the commission  in the year   0  a lady of good quality came and addressed herself to him much after the following manner she told him she had choice of lovers but preferred one above the rest but desired to know his name and if she made him her choice what would be the subsequent fate of such a matrimony mr duncan campbell very readily gave her down in writing this plain and honest reply that of all her suitors she was most inclined to a captain a distinguished officer and a great beau naming his name and one that had a great many outward engaging charms sufficient to blind the eyes of any lady that was not thoroughly acquainted with his manner of living he therefore assured her and thought himself bound being conjured so to do having received his fee though there was danger in such plain and open predictions that he was a villain and a rogue in his heart a profligate gamester and that if she took him to her bed she would only embrace her own ruin the ladys woman who was present being in fee with the captain resolving to give intelligence for fear the officer her so good friend should be disappointed in the siege slily shuffled the papers into her pocket and made a present of them to the military spark fired with indignation at the contents he vowed revenge and in order to compass it conspires with his female spy about the means in fine for fear of losing the lady though he quarreled with duncan campbell a method was to be found out how to secure her by the very act of revenge at last it was resolved to discover to her that he had found out what she had been told by mr campbell but the way how he had been informed was to remain a secret he did do so and ended his discovery with these words i desire madam that if i prove him an impostor you would not believe a word he says  the lady agreed to so fair a proposal  then the captain swore that he himself would never eat a piece of bread more till he had made mr campbell eat his words nay he insisted upon it that he would bring him to his tongue and make him own by word of mouth that what he had written before was false and calumnious to which the lady answered again that if he performed what he said she would be convinced this brave military man however not relying upon his own single valor and prowess to bring about so miraculous a thing as the making a person that was dumb to speak he took with him for this end three lusty assistants to combine with him in the assassination the ambuscade was settled to be at the five bells tavern in witchstreet in the strand after the ambush was settled with so much false courage the business of decoying mr campbell into it was not practicable any other way than by sending out false colors the ladys woman who was by her own interest tied fast to the interest of the beau was to play the trick of dalila and betray this deaf and dumb sampson as he will appear to be a kind of one in the sequel of the story into the hands of these philistines she smooths her face over with a complimenting lie from her mistress to mr campbell and acted her part of deceit so well that he promised to follow her to the five bells with all haste and so she skuttled back to prepare the captain and to tell him how lucky she was in mischief and how she drew him out by smiles into perdition the short of the story is when they got him in among them they endeavored to assassinate him but they missed of their aim yet it is certain they lest him in a very terrible and bloody condition and the captain went away in as bad a plight as the person was left in whom he assaulted so cowardly with numbers and to such disadvantage i was sent for to him upon this disaster and the story was delivered to me thus by one of the drawers of the tavern when i inquired into it they began to banter him and speaking to him as if he heard asked him if he knew his own fortune they told him it was to be beaten to death this was an odd way of addressing a deaf and dumb man they added they would make him speak before they had done the boy seeing he made no reply but only smiled thought what passed between them was a jest with an old acquaintance and withdrew about his business the door being fastened however before they began the honorable attack they vouchsafed to write down their intent in the words abovementioned which they had uttered before to make sure that he should understand their meaning and what this odd way of correction was for all the while the maid who had brought him into it was peeping through a hole and watching the event as appears afterward mr campbell wrote them the following answer viz that he hoped for fair play that he undersd bergarden as well as they but if a gentleman was amongst them he would expect gentlemanly usage the rejoinder they made to this consisted it seems not of words but of action the officer in conjunction with another ruffian one of the strongest of the three he had brought commenced the assault as good luck would have it he warded off their first blows it seems with tolerable success and a winequartpot standing upon the table duncan took to his arms and at two or three quick blows well managed and close laid in upon the assailants felled them both to the ground here it was that the maid discovered her knowledge of it and privity to the plot to the whole house for the no sooner sees the famous leader the valiant captain lie sprauling on the floor with bleeding temples but she shrieked out with all the voice she could exert murder murder murder alarmed at this outcry the master and all the attendants of the tavern scamperd up stairs burst into the room and found duncan campbell struggling with the other two and the quartpot still fast clenchd in his hand which they were endeavoring to wrench from him the drawers rescued him out of their hands and inquired into the matter the maid in a fright confessed the whole thing the officer and his associate rubbed their eyes as recovering from a stunning sleep reeled as they went to rise paid the reckoning and slunk pitifully away or as the rakes term for it is they brushed off and for all their odds had the worst of the lay i who had some authority with mr campbell by reason of my years and the strict acquaintance i had with his mother when i came and found him in that pickle and had the whole relation told me by the people of the house though i could not forbear pitying him within my own mind took upon me to reprehend him and told him that these hardships would by providence be daily permitted to fall upon him for he met with them twenty times while he continued in that irregular way of living and spending his time that might be so precious to himself and many others in drunkenness and debauchery and i think the lessons i wrote down to him upon that head though a little severe just at that juncture were notwithstanding well timed and did as i guessed they would make a more solid impression in him than at any other in all these scuffles whether it is that being deaf and dumb an affront works deeper upon a man and so renders him far more fierce or resolute it must be said that though nature has been kind in making him very strong robust and active with all yet he has bore some shocks one would imagine beyond the strength of a man having sometimes got the better of five or six russians in rencounters of the like kind  the next banter he met with was in a gentler way from an unbelieving lady and yet she came off with very ill success and the banter turned all upon herself in the end  a lady of distinction whose name shall therefore be concealed in this place came with two or three of her special friends who took her for the most merry innocent spotless virgin upon earth and whose modesty was never suspected in the least by her relations or servants that were nearest about here after having rallied mr campbell  several frivolous questions doubting his  and vexing and teazing him with  beyond all patience was by him told that he did not take fees in his profession to be made a jest of like a common fortune tellers but to do real good to those who consulted him as far as he was able by his predictions that he was treated with more respect by persons of a higher condition though her own was very good and so offered her guinea back again with a bow and a smile she had a little more generosity of spirit than not to be a little nettled at the proffer she had caused by so coarse an usage she affected appearing grave a little and told him she would be serious for the future and asked him to set down her name which she had neglected before to ask other questions that were nothing to the purpose he promised to write it down but pausing a little longer than ordinary about it she returned to her former way of uncivil merriment and ungallant raillery she repeated to him in three or four little scraps of paper one after another as fast as she could write them the same words viz  that he could not tell her name nor whether she was maid wife or widow and laughed as if she would split her sides triumphing to the rest of her companions over his ignorance and her own wit as if she had posed him and put him to an entire stand but see what this overweening opinion of security ended in the man of the second sight was not to be so easily baffled vexed at being so disturbed and coming out of his brown study he reaches the paper and begins to write  now it was the ladys turn to suffer she had deserved hearty punishment and it came into her hands with the note to a degree of severity as you will perceive by the contents of it just now  she read it and swooning away dropped from her chair the whole room being in a bustle i that was in the outward chamber ran in while mr campbell was sprinkling water in her face a lady snatched up the note to read it at which he seemed mightily displeased i therefore who understood his signs recovered it out of her hands by stratagem and ran to burn it which i did so quick that i was not discovered in the curiosity which i must own i satisfied myself in by reading it first a curiosity raised too high by so particular an adventure to be overcome in so little a time of thought as i was to keep it in my hands and so i came by the knowledge of it myself without being informed by mr campbell this shows how a sudden curiosity when there is not time given to think and correct it may overcome a man as well as a woman for i was never overcurious in my life and though i was pleased with the oddness of the adventure i often blushed to myself since for the unmanly weakness of not being able to step with a note from one room to another to the fireside without peeping into the contents of it the contents of it were these madam since you provoke me your name is  you are no widow you are no wife and yet you are no maid you have a child at nurse at such a place by such a gentleman and you were brought to bed in leicestershire the lady convinced by this answer of his strange and mystical power and pleased with his civility in endeavoring to conceal from others the secret after so many repeated provocations though she showed great disorder for that day became one of his constant attenders some time after and would not take any step in her affairs without his advice which she often has said since she found very much to her advantage she was as serious in her dealings with him afterward and improved by being so as she was gay and turbulent with him before and smarted for it in fine she was a thorough convert and a votary of his and the only jest she used afterward to make concerning him was a civil witticism to his wife to whom she was wont every now and then smiling to address herself after this manner your husband madam is a devil but he is a very handsome and a very civil one  not long after this came another lady with a like intent to impose upon him and was resolved as she owned to have laughed him to scorn if she had succeeded in her attempt she had very dexterously dressed her self in her womans habit and her woman in her own her footman squired the new made lady in a very gentlemanly dress hired for that purpose of a disguise from monmouthstreet the strange and unknown masqueraders entered mr campbells room with much art the fellow was by nature of a clean make and had a good look and from following a genteel master when he was young copied his gait a little and had some appearance of a mien and a tolerable good air about him but this being the first time of his being so fine and he a little vain in his temper he overacted his part he strutted too much he was as fond of his ruffles his watch his sword his cane and his snuffbox as a boy of being newly put into breeches and viewed em all too often to be thought the possessor of any such things long the affectation of the chambermaid was insufferable she had the toss of the head the jut of the bum the sidelong leer of the eye the imperious look upon her lady now degraded into her woman that she was intolerable and a person without the gift of the second sight would have guessed her to have been a pragmatical upstart though it is very probable that during that time she fancied herself really better than her mistress the mistress acted her part of maid the best for it is easier for genteel modesty to act a low part than for affected vanity to act a high one she kept her distance like a servant but would to disguise things the better be every now and then pert according to their way and give occasion to be chid but there is an air of gentility inborn and inbred to some people and even when they aim to be awkward a certain grace will attend all their minutest actions and gestures and command love respect and veneration i must therefore own that there was not need of a mans being a conjurer to guess who ought to be the lady and who the maid but to know who absolutely was the lady and who was the maid did require that skill for how many such real ladies have we that are made so from such upstarts and how many genteel waiting women of great descent that are born with a grace about them and are bred to good manners mr campbells art made him positive in the case he took the patches from the face of the maid and placed them on the mistrisses he pulled of her hood and scarf and gave it the lady and taking from the lady her ridinghood gave it the maid in exchange for ladies at that time of day were not entered into that fashion of cloaking themselves then he wrote down that he should go out and ought to send his maid in to undress them quite and give the mistress her own clothes and the maid hers and with a smile wrote down both their names and commended her contrivance but after that it was remarked by the lady that he paid her less respect than she expected and more to her footman who was in gentlemans habit whom he took by his side and told a great many fine things whereas he would tell the lady nothing further the lady nettled at this wrote to him that she had vanity enough to believe that she might be distinguished from her maid in any dress but that he had shown his want of skill in not knowing who that gentleman was mr campbell told her her mistake in sharp terms and begging her pardon assured her he knew several chambermaids as genteel and as wellborn as her and many mistresses more awkward and worseborn than her maid that he did not go therefore by the rule of guess and judging what ought to be but by the rule of certainty and the knowledge of what actually was she however unsatisfied with that answer perplexed him mightily to know who the man was he answered he would be a great man  the lady laughed scornfully and said she wanted to know who he was not what he would be  he answered again  he was her footman but that she would have a worse  she grew warm and desired to be informed why since he knew the fellows condition he respected her to little and him so much and accused him of want of practicing manners if he had not went of knowledge he answered madam since you will be asking questions too far  this footman will advance himself to the degree of a gentleman and have a woman of distinction to his wife while you will degrade yourself by a marriage to be the wife of a footman his ambition is laudable your condescension mean therefore i give him the preference i have given you fair warning and wholesome advice you may avoid your lot by prudence but his will certainly be what i tell you  this coming afterward to pass exactly as was predicted and his disappointing so many that had a mind to impose upon him has rendered him pretty free from such wily contrivances since though now and then they have happened but still to the mortification and disappointment of the contrivers but as we have not pretended to say with regard to these things that he has his genius always at his elbow or his beck to whisper in his ear the names of persons and such little constant events as these so that we may not be deemed to give a fabulous account of his life and adventures we think ourselves bound to give the reader an insight into the particular power and capacity which he has for bringing about these particular performances especially that of writing down names of strangers at first sight which i dont doubt will be done to the satisfaction of all persons who shall read the succeeding chapter concerning the gift of the second sight  chap vii concerning the second sight mr martin lately published a book entitled a description of the western isles of scotland called by the ancient geographers hebrides it contains many curious particulars relating to the natural and civil history of those islands with a map of them and in his preface he tells us that perhaps it is peculiar to those isles that they have never been described till now by any man that was a native of the country or had traveled them as himself has done and in the conclusion of the said preface he tells us he has given here such an account of the second sight as the nature of the thing will bear which has always been reckoned sufficient among the unbiased part of mankind but for those that will not be satisfied they ought to oblige us with a new scheme by which we may judge of matters of fact the chief particulars he has given us concerning the second sight are here set down by way of abstract or epitome that they may not be too tedious to the reader    in the second sight the vision makes such a lively impression on the seers that they neither see nor think of any thing else but the vision as long as it continues and then they appear pensive or jovial according to the object which was presented to them    at the sight of a vision the eyelids of the person are erected and the eyes continue staring till the object vanish as has often been observed by the author and others present    there is one in sky an acquaintance of whom observed that when he sees a vision the inner part of his eylids turns so far upwards that after the object disappenrs he must draw them down with his fingers and sometimes employs others to draw them down which he finds to be much the easier way    the faculty of the second sight does not lineally descend in a family as some imagine for he knows several parents that are endowed with it but not their children and so on the contrary neither is it acquired by any previous compact and after a strict enquiry he could never learn from any among them that this faculty was communicable any way whatsoever  note that this account is differing from the account that is given by mr aubrey a gentleman of the royal society and i think mr martins reason here against the descent of this faculty from parents to children is not generally conclusive for though he may know parents endowed with it and not children and so vice versa yet there may be parents who are endowed with it being qualified as mr aubrey has said  viz both being second sighted or even one to an extraordinary degree whose children may have it by descent and as to this facultys being any otherways communicable since the accounts differ i must leave it to a further examination    the seer knows neither the object time nor place of a vision before it appears and the same object is often seen by different persons living at a considerable distance from one another the true way of judging as to the time and circumstance of an object is by observation for several persons of judgment without this faculty are more capable to judge of the design of a vision than a novice that is a seer as an object appears in the day or night it will come to pass sooner or later accordingly    if an object be seen early in the morning which is not frequent it will be accomplished in a few hours afterward if at noon it will commonly be accomplished that very day if in the evening perhaps that night if after candles be lighted it will be accomplished that night it is later always in accomplishment by weeks months and sometimes years according to the time of the night the vision is seen    when a shroud is perceived about one it is a sure prognostic of death the time is judged according to the height of it about the person for if it be not seen above the middle death is not to be expected for the space of a year and perhaps some months longer and as it is frequently seen to ascend higher toward the head death is concluded to be at hand in a few days if not hours as daily experience confirms examples of this kind were shown the author when the persons of whom the observations were made enjoyed perfect health  there was one instance lately of a prediction of this kind by a seer that was a novice concerning the death of one of the authors acquaintance this was communicated to a few only and with great confidence the author being one of the number did not in the least regard it till the death of the person about the time foretold confirmed to him the certainty of the prediction the foresaid novice is now a skilful seer as appears from many late instances he lives in the parish of st marys the most northern in sky    if a woman be seen standing at a mans left hand it is a presage that she will be his wife whether they are married to others or unmarried at the time of the apparition if two or three women are seen at once standing near a mans left hand she that is next him will undoubtedly be his wife first and so on whether all three or the man be single or married at the time of the vision of which there are several late instances of the authors acquaintance it is an ordinary thing for them to see a man that is to come to the house shortly after and though he be not of the seers acquaintance yet he not only tells his name but gives such a lively description of his stature complexion habit etc that upon his arrival he answers the character given of him in all respects if the person so appearing be one of the seers acquaintaince he can tell by his countenance whether he comes in good or bad humor the author has been seen thus by seers of both sexes at some hundreds of miles distance some that saw him in this manner had never seen him personally and it happened according to their visions without any previous design of his to go to those places his coming there being purely accidental and in the nineteenth page of his book he tells us that mr daniel morrison a minister told him that upon his landing in the island rona the natives received him very affectionately and addressed themselves to him with this salutation god save you pilgrim you are heartily welcome here for we have had repeated apparitions of your person amongst us viz after the manner of the second sight    it is ordinary with them to see houses gardens and trees in places void of all three and this in process of time uses to be accomplished of which he gives an instance in the island of sky   0 to see a spark of fire fall upon ones arm or breast is a forerunner of a dead child to be seen in the arms of those persons of which there are several fresh instances  to see a seat empty at the time of ones sitting in it is a presage of that persons death quickly after  when a novice or one that has lately obtained the second sight sees a vision in the nightime without doors and comes near a fire he presently falls into a swoon  some find themselves as it were in a crowd of people having a corpse which they carry along with them and after such visions the seers come in sweating and describe the people that appeared if there are any of their acquaintance among them they give an account of their names and also of the bearers but they know nothing concerning the corpse  all those that have the second sight do not always see these visions at once though they are together at the time but if one who has this faculty designedly touch his fellow seer at the instant of a visions appearing then the second sees it as well as the first     there is the way of foretelling death by a cry that they call taisk which some call a wrath in the lowland they hear a loud cry without doors exactly resembling the voice of some particular person whose death is foretold by it of which he gives a late instance which happened in the village rigg in sky isle     things are also foretold by smelling sometimes as follows fish or flesh is frequently smelt in the fire when at the same time neither of the two are in the house or in any probability like to be had in it for some weeks or months this smell several persons have who are endued with the second sight and it is always accomplished soon after     children horses and cows have the second sight as well as men and women advanced in years  that children see it it is plain from their crying aloud at the very instant that a corpse or any other vision appears to an ordinary seer of which he gives an instance in a child when himself was present  that horses likewise see it is very plain from their violent and sudden starting when the rider or seer in company with them sees a vision of any kind by night or day it is observable of a horse that he will not go forward that way till he be led about at some distance from the common road and then he is in a sweat he gives an instance of this in a horse in the isle of sky  that cows have the second sight appears from this that if a woman milking a cow happens to see a vision by the second sight the cow runs away in a great fright at the same time and will not be pacified for some time after  in reference to this paracelsus tom   l de art presaga writes thus horses also have their auguries who perceive by their sight and smell wandering spirits witches and specter and the like things and dogs both see and hear the same  here in the next place the author answers objections that have lately been made against the reality of the second sight  first it is objected that these seers are visionary and melancholy people who fancy they see things that do not appear to them or any body else  he answers the people of these isles and particularly the seers are very temperate and their diet is simple and moderate in quantity and quality so that their brains are not in all probability disordered by undigested fumes of meat or drink both sexes are free from hysteric fits convulsions and several other distempers of that sort there are no madmen among them nor any instance of selfmurder it is observed among them that a man drunk never has a vision of the second sight and he that is a visionary would discover himself in other things as well as in that nor are such as have the second sight judged to be visionaries by any of their friends or acquaintaince  secondly it is objected that there are none among the learned able to oblige the world with a satisfactory account of these visions therefore they are not to be believed  he answers if every thing of which the learned are not able to give a satisfactory account shall be condemned as false and impossible we shall find many other things generally believed which must be rejected as such  thirdly it is objected that the seers are impostors and the people who believe them are credulous and easy to be imposed upon  he answers the seers are generally illiterate and wellmeaning people and altogether void of design nor could he ever learn that any of them made the least gain of it neither is it reputable among them to have that faculty beside the people of the isles are not so credulous as to believe an impossibility before the thing foretold be accomplished but when it actually comes to pass afterward it is not in their power to deny it without offering violence to their senses and reason beside if the seers were deceivers can it be reasonable to imagine that all the islanders who have not the second sight should combine together and offer violence to their understandings and senses to force themselves to believe a lie from age to age there are several persons among them whose birth and education raise them above the suspicion of concurring with an imposture merely to gratify an illiterate and contemptible sort of persons nor can a reasonable man believe that children horses and cows could be engaged in a combination to persuade the world of the reality of a second sight  every vision that is seen comes exactly to pass according to the rules of observation though novices and heedless persons do not always judge by those rules concerning which he gives instances  there are visions seen by several persons in whose days they are not accomplished and this is one of the reasons why some things have been seen that are said never to have come to pass and there are also several visions seen which are not understood till they are accomplished  the second sight is not a late discovery seen by one or two in a corner or a remote isle but it is seen by many persons of both sexes in several isles separated about forty or fifty leagues from one another the inhabitants of many of these isles never had the least converse by word or writing and this faculty of seeing visions having continued as we are informed by tradition ever since the plantation of these isles without being disproved by the nicest sceptick after the strictest inquiry seems to be a clear proof of its reality  it is observable that it was much more common twenty or thirty years ago than at present for one in ten does not see it now that saw it then  the second sight is not confined to the western isles alone the author having an account that it is in several parts of holland but particularly in bommel where a woman has it for which she is courted by some and dreaded by others she sees a smoke about ones face which is the forerunner of the death of a person so seen and she actually foretold the deaths of several that lived there she was living in that town a few winters ago  the second sight is likewise in the isle of man as appears by this instance captain leathes the chief commander of bellfast in his voyage    0 lost thirteen men by a violent storm and upon his landing in the isle of man an ancient man clerk to a parish there told him immediately that he had lost thirteen men there the captain enquired how he came to the knowledge of that he answered that it was by thirteen lights which he had seen come into the churchyard as mr sacheverel tells us in his late description of the isle of man note that this is like the sight of the corpsecandles in wales which is also well attested  here the author adds many other instances concerning the second sight of which i shall set down only a few  a man in knockow in the parish of st marys the northermost part of sky being in perfect health and sitting with his fellow servants at night was on a sudden taken ill dropped from his seat backward and then fell a vomiting at which the family was much concerned he having never been subject to the like before but he came to himself soon after and had no sort of pain about him one of the family who was accustomed to see the second sight told them that the mans illness proceeded from a very strange cause which was thus an illnatured woman whom he named who lives in the next adjacent village of bornskittag came before him in a very angry and furious manner her countenance full of passion and her mouth full of reproaches and threatened him with her head and hands till he fell over as you have seen him this woman had a fancy for the man but was like to be disappointed as to her marrying of him this instance was told the author by the master of the family and others who were present when it happened  sir norman macklead and some others playing at tables at a game called in irish falmermore wherein there are three of a side and each of them throw the dice by turns there happened to be one difficult point in the disposing of one of the tablemen this obliged the gamester to deliberate before he was to change his man since upon the disposing of it the winning or losing of the game depended at length the butler who stood behind advised the player where to place the man with which he complied and won the game this being thought extraordinary and sir norman hearing one whisper him in the ear asked who advised him so skilfully he answered it was the butler but this seemed more strange for it was generally thought he could not play at tables upon this sir norman asked him how long it was since he had learned to play and the fellow owned that he had never played in his life but that he saw the spirit brownie a spirit usually seen in that country reaching his arm over the players head and touching the part with his finger where the tableman was to be placed this was told the author by sir norman and others who happened to be present at the time  daniel bow alias black an inhabitant of bornskittag who is one of the precisest seers in the isles foretold the death of a young woman in minginis within less than twenty four hours before the time and accordingly she died suddenly in the fields though at the time of the prediction she was in perfect health but the shroud appearing close about her head was the ground of his confidence that her death was at hand  the same person foretold the death of a child in his masters arms by seeing a spark of fire fall on his left arm and this was likewise accomplished soon after the prediction  some of the inhabitants of harries sailing round the isle of sky with a design to go to the opposite mainland were strangely surprised with an apparition of two men hanging down by the ropes that secured the mast but could not conjecture what it meant they pursued their voyage but the wind turning contrary they were forced into broadford in the isle of sky where they found sir donald mackdonald keeping a sherriffs court and two criminals receiving sentence of death there the ropes and mast of that very boat were made use of to hang those criminals this was told the author by several who had this instance related to them by the boats crew  several persons living in a certain family told the author that they had frequently seen two men standing at a gentlewomans left hand who was their masters daughter they told the mens names and being her equals it was not doubted but she would be married to one of them and perhaps to the other after the death of the first sometime after a third man appeared who seemed always to stand nearest to her of the three but the seers did not know him though they could describe him exactly and within some months after this man who was seen last actually came to the house and fully answered the description given of him by those who never saw him but in a vision and he married the woman shortly after they live in the isle of sky and both themselves and others confirmed the truth of this instance when the author saw them  archibald mack donald of the parish of st marys in the isle of sky being reputed famous in his skill of foretelling things to come by the second sight happening to be in the village knockow one night and before supper told the family that he had just then seen the strangest thing he ever saw in his life viz a man with an ugly long cap always shaking his head but that the strangest of all was a little kind of an harp which he had with four strings only and that it had two hartshorns fixed in the front of it all that heard this odd vision fell a laughing at archibald telling him that he was dreaming or had not his wits about him since he pretended to see a thing which had no being and was not so much as heard of in any part of the world all this could not alter archibalds opinion who told them that they must excuse him if he laughed at them after the accomplishment of the vision archibald returned to his own house and within three or four days after a man with a cap harp etc came to the house and the harp strings horns and cap answered the description of them at first view and he shook his head when he played for he had two bells fixed to his cap this harper was a poor man who made himself a buffoon for his bread and was never seen before in those parts and at the time of the prediction he was in the isle of barray which is about twenty leagues distant from that part of sky this relation is vouched by mr daniel martin and all his family and such as were then present and they live in the village where this happened  one daniel nicholson minister of st marys in sky the parish in which mr archibald mac donald lived told the author that one sunday after sermon at the chapel uge he took an occasion to inquire of archibald if he still retained that unhappy faculty of seeing the second sight and wished him to get rid of it if possible for said he it is no true character of a good man archibald was highly displeased and answered that he hoped he was no more unhappy than his neighbors for seeing what they could not perceive i had said he as serious thoughts as my neighbors in time of hearing a sermon to day and even then i saw a corpse laid on the ground close to the pulpit and i assure you it will be accomplished shortly for it was in the daytime there were none in the parish then sick and few are buried at that little chapel nay sometimes not one in a year yet when mr nicholson returned to preach in the said chapel a fortnight or three weeks after he found one buried in the very spot named by archibald this story is vouched by mr nicholson the minister and several of the parishioners still living  note that it is counted by many an argument of somewhat evil attending this faculty of the second sight because there are instances given of some persons who have been freed of it upon using some christian practices but i shall hereafter show that this opinion cannot be entirely true  sir norman maclead who has his residence in the isle of bernera which lies between the isles of n vist and harries went to the isle of sky about business without appointing any time for his return his servants in his absence being all together in the large hall at night one of them who had the second sight told the rest they must remove for there would be abundance of other company in the hall that night one of his fellow servants answered that there was very little likelihood of that because of the darkness of the night and the danger of coming through the rocks that lie round the isle but within an hour after one of sir normans men came to the house bidding them provide lights etc for his master had newly landed  sir norman being told of this called for the seer and examined him about it he answered that he had seen the spirit brownie in humane shape come several times and make a show of carrying an old woman that sat by the fire to the door and at last seemed to carry her out by neck and heels which made him laugh heartily and gave occasion to the rest to conclude him mad to laugh so much without any reason this instance was told the author by sir norman himself  four men from the isle of sky and harries went to barbados and staid there some years who though they had wont to see the second sight in their native country never saw it in barbados but upon their return to england the first night after their landing they saw the second sight as the author was told by several of their acquaintaince  john morrison who lives in bernera of harries wears the plant called fuga daemonum sewed in the neck of his coat to prevent his seeing of visions and says he never saw any since he first carried that plant about him  a spirit by the country people called brownie was frequently seen in all the most considerable families in the isles and north of scotland in the shape of a tall man having very long brown hair but within these twenty years past he has been seen but rarely  there were spirits also that appeared in the shape of women horses swines cats and some like fiery balls which would follow men in the fields but there have been but few instances of these for upwards of forty years past  these spirits used also to form sounds in the air resembling those of an harp pipes crowing of a cock and of the grinding of handmills and sometimes voices have been heard in the air at night singing irish songs the words of which songs some of the authors acquaintances still retain one of them resembled the voice of a woman who died sometime before and the song related to her state in the other world all these accounts the author says he had from persons of as great integrity as any are in the world so far mr martin whose account is so long that i have given the reader only a short a bridgement thereof and shall therefore satisfy myself without relating any further passages by directing the reader to others also learned men who have written on the same subject laurentius ananias printed a volume in latin at venice anno      about the nature of demons where in the third book he writes concerning the second sight  the learned camerarius does the like and names a person of his own acquaintance whom he testifies to have had that gift st austin himself testifies something not very different from what we now call the gift of the second sight of one curina who lived in the country of hippo in africa  bonaysteau tells us something like it in his disc de excel and dig hominis concerning the spirit of hermotimus  so do likewise herodotus and maximus tyrius about the spirit of aristaeus  cardan does the same in his de rerum variet l   c    of his kinsman baptista cardan a student at pavia  baptista fulgosus tells us of what we call the second sight in other words in his l   fact and dict memorab c   among our own countrymen the lord henry howard in the book he writ against supposed prophecies in his seventeenth chapter tells us a wonderful story of this kind of sight and sure that noble lord may be looked upon as an unexceptionable testimony in a story he relates of his own knowledge he having otherwise little faith in things of this kind mr cotton mather a minister of new england in his relation of the wonders of the invisible world inserted in his ecclesiastical history of that country printed in london anno   0  in folio has given us several instances of this kind as also of many other diabolical operations mr baxters book concerning the certainty of the world of spirits has the like proofs in it mr aubrey fellow of the royal society has written largely concerning second sighted persons so has mr beaumont in his book of genii and familiar spirits who has collected almost all the other accounts together and many others whose very names it would be tedious to recite however as there are a few more passages very curious in themselves i will venture so far upon the readers patience as not only to recite the names of the authors but the accounts themselves in as succinct and brief a manner as it is possible for any one to do  mr th may in his history lib   writes that an old man like an hermit second sighted took his leave of king james i when he came into england he took little notice of prince henry but addressing himself to the duke of york since king charles i fell a weeping to think what misfortunes he should undergo and that he should be one of the most miserable and most unhappy princes that ever was  a scotch nobleman sent for one of these second sighted men out of the highlands to give his judgment of the then great george villiers duke of buckingham as soon as ever he saw him pish said he he will come to nothing i see a dagger in his breast and he was stabbed in the breast by captain felton as has been at large recounted in some of the foregoing pages  sir james melvin has several the like passages in his history  a certain old man in south wales told a great man there of the fortune of his family and that there should not be a third male generation it has fallen out accordingly  sir william dugdale with his own mouth informed several gentlemen that major general middleton since lord went into the highlands of scotland to endeavor to make a party for king charles i an old gentleman that was second sighted came and told him that his endeavor was good but he would be unsuccessful and moreover that they would put the king to death and that several other attempts would be made but all in vain but that his son would come in but not reign in a long time but would at last be restored this lord middleton had a great friendship with the lord bocconi and they made an agreement that the first of them that died should appear to the other in extremity the lord middleton was taken prisoner at worcester fight and was prisoner in the tower of london under three locks lying in his bed pensive bocconi appeared to him my lord middleton asked him if he were dead or alive he said dead and that he was a ghost and told him that within three days he should escape and he did so in his wifes clothes when he had done his message he gave a frisk and said givanni givanni it is very strange in the world to see so sudden a change and then gathered up and vanished this account sir william dugdale had from the bishop of edinburgh and this account he has writ in a book of miscellanies which is now reposited with other books of his in the musaeum at oxford  thus the reader sees what great authorities may be produced to prove that wonderful and true predictions have been delivered by many persons gifted with the second sight the most learned men in almost all nations who are not in all likelihood deceived themselves the most celebrated and authentic historians and some divines in england who it is not to be thought have combined together and made it their business to obtrude upon us falsehoods persons of all ranks from the highest to the lowest in scotland who it would be even madness to think would join in a confederacy to impose tricks upon us and to persuade us to the greatest of impostures as solemn truths delivered from their own mouths all these i say have unanimously and as it were with one voice asserted repeated and confirmed to us that there have been at all times and in many different nations and that still there are persons who possessed with the gift of a second sight predict things that wonderfully come to pass and seem to merit very little less than the name of prophets for their miraculous discoveries now if any man should come and without giving the least manner of reason for it for there is no reason to be given against such assertions declare his disbelief of all these authentic though strange accounts can he with reason imagine that his incredulity shall pass for a token of wisdom shall his obstinacy confute the learned shall his want of faith be thought justly to give the lie to so many persons of the highest honor and quality and of the most undoubted integrity in fine shall his infidelity by a reverse kind of power to that which is attributed to the philosophers stone be able to change the nature of things turn and transmute truth into falsehood and make a down right plain matter of fact to be no more than a chimera or an ens rationis and shall a manifest experience be so easily exploded  taking it therefore for granted that no modest man whatsoever though never so hard of belief which is certainly as great a weakness as that of too much credulity will make bold openly to declare his disbelief of things so well attested and taking it much more for granted still that it is impossible for any man of common sense to have the front of declaring his disbelief of them in such a manner as to urge it for an argument and a reason why others should disbelieve them too taking this i say as i think i very well may for granted i think there remains nothing further for me to offer before i conclude this chapter except a few remarks as to the similitude there is between those actions which i have related above to have been performed by mr campbell and these actions which so many learned ingenious and noble authors as i have just now quoted have asserted to have been performed by persons whom they knew to be gifted with the second sight  as to what is said several pages above concerning duncan campbell when a boy at edinburgh that he even told his little companions who would have success at their little matches when they played at marbles and that he informed a great gamester there whose name i have disguised under that of count cog what times he should choose to play if he would win as ludicrous as it may have appeared to be and as much as it may have seemed to my readers to carry with it nothing better than the face of invention and the air of fiction yet if they will be at the pains of comparing that passage of duncan campbells with the account given in this chapter from the mouth of sir norman maclead concerning a man who though he never played at tables in his life instructed a skilful gamester when he was at a stand to place one of his men right upon which the whole game depended which the ignorant fellow when asked how he came to do it said he was directed to by the spirit brownie whoever i say will be at the pains of comparing these passages together will find they bear a very near resemblance and that the way we may most reasonably account for duncan campbells prediction when he was a boy must be that he was at that time directed by his little genius or familiar spirit which i described in the precedent pages as this fellow was by the spirit brownie according to sir norman macleads assertion which spirit brownie as mr marten a very good and credited writer assures us in his history of the western islands dedicated to the late prince george of denmark is a spirit usually seen all over that country  if the reader recollects he will remember likewise that in the little discourse which i mentioned to have been held between me and this duncan campbell when a boy concerning his little genius i there say the boy signified to me that he smelt venison and was sure that some would come to his mothers house shortly after accordingly i came thither that morning from the death of a deer and ordered a part of it to be brought after me to her house now mr martens twelfth observation about the second sight in this chapter clears it plainly up that this knowledge in the boy proceeded from the gift of second sight not to give the reader too often the trouble of looking back in order to judge of the truth of what i say i will here repeat that observation which is as follows things are also foretold by smelling sometimes for example fish or flesh is frequently smelt in the fire when at the same time neither of the two are in the house or in any probability like to be had in it for some weeks or months this smell several persons have who are endued with the second sight and its always accomplished soon after  but i will here omit any further remarks by way of accounting how he compassed his predictions when a boy either by the intervention of his genius or the gift of a second sight and examine how nearly those things which i have related to have been done by him in his more advanced years when he took up the profession of a predictor in london correspond with the accounts given us in this chapter about a second sight and how near a resemblance the things done by him bear to those things that are so well attested to have been performed by others through the efficacious power of this wonderful faculty  first then if we have a mind to make a tolerable guess which way mr campbell came acquainted that the death of the beautiful young lady mrs wlwd was so near at hand and that though she was so universally admired she would die unmarried the accounts given of other second sighted persons in the like cases will put us in the most probable way of guessing right this is explained by the seventh observation in this chapter where it is said from mr marten that when a shroud is perceived about one it is a sure prognostic of death the time is judged according to the height of it about the person for if it be not seen above the middle death is not to be expected for the space of a year or longer but as it comes nearer to the head it is expected sooner if to the very head it is concluded to be at hand within a few days if not hours of this we have an example of which mr marten was an eyewitness concerning the death of his own acquaintance but he did not in the least regard it till the death of the person about the time foretold confirmed to him the certainty of the prediction  secondly as to the ignominious death that irwin came to and which he predicted to his mother so long before when she was in flourishing circumstances and when there was no appearance that any of her children should be brought to a beggarly condition and learn among base gangs of company to thieve and be carried to the gallows the story told in this chapter of some of the inhabitants of harries sailing round the isle of sky and seeing the apparition of two men hanging by the ropes on the mast of their vessel and when they came to the opposite mainland finding two criminals just sentenced to death by sir donald mac donald and seeing their own very mast and ropes made choice of for their execution clears up the manner how mr campbell might predict this of irwin likewise by the force of the second sight  thirdly as to mr campbells telling christallina the belle and chief toast of the court and urbana the reigning beauty of the city that they should shortly be married and who were to be their husbands it is a thing he has done almost every day in his life to one woman or other that comes to consult him about the man she is to be married to the manner he probably takes in doing this may be likewise explained by the foregoing story in this chapter about the servants who said they saw three men standing by the left hand of their masters daughter and that he that was nearest would marry her first whom they plainly and exactly described though they had never seen him but in their vision as appeared afterward for within some months after the very man described did come to the house and did marry her vide the eight observation of the second sight  fourthly as to the predictions delivered by mr campbell to the merchant which are set down at length in the foregoing chapter i know no better way at guessing the manner how the second sight operated in him at that time than by comparing them to these two instances which i briefly repeat because they are set down at length before in this chapter and first it may be asked how did the second sight operate in mr campbell when it gave him to know that the merchants ships which repeated intelligences had in appearance confirmed to be lost were at that time safe and would return securely home into the harbor designed the best way of accounting for it that i know is by the story that sir norman macklead is above affirmed to have told with his own mouth concerning a servant of his who rightly foretold his returning home and landing on the isle of berera one night where his residence is when there was very little or no likelihood of it because of the darkness of the night and the danger of coming through the rocks that lie round the isle when sir norman examined him about it he answered that he knew it by a vision of the spirit brownic and hence it may be the most probably conjectured that mr campbells knowledge of the merchants ships being safe came from a vision of his particular genius or familiar spirit which we spoke of before what i have already instanced in is i think sufficient with regard to the wonderful things which mr campbell has performed either by the intervention of a genius or the power of a second sight but as he has frequently done a great many amazing performances which seem to be of such a nature that they cannot be well and clearly explained to have been done either by the intervention of his familiar spirit and genius or by the power of the second sighted faculty we must have recourse to the third means by which only such predictions and practices can be compassed before we expound these new mysteries which appear like incredible riddles and aenigmas at the first and this third means which we must have recourse to for expounding these strange acts of his is a due consideration of the force and power of natural magic which together with a narrative of the acts which he seems magically to bring about will be the subject of the following chapter  chap viii but before we proceed to our disquisitions concerning the power and efficacy of natural magic and examine what mysterious operations may be brought about and compassed by magical practices and before we take a further survey of what mr campbell has performed in this kind that relates to his profession and the public part of his life which concerns other people as well as himself i shall here relate some singular adventures that he passed thoro in his private life and which regard only his own person in order to this i must return back to the year   0  about which time some unaccountable turns of fortune attended him in his own private capacity which must be very surprising and entertaining to my readers when they find a man whose foresight was always so great a help and assistance to others who consulted him in their own future affairs helpless as it has been an observation concerning all such men in the account of the second sight and blind in his own future affairs tossed up and down by inevitable and spightful accidents of fortune and made the may game of chance and hazard as if that wayward and inconstant goddess was resolved to punish him when she caught him on the blind side for having such a quick insight and penetrating faculty in other peoples matters and scrutinizing too narrowly into her mysteries and so sometimes preventing those fatal intentions of hers into which she would fain lead many mortals hoodwinked and before they knew where they were in this light these mighty and famous seers seem to be born for the benefit and felicity of others but at the same time to be born to unhappiness themselves and certainly in as much as we consider them as useful and beneficial often but always satisfactory to persons who are curious in their inquiries about their fortunes it will be natural to those of us who have the least share of generosity in our minds to yield our pity and compassion to them when they are remarkably unfortunate themselves especially when that calamity seems more particularly to light upon them for their ability and endeavor to consult the good fortune of other folks  about the abovementioned year   0  duncan campbel grew a little tired of his profession such a multitude of followers troubled him several of whom were wild youths and came to banter him and many more too inquisitive females to teaze him with endless impertinences and who the more he told them had still the more to ask and whose curiosity was never to be satisfied and besides this he was so much envied and had so many malicious artifices daily practiced against him that he resolved to leave off his profession he had i know followed it pretty closely from the time i first saw him in london which was i think in the beginning of the year school till the year   0  with very good success and in those few years he had got together a pretty round sum of money our young seer was now at mans estate and had learned the notion that he was to be his own governor so far as to be his own counselor too in what road of life he was to take and this consideration no doubt worked with a deeper impression on his mind than it usually does on others that are in the same blossoming pride of manhood because it might appear more natural for him to believe that he had a sufficient ability to be his own proper adviser who had given so many others and some more aged than himself counsel with very good success now every experienced person knows that when manhood is yet green it is still in the same dangerous condition as a young plant which is liable to be warped by a thousand cross fortuitous accidents if good measures be not taken to support it against all the contingent shocks it may meet with from the weather or otherwise now it was his misfortune to be made averse to business which he loved before by having too much of it and to be so soured by meeting with numerous perplexities and malicious rubs laid in his way by invidious people who are the useless and injurious busybodies that always repine at the good of others and rejoice to do harm to the diligent and assiduous though they reap no profit by it themselves that he was disgusted and deterred entirely from the prosecution of a profession by which he got not only a competent but a copious and plentiful subsistence nay indeed this was another mischief arising to him from his having so much business that he had got money enough to leave it off when the perplexities of it had made him willing to do so and to live very comfortably and handsomely like a gentleman without it for a time and we know the youngest men are not wont to look the farthest before them in matters that concern their own welfare now inasmuch as he had thus taken a disgust to business and application and was surfeited as i may say with the perplexities of it it must be as natural for him we know to search for repose in the contrary extreme viz recreation and idleness as it is for a man to seek rest after toil to sleep after a days labor or to sit down after a long and tiresome walk but there are two very distinct sorts of idleness and two very different kinds of recreation there is a shameful idleness which is no better than downright sloth and there is a splendid kind of indolence where a man having taken an aversion to the wearisomeness of a business which properly belongs to him neglects not however to employ his thoughts when they are vacant from what they ought more chiefly to be about in other matters not entirely unprofitable in life the exercise of which he finds he can follow with more abundant ease and satisfaction there are some sorts of recreations too that are mean fordid and base others that are very innocent though very diverting and that will give one the very next most valuable qualifications of a gentleman after those which are obtained by a more serious application of the mind the idea which i have already given my readers of our duncan campbell will easily make them judge before i tell them which way in these two ways his genius would naturally lead him and that when he grew an idle man he would rather indulge himself with applying his mind to the shining trifles of life than be wholly slothful and unactive and that when he diverted himself he would not do it after a fordid base manner as having a better taste and a relish for good company but that his recreations would still be the recreations of a gentleman and just accordingly as my readers would naturally judge beforehand in his case so it really happened the moment he shook of business and dismissed the thoughts of it his genius led him to a very gallant way of life in his lodgings in his entertainments in paying and receiving visits in coffeehouses in taverns in fencing schools in balls and other public assemblies in all ways in fine both at home and abroad duncan campbell was a well comported and civil fine gentleman he was a man of pleasure and nothing of the man of business appeared about him but a gentlemans life without a gentlemans estate however shining and pleasant it may be for a time will certainly end in sorrow if not in infamy and comparing life as moralists do to a day one may safely pronounce this truth to all the splendid idlers i have mentioned that if they have sunshiny weather till noon yet the afternoon of their life will be very stormy rainy and uncomfortable and perhaps just at the end of their journey to carry on the metaphor throughout close in the darkest kind of night of this as i was a man of years and more experienced in the world than he i took upon me to forewarn mr campbell as soon as i perceived the first dangerous fit of this elegant idleness had seized him but when will young men by so much the more headstrong as they have less of the beard be guided and brought to learn and when shall we see that happy age in which the gray heads of old men shall be clapped upon the shoulders of youth i told him that in this one thing he ought to consult me and acknowledge me to be a true prophet if i told him the end of the seeming merry steps in life he was now taking would infallibly bring him to a labyrinth of difficulties out of which if he extricated himself at all he would at least find it a laborious piece of work his taste had been already vitiated with the sweets which lay at the top of the bitter draught of fortune and my honest rugged counsel came too late to prevail when his fancy had decoyed and debauched his judgment and carried it over into another interest i remember i writ down to him the moral story where vicious pleasure and virtue are pictured by the philosopher to appear before hercules to court him into two several paths i told him more particularly since he had not an estate to go th with the gentlemanly life as he called it that if he followed the alluring pleasures which endeavored to tempt hercules he would involve himself at last in a whole heap of miseries out of which it would be more than an herculean labor for him to disentangle himself again if he had been a man that could have ever heard with either i would have told the reader in a very familiar idiom that he turned the deaf ear to me for he did not mind one syllable nor tittle of the prescriptions i set down for him no more than if he had never read them but varying the phrase a little i may say at least when he should have looked upon my counsel with all the eyes he had he turned the blind side upon it i was resolved to make use of the revenge natural to a man of years and therefore applied that reproachful proverb to him which we ancients delight much in making use of to youths that follow their own false and hot imaginations and will not heed the cooler dictates of age experience and wisdom accordingly i wrote down to him these words and left him in a seeming passion i am very well assured young man you think me that am old to be a fool but i that am old absolutely know you who are a young fellow to be a downright fool and so i leave you to follow your own ways till sad and woeful experience teaches you to know it your ownself and makes you come to me to own it of your own accord as i was going away after this tart admonition and severe reprimand i had a mind to observe his countenance and i saw him smile which i rightly construed to be done in contempt of the advice of age and in the gaiety and fullness of conceit which youth entertains of its own fond opinions and hairbrained rash resolves he was got into the company of a very pretty set of gentlemen whose fortunes were far superior to his but he followed the same genteel exercises as fencing etc and made one at all their public entertainments and so being at an equal expense with those who could well afford to spend what they did out of their estates he went on very pleasantly for a time still spending and never getting without ever considering that it must by inevitable consequence fall to his lot at last to be entirely reduced to a state of indigence and want and what commonly heightens the misfortune of such men and so of all gentlemens younger brothers who live upon the ready money that is given them for their portions is that the prosperity they live in for a time gains them credit enough just to bring them in debt and render them more miserable than those very wratches who never had either any money or credit at all they run themselves into debt out of shame and to put off the evil day of appearing ruined men as long as they can and then when their tempers are souerd by adversity they grow tired of their own lives and then in a quarrel they or some other gentleman may be is run thorough or else being hunted by bailiffs they exercise their swords upon those pursuers thus where gentlemen will not consider their circumstances their very prosperity is a cause of and aggravates their misery their very pride which was a decent pride at first in keeping up and maintaining their credit subjects them too often to the lowest and the meanest acts and their courage which was of a laudable kind turns into a brutish and savage rage and all the fine esteemed flourishing and happy gentleman ends and is lost in the contemned poor and miserable desperado whose portion at last is confinement and a goal and sometimes even worse and what i shall not so much as name here into many of these calamities mr campbell had brought himself before it was long by his heedlesness and running according to the wild dictates of youth counter to all sound and wholesome advice he had it seems run himself into debt and one day as he was at a coffeehouse the sign of the three crowns in great queen street in rushed four bailiffs upon him who being directed by the creditors wife had watched him into that house and told him they had a warrant against him and upon his not answering they being unacquainted with his being deaf and dumb offered to seize his sword he startled at their offering of violence and taking them for russians which he had often met with repelled the assaulters and drawing his sword as one man more bold than the rest closed in with him he shortened his blade and in the fall pinned the fellow through the shoulder and himself through the leg to the floor after that he stood at bay with all the four officers when the most mischievous assailant of them all the creditors wife  to step into the fray and very barborously took hold of that nameless part of the man for which as she was a married woman nature methinks should have taught her to have a greater tenderness and almost squeezed and crushed those vitals to death but at last he got free from them all and was going away as fast as he could not knowing what consequences might ensue but the woman who aimed herself at committing murder in the most savage and inhuman manner ran out after him crying out murder murder as loud as she could and alarmed the whole street the bayliffs following the woman and being bloody from head to foot by means of the wound he received gave credit to the outcry the late earl riverss footmen happening to be at the door ran immediately to stop the supposed murderer and they indeed did take him at last but perceived their mistake and discovered that instead of being assistants in taking a man whom they thought to be a murderer endeavoring to make his escape from the hands of justice they had only been tricked in by that false cry to be adjutants to a bailiff in retaking a gentleman who by so gallant a defense had rescued himself from the dangers of a prison and when they had discovered this their mistake they were mighty sorry for what they had done the most active and busy among the earls footmen was a dutch man and the earl happening to be in a room next the street and hearing the outcry of murder stepped to the window and seeing his own servants in the midst of the bustle examined the dutch man how the matter was and being told it he chid the man for being concerned in stopping a gentleman that was getting free from such troublesome companions but the dutch man excused himself like a dutch man by making a very merry blunder for a reply sacrament said he to his lord if i had thought they were bailiffs i would have fought for the poor dumb gentleman but then why had not he told me they were bailiffs my lord  in short duncan campbell was carried off as their prisoner but the bailiff that was wounded was led back to the coffee house where he pretended the wound was mortal and that he despaired of living an hour the proverb however was of the fellows side and he recovered sooner than other people expected he could as soon as all danger was over an action for damages and smart money as their term is was brought against mr campbell the damages were exaggerated and the demand was so extravagant that duncan campbell was neither able just at that time nor willing had he been able to pay so much as he thought in his own wrong and having no bail and being ashamed to make his case known to his better sort of friends who were both able and willing to help him at a dead list he was hurried away to goal by the bailiffs who showed such a malignant and insolent pleasure as commonly attends powerful revenge when they put him into the marshalsea there he lay in confinement six weeks till at last four or five of his chief friends came by mere chance to hear of it immediately they consulted about his deliverance and unanimously resolved to contribute for his enlargement and they accordingly went cross the water together and procured it out of hand  two of his benefactors were officers and were just then going over to flanders duncan campbell to whom they communicated their design was resolved to try his fortune in a military way out of a roving kind of humor raised in him partly by his having taken a sort of aversion to his own profession in town and partly by his finding that he could not live without following a profession as he had done any longer he over a bottle frankly imparted his mind to them at large he signified to them that he hoped since they had lately done him so great a favor in freeing him from one captivity they would not think him too urgent if he pressed for one favor further upon natures so generous as theirs by whom he took as great a pleasure in being obliged as he could receive in being capable of obliging others he wrote to them that the favor he meant was to redeem him from another captivity almost as irksome to him as that out of which they had lately ransomed him this captivity continued he is being either forced to follow my old profession which i have taken an entire disgust to for a maintenance or being forced to live in a narrower way than suits with my genius and the better taste i have of higher life such a state gentlemen you know is more unpalatable than halfpay it is like either being forced to go upon the forlorn hope or else like a mans being an entirely cashiered and broken officer that had no younger brothers fortune and no other support but his commission thus though you have set my body at liberty my soul is still under an imprisonment and will be till i leave england and can find means of visiting flanders which i can do no otherwise than by the advantage of having you for my convoy i have a mighty longing to experience some part of a military life and i fancy if you will grant me your interest and introduce me to the valiant young lord lorne and be spokesmen for a dumb man i shall meet with a favorable reception and as for you gentlemen after having named that great patron and pattern of courage and conduct in the field i cannot doubt but the very name i bear if you had not known me would have made you taken me for a person of a military genius and that i should do nothing but what would become a british soldier and a gentleman nothing in fine that should make you repent the recommendation  these generous and gallant friends of his it seems complied with his request and promised they would make application for him to the lord lorne and duncan campbell had nothing to do but to get his bag and baggage ready and provide himself with a pass his baggage was not very long a getting together and he had it in tolerable good order and as for his pass a brother of the lord forbes was so kind as to procure him one upon the first application duncan made to him  accordingly in a few days afterward they went on board and having a speedy and an easy passage arrived soon at rotterdam duncan met with some of his english acquaintance in that town and his mind being pretty much bent upon rambling and seeing all the curiosities customs and humors he could in all the foreign places he was to pass thorough he went out of a frolic with some gentlemen next day in a boat to an adjacent village to make merry over a homely dutch entertainment the intended repast being to consist of what the boors there count a great delicacy brown bread and white beer he walked out of sight from his company and they lost one another and stroling about by himself at an unseasonable hour as they call it there after the bell has tolled duncan campbell who neither knew their laws nor if he had was capable of being guided by the notice which their laws ordain was taken into custody in the village for that night and carried away the next day to williamstadt where he was taken for a spy and put into a close imprisonment for three or four days  but some scotch gentlemen who had been in company with mr campbell at mr cloystermans a painter in covent garden made their application to the magistrate and got him releassd he knew his friends the officers that carried him over were gone forward to the camp and that there was no hope of finding them at rotterdam if he should go thither and so he resolved since he had had so many days punishment in williamstadt to have three or four days pleasure there too by way of amends before he would set out on his journey after his friends but on the third night he got very much in drink and as he went very boisterously and disorderly along a sentry challenged him and the want of the sense of hearing had like to have occasioned the loss of his life the sentry fired at him and narrowly missed him he was taken prisoner not without some resistance which was so far innocent as that he knew not any reason why he should be feized but very troublesome and unwarrantable in so orderly a town so the governors secretary after the matter was examined into judging it better for the unhappy gentlemans future safety advised him to return home to his own country and accordingly bespoke him a place in a dutch ship called yowfrow catherine for his passage to england  duncan campbell had taken up this humor of rambling first of his own accord and the troubles which he had run himself into by it we may reasonably suppose had pretty well cured him of that extravagant itch and there is little doubt to be made but that he rejoiced very heartily when he was got on board the ship to return to england and that in his new resolutions he had reconciled himself to the prosecution of his former profession and intended to set up for a predictor again as soon as he could arrive at london but now fortune had not a mind to let him go off so he had had his own fancy for rambling and now she was resolved to have hers and to give him his bellyful of caprice accordingly when the dutch ship called yowfrow catherine was making the best of her road for london and each person in the vessel was making merry filled with the hopes of a quick and prosperous passage a french privateer appeared in sight crouding all the sails she could and bearing toward them with all haste and diligence the privateer was doublemannd and carried thirty guns the dutch vessel was defenseless in comparison and the people on board had scarce time to think and to deplore that they should be made a prey of before they actually were so and had reason enough given them for their sorrow all the passengers to a single man were stripped and had french seamens jackets in exchange for their clothes duncan campbell had now a taste given him of the fate of war as well as of the humor of traveling and wished himself again i warrant him among his greatest crowd of consulters as tiresome as he thought business to be instead of being in the middle of a crew of seasavages the town where the dumbprisoner was at last confined was denain there happened to be some english friars there who were told by the others who he was and to them he applied himself in writing and received from them a great deal of civil treatment but a certain man of the order of recollects happening to see him there who had known him in england and what profession he followed caused him to be called to question as a man that made use of ill means to tell fortunes when he was questioned by a whole society of these religious men he made them such pertinent and satisfactory answers in writing that he convinced them he had done nothing for which he deserved their reprimand and they unanimously acquitted him the heads of his defense as i have been informed were these  first he alleged that the second sight was inborn and inbred in some men and that every country had had examples of it more or less but that the country of scotland in which he was educated from an infant abounded the most of any with those sort of people and from thence he said he thought he might very naturally draw this conclusion that a faculty that was inborn and inbred to men and grown almost a national faculty among a people who were remarkably honest upright and wellmeaning people could not without some impiety be imputed to the possessors of it as a sin and when one of the fathers rejoined that it was remarked by several writers of the second sight that it must be therefore sinful because it remained no longer among the people when the doctrines of christianity were fully propagated and the light of the gospel increased among them and that afterward it affected none but persons of vicious lives and an ill character to this objection mr campbell replied that he knew most even ingenious writers had made that remark concerning the second sight but begged leave to be excused if he ventured to declare that it was no better than a vulgar and common error and the reasons were these which he alleged in his own behalf and to confirm his assertion he told them men of undoubted probity virtue and learning both of their own religion  viz the roman catholic and also of the reformed religion and in several nations had been affected and continued all their lives to be affected with this second sighted power and that there could be therefore no room to fix upon it the odious character of being a sinful and vicious not to say that some called it still worse a diabolical talent he said he would content himself with making but two instances because he believed those two would be enough to give content to them his judges too in that case in his first instance he told them that they might find somewhat relating to this in nicolaus hemingius who in his tracts de superstitionibus magicis printed at copenhagen anno      informs the world that petrus palladius a bishop of seelandt and professor of divinity at copenhagen could from a part of his body affected foretell from what part of the heavens tempests would come and was seldom deceived one of the fathers immediately asked him if he understood latin  to this duncan campbell replied no oh said the friar then i dont remember that book was ever translated into english that you mention  but rejoined duncan campbell the passage i mentioned to you i have read in an english book and word for word according to the best of my memory as i have written it down to you  in what english book said the friar  i dont remember the name of the book duncan campbell answered but very well remember the passages and that it was in a book of authority and which bore a credit and good repute in the world and you being scholars may if you please have recourse to the learned original and i doubt not but you will find what i say to be a truth  for the second instance he told them that in spain there are those they call saludadores that have this kind of gift there was continued he in writing one of your own religion venerable fathers and of a religious order nay a friar too that had this gift he was a noted dominican said he and though i forget his name you may by writing a letter to england learn his name he was a devout portuguese belonging to queen catherine dowagers chapel and had the second sight to a great degree and was famous and eminent for it they then asked him what was the full power he had to do by the second sight he answered that as they had intimated that they had perused some of the skilful writers concerning the second sight he did not doubt but they had found as well as he could tell them that as to the extent of peoples knowledge in that secret way it reached both present past and future events they foresee murders drownings weddings burials combats manslaughters etc of all which there are many instances to be given they commonly foresee sad events a little while before they happen for instance if a mans fatal end be hanging they will see a gibbet or rope about his neck if beheading they will see a man without a head if drowning they will see water up to his throat if stabbing they will see a dagger in his breast if unexpected death in his bed they will see a winding sheet about his head they foretell not only marriages but of good children what kind of life men shall lead and in what condition they shall die also riches honors preferments peace plenty and good weather it is likewise usual with persons that have lost any thing to go to some of these men by whom they are directed how with what persons and in what place they shall find their goods it is also to be noted that these gifts bear a latitude so that some have it in a far more eminent degree than others and what i have here written down to you you need not take as a truth from me but as it concerned me so nearly i remember the passage by heart and you will find it very near word for word in dr beaumonts book of familiar spirits ay said the friars but you have a genius too that attends you as we are informed so replied duncan campbell have all persons that have the second sight in any eminent degree and to prove this i will bring no less a witness than king james who in his demonology book the third and chapter the second mentions also a spirit called brownie that was wont formerly to haunt diverse houses without doing any evil but doing as it were necessary turns up and down the house he appeared like a rough man nay some believed that their house was all the sonsier as they called it that is the more lucky or fortunate that such spirits resorted there with these replies the friars began to own they were very well satisfied and acquiesed in the account he had given of himself as a very good true and honest account but they told him they had still a further accusation against him and that was that he practiced magic arts and that he used as they had been informed unlawful incantations to this he made answer that there were two kinds of magic of which he knew they that were men of learning could not be ignorant the art magic which is wicked and impious continued he is that which is professed and has been professed at all times in the world by witches magicians diviners inchanters and such like notorious profligates who by having an unnatural commerce with the devil do many strange prodigious and preternatural acts above and beyond all humane wisdom and all the arguments i ever did or ever will deduce continued he from that black art is a good and a shining argument it is this o fathers i draw a reason from these prodigious practices of wizards magicians inchanters etc and from all the heathen idolatry and superstition to prove that there is a deity for from these acts of theirs being preternatural and above humane wisdom we may consequently infer that they proceed from a supernatural and immaterial cause such as demons are and this is all the knowledge i ever did or ever will draw from that black hellish art but fathers there is another kind of art magic called natural magic which is directly opposite to theirs and the object of which art is to do spiritual good to mankind as the object of theirs is to torment them and induce them to evil they afflict people with torments and my art relieves them from the torments they cause the public profession of these magical arts has as you know fathers it is a common distinction between black and white magic been tolerated in some of the most famous universities of christendom though afterward for a very good reason in politics making it a public study to such a degree was very wisely retrenched by a prohibition if this therefore be a fault in your own opinions hear my accusers but if not you will not only excuse but commend me  the friars were extremely well pleased with his defense but one of them had a mind to frighten him a little if he could and asked him what he would say if he could produce some witches lately seized that would swear he had been frequently at their unlawful assemblies where they were making their waxen images and other odd mischievous inventions in black magic to torment folks what if i can produce such evidence against you wrote the father to him by way of strengthening the question will you not own that we have convicted you then and when he had wrote the note he gave it duncan campbell with a look that seemed to express his warmth and earnestness in the expostulation duncan campbell took the paper and read it and far from being startled returned this answer with a smile continuing in his face while he wrote it no said he fathers by your leave they will only prove me a good magician by that oath and themselves more plainly witches they will prove their love to torment good folks and only show their hatred to me an innocent man but wise enough to torment em by hindering em from tormenting others the fathers were well pleased with the shrewdness of the answer but duncan campbell had a mind to exert his genius a little farther with the good friar who thought likewise he had put him a very shrewd question so taking up another sheet of paper fathers said he shall i entertain you with a story of what passed upon this head between two religious fathers as you all of you are and a prince of germany in which you will find that mine ought to be reputed a full answer to the question the last learned father was pleased to propose to me the story is somewhat long but very much to the purpose and entertaining i remember it perfectly by heart and if you will have patience while i am writing it i dont doubt but that i shall not only satisfy you but please you and oblige you with the relation the author i found it in quotes it from fromannus i think the mans name was so and i am sure my author calls him a very learned man in his third book of magical incantation and though i dont understand the language the original is writ in yet i date venture to say upon the credit of my english author from whom i got the story by heart that you will find me right when ever you shall be pleased to search  the friars were earnest for the story and expressed a desire that he would write it down for them to read which he did in the following words nte that i have since compared mr duncan campbell s manuscript with the authors page out of which he took it and find it word for word the same which shows how incomparable a memory this deaf and dumb gentleman has got besides his other extraordinary qualifications the story is this  a prince of germany invited two religious fathers of eminent virtue and learning to a dinner the prince at table said to one of them father think you we do right in hanging persons who are accused by ten or twelve witches to have appeared at their meetings or sabbaths i somewhat fear we are imposed on by the devil and that it is not a sofe way to truth that we walk in by these accusations especially since many great and learned men every where begin to cry out against it and to charge our consciences with it tell me therefore your opinion to whom the fathers being somewhat of an eager spirit said what should make us doubtful in this case or what should touch our consciences being convicted by so many testimonies can we make it a scruple whether god will permit innocent persons should be so traduced there is no cause for a judge to stick at such a number of accusations but he may proceed with safety to which when the prince had replied and much had been said pro and con on both sides about it and the father seemed wholly to carry the point the prince at length concluded the dispute saying i am sorry for you father that in a capital cause you have condemned yourself and you cannot complain if i commit you to custody for no less than fifteen witches have deposed that they have seen you ay start not you your own self at their meetings and to show you that i am not in jest i will presently cause the public acts to be brought for you to read them the father stood in a maze and with a dejected countenance had nothing here to oppose but confusion and silence for all his learned eloquence  as soon as mr campbell had wrote down the story the fathers perused it and seemed mightily entertained with it it put an end to all further questions and the man whom they had been trying for a conjurer they joined in desiring upon distinct pieces of paper under their several hands to come frequently and visit them as being not only a harmless and innocent but an extraordinary wellmeaning good and diverting companion they treated him for sometime afterward during his stay with the friendship due to a countryman with the civility that is owing to a gentleman and with the assisiance and support which beloagd to a person of merit in distress money they had none themselves it seems to give him being menditants by their own prosession but they had interest enough to get him quite free from being prisoner he participated of their elemosinary table had a cell allowed him among them in what they call their dormitory he had an odd coat and a pair of trowzers made out of some of their brown coarse habits by the poor unfashionable tailor or botcher belonging to the convent and at last they found means of recommending him to a master of a french vessel that was ready to set sail to give him a cast over the channel to england and to provide him with the necessaries of life till he got to the port this french vessel was luckier than the dutch one had been before to our dumb gentleman it had a quick and prosperous passage and arrived at portsmouth and as soon as he landed there he having experienced the misfortunes and casualties that a man in his condition wanting both speech and hearing was liable to in places where he was an utter stranger to every body resolved to make no stay but move on as fast as he could toward london when he came to hampton town considering the indifferent figure he made in those odd kind of clothes which the poor friars had equipped him with and that his long beard and an uncombd wigg added much to the disguise he was resolved to put on the best face he could in those awkward circumstances and stepped into the first barbers shop he came at to be trimmed and get his wigg combed and powdered this proved a very lucky thought to him for as soon as he stepped into the first barbers shop who should prove to be the master of it but one tobit yeats who had served him in the same capacity at london and was but newly set up in the trade of a barbersurgeon at hampton town and followed likewise the profession of schoolmaster this tobit yeates had shaved him quite before he knew him in that disguise and mr campbell though he knew him presently had a mind to try if he should be known himself first at length the barber finding him to be a dumb man by his ordering every thing with motions of the hand and gestures of the body looked at him very earnestly remembered him and in a great surprise called for pen ink and paper and begged to know how he came to be in that disguise whether he was under any misfortune and apprehension of being discovered that made him go in so poor and so clownish a habit and tendered him any services as far as his little capacity would reach and desired him to be free and command him if he was able to assist him in any thing these were the most comfortable words that duncan campbell had read a great while he took the pen and paper in his turn related to him his whole story gave the poor barber thanks for his good natured offer and said he would make so much use of it as to be indebted to him for so much money as would pay the stage coach and bear him in his traveling expenses up to london from whence he would speedily return the favor with interest the poor honest fellow out of gratitude to a master whose liberality he had formerly experienced immediately furnished mr duncan campbell with that little supply expressing the gladness of his heart that it lay in his power and the stage coach being to set out within but a few hours he ran instantly to the inn to see if he could get him a place by good luck there was room and but just room for one more which pleased duncan campbell mightily when he was acquainted with it by his true and trusty servant the barber for he was as impatient to see london again it seems as he had been before to quit it well he had his wish and when he came to london he had one wish more for fortune to bestow upon him which appeared to begin to grow kind again after her fickle fit of cruelty was over and this wish was that he might find his former lodgings empty and live in the same house as he did when he followed his prosession this too succeeded according to his desire and he was happily fixed once more to his hearts content in his old residence with the same people of the house round about him who bore him all that respect and affection and showed all that readiness and willingness to serve him on every occasion and at every turn which could be expected from persons that let lodgings in town to a gentleman whom they esteemed the best tenant they ever had in their lives or ever could have  immediately the tidings of the dumb gentlemans being returned home from beyond sea spread throughout all the neighborhood and it was noised about from one neighborhood to another till it went through all ranks and conditions and was known as well in a day or twos time all the town over as if he had been some great man belonging to the state and his arrival had been notified to the public in the gazette as a person of the last importance and such a person he appeared indeed to be taken for especially among the fair sex who thronged to his doors crowd after crowd to consult with him about their future occurrences in life  these curious tribes of people were as various in their persons sex age quality profession art trade as they were in the curiosity of their minds and the questions they had intended to propound to this dumb predictor of strange events that lay yet as embrios in the womb of time and were not to come some of them to a maturity for birth for very many years after just as porcelain clay is stored up in the earth by good artificers which their heirs make china of half a century and sometimes more than an age afterward  these shoals of customers who were to fee him well for his advice as we may suppose now he stood in need of raising a fresh stock were unquestionably as welcome and acceptable to him as they appeared too troublesome to him before when he was in a state of more wealth and plenty  fortune that does nothing moderately seemed now resolved as she had been extremely cruel before to be extremely kind to him he had nothing to do from early in the morning till late at night but to read questions and resolve them as fast as much frequented doctors write their prescriptions and recipes and like them also to receive fees as fast fortune was indeed mightily indulgent to the wants she had so suddenly reduced him to and relieved him as suddenly by these knots of curiosos who brought him a glut of money but one single fair lady that was one of his very first consulters after his return and who had received satisfactory answers from him in other points before he went abroad proved so good fortune would have it worth all the rest of his customers together as numerous as they were and as i have accordingly represented them  this lady was the relict or widow of a gentleman of a good estate and of a very good family whose name was digby and a handsome jointure she had out of the estate this lady it seems having been with him in former days and seen him in a more shining way of life for he had taken a humor to appear before all his company in that coarse odd dress made out of the fryers habit and would not be persuaded by the people of the house to put on a nightgown till he could provide himself with a new suit was so curious among other questions as to ask him whether he had met with any misfortunes and how he came to be in so slovenly and wretched a habit here mr campbell related the whole story of his travels to her and the crosses and disappointments he had met with abroad the tears he observed would start every now and then into her eyes when she came to any doleful passage and she appeared to have a mighty compassionate kind of feeling when she read of any hardship more than ordinarily melancholy that had befallen him mr campbell it is certain had then a very good presence and was a handsome and portly young man and as a great many young gentlemen derive the seeming agreeableness of their persons from the tailor and perruquemaker the shoemaker and hosier so mr campbells person on the other hand gave a good air and a good look to the awkward garb he had on and i believe it was from seeing him in this odd trim as they call it the ladies first took up the humor of calling him the handsome sloven add to this that he looked his misfortune in the face with a jolly countenance and smiled even while he was penning the relation of his calamities all which are certainly circumstances that first sooth a generous mind into a state of compassion and afterward heighten it in the breast wherein it is conceived hence it came that this pretty and good natured widow mrs digby when she had expressed her commiseration of him by her looks began to take the pen and express it in very tender terms neither did she think that expression in words a sufficient testimony of the compassion she bore to him the generosity of her mind did lead her to express it in a more substantial manner still and that was to show it plainly by a very benevolous action she laid a purse of twenty guineas before the table and at the same time smiling pointed to the table as signifying her desire that he would accept it and running to the door dropped a curtesy and skuttled away and by the same civil act as she obliged him she put it out of his power to refuse being so obliged so that though the present was very handsome the manner of giving it was still handsomer if being a handsome young man of merit in distress and bearing his misfortunes with an equal mind are powerful motives to excite compassion in the mind of a generous lady so the generosity of a young agreeable widow expressed in so kind and so benevolous a way to a young gentleman when he had been tasting nothing but the bitter draughts of fortune before must stir up an affection in a mind that had any sense of gratitude and truly just such was the effect that this ladys civility had upon mr duncan campbell he conceived from that moment a very great affection for her and resolved to try whether he could gain her which he had no small grounds to hope from the esteem which she appeared to bear toward him already i remember mr dryden makes a very beautiful observation of the near alliance there is between the two passions of pity and love in a womans breast in one of his plays his words are these for pity still foreruns approaching love as lightning does the thunder mr bruyere a most ingenious member of the french academy has made another remark which comes home to our present purpose he says that many women love their money better than their friends but yet value their lovers more than their money according to the two reflections of these fine writers upon the tempers of the fair mr campbell had hopes enough to ground his courtship upon and it appeared so in the end by his proving successful she from being a very liberal and friendly client became at last a most affectionate wife he then began to be a housekeeper and accordingly took a little neat one and very commodious for his profession in monmouth court here i must take leave to make this observation that if mr campbell inherited the talents of his secondsighted mother he seemed likewise to be an heir to his father mr archibald campbell both in his strange and accidental sufferings by sea and likewise in his being relieved from them after as accidental and strange a manner by an unexpected marriage just like his fathers and here we return again to take a new survey of him in the course of his public practice as a predictor the accounts i shall give of his actions here will be very various in their nature from any i have yet presented to the reader they are more mysterious in themselves and yet i shall endeavor to make the manner of his operating in this kind as plain as i think i have the foregoing ones and then i flatter my self they must afford a fresh entertainment for every reader that has any curiosity and a good taste for things of so extraordinary a kind for what i have all along propounded to myself from the beginning and in the progress to the end of this history is to interweave entertaining and surprising narratives of what mr campbell has done with curious and instructive enquiries into the nature of those actions for which he has rendered himself so singularly famous it was not therefore suitable to my purpose to clog the reader with numerous adventures almost all of the same kind but out of a vast number of them to single some few of those that were most remarkable and that were mysteries but mysteries of very different sorts i leave that method of swelling distorted and commented trifles into volumes to the writers of fable and romance if i was to tell his adventures with regard for example to women that came to consult him i might perhaps have not only written the stories of eleven thousand virgins that died maids but have had relations to give of as many married women and widows and the work would have been endless all that i shall do therefore is to pick out one particular each of a different kind that there may be variety in the entertainment upon application to this dumb man one is told in the middle of her health that she shall die at such a time another that she shall sicken and upon the moment of her recovery have a suitor and a husband a third who is a celebrated beauty with a multitude of admirers round about her that she shall never become a wife a fourth that is married when she shall get rid of an uneasy husband a fifth that has lost her goods who stole them where and when they shall be restored a sixth that is a merchant when he shall be undone and how and when he shall recover his losses and be as great on the exchange as ever a seventh that is a gamester which will be his winning and which his losing hour an eighth how he shall be involved in a lawsuit and whether the suit will have an adverse or a prosperous issue a ninth that is a woman with choice of lovers which she shall be most happy with for life and so on to many others where every prediction is perfectly new and surprising and differs from the other in almost every circumstance when a man has so extensive a genius as this at foretelling the future occurrences of life one narrative of a sort is enough in conscience to present the reader with and several of each kind would not methinks be entertaining but tiresome for he that can do one thing in these kinds by the power of prediction can do ten thousand and those who are obstinate in extenuating his talents and calling his capacity in question and that will not be convinced by one instance of his judgment would not own the conviction if ten thousand instances were given them the best passages i can recommend to their perusal are those where persons who came purposely to banter him under the color of consulting him and covered over their sly intentions with borrowed disguises and came in masquerades found all the jest turned upon themselves in the end which they meant to our famous predictor and had the discouragement of seeing their most concealed and deepest laid plots discovered and all their most witty fetches and wily contrivances defeated till they were compelled universally to acknowledge that endeavoring to impose upon the judgment of our seer by any hidden artifice and cunning whatsoever was effectually imposing upon their own his unusual talent in this kind was so openly known and so generally confessed that his knowledge was celebrated in some of the most witty weekly papers that ever appeared in public isaac bickerstaff who diverted all the beaumond for a long space of time with his lucubrations takes occasion in several of his papers to applaud the speculations of this dumb gentleman in an admirable vein of pleasantry and humor peculiar to the writer and to the subject he writ upon and when that bright author who joined the uttermost facetiousness with the most solid improvements of morality and learning in his works laid aside the title of a tatler and assumed the name of a spectator and censor of mens actions he still every now and then thought our duncan campbell a subject worthy enough to employ his farther considerations upon i must take notice of one letter sent concerning him to the spectator in the year      which was at a time when a lady wanted him after he had removed from monmouth street to drury lane  mr spectator about two years ago i was called upon by the younger part of a country family by my mothers side related to me to visit mr campbell the dumb man for they told me that was chiefly what brought them to town having heard wonders of him in essex i who always wanted faith in such matters was not easily prevailed on to go but lest they should take it ill i went with them when to my own surprise mr campbell related all their past life in short had he not been prevented such a discovery would have come out as would have ruined their next design of coming to town viz buying wedding clothes our names  though he never heard of us before and we endeavored to conceal were as familiar to him as to ourselves to be sure mr spectator he is a very learned and wise man being impatient to know my fortune having paid my respects in a family jacobus he told me after his manner among several other things that in a year and nine months i should fall ill of a new fever be given over by my physicians but should with much difficulty recover that the first time i took the air afterward i should be addressed to by a young gentleman of a plentiful fortune good sense and a generous spirit mr spectator he is the purest man in the world for all he said is come to pass and i am the happiest she in kent i have been in quest of mr campbell these three months and cannot find him out now hearing you are a dumb man too i thought you might correspond and be able to tell me something for i think my self highly obliged to make his fortune as he has mine it is very possible your worship who has spies all over this town can inform me how to send to him if you can i beseech you be as speedy as possible and you will highly oblige your constant reader and admirer  dulcibella thankley   the spectators answer ordered that the inspector i employ about wonders enquire at the goldenlion opposite to the half moon tavern in drury lane into the merit of this silent sage and report accordingly  vide the  th volume of spectators no     being on wednesday september the  d        but now let us come to those passages of his life the most surprising of all during the time that he enjoyed this reputation and when he proved that he deserved the fame he enjoyed let us take a survey of him while he is wonderfully curing persons laboring under the misfortune of witchcraft of which the following story will be an emiment instance and likewise clear up how he came by his reputation in essex as mentioned in the abovementioned letter to the spectator  in the year   0  susanna johnson daughter to one captain johnson who lived at a place adjacent to rumford in essex going one morning to that town to buy butter at the market was met there by an old miserablelooking woman just as she had taken some of her change of the marketwoman in copper and this old woman rather demanded than begged the gentlewoman to give her a penny mrs johnson reputing her to be one of those hateful people that are called sturdy beggars refused it her as thinking it to be no act of charity and that it would be rather gratifying and indulging her impudence than supplying or satisfying her indigence upon the refusal the old hag with a face more wrinkld still if possible by anger than it was by age took upon her to storm at young mrs johnson very loudly and to threaten and menace her but when she found her common threats and menaces were of no avail she swore she would be revenged of the young creature in so signal a manner that she should repent the denial of that penny from her heart before she got home and that it should cost her many pounds to get rid of the consequences of that denial and her anger the poor innocent girl despised these last words likewise and getting up on horseback returned homewards but just as she got about half way her horse stopped and no means that she could use would make him advance one single step but she staid a while to see if that would humor him to go on at last the beast began to grow unruly and snorted and trembled as if he had seen or smelt something that frighted him and so fell a kicking desperately till he threw the girl from the saddle not being able to cling to it any longer though a pretty good horsewoman of her years so much were the horses motions and plungings more than ordinarily violent  as providence would have it she got not much harm by the fall receiving only a little bruise in the right shoulder but she was dreadfully frighted this fear added wings to her feet and brought her home as speedily of herself as she usually came on horseback she immediately without any other sign of illness than the pallid color with which fear had disordered the complexion of her face alarmed all the family at home with the story took her bed upon it complained of inward rackings of the belly and was never at case unless she lay doubled up together her head to her knees and her heels to her rump just like a figure of   she could not be a single moment out of that posture without shrieking out with the violence of anxious torments and racking pains  in this condition of misery amidst this agony of suffering and in this double posture was the poor wretched young gentlewoman brought to town physicians were consulted about her but in vain she was carried to different hospitals for assistance but their endeavors likewise proved ineffectual at last she was conducted to the college of physicians and even the collective wisdom of the greatest sages and adepts in the science of physic was posed to give her any prescription that would do her service and relieve her from the inexplicable malady she labored under the poor incurable creature was one constant subject of her complaining mothers discourse in every company she came into it happened at last and very providentially truly that the mother was thus condoling the misfortune of her child among five or six ladies and telling them among other things that by the most skilful persons she was looked upon to be bewitched and that twas not within the power of physic to compass her recovery they all having been acquainted with our mr duncan campbell unanimously advised her to carry her daughter to his house and consult with him about her the mother was overjoyed at these tidings and purposed to let no time slip where her childs health was so deeply concerned she got the ladies to go with her and her child to be eyewitnesses of so extraordinary a piece of practice and so eminent a trial of skill  as soon as this dismal object was brought into his room mr duncan campbell lifted up her head and looked earnestly in her face and in less than a minutes time signified to the company that she was not only bewitched but in as dreadful a condition almost as the man that had a legion of fiends within him  at the reading of these words the unhappy creature raised up her head turned her eyes upwards and a smile a thing she had been a stranger to for many months overspread her whole face and such a kind of color as is the flushing of joy and gladness and with an innocent tone of voice she said she now had a firm belief she should shortly be delivered the mother and the rest of the company were all in tears but mr campbell wrote to them that they should be of good heart be easy and quiet for a few moments and they should be convinced that it was witchcraft but happily convinced by seeing her so suddenly well again this brought the company into pretty good temper and a little after mr campbell desired she might be led up stairs into his chamber and left there alone with him for a little while this occasioned some small female speculation and as much mirth as their late sorrow alleviated with the hopes of her cure would permit  this you may be sure was but a snatch of mirth just as the nature of the thing would allow of and all sorts of waggery being laid instantly aside and removed almost as soon as conceived the poor young thing was carried in that double posture up stairs she had not been much above half an hour there when by the help only of mr campbells arm she was led down stairs and descended into that room full of company as a miracle appearing in a machine from above she was led backward and forward in the room while all gazed at her for a while with joyful astonishment for no arrow was ever more strait than she mr campbell then prevailed with her to drink a glass of wine and immediately after she evacuated wind which she had not done for some months before and found herself still more amended and easy and then the mother making mr campbell some small acknowledgment at that time with the promise of more and her daughter giving thanks and all the company commending his skill took their leaves and departed with great demonstrations of joy i shall here to cut the story short signify that she came frequently afterward to make her testimonials of gratitude to him and continues to enjoy her health to this very day at greenwich where she now lives and will at any time if called upon make oath of the truth of this little history as she told me herself with her own mouth  the next thing therefore it behooves me to do in this chapter is to give some satisfactory account of magic by which such seeming mysterious cures and operations are brought about  this task i would perform in the most perspicuous and most convincing manner i can for magic i know is held to be a very hard and difficult study by those learned and universally unlawful and diabolical by those unlearned who believe there is such a science attainable by human genius on the other hand by some learned men who believe there is no such science it is represented as an inconsistent system of superstitions and chimeras and again laughed at as such by the unlearned who are of an incredulous temper what i would therefore undertake to do in this place is to show the learned men who believe there is such an art that the attainment to a tolerable knowledge of the manner how magical practices may be brought about is no such difficult matter as they have represented it to themselves and by doing this i shall make the system of it so plain that while the learned approve of it the unlearned too who are not of an unbelieving kind may understand clearly what i say and the learned men who have rejected this science as chimerical may be clearly convinced it is real and then there is nothing left but obstinate unbelieving ignorance which i shall not here pretend by arguments to lead into sense but leave it to the work of time in fine i will endeavor to induce men of sense to say that what has been accounted mysterious is delivered in a plain easy and convincing manner and to own that they approve while men of the lower class of understanding shall confess and acknowledge that they themselves understand it and that what has hitherto been represented as arduous and difficult to a great genius is adapted and rendered not only clear but familiar to persons of midling talents in this work therefore i shall follow the strictest order i can which of all things render a discourse upon any subject the most clear and that it may be plain to the commonest capacity i will first set down what order i intend to follow  first i will speak of magic in general  secondly of magic under its several divisions and subdivisions  thirdly concerning the object of art as it is good or bad  fourthly of the persons exercising that art in either capacity of good or bad and by what means they become capacitated to exercise it  in the fifth place i shall come to the several objections against the art of magic and the refutation of those objections  the first objection shall be against the existence of good and bad spirits the refutation of which will consist in my proving the existences of spirits both good and bad by reason and by experience  the second objection that will be brought is to contain an allegation that there are no such persons as witches now and an argument to support that allegation drawn from the incapacity and impossibility of any things making while itself is incarnate a contract with a spirit this objection will be answered by proving the reality of witches from almost universal experience and by explaining rationally the manner how the devils hold commerce with witches which explication is backed and authorized by the opinion of the most eminent divines and the most learned physicians  from hence sixthly and lastly we shall conclude on the side of the good magic that as there are witches on the one hand that may afflict and torment persons with demons so on the other hand there are lawful and good magicians that may cast out demons from people that are possessed with them  and first as to magic in general magic consists in the spirit by faith for faith is that magnet of the magicians by which they draw spirits to them and by which spirits they do great things that appear like miracles  secondly magic is divided into three sorts viz divine natural and diabolical and natural magic is again subdivided into two kinds simple and compound and natural compound magic is again likewise divided into two kinds viz naturaldivine magic and naturaldiabolical magic now to give the reader a clear and a distinct notion of each several species of magic here mentioned i set down the following definitions  divine magic is a celestial science in which all operations that are wonderfully brought about are performed by the spirit of god  natural magic is a science in which all the mysterious acts that are wrought are compassed by natural spirits  but as this natural magic may be exercised about things either in a manner indifferent in themselves or mere morally good and then it is mere natural magic or else about things theologically good and transcendently bad and then it is not merely and natural magic but mixed and compound if natural magic be exercised about the most holy operations it is then mixed with the divine and may then be called not improperly naturaldivine magic but if natural magic troubles itself about compassing the wickedest practices then is it promiscuous with the demoniacal and may not improperly be called natural diabolical magic  thirdly the object of this art is doing wonders out of the ordinary appearing course of nature which tend either to great good or bad by the help and mediation of spirits good and bad  fourthly as to the persons exercising that art in either way whether good or bad and by what means they become capacitated to act it the notion of this may be easily deduced from the notions of the art itself as considered above in its each different species for as all magic consists in a spirit every magician acts by a spirit  divine magicians that are of god are spoke of in the sacred book and therefore i shall not mention the passages here but pass them over as ought in a book like this with a profound and reverential silence as well as the other passages which speak of natural and daemoniacal magicians and in all i shall speak of them in this place i shall only speak of them with regard to humane reason and experience and conclude this head with saying that natural magicians work all things by the natural spirits of the elements but that witches and daemoniacal magicians as jannes and jambers in egypt were work their magical performances by the spirit of demons and it is by the means of these different spirits that these different magicians perform their different operations  these things thus distinctly settled and explained it is now we must come and ground the dispute between those who believe there are no such things as magicians of any kind and those who assert there are of all the kinds above specified  those who contend there are have recourse to experience and relate many wellwitnessd narratives to prove that there have been in all times and that there are still magicians of all these kinds but those who contend that there are no such persons will give no ear to what the others call plain experience they call the stories let whatever witnesses appear to justify them either fabulous legends invented by the authors or else tricks of intellectual logerdemain imposed by the actors upon the relators of those actions since therefore they say though the believers in magic bragg of experience never so much it may be but a fallible experience they reasonably desire to know whether these gentlemen that stand for magic can answer the objections which they propose to prove that the practice of magic according to the system laid down is inconsistent with reason before they will yield their assent let the stories be never so numerous appear neverso credible these unbelieving gentlemen desire to be tried by reason and aver till that reason is given they will not be convinced by the number of stories because though numerous they are stories still neither will they believe them because they appear credible because seeming so is not being so and appearances though never so fair when they contradict reason are not to be swallowed down with an implicit faith as so many realities and thus far no doubt the gentlemen who are on the unbelieving side are very much in the right on it the learned gentlemen on the other hand who are persuaded of this mighty mysterious power being lodged in the hands of magicians answer that they will take upon them to refute the most subtle objections brought by the learned unbelievers and to reconcile the practicability of magical mysteries by the capacity of men who study that art to right rules and laws of reasoning and to show that some stories though never so prodigious which are told of magicians demand the belief of wise men on two accounts because as experience backs reason on the one hand reason backs experience on the other and so the issue of the whole argument whether there are magicians or not is thrown upon both experience and reason these arguments on each side i shall draw up fairly pro and con for i dont pretend to be the inventor of them my self they belong to other authors many years ago be it enough for me to boast of if i can draw them up in a better and closer form together than they have yet appeared in in that i take upon my self a very great task i erect my self as it were into a kind of a judge i will sum up the evidences on both sides and i shall wherever i see occasion intimate which side of the argument bears the most weight with me but when i have enforced my opinion as far as i think needful my readers like a jury are still at liberty to bring in their verdict just as they themselves shall see fit and this naturally leads me where i promised to come to in the fifth part of this discourse to the several objections against the power of art magic and the refutation of those objections  the first objections being against the existence of spirits and the refutations thereof the first objection which they who reject magic make use of is denying that there are any such things as spirits about which since those who defend the art say it entirely exercises itself the objectors contend that if they can make out that there are no such beings as spirits all pretensions to the art must be entirely groundless and for the future exploded  to make this part out that there are no spirits the first man they produce on their side is undoubtedly one of very great credit and authority inasmuch as he has justly born for many centuries the title of a prince of philosophers they say that aristotle in his book de mundo reasons thus against the existence of spirits viz that since god can do all things of himself he does not stand in need of ministering angels and demons a multitude of servants showing the weakness of a prince  the gentlemen who defend the science make this reply they allow the credit and authority of aristotle as much as the objectors but as the objectors themselves deny all the authorities for the spirits and desire that reason may be the only ground they go upon so the refuters on their parts desire that aristotles ipse dixit may not be absolutely passed upon them for argument but that his words may be brought to the same touchstone of reason and proved if they are standard if this argument say they will hold good aristotle should not suppose intelligencies moving the caelestial spheres for god suffices to move all without ministering spirits nor would there be need of a sun in the world for god can enlighten all things by himself and so all second causes were to be taken away therefore there are angels and ministering spirits in the world for the majesty of god not for his want of them and for order not for his omnipotency and here if the objectors return and say who told you that there are spirits is not yours a precarious hypothesis may not we have leave to recriminate in this place pray who told aristotle that there were intelligencies that moved the caelestial spheres is not this hypothesis as precarious as any man may pretend that of spirits to be and we believe there are few philosophers at present who agree with aristotle in that opinion and we dare pronounce this to be ours that aristotle took his intelligencies from the hebrews who went according to the same whimsical though pretty notion which first gave rise to the fiction of the nine muses but more than all this it is a very great doubt among learned men whether this book de mundo be aristotles or no  the next thing the objectors bring against the existence of spirits is that it is nonsense for men to say that there are such beings of which it is impossible for a man to have any notion and they insist upon it that it is impossible for any man to form an idea of a spiritual substance as to this part the defendants rejoin that they think our late most judicious mr lock in his claborate and finished essay on humane understanding has fairly made out that men have as clear a notion of a spiritual substance as they have of any corporeal substance matter or body and that there is as much reason for admitting the existence of the one as of the other for that if they admit the latter it is but humor in them to deny the former it is in book the   d chap    where he reasons thus if a man will examine himself concerning his notion of pure substance in general he will find he has no other idea of it but only a supposition of he knows not what support of such quality which are capable of producing simple ideas in us which qualities are commonly called accidents thus if we talk or think of any particular sort of corporeal substance as horse stone etc though the idea we have of either of them be but the complication or collection of those several simple ideas or sensible qualities which we use to find united in the thing called horse or stone yet because we cannot conceive how they should subsist alone not one in another we suppose them to exist in and be supported by some common subject which support we denote by the name of substance though it be certain we have no clear or distinct idea of that thing we suppose a support the same happens concerning the operations of our mind viz thinking reasoning and fearing etc which we concluding not to subsist of themselves and not apprehending how they can belong to body we are apt to think these the actions of some substance which we call spirit whereby it is evident that having no other notion of matter but something wherein those many sensible qualities which affect our senses do subsist by supposing a substance wherein thinking knowing doubting and a power of moving etc do subsist we have as clear a notion of the nature or substance of spirit as we have of body the one being snpposed to be without knowing what is the substratum to those simple ideas which we have from without and the other supposed with a like ignorance of what it is to be the substratum of these operations which we experiment in ourselves within it is plain then that the idea of corporeal substance in matter is as remote from our conceptions and apprehensions as that of spiritual substance and therefore from our not having any notion of the substance of spirit we can no more conclude its not existence than we can for the same reason deny the existence of body it being as rational to affirm there is no body because we cannot know its essence as it is called or have the idea of the substance of matter as to say there is no spirit because we know not its essence or have no idea of a spiritual substance mr lock also comparing our idea of spirit with our idea of body thinks there may seem rather less obscurity in the former than the latter our idea of body he takes to be an extended solid substance capable of communicating motion by impulse and our idea of soul is a substance that thinks and has a power of exciting motion in body by will or thought now some perhaps will say they comprehend a thinking thing which perhaps is true but he says if they consider it well they can no more comprehend an extended thing and if they say they know not what it is thinks in them they mean they know not what the substance is of that thinking thing no more says he do they know what the substance is of that solid thing and if they say they know not how they think he says neither do they know how they are extended how the solid parts are united or where to make extension etc  the learned monsieur le clerc who generally knows how far humane reason can bear argues consonantly to what is before delivered by mr lock in his coronis added to the end of the fourth volume of his philosophical works in the third edition of them where he writes as follows  when we contemplate the corporeal nature we can see nothing in it but extension divisibility solidity mobility and various determinations of quantity or figures which being so it were a rash thing and contrary to the laws of right reasoning to affirm other things of bodies and consequently from mere body nothing can be deduced by us which is not joined in a necessary connection with the said properties therefore those who have thought the properties of perceiving by sense of understanding willing imagining remembering and others the like which have no affinity with corporeal things to have risen from the body have greatly transgressed in the method of right reasoning and philosophising which has been done by epicurus and those who have thought as he did having affirmed our minds to be composed of corporeal atoms but whence shall we say they have had their rise truly they do not owe their rise to matter which is wholly destitute of sense and thought nor are they spontaneously sprung up from nothing it being an ontological maxim of most evident truth that nothing springs from nothing  having thus given the reader the first objections made against the existence of spirits and the refutations thereof i must now frankly own on which side my opinion leans and for my part it seems manifest to me that there are two beings we conceive very plainly and distinctly viz body and spirit and that it would be as absurd and ridiculous to deny the existence of the one as of the other and really if the refuters have got the better in their way of reasoning they have still a much greater advantage over the objectors when they come to back these reasons with fresh arguments drawn from experience of this there having been many undoubted narratives given in the foregoing pages concerning the apparitions of spirits i shall refer the reader back again to them and only subjoin here one or two instances which may if required be proved upon oath of spirits seen by two persons of our duncan campbells own acquaintance in the year      one mrs stephens and her daughter were together with mr campbell at the house of mr ramells a very great and noted weaver at haggerstone where the rainy weather detained them till late at night just after the clock struck twelve they all of them went to the door to see if the rain had ceased being extremely desirous to get home as soon as ever they had opened the door and were all got together their appeared before them a thing all in white the face seemed of a dismal pallid hue but the eyes thereof fiery and flaming like beacons and of a saweer size it made its approaches to them till it came up within the space of about three yards of them there it fixed and stood like a figure agaze for some minutes and they all stood likewise stiff like the figure frozen with fear motionless and speechless when all of a sudden it vanished from their eyes and that apparition to the sight was succeeded by a noise or the appearance of a noise like that which is occasioned by the fighting of twenty mastiff dogs  not long after mrs anne stephens who lived in spittlefields a woman well known by her great dealings with mercers upon ludgate hill sitting in her house alone and musing upon business happened by accident to look behind her and saw a dead corpse to her thinking lie extended upon the floor just as a dead corpse should be excepting that the foot of one leg was fixed on the ground as it is in a bed when one lies with one knee up she looked at it a long while and by degrees at last stole her eyes from so unpleasing and unexpected an object however a strange kind of a curiosity overcame her fears and she ventured a second time to turn her head that way and saw it as before fixed for a considerable time longer but durst not stir from her seat she again withdrew her eyes from the horrible and melancholy spectacle and resumed the courage after a little reflection of viewing it again and resolving to ascertain herself if the vision was real by getting up from her seat and going to it but upon this third retrospection she found it vanished this relation she writ down to mr duncan campbell and has told before mrs ramell her own sister and many other very creditable persons now as to these arguments from experience i shall also deliver my opinion i dispute not but that learned men who have obstinate prepossessions may produce plausible arguments why all things should be thought to be done by imposture which seem strange to them and interfere with their belief and truly thus far their humor may be indulged that if only one person relates a very strange and surprising story a man may be more apt to think it is possible for that person to lie than that so strange a relation should be true but if a considerable number of persons of several countries several religions several professions several ages and those persons looked upon to be of as great sagacity as any the country afford agree in relations of the same kind though very strange and are ready to vouch the truth of them upon oath after having well considered circumstances i think it a violation of the law of nature to reject all these relations as fabulous merely upon a selfpresuming conceit unless a man can fairly show the things to be impossible or can demonstrate wherein those persons were imposed on for from hence i form the following conclusive argument what is possible according to reason grows probable according to belief where the possibility is attested to have reduced itself into action by persons of known credit and integrity now not only the possibility of the existence of spirits but the actual existence thereof is proved above by logical demonstration therefore are we to believe both by the course of logical reason and moral faith that those existencies have appeared to men of credit who have attested the reality thereof upon oath  second objection against the existence of witches these objectors go on to say that provided they should allow there is an existence of spirits yet that would be still no argument how magic should subsist because they deny that it is impossible for a man in his body to have a commerce much less make a contract with spirits but here again the refuters allege they have both experience and reason on their sides as a joint argument of reason and experience they tell you that the numerous witches which have in all countries been arraigned and condemned upon this occasion are evident testimonies of this commerce and contract being held and made with spirits they pretend to say that these objectors call not their the refuters judgment so much in question who contend that there is a magic art as they call in question the judgment of all the wisest legislative powers in christendom who have universally agreed in enacting penal laws against such capital offenders  but here the objectors return and say that it being impossible for us to show the manner how such a contract should be made we can never but without reason believe a thing to be of which we can form no perfect idea the refuters on the other hand reply with the learned father le brune it is manifest that we can see but two sorts of beings spirits and bodies and that since we can reason but according to our own ideas we ought to ascribe to spirits what cannot be produced by bodies indeed the author of the republic of learning in the month of august anno      has given us a rough draft for writing a good tract of witchcraft which he looks upon as a desideratum where among other things he writes thus since this age is the true time of systems one should be contrived concerning the commerce that may be betwixt demons and men  on this passage father le brune writes thus doubtless here the author complies with the language of a great many persons who for want of attention and light would have us put all religion in systems whatever regard i ought to have for many of those persons i must not be afraid to say that there is no system to be made of those truths which we ought to learn distinctly by faith because we must advance nothing here but what we receive from the oracle we must make a system to explain the effects of the loadstone the ebbing and flowing of the sea the motion of the planets for that the cause of these effects is not evidently signified to us and many may be conceived by us and to determine us we have need of a great number of observations which by an exact induction may lead us to a cause that may satisfy all the phoenomena it is not the same in the truths of religion we come not at them by groping it were to be wished men spoke not of them but after a decisive and infallible authority it is thus we should speak of the power of demons and of the commerce they have with men it is of faith that they have power and that they attack men and try to seduce them diverse ways it is true indeed they are sometimes permitted to have it over the just though they have it not ordinarily but over those that want faith or fear not to partake of their works and that to the last particularly the disordered intelligencies try to make exactly succeed what they wish inspiring them to have recourse to certain practices by which those seducing spirits enter into commerce with men thus far father le brune but still these objectors demand to know by what means this commerce may be held between demons and men and urge us to describe the manner or pretend that they have still reason to refuse coming into the belief of a thing which we would impose upon them though wholly ignorant of it ourselves to that the refuters answer thus that both christian divines and physicians agree as to the manner how which they are so curious in enquiring after that demons stir up raptures and ecstasies in men binding or loosing the exterior senses and that either by stopping the pores of the brain so that the spirits cannot pass forth as it is done naturally by sleep or by recalling the sensitive spirits from the outward senses to the inward organs which he there retains so the devil renders women witches extatical and magicians who while they lie fast asleep in one place think they have been in diverse places and done many things this the learned objectors say proceeds from no demon but from the disease called an epilepsy but on the other hand the more learned refuters insist upon it that these ecstasies are not epileptick scizures this say they appears from bodin in his theater of universal nature where he says that those that are wrapped by the devil feel neither stripes nor cuttings nor no wresting of their limbs nor burning tortures nor the application of a red hot iron nay nor is the beat of the pulse nor the motion of the heart perceived in them but afterward returning to themselves they feel most bitter pains of the wounds received and tell of things done at  00 miles distance and affirm themselves to have seen them done the ingenious dr ader makes an admirable physical distinction between this kind of ecstasy and a syncope or stupor caused by narcotick medicines sennertus in his institutio medica writes of the daemoniacal sopor of witches who think they are carried through the air dance feast and have copulation with the devil and do other things in their sleep and afterward believe the same things waking now he says whether they are really so carried in the air etc or being in a profound sleep or only dream they are so carried and persist in that opinion after they are awake these facts or dreams cannot be natural for it cannot be that there should be so great an agreement in dreams of persons differing in place temperament age sex and studies that in one night and at the same hour they should in concert dream of one and the same such meeting and should agree as to the place number and quality of the persons and the like circumstances but such dreams are suggested from a preternatural cause viz from the devil to his confederate by the divine permission of an almighty power where punishments are to be permitted to be inflicted upon reprobate sinners  whence also to those witches sincerely converted and refusing to be any more present at those diabolical meetings those dreams no longer happen which is a proof that they proceeded not before from a natural cause  here begins the great point of the dispute as to that branch of magic which we call natural magic the objectors may tell us that they will freely own that there may be an existence of spirits that there may be an existence of witches that by a divine power men may be influenced so far as to have a communication with good spirits and that from thence they may become spiritual divine magicians they will likewise perhaps as freely grant that by the intervention of a demon things preternatural may be brought about by persons who have studied the daemoniacal magic but then what they principally insist upon is that it must be contradictory to all humane reason to imagine that there can be such a thing as natural magicians and thus far they may form their argument they say that the persons who contend for the magic art own that all that is brought about by magic is by the assistance and help of a spirit and that consequently what is effected by it must be preternatural now they say it is a thing inconsistent by a natural power to bring about a preternatural effect therefore there can be no such thing as natural magic which has within itself the efficacy of destroying those acts done by magicians in the diabolical  to this the refuters take leave to reply that the foundation upon which the argument is built is wrong grounded they have admitted that in diabolical art magic there may be a commerce held between men and spirits by which several preternatural effects may be brought about and the reason they assign for it there is because there is a preternatural agent concerned therein the devil but then say they in natural magic you can pretend to no such agent and therefore to no such preternatural effect this argument contains within it two falacies first as to the commerce held between a man and a demon there is nothing preternatural in getting the acquaintance the will of the man is entirely natural either naturally good or naturally corrupted the black spirit that converseth with him it is acknowledged is not so but it is from the will of the man not from the power vested in the devil that the acquaintance first grows therefore the acquaintance it self is natural though it arises from the last corruption and depravations of nature but being made with a preternatural existence though the cause of the acquaintance be corruptedly natural yet the intermediate cause or means after that acquaintance is not so and therefore the effect of that intermediate cause may be wonderful and seem to be out of the ordinary course of nature now since it is generally allowed that there are natural spirits of the elements as well as divine and infernal what we have to prove is only this that man by natural magic may have a commerce with natural spirits of their elements as witches may have with the spirits or demons now as we said before the commerce itself depends upon the will of the person and is therefore natural and consequently may as well subsist between the one as the other for the devil cannot force a man to hold a commerce with him whether he will or no the second falacy is calling the effect preternatural no otherwise than as it connotates the agent that brought it about which is a spiritual agent for the effect is in itself considered natural and brought about by second causes that are natural by the devils penetration who is subtle enough to make use of them for such and such ends now men by natural spirits which are of a faculty thoroughly subtle may as well with natural second causes compass the remedy of an evil spirit as the devil is able to infect men with it from these speculations a farther plain consequence may be deduced how a man may by the pure force of natural magic cure a person that is infested with evils by a demon for how is it that a demon infests any body with his evil motions it is true he is a preternatural agent but the evil effect he does is brought about by natural causes for how does a demon stir up raptures or ecstasies in men why he does it as we are told above by binding or loosing the exterior senses by stopping the pores of the brain so that the spirits cannot pass forth and this the art of physic can compass by its drugs and sleep causes the same thing very naturally of itself therefore as the evil itself is natural the remedy that is natural will certainly overcome it but then say you why cannot those persons be cured by physicians i answer not because their remedies are not in themselves sufficient to cure the evils themselves but because generally physicians dont administer their drugs as christians but as physicians and when they prescribe them to the sick they generally prescribe to them only purely considered as patients not as christians and therein they come to fail because the agent the devil is a subtle spirit that brings the evil and alters its situation before the remedy which would master it otherwise can take any effect which agent the devil is employed by the horrible and impious faith of the antiphysician viz the black magician but if the physician would act the christian at the same time so far as to have a faith that things ordained in the course of nature for the good of man would have its effects in spite of a devil if taken with a good faith by the patient that all good things ordained to be for the natural recovery of men if they took it with thankfulness to the sender would have due effect why then the natural spirits of the elements would resist the farther agency of the daemoniacal spirit and then nothing but the natural evil caused at first by the demon remaining in the person without the farther superintendency of the demon might demonstratively be taken away by the mere natural remedy or medicine and thus good and pious physicians making use of such proper remedies as their skill teaches them and having an honest faith that the goods of nature intended for the use and benefit of man if received by the patient with the same good faith is above the power of the devil to frustrate may not improperly be called natural magicians these arguments of mine i shall now take leave to back by experience  besides what we have urged from reason concerning the power of natural magic we shall only subjoin that divines themselves hold that natural magic and also natural divinations and prophecies are proved by quotations from that venerable writ which is their guide and bring proofs from the same also that by natural magic demons are also cast forth but not all kinds of demons and so many works of efficacy are wrought by natural magic they tell you such was the pythonissa that raised the apparition to saul which appeared in a body of wind and air thus if a person by natural magic should cast out demons it does not follow that this was also from divine magic and if demons are cast out by natural magic by one that is in the fear of god it does not follow that he is a true magician of god but if it exorbitates to daemoniacal then it is condemned and when natural magic keeps within its bounds the divines tell us it is not condemned in the venerable book which is the christians sure guide but inasmuch as the lawfulness even of natural magic has been called in question by others i shall in an appendix joined to this treatise examine that matter both according to the reasons of our english laws and according to the best stated rules of casuistry that i am a master of still submitting my judgment to the superior judgment of those who are professed divines and lawyers and if my opinions prove erroneous i am willing to retract them and therefore in this place there remains nothing farther for me to do but only as i have shown on the one hand how natural magic and its powerful operations are proved by reason to show on the other hand how far reason in these cases is likewise backed and supported by wellevidencd practice and notorious experience and to do this after having mentioned one memorable instance which i refer the reader to in the body of the book concerning the performances of mr greatrix to which a lord orrery was a witness in ireland i shall to avoid prolixity bring the other testimonials of practice from the success which our duncan campbell himself has had in this way on other occasions  in the year      lived in fanchurchstreet one mr coats a tobaccomerchant who had been for many years sorely tormented in his body and had had recourse for a cure to all the most eminent physicians of the age even up to the great dr ratcliff himself but all this mighty application for relief was still in vain each doctor owned him a wonder and a mystery to physic and left him as much a wonder as they found him neither could the professors of surgery guess at his ailment or resolve the riddle of his distemper and after having spent from first to last above a thousand pounds in search of proper remedies they found the search ineffectual the learned all agreed that it could proceed from nothing else but witchcraft they had now indeed guessed the source of his illness but it was an illness of such a kind that when they had found it out they thought themselves not the proper persons to prescribe to him any remedies that task was reserved it seems for our duncan campbell who upon some bodys information or other was sent for to the betwiched patient mr coats who found him the wonder that the others had left him but did wonders in undertaking and compassing his cure i remember one of the ingredients made use of was boiling his own water but i cannot tell how twas used and upon turning over the books of some great physicians since i have found that they themselves have formerly delivered that as one part of the prescriptions for the cure of patients in like cases but as there are other things which mr campbell performs that seem to require a mixture of the secondsight and of this natural magic before they can be brought about i will entertain the reader with one or two passages of that sort likewise and so conclude the history of this so singular a mans life and adventures  in the year    0 a gentlewoman lost about six pounds worth of flanderslace and inasmuch as it was a present made to her husband she was concerned as much as if it had been of twenty times the value and a lady of her acquaintance coming to visit her to whom she unfolded among other things in discourse this little disaster the lady smiling replied with this question did you never hear madam of mr duncan campbell it is but making your application to him things that are lost are immediately found the power of his knowledge exceeds even the power of laws they but restrain and frighten and punish robbers but he makes thieves expiate their guilt by the more virtuous way of turning restorers of the goods they have stolen madam rejoined the losing gentlewoman you smile when you tell me this but really as much a triflc as it is since twas a present to my husband i cannot help being sensibly concerned at it a moments disappointment to him in the least thing in nature creates in me a greater uneasiness than the greatest disappointment to my single self could do in things of moment and importance what makes me smile said the lady when i speak of it or think of it is the oddness and peculiarity of this mans talent in helping one to such things but without the least jest i assure you that i know by experience these things come within the compass of his knowledge and i must seriously tell you for your farther satisfaction that he has helped me and several of my friends to the finding again things lost which were of great value and is this without laughing true said the losing fair very gravely and demurely like a person half believing and desirous to be fully confirmed in such a belief the lady she advised with did then ascertain her of the truth of the matter alleging that for a single half guinea he would inform her of her things and describe the person that conveyed them away no sooner was this gentlewoman convinced but she was eager for the trial solicited her friend to conduct her to mr campbell and upon the first word of consent she was hooded and scarfd immediately and they coachd it away in a trice to mr campbells house whom they luckily found within  the ladies had not been long seated before he wrote down the name of this new client of his exactly as it was viz mrs saxon then she was in good hopes and with much confidence propounded to him the question about the lace he paused but a very little while upon the matter before he described the person that took it and satisfied her that in two or three days she would be mistress of her lace again and find it in some book or corner of her room she presented him a halfguinea and was very contentedly going away but mr campbell very kindly stopped her and signified to her that if she had no more to offer to him he had something of more importance to reveal to her she sat full of expectation while he wrote this new matter and the paper he delivered to her contained the following account as for the loss of a little bit of lace it is a mere trifle you have lost a great many hundreds of pounds which your aunt naming her name left you but you are bubbled out of that large sum for while you was artfully required down stairs about some pretended business or other one mr httn conveyed your aunts will out of the desk and several other things of value and writing down the names of all the persons concerned which put mrs saxon in a great consternation he concluded this paper with bidding her go home with a contented mind she should find her lace in a few days and as she found that prediction prove true she should afterward come and consult about the the rest  when she came home it seems big at first with the thoughts of what she had been told she rifled and ransacked every corner but no lace was to be met with all the next day she hunted in the like manner but frightened the whole time as if she thought the devil was the only person could bring it but all to no purpose the third day her curiosity abated she gave over the hopes of it and took the prediction as a vain delusion and that what she gave for it was onmore money thrown away after what had been lost before that very day as it commonly happens in such cases when she least dreamt of it she lighted on it by accident and surprise she ran with it in her hand immediately to her husband and now she had recovered it again told him of the loss of it and the whole story of her having been at mr campbells about it and then amplifying the discourse about what he had told her besides as to more considerable affairs she said she resolved to go and consult him a little farther about them and begged her husband to accompany her he would fain have laughed her out of that opinion and intent but the end was she persuaded him into it and prevailed upon him to seem at least very serious about the matter and go with her to the oracle assuring him there was no room for doubting the same success  well to mr campbells they accordingly came and after mr saxon in deference to his wifes desire had paid our predictor a handsome complement of gold mr duncan campbell saluted him in as grateful a manner with the assurance that there was in kent a little country house with some lands appertaining to it that was his in right of his wife that he had the house as it were before his eyes that though he had never substantially seen it nor been near the place where it stood he had seen it figuratively as if in exact painting and sculpture that particularly it had four green trees before the door from whence he was positive that if mr saxon went with him in quest of it he should find it out and know it as well the moment he come near it as if he had been an inhabitant in it all his life  mr saxon though somewhat of an unbeliever yet must naturally wish to find it true you may be sure and yet partly doubting the event and partly pleased with the visionary promise of a fortune henever expected laughed very heartily at the oddness of the adventure and said he would consider whether it would not savor too much of quixotism to be at the expense of a journey on such frolicks and on such a chimerical foundation of airy hopes and that then he would call again and let mr campbell know his mind upon that point  in every company he came into it served for laughter and diversion they all however agreed twas worth his while since the journey would not be very expensive to go it by way of frolic his wife one morning saying that she did remember some talk of a house and such things as mr campbell had described put him forward upon the adventure and upon mr saxons proposing it to his brother barnard mr barnard favored the proposal as a joke and agreed upon the country ramble they came on horseback to mr campbells with a third horse on which the dumb predictor was mounted and so on they jogged into kent toward sevenoak being the place which he described the first day they set out was on a saturday morning in june and about five that afternoon they arrived at the blackbull at sevenoak in kent it being a delicate evening they took an agreeable walk up a fine hill gracefully adorned with woods to an old seat of the earl of dorsets meeting by the way with an old servant of the earls one perkins he offered mr barnard who it seems was his old acquaintance to give them all a sight of that fine ancient seat  after they had pleased themselves with viewing the antique nobility of that stately structure this perkins went back with them to their inn the bull at sevenoak they that could talk were very merry in chat and the dumb gentleman who saw them laugh and wear all the signs of alacrity in their countenances was resolved not to be behind with their tongues and by dint of pen ink and paper that he made signs should be brought in was resolved if one might be said to crack without noise to crack his jest as well as the best of em for it may be truly said of him that he seldom comes into any even diverting company where he is not the most diverting man there and the head though we cannot call him the mouth of the cheerful society after having eyed this perkins a little and being grown by his art as we may suppose as familiar with the mans humor as if he had known him as many years as mr barnard pray mr barnard quoth he in writing how comes it you that are so staunch and so stiff a whig should be so acquainted and so particularly familiar with such an old papist and so violent a jacobite as i know that mr perkin whom i never saw nor had any notice of in my life to be and pray replied mr barnard what reason have you beyond a pun to take him for a jacobite must he be so because his name is perkin i do assure you in this you show yourself but little of a conjurer if you can tell no more of houses than you do of men we may give over our search after the house you spoke of here the reader must understand they discoursed on their fingers and wrote by turns mr campbell replied seriously laying a wager is no argument in other things i own but in this i know it is because i am sure after we have laid the wager he will fairly confess it among friends since it will go no farther and i said mr campbell will lay what wager you will apiece with you all round hereupon mr barnard who had known him a great many years was the first that laid and many more to the number of five or six followed his example the decision of the matter was deferred till next day at the return of the old man to the inn they being about to break up that night and go to bed  the next day being sunday the landlord carried his guests to see the country and after a handsome walk they came through the churchyard they were poring upon the tombs no delight can be greater to mr campbell than that and really by the frequent walks he usually takes in westminsterabbey and the churchyards adjacent to this metropolis one would imagine he takes delight to stalk along by himself on that dumb silent ground where the characters of the persons are only to be known as his own meaning is by writings and inscriptions on the marble when they had sufficiently surveyed the churchyard it grew near dinnertime and they went homewards but before they had got many yards out of the churchyard mr campbell makes a full stop pointing up to a house and stopping his friends a little he pulls out of his pocket a pencil and paper and notes down the following words that that is the house my vision presented to me i could swear it to be the same i know it to be the same i am certain of it the gentlemen with him remarked it would not take any farther notice at that time intending to inquire into it with secrecy and so went on to the inn to dinner  as merry as they had been the night before after supper they were still more innocently cheerful this day after dinner till the time of service begun when the duty of the day was performed and over they returned to divert and unbend their minds with pleasant but harmless conversation i suppose no body but a set of very great formalists will be offended with scandal or scruples that to travelers just ready to depart the town mr perkin came on that good day and decided the wagers by owning to all the company secrecy being first enjoined that he was a roman catholic though no body of the family knew it in so many years as he had lived there which was before mr campbell was born this and other innocent speeches afforded as much cheerfulness as the lords day would allow of  on the next day being monday they sent for one mr toland toler an attorney of the place to find out to whom that house belonged but by all the inquiry that could possibly be made with convenient secrecy no body could find it out for a long time but at last it came to light and appeared to be justly to a tittle as mr campbell had predicted  being now satisfied the next day our three travelers returned for london and the two vocal men were very jocular upon their adventure and by their outward gesticulations gave the prophetical mute his share of diversion mr barnard as they passed into a farmhouseyard remarked that all the hogs fell a grunting and squeaking more and more as mr campbell came nearer who poor man could know nothing of the jest nor the cause of it till they alighted and told it him by signs and writing said to mr saxon laughing now we have found out our house we shall have only mr campbell home again by himself we have no farther need of the devil that accompanied him to the country up to town with us there are other devils enough to be met with there he knows and so this according to the fashion of his predecessor devils is entered into the herd of swine  however the event of this journey to cut the story short procured mr saxon a great insight upon inquiry into several affairs belonging to him of which he would otherwise have had no knowledge and he is now engaged in a chancery suit to do himself justice and in a fair way of recovering great sums of money which without the consultation he had with this dumb gentleman he had in all likelihood never dreamt of  in the year      a gentleman whose name shall be in this place amandus famed for his exquisite talents in all arts and sciences but particularly for his gentleman like and entertaining manner of conversation whose company was affected by all men of wit who grew his friends and courted by all ladies of an elegant taste who grew his admirers this accomplished gentleman i say came to mr campbell in order to propound a question to him which was so very intricate and so difficult to answer that if he did answer it it might administer to himself and the ladies he brought with him the pleasure of admiration in seeing a thing so wonderful in itself performed or on the other hand if he did not make a satisfactory reply to it then it might afford him and the ladies a very great delight in being the first that puzzled a man who had had the reputation for so many years of being capable of baffling all the wittiest devices and shrewd stratagems that had been from time to time invented to baffle his skill and explode his penetration in the secondsight and the arts which he pretended to the persons whom amandus brought with him were the illustrious lady delphina distinguished for her great quality but still more celebrated for her beauty his own lady the admired amabella and a young blooming pretty virgin whom we will call by the name of adeodata about which last lady the question was to be put to mr campbell adeodata it seems was the natural daughter of this very fine gentleman who had never let her into the knowledge of her own birth but had bred her up from her infancy under a borrowed name in the notion that she was a relations daughter and recommended to his care in her infancy now the man that had the secondsight was to be tried it was now to be put to the proof if he could tell names or no amandus was so much an unbeliever as to be willing to hazard the discovery  amabella and delphina were strangers to her real name and asked duncan campbell not doubting but he would set down that which she ordinarily went by amabella had indeed been told by amandus that adeodata was the natural daughter of a near friend of his but who this near friend was remained a secret that was the point which lay upon our duncan campbell to discover when the question was proposed to him what her name was he looked at her very steadfastly and shook his head and after some time he wrote down that it would be a very difficult name for him to fix upon and truly so it proved he toiled for every letter till he sweated and the ladies laughed incontinently imagining that he was in an agony of shame and confusion at finding himself pozd he desired amandus to withdraw a little for that he could not so well take a full and proper survey of ladies faces when a gentleman was by this disturbance and perplexity of his afforded them still more subject of mirth and that excuse was taken as a pretense and a putoff to cover his shame the better and hide from one at least that he was but a downright bungler in what he pretended to be so wonderful an artist however after two hours hard sweat and labor and viewing the face in different shades and lights for i must observe to the reader that there is a vast deal of difference some he can tell in a minute or two with ease some not in less than four or five hours and that with great trouble he undeceived them with regard to his capacity he wrote down that adeodatas real name was amanda as being the natural daughter of amandus delphina and amabella were surpised at the discovery and amandus when he was called in owning it a truth his wife amabella applauded the curious way of her coming by such a discovery when adeodata was just marriageable took a liking to her as if her own daughter and every thing ended with profit mirth and cheerfulness i could add a thousand more adventures of mr campbells life but that would prove tedious and as the town has made a great demand for the book it was thought more proper to conclude it here the most diverting of all are to be found best to the life in original letters that passed between mr campbell and his correspondents some select ones of which will be shortly published in a little pocketvolume for the farther entertainment of such readers as shall relish this treatise in which the author hopes he shall be esteemed to have endeavored at the intermingling of some curious disquisitions of learning with entertaining passages and to have ended all the merriest passages with a sober instructive and edifying moral which even to those who are not willing to believe the stories is reckoned sufficient to recommend even fables themselves  the appendix it is not that mr duncan campbell stands in need of my arguments to prove that he is in no respect liable to the acts of parliament made against fortunetellers etc that i undertake the writing of this appendix the true reason thereof being the more completely to finish this undertaking for having in the body of the book it self fully proved a secondsight and that the same frequently happens to persons some of them eminently remarkable for piety and learning and have from thence accounted for the manner of mr campbells performing those things he professes to the great surprise and no less satisfaction of all the curious who are pleased to consult him and at the same time proved the lawfulness of such his performances from the opinions of some of the most learned in holy science i thought it not improper to add the following short appendix being a summary of several acts of parliament made against fortunetellers conjurers egyptians sorcerers pretenders to prophesy etc with some proper remarks suited to our present purpose as well to satisfy them who are fantastically wise and obstinately shut their eyes against the most refulgent reason and are wilfully deaf to the most convincing and persuasive arguments and thereupon cry out that mr campbell is either an impostor and a cheat or at least a person who acts by the assistance of unlawful powers as also to put to silence the no less waspish curs who are always snarling at such whom providence has distinguished by more excellent talents than their neighbors true merit is always the mark against which traducers level their keenest darts and wit and invention oftentimes join hands with ignorance and malice to foil those who excel art has no greater enemy than ignorance and were there no such thing as vice virtue would not shine with half its luster did mr campbell perform those wonderful things he is so deservedly famous for as these cavillers say by holding intelligence with infernal powers or by any unjustifiable means i am of opinion he would find very few in this atheistical age who would open their mouths against him since none love to act counter to the interest of that master they industriously serve and did he on the other hand put the cheat upon the world as they maliciously assert i fancy he would then be more generally admired especially in a country where the game is so universally artfully and no less profitably played and that with applause since those pretenders to wisdom merrily divide the whole species of mankind into the two classes of knaves and fools fixing the appellation of folly only upon those whom they think not wise that is wicked enough to have a share with them in the profitable guilt  our laws are as well intended by their wise makers to skreen the innocent as to punish the guilty and where their penalties are remarkably severe the guilt they punish is of a proportionable size art which is a mans property when acquired claims a protection from those very laws which false pretenders thereto are to be tried and punished by or else all science would soon have an end for no man would dare make use of any talent providence had lent him and his own industrious application had improved should he be immediately tried and condemned by those statutes which are made to suppress villains by every conceited and half learned pedant  it is true indeed those excellent statutes which are made against a sort of people who pretend to fortunetelling and the like are such as are well warranted as being built upon the best foundation viz religion and policy and were mr campbell guilty of any such practice as those are made to punish i openly declare that i should be so far from endeavoring to defend his cause that i would be one of the first that should aggravate his crime thereby to enforce the speedier execution of those laws upon him which are made against such offenders but when he is so far from acting that he does not even pretend to any such practice or for countenancing the same in others as is manifest from the many detections he has made of that sort of villainy which the book furnishes us with i think my self sufficiently justified for thus pleading in his defense  i cannot but take notice in reading the statutes made against such offenders our wise legislature has not in any part of them seemed so much as to imply that there are in reality any such wicked persons as they are made against to wit conjurers etc but that they are only pretenders to those infernal arts as may reasonably be inferred from the nature of the penalties they inflict for our first laws of that sort only inflicted a penalty which affected the goods and liberty of the guilty and not their lives though indeed they were afterward forced to heighten the punishment with a halter not that they were better convinced as i humbly conceive but because the criminals were most commonly persons who had no goods to forfeit and to whom their liberty was no otherwise valuable but as it gave them the opportunity of doing mischief indeed our law books do furnish us with many instances of persons who have been tried and executed for witchcraft and sorcery but then the wiser part of mankind have taken the liberty to condemn the magistrate at that time of day of too much inconsideration and the juries of an equal share of credulity and those who have suffered for such crimes have been commonly persons of the lowest rank whose poverty might occasion a dislike of them in their fellow creatures and their too artless defense subject them to their mistaken justice so that upon the whole i take the liberty to conclude and i hope not without good grounds that those laws were made to deter men from an idle pretense to mysterious and unjustifiable arts which if too closely pursued commonly lead them into the darkest villainy not only that of deceiving others but as far as in them lie making themselves slaves to the devil and not to prevent and hinder men from useful enquiries and from the practice of such arts which though they are in themselves mysterious yet are and may be lawful  i would not however be thought in contradiction to my former arguments to assert that there never were or that there now are no persons such as wizards sorcerers etc for by so doing i should be as liable to be censured for my incredulity as those who defame mr campbell on that account are for their want of reason and common honesty holy and profane writ i confess furnishes us with many instances of such persons but we must not from thence hastily infer that all those men are such who are spightfully branded with the odious guilt for were it in the devils power to make every wicked man a wizard and woman a witch he soon would have agents enough to shake this lower world to atoms but the almighty who restrains him likewise restrains those  having premised thus much i shall now proceed to consider some of the acts of parliament themselves the persons against whom they were made and the necessity of making the same and some of the first acts we meet with were those which were made against a sort of people called egyptians persons who if in reality such might if any be suspected of practicing what we call the black art the same having been for many ages encouraged in their country nay so much has it been by them favored that it was introduced into their superstitious religion if i may without an absurdity call it so and made an essential part thereof and i believe mahometism has not much mended the matter since it has imperiosly reigned there or in any respect reformed that idolatrous nation now the mischief these persons might do being so much in the devils power among the unwary was thought too considerable not to be provided against and therefore our wise legislature the more effectually to prevent the same by striking at the very foundation made an act in the    h viii   that if any calling themselves egyptians do come into this realm they shall forfeit all their goods and being demanded shall depart the realm within fifteen days upon pain of imprisonment and the importers of them by another act were made liable to a heavy penalty this act was continued by the   p and m conjuration witchcraft enchantment and sorcery to get money or consume any person in his body members or goods or to provoke any person to unlawful love was by the    h viii    and the   eliz    and the   jac i    made felony and by the same    h viii    it was made felony to declare to another any false prophesies upon arms etc but this act was repealed by the   ed vi    but by another act of the   and   of ed vi    it was again enacted that all such persons who should pretend to prophesies etc should upon conviction for the first offense forfeit ten pounds and one years imprisonment and for the second offense all his goods and imprisonment for life and by the   ed vi    the same was made to continue but till the then next sessions of parliament and by the   eliz    the same act was again renewed against fantastical prophesiers etc but both those acts were repealed by the   jac i     thus far we find that for reasons of state and for the punishment of particular persons those acts were made and repealed as occasion required and not kept on foot or indeed were they ever made use of as i can remember in my reading against any persons whose studies led them into a useful enquiry into the nature of things or a lawful search into the workings of nature itself by which means many things are foretold long before they come to pass as eclipses and the like which astrologers successfully do whose art has been in all ages held in so great esteem that the first monarchs of the east made it their peculiar study by which means they deservedly acquired to themselves the name of magi or wise men but on the contrary were provided against persons profligate and loose who under a pretense and mask of science commit vile and roguish cheats and this will the more plainly appear if we consider the letter and express meaning of the following acts wherein the persons i am speaking of are described by such characters which sufficiently prove the assertion for in the    of eliz   it was enacted that all persons calling themselves scholars going about begging seafaring men pretending losses of their ships and goods at sea and going about the country begging or using any subtle craft feigning themselves to have knowledge in phisiognomy palmistry or any other the like crafty science or pretending that they can tell destinies fortunes or such like fantastical imaginations shall be taken and deemed rogues vagabonds sturdy beggars and shall be stripped naked from the middle upwards and whipped till his or her body be bloody and by the   jam      for the better restraining of the said offenses and for the farther punishing the same it was farther enacted that any person or persons using witchcraft sorcery etc and all their aiders abettors and counselors being convicted and attainted of the same offenses shall suffer pain of death as felons without the benefit of clergy or to tell and declare in what place any treasure of gold and silver should or might be found in the earth or other secret places or where goods or things lost or stolen should be found or become or to provoke any person to unlawful love such offender to suffer imprisonment for one whole year without bail or mainprize and once in every quarter of the said year shall in some market town or upon the market day or at any such time as any fair shall be kept there stand openly in the pillory by the space of six hours and there shall openly confess his or their offense and for the second offense shall suffer death as felons without the benefit of clergy  that these laws were made against a set of villains whose natural antipathy to honesty and labor furnished them with pretensions to an uncommon skill thereby the more easily to gull and cheat the superstitiously credulous and by that means discover from them some such secrets that might farther them in perpetrating the more consummate villainy is plain from the very words and expressions of the very acts themselves and the description of the persons they are made against and not as i before observed to prevent and hinder men from the lawful inquiry after useful delightful and profitable knowledge  mr campbell who has been long a settled and reputable inhabitant in many eminent parts of the city of london cannot i am sure be looked upon as one of those these acts of parliament were made against unless we first strip the acts themselves of their own natural express and plain meaning and cloth them with that which is more obscure unnatural forced and constrained a practice which if allowed would make them wound the innocent and clear the guilty and render them not our defense but our greatest evil they would by that means become a perfect aenigma and be so far from being admired for their plainness that they would be even exploded like the oracles of the heathen for their double meaning  if mr campbell has the secondsight as is unquestionable from the allowed maxim that what has been may be again and by that means can take a view of contingencies and future events so long as he confines these notices of approaching occurrences to a good purpose and makes use of them only innocently and charitably to warn persons from doing such things that according to his conceptions would lead them into misfortune or else in putting them upon such arts that may be of use and benefit to themselves and posterity always having a strict regard to morality and religion to which he truly adheres certainly i think he ought so much the more to be admired for the same by how much the more this his excellent knowledge is surpassing that of other men and not be therefore unjustly upbraided with the injurious character of a cheat or an ill man however this i will presume to affirm and i doubt not but to have my opinion confirmed by the learned sages of the law that this his innocent practice and i venture to add honest one too does by no means entitle him to the penalties of the beforementioned laws made against fortune tellers and such sort of profligate wretches which it is as great an absurdity to decry as it would be to call him who is a settled and reputable inhabitant a stroller or wandering beggar  again it is true that mr campbell has relieved many that have been supposed to have been bewitched as is related and well attested in the book of his life but will any one from thence argue that he himself is a real conjurer or wizard because he breaks the chains by which those unhappy wretches were bound no surely for if that were the case we might then as well indict the physician who drives away a malignant distemper and roots out its latent cause by his mysterious skill in plants and drugs or conclude that the judge who condemns a criminal is for the same reason guilty of the selfsame crime for which the offender is so by him condemned persons who delight in such unnatural conclusions must certainly be in love with the greatest absurdities and must entirely abandon their natural reason before they can be brought to conclude that the prince of darkness would assist men in destroying his own power  the best answer i can afford those men is silence for if they will not argue upon the principles of reason or be guided by her dictates i think them no more fit to be contended with in a rational and decent manner than bedlamites and such who are bereft of all understanding a rod is the best argument for the back of a fool and contempt the best usage that ought to be shown to every headstrong and ignorant opponent  in a word i know of no branch of mr campbells practice that bears the least resemblance to those crimes mentioned in the foregoing acts that he can and does tell peoples names at first sight though perfect strangers to him is confessed by all who have made the curious enquiry at his hands but what part of the acts i would fain know is that against knowledge and a clear sight into things not common is not only an allowable but a commendable qualification and whether this knowledge in him be inherent accidental or the result of a long study the case is still the same since we are assured he does it by no unlawful intelligence or makes use of the same to any ill purpose and therefore is undoubtedly as lawful as to draw natural conclusions from right premises hard is the fate of any man to be ignorant but much harder would his lot be if he were to be punished for being wise and like mr campbell excelling others in this kind of knowledge  much more might be said in defense of mr campbell and the art he professes but as the arguments which are brought against him by his enemies on the one hand are trivial and illgrounded i therefore think they deserve no farther refutation so on the other his innocence is too clear to require it  after having thus taken a survey of mr campbells acts with regard to their legality according to the statutes and the laws of the nation wherein he lives we will consider next whether according to the stated rules of casuistry among the great divines eminent for their authority it may be lawful for mr campbell to predict or for good christian persons to visit his house and consult him about his predictions i have upon this head examined all the learnedest casuists i could meet with in ancient times for i cannot meet in my reading with any moderns that treat thoroughly upon this case or i should rather have chosen them because perhaps the seondsight was less known in those ancient days than it has been since and so might escape their notice  my design is first to give the reader a distinct summary of all that has been said of this matter and to do it as succinctly and briefly as possible and then to argue myself from what they agree upon as to this mans particular case  that the reader may have recourse to the authors themselves if they have a curiosity and find that i dont go about to impose upon their judgments i will here tell the reader where he may find the whole contents of the following little abstract of divinity and casuistry because it would be a tedious piece of work to set down the words of each of them distinctly and quote them every one round at the end of their several different sentences which tend to the same meaning but i will strictly keep to the sense of them all and i here give the reader their names and the places that he may consult them himself if his inclination leads him to be so curious thomas aquinas   distin    quaestio   art   bona   did

maleficorum  these divines have generally written upon impious arts of magic which they call by the name of divination and this divination as they term it they divide into two kinds the one in which the devil is expressly invoked to teach hidden and occult things the other in which he is tacitly called upon to do the same an express invocation is by word or deed by which a real pact is actually made with the devil and that is a sin that affects the death of the soul according to the laws of theology and ought to effect the death of the body according to civil and political laws the tacit invocation of demons is then only when a man busies himself so far with such persons that it is meet and just that the devil should be permitted to have to do with him though it was opposite to the intention of the man  but then this express invocation again is subdivided into several species according to the diverse manners by which the devil instructs these men  the first is enchantment which i need not describe and of which i will speak no more because it is what every body knows to be detestable and no body ought to know the art thereof  the second is divination by dreams when any instructions are expected from the devil by way of dream which is a capital crime  the third is called necromancy which is when by the use of blood and writing or speaking certain verses the dead seem to rise again and speak and teach future things for though the devil cannot recall a soul departed yet he can as some have thought take the shape of the dead corpse himself actuate it by his subtilty as if it was informed with a soul and some affirm that by the divine permission the devil can do this and spoke so in the case of samuel and saul but divines of a more solid genius attribute that power only to the deity and say with reason that it is beyond the devils capacity but it is certain this was a divination done in dead animals by the use of their blood and therefore the word is derived from the greek  which significs dead and  which signifies divination  the fourth species is called divination by the pythians which was taken from apollo the first diviner as thomas aquinas says in his secunda secundae qu    artic    the fifth is called geomancy which is when the devil teaches any thing by certain signs appearing in the earthly bodies as in wood iron or polishd stones berylls or glass  the sixth is named hydromancy as when a demon teaches any thing by appearances in the water  the seventh is styled aeromancy and it is when he informs people of such things by figures in the air  the eighth is entitled pyromancy that is when it instructs people by forms appearing in the fire  the ninth is termed aruspicy which is when by signs appearing in the bowels of sacrificed animals the demon predicts at altars  thus far as to express divination or invocation of the devil which is detestable and the very consulting of persons that use such unlawful means is according to the judgment of all casuists the high road to eternal damnation  now as to tacit divination or invocation of the devil that is divided into two subaltern kinds the first kind is when for the sake of knowing hidden things they make use of a vain and superstitious disposition existing in things to judge from which disposition is not of a sufficient virtue to lead them to any real judgment the second kind of tacit divination is when that knowledge is sought by the disposition of those things which men effect on purpose and of their own accord in order to come by and acquire that knowledge  both these kinds of tacit divination are again subdivided into several species as are particularly mentioned by st thomas secunda secundoe quaest    artic   gregory de valentine tomo   disput   quaest    puncto   toletus in summa lib   cap    and michael medina lib   de recta in deumfide post sanctum augustinum lib   de doct christ cap    and sequen  the first of these kinds of tacit divination contains under it the following several species  the first species is called genethliacal which is when from the movement or situation of the stars mens nativities are calculated and enquired into so far as that from such a search they pretend to deduce the knowledge of human effects and the contingent events that are to attend them this thomas aquinas and sixtus quintus condemns but i shall with humility and submission to greater judgments enquire hereafter into their reasons and give my opinion why i think this no evil art but i submit my opinion if after it is given it is thought erroneous  the second is augury when any thing is predicted from the chattering of birds or the voice of animals and this may be either lawful or unlawful if it comes from natural instinct for brutes having only a sensitive soul have their organs subject to the disposition of the greater bodies in which they are contained and principally of all to the celestial bodies his augury is not amiss for if when crows are remarked to kaw as the vulgar phrase is more than ordinary it is judging according to the instinct of their nature if we expect rain and we may reasonably depend upon it we shall be right if we foretell rain to be at hand but sometimes the devils actuate those brute animals to excite vain ideas in men contrary to what the instinct of their nature compels them to this is superstitious and unlawful and forbid in holy writ  the third is aruspicy when from the flight of birds or any other motion of any animals whatsoever persons pretend to have an insight and a penetrative knowledge into occult and hidden matters  the fourth consists in omens when for example a man from any words which others may have spoken on purpose or by accident pretends to gather a way of looking into and knowing any thing of futurity  the fifth is chiromancy which consists in making a pretense to the knowledge of future things by the figures and the lines of the hands and if it be by consulting the shoulderbones of any beast it goes by the name of spatulamancy  as the first kind of divination by a tacit invocation of the devil is divided into the five species above mentioned so also is the second kind of tacit divination or invocation of the devil divided into two species by st thomas of aquin secunda secundae quaestione nonagesima quinta articulo tertio and too tedious to insert here  now all these ways are by these divines counted wicked and i set them down that people may avoid them for how many gypsies and pretenders to chyromancy have we in london and in the country how many that are for hydromancy that pretend in water to show men mighty mysteries and how many in geomancy with their berylls and their glasses that if they are not under the instigation of the devil propagate the scandal at least by being cheats and who ought to be punished to the utmost severity as our english laws enact mr campbell who hates contemns and abhors these ways ought methinks to be encouraged by their being restrained and people of curious tempers who always receive from him moral and good instructions which make em happy in the conduct of life should be animated in a public manner to consult him in order to divert the curious itch of their humors from consulting such wicked impostors or diabolical practicers as too frequently abound in this nation by reason of the inquisitive vulgar who are more numerous in our climate than any i ever read of  but now to argue the case of conscience with regard to his particular practice by way of the secondsight whether in foro conscientiae it is lawful for him to follow it or others to consult him the divines abovementioned having never had any notice of that faculty in all likelihood or if they had never mentioning it makes it a point more difficult for me to discuss but i think they have stated some cases by the making of which my premises i can deduce from all the learned men i have above quoted a conclusion in favor of our mr duncan campbell and of those who consult him but my opinion shall be always corrected by those who are wiser than my self and to whom i owe entire submission i take leave to fix these premises from them first and to form my argument from them afterward in the following manner  first it is allowed by all these divines that a knowledge which one may have of future things within the order of nature is and may be lawful  secondly they imply that where justice is not violated it is lawful both to predict and to consult  thirdly many of them but particularly aureolus puts this question is it lawful to go to one that deals in the black art to persuade them to cure any innocent body that another necromancer or dealer in the black art may have maliciously afflicted and tormented with pains and some of these casuists particularly aureolus say it is lawful on such an occasion to go to such a conjurer because the end is not conjuration but freeing a person from it  but i take leave to dissent from these great men and think they are in a double mistake first in stating the question and then in making such an answer provided the question had been stated right  the question is founded upon this supposition which is past by as granted viz that one necromancer could release a person bewitched by another which is absolutely false for it is against the nature of the devil to be made an instrument to undo his own works of impiety but admitting and not granting this to be possible and the question to be rightly stated why still these casuists are out in their answer it is lawful reply they because the end of going to the conjurers is not conjuration but freeing a good person from it but the end is not the point here to be considered it is the medium which is bad that is to be considered it is by conjuration according to their hypothesis the other conjuration is to be dissolved and does not the common rule that a man must not do evil that good may come of it forbid this practice and to speak my opinion plainly in that case the friend that should consult a conjurer for that end would be only so kind to put his own soul in danger of being guilty of hell torments to relieve his afflicted friend from some bodily pains which twould be a virtue in him to suffer with patience and resignation  others almost all divines indeed agree that it is and may be lawful to go to a conjurer that torments another and give him money not to afflict the patient any longer because that is only feeing him to desist from acting after his conjuring manner  these premises thus settled if we allow the secondsight to be inborn and inbred and natural and common to some families which is proved in the book and if all that mr campbell has predicted in that secondsighted way terminates with moral advice and the profit of the consulter and without the violation of justice to others as the book shows all throughout if he can relieve from witchcraft as it seems oath is to be had he can which no one that deals in black art can do why then i need not draw the conclusion every reader will do it naturally they will avow all the strictest laws of casuistry and morality to be in favor of mr campbell and his consulters  finis
