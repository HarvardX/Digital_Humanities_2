the progress of amir timur or tamerlane in hindostan a d      higerah  00 tamerlane invades hindostan amir timur being informed of the commotions and civil wars of hindostan began his expedition into that country in the eight hundredth year of the higerah and on the twelfth of mohirrim in the following year arrived on the banks of the chule jallali a river on the frontiers of hindostan  he immediately dispatched amir shech noor ul dien to dispossess shab ul dien mubarick who had in charge the defense of the frontier districts when shech noor a d      hig  00 ul dien had arrived within a few miles of shab ul dien mubarick he summoned him to submit to timur but as the imperial general had previously retreated into a strong hold on the bank of the river round which he had drawn a ditch forming the place into an island he determined to defend himself to the last  shech noor ul dien however found means upon making his approaches to fill up the ditch but at night he suffered a considerable loss by a violent sally of the besieged whom in the end he repulsed and forced to take shelter within their walls amir timur himself advanced against the enemy with his whole army shab ul dien intimidated by the approach of timur stowed privately in forty boats his treasure and family and fell down the river being two days pursued in vain by shech noor ul dien who was detached with a party after him the garrison after the departure of their leader immediately surrendered  amir timur proceeded down the river to the conflux of the jimboo and chinab where there was a strong fort and town known by the name of tulmubini he ordered a bridge to be laid across by which his army might pass tamerlane lays tulmubini under contribution having pitched his camp without the town he laid it under a heavy contribution but whilst the inhabitants were very busy in collecting the sum demanded a complaint being made in the camp of the scarcity of provisions orders were issued to seize grain wherever it should be found the soldiers upon this hastened to search the town but not being content to take provisions alone the natural consequence was that a general plunder ensued the inhabitants massacred the inhabitants endeavoring to oppose this outrage were massacred without mercy  to besiege the citadel would but retard the designs of timur he therefore marched the next day after the massacre to a town called shawnawaze where he found more grain than was sufficient a d      hig  00 to serve his whole army shawnawaze pillaged he therefore ordered that what could not be carried away should be burnt having previously cut off jisserit the brother of shuha giker who had attempted to defend the place with two thousand men timur marched on the third day from shawnawaze and crossing the bea came into a rich and plentiful country  it may not be improper here to say something concerning the proceedings of mirza pier mahummud after his having as has been already mentioned taken moultan the solstitial rains having destroyed a great part of his cavalry in the field he was under the necessity of drawing his army into the city of moultan mirza pier mahummud blockaded in moultan there he was driven to the utmost distress by the inhabitants of the country who had closely invested him his cavalry instead of being able to act against them diminished daily in their numbers for want of forage  is relieved by timur in this untoward situation were the affairs of that prince when his grandfather amir timur entered hindostan who immediately reinforced mahummud with a detachment of thirty thousand chosen horse and soon joined him with his whole army the prince carried in his mind great animosity against the governor of battenize who had chiefly distressed him amir timur himself to chastise the governor selected ten thousand horse with which he marched directly toward him when he reached adjodin he was shown the tomb of shech ferid shuckergunge the poet in respect to whose memory he spared the few inhabitants who remained in the place the greater part having fled to delhi and battenize  who  at battenize timur continued then his march to battenize crossing the river of adjodin and encamping at chaliskole from which place in one day he marched fifty crores to battenize upon his arrival the people of debalpoor and other adjacent towns crowded into a d      hig  00 the place in such numbers that half of them were driven out and obliged to take shelter under the walls and invests it they were there attacked the first day by the king and some thousands of them slain raw chillige who was governor of the place seeing the enemy so few in number drew out the garrison and formed them without the town in order of battle the moguls however upon the first onset drove him back within his walls while the king himself pressed so hard upon the enemys rear that he possessed himself of the gates before they could be shut then driving the runaways from street to street he became in a few hours entirely master of the place except the citadel to reduce which he ordered a party immediately to dismount and begin to undermine it  the city taken the garrison desired to capitulate to which timur agreed and the governor having had an interview with the king presented him with three hundred arabian horses and with many of the valuable curiosities of hindostan timur in return honored him with a chelat and after the conditions were settled sent amir soliman sheh and omar ulla to take possession of the gates commanding them to slay all those who had taken refuge in the place and had before been active against his grandson mirza pier mahummud the rest after being plundered were ordered to be dismissed  and the inhabitants put to the sword in consequence of this inhuman order five hundred persons in a few minutes were put to death those who remained still within the sort were so struck with this massacre that they set fire to the place murdered their wives and children and in mere despair sought after nothing but revenge and death the scene now became terrible indeed but the unfortunate inhabitants were in the end cut off to a man they however revenged themselves amply upon the rapacious and inhuman authors of their distress some thousands a d      hig  00 of the moguls having fallen by their hands this so much exasperated amir timur that firebrand of the world that he ordered every soul in battenize to be massacred and to reduce the city itself to ashes  several cities taken by timur and the inhabitants massacred timur marching to surusti put the inhabitants of that place also to the sword and gave the town up to pillage advancing to fatteabad he continued the same scene of barbarity through that and the adjacent towns of rahib amirani and jonah he detached hakim agherack toward sammana with five thousand horse and with the few that remained he himself scoured the country and cut off a tribe of banditti called jits who had lived for some years by rapine his army in the mean time being divided under different chiefs carried fire and sword through all the provinces of moultan and lahore but when they advanced near the capital he ordered a general rendezvous at keitil a town within five crores of sammana  timur himself soon joined his army and having regulated the order of his march advanced toward delhi when he reached panniput he ordered his soldiers to put on their fighting apparel coats stuffed thick with cotton worn instead of armor  and that he might be the better supplied with forage crossed the jumna took the fort of lowni by assault and put the garrison to the sword arrives before delhi he then marched down along the river and encamped opposite to the citadel of delhi posting guards to prevent all communication he immediately detached amir soliman shaw and amir jehan shaw to scour the country behind him to the south and south east of the city which he reconnoitres whilst he himself that very day with seven hundred horse only crossed the river to reconnoitre the citadel  mahmood shaw and mullu eckbal chan seeing so few in the retinue of timur issued forth with five thousand foot and twentyseven a d      hig  00 elephants against him mahummud sillif an omrah of repute in delhi who led on the attack was repulsed and taken prisoner by the moguls timur ordered him to be immediately beheaded and after having made the observations which he designed repassed the river and joined his army  he next morning moved his camp more to the eastward where he was told by the princes and generals of his army that there were then above one hundred thousand prisoners in his camp who had been taken since he crossed the sind that these unfortunate persons had the day before expressed great joy when they saw him attacked before the citadel which rendered it extremely probable that on a day of battle they would join with their countrymen against him he massacres  00000 prisoners in cold blood the inhuman timur who might have found other means of prevention gave orders to put all above the age of fifteen to the sword so that upon that horrid day one hundred thousand men were massacred in cold blood this barbarity together with his other actions of equal cruelty gained him the name of hillak chan or the destroying prince  crosses the jumna upon the fifth of jemmad ul awil timur forded the river with his army without opposition and encamped on the plains of firoseabad where he entrenched himself filling the ditch with buffaloes fronting the enemy whom he fastened with ropes and picquets to their stations placing at the same time strong guards at proper distances behind them  though the astrologers pronounced the seventh an unlucky day the king marched out of his lines and drew up his army in order of battle sultan mamood and mullu eckbal chan with the army of delhi and one hundred and twenty elephants in mail advanced toward him but upon the very first charge of a squadron called the heroes of chighitta the elephantdrivers were dismounted a d      hig  00 and the outrageous animals deprived of their guides ran roaring back and spread terror and confusion among their own ranks totally defeats the enemy the veteran troops of timur who had already conquered half the world improved this advantage and the degenerate hindoos were in a few minutes totally routed without making one brave effort for their country lives and fortunes the conqueror pursued them with great slaughter to the very gates of delhi near which he fixed his quarters  who desert the city the consternation of the fugitives was so great that not trusting to their walls sultan mamood and mullu eckbal chan deserted in the night their capital the former flying to guzerat the latter taking the route of berren timur having intelligence of their flight detached parties after them one of which coming up with sultan mamood killed a great number of his retinue and took his two infant sons seif ul dien and choda daad prisoners timur received the submission of all the great men of the city who crowded to his camp and were promised protection upon paying great contributions and upon the friday following he ordered the chutba in all the mosques to be read in his own name upon the sixteenth of the same month he placed guards at the gates and appointed the scriviners of the city and magistrates to regulate the contribution according to the wealth and rank of the inhabitants information was in the mean time lodged that several omrahs and rich men had shut themselves up in their houses with their dependents and refused to pay down their share of the ransom this obliged timur shaw to send troops into the city to enforce the authority of the magistrates a general confusion uproar and plundering immediately ensued which could not be restrained by the mogul officers who at the same time durst not acquaint the king that their authority was contemned by the troops  a d      hig  00 timur was then busy in his camp in celebrating a grand festival on account of his victory so that it was five days before he received any intelligence of these proceedings the first notice he had of them was by the flames of the city for the hindoos according to their manner seeing their wives and daughters ravished and polluted their wealth seized by the hand of rapine and they themselves insulted beat and abused at length by one consent shut the city gates set fire to their houses murdered their wives and children and ran out like madmen against their enemies  a general massacre but little effect had the despair of the unfortunate upon the moguls who soon collected themselves and began a general massacre some streets were rendered impassable by the heaps of dead and in the mean time the gates being forced the whole mogul army were admitted then followed a scene of horror much easier to be imagined than described  the unparalleled misfortunes of the delhians the desperate courage of the unfortunate delhians was at length cooled in their own blood they threw down their weapons they submitted themselves like sheep to the slaughter they permitted one man to drive a hundred of them prisoners before him so that we may plainly perceive that cowardice is the mother of despair in the city the hindoos were at least ten to one superior in number to the enemy and had they possessed souls it would have been impossible for the moguls who were scattered about in every street house and corner laden with plunder to have resisted the dreadful assault but though the hindoos had the savage resolution of imbing their hands in the blood of their wives and children we find them still the slaves of fear and shrinking at the approach of that death which they could so readily execute upon others  nizam ul dien acnt of the  in delhi this massacre is in the history of nizam ul dien ahmud otherwise related the collectors of the ransom says he upon the part a d      hig  00 of timur having used great violence by torture and other means to extort money the citizens fell upon them and killed some of the moguls this circumstance being reported to the mogul king he ordered a general pillage and upon resistance a massacre to commence this account carries greater appearance of truth along with it both from timurs general character of cruelty and the improbability of his being five days close to the city without having intelligence of what passed within the walls  but the race of the mogul prince take to this day great pains to invalidate this opinion nor do they want arguments upon their side the principal one is this that in consequence of a general plunder the king would have been deprived of the ransom which must have been exceedingly great and for which he only received the elephants and regalia neither have we any account of his taking any part of the plunder from his army afterward though it must have been very immense  timur enters delhi the king after this horrid scene entered the city taking to himself one hundred and twenty elephants twelve rhinoceroses and a number of curious animals that had been collected by firose shaw the fine mosque built by that prince upon the stones of which he had inscribed the history of his reign being esteemed a masterpiece of architecture and taste took so much the fancy of the conqueror that he ordered stonecutters and masons from delhi to samarcand to build one upon the same plan  resolves to return marches to firoseabad after having stayed fifteen days at delhi timur took a sudden resolution of returning and he accordingly marched out to firoseabad whither bahadre nahir sent him two white parrots as curiosities from mewat with prosessions of subjection the king sent seid shumse ul dien turmuzi to bring him to the presence which a d      hig  00 summons he immediately obeyed and chizer chan who had lain concealed in the hills presented himself at court and was favorably received  and to paniput the king marching from firoseabad arrived at paniput from whence he detached amir shaw malluk to besiege merat a strong fort situated between the rivers about thirty crores from delhi when amir shaw malluk reached the place upon reconnoitring its strength and finding the garrison determined to defend it he mentioned in a letter to the king that they insulted him from the walls by telling him he could succeed no better than tirrim seri chan the mogul prince who had formerly attempted to take the place  besieges and takes merat this had the desired effect upon the king who immediately marched his army against merat and without delay began to sink his mines and carry on his approaches advancing his sap toward the walls at the rate of fifteen yards every twentyfour hours elias adyhuni the son of moluna ahmud jannasure and mulleck suffi kebire defended the place with great resolution but the moguls having filled up the ditch placed their scaling ladders and fastened their hookropes to the wall in spite of all opposition and without waiting for a breach by means of the mines stormed the place and put every soul within it to the sword the mines however being finished the king ordered them to be sprung which blew the walls and bastions into pieces  his progress toward the  of the ganges timur continued his march to the skirts of the mountains of sewalic marking his way with fire and sword crossing then the ganges he subdued the country as high as where the river issues from the mountains returning from thence he repassed the river and marched through the hills where he was opposed by a zemindar called zein dund whom he defeated and plundered a d      hig  00 he then continued his rout taking several small forts in his way having arrived at jimmugur he fought the raja of that place who was wounded taken and forced to become a mussulman  jisserit the brother of shuha gicker who had fled to him after his being defeated by timur shaw had by his brother been severely reprimanded for opposing the king which having been represented to timur shuha gicker was admitted into his presence and became a great favorite but when the king had marched on to delhi he remembered not his obedience and in the absence of timur possessed himself of lahore shuha gicker refuses to submit to timur timur takes lahore the king having returned to jimbo a fort in punjaab three days journey north of lahore  shuha gicker refused to submit to his authority the sultan sent part of his army to besiege shuha gicker in lahore which being taken in a few days he was brought prisoner to the king who ordered him to be instantly beheaded  we do not find that timur appointed any king to govern hindostan which he had in a great measure subdued he however confirmed the subas who had submitted to him in their governments and from this circumstance we may suppose that he intended to retain the empire in his own name though he left no troops behind him except a small detachment in delhi to secure it from further depredations while he remained at jimbo he appointed chizer chan viceroy of moultan lahore and dibalpoor then proceeded by the way of cabul to samurcand  section ii the conclusion of the reign of mahmood shaw a d      hig  00 the city of delhi had remained in anarchy for the space of two months when it was taken possession of by nuserit shaw with only two thousand horse from merat shab chan and malleck almass with their troops and ten elephants joined him soon after from the same place nuserit shaw sent immediately shab chan with his troops toward birren against eckbal chan who had there taken up his residence but shab chan was attacked in the night upon his march by the zemindars in the interest of eckbal chan and slain eckbal chan pursuing this advantage took all the baggage of shab chans army  this success raising the reputation as well as spirits of eckbal chan he in a few days thought himself in a condition to attempt the capital which he did with success for nuserit shaw upon his approach fled to merat eckbal chan recovers delhi and eckbal chan resumed the administration of affairs in the ruined city the inhabitants who had fled to different places having still a natural hankering after their old abode began to assemble again and the place in a short

chaja jehan was dead at jionpoor and that his adopted son kirrinphil having assumed the title of sultan mubarick shaw held that government eckbal chan being in alliance with shumse chan governor of biana mubarick chan and bahadre nahir of mewat marched the same year against kirrinphil  when he had reached the village of pattiali upon the banks of the ganges rai sere and all the zemindars of that country opposed him but he defeated them with great slaughter after this victory he marched to kinnoge with an intention to proceed to jionpoor and from thence to lucknouti frustrated in his designs upon the province of joupoor upon his march however he was met by mubarick shaw who opposed his crossing the ganges so effectually that after repeated efforts for two months he was forced to abandon the undertaking and to return to his own country a d   0  hig  0  his persidy but the perfidious eckbal entertaining some groundless suspicions of shumse chan and mubarick chan assassinated them both upon their way back to their own governments  sultan mahmood returns to delhi sultan mahmood shaw in the year  0  being disgusted with ziffer chan at guzerat fled from him to malava and soon after by the invitation of eckbal chan returned to delhi he however contented himself with a pension fearing that his interfering a d   0  hig  0  in the government would prove fatal to him advice being arrived that mubarick shaw was dead at jionpoor eckbal chan taking along with him sultan mahmood marched again toward kinnoge upon which sultan ibrahim the brother of mubarick shaw who had mounted the throne advanced with the troops of the east to meet him  his folly when the armies were near one another sultan mahmood dissatisfied with his condition and having the folly to imagine that sultan ibrahim would acknowledge him king and abdicate the throne for his sake escaped one day when he was out hunting to the army of ibrahim but when that prince learned the intentions of mahmood he even withheld from him the necessaries of life and intimated to him to quit the camp made governor of kinnoge sultan mahmood returned in great distress to kinnoge and was left by eckbal chan in the government of that city the governor who was formerly there on the part of sultan ibrahim being driven out ibrahim however put up with this insult and returned to jionpoor while eckbal chan retired to

shut himself up in the city and eckbal chan invested it for some time but not being able to reduce the place he raised the siege and marched toward sammana  byram chan byram chan a descendant of one of the turkish slaves of firose shaw had fixed himself in sammana and upon the approach of eckbal chan had fled to the hills of budhoor eckbal closely pursuing him encamped at the skirts of the mountains seid alim ul dien came to mediate matters and a peace was soon patched up between the contending parties and both joining their forces together marched toward moultan against chizer chan at tilbundi they were opposed by rai daood camal may and rai hubbu who were defeated and taken prisoners is flayed alive the perfidious eckbal chan after this victory without any apparent reason except a desire of aggrandizing himself seized upon byram chan and ordered him to be flayed alive  the death of byram did not remain long unrevenged eckbal arriving near adjodin chizer chan met him with the

received intelligence of this desertion crossed the ganges and marched toward delhi with great expedition when he had reached the banks of the jumna he heard that chan azim ziffer chan of guzerat had taken alip chan suba of mindu and the country of malava and was then upon his march toward jionpoor upon which he immediately retreated to cover the capital of his dominions  a d   0  hig   0 byram

commanded the fort of firosa the sultan after levying contributions returned the sultan besieged in feroseabad and chizer chan upon advice of these transactions marched against delhi and besieged sultan mahmood who was neither a warrior nor a politician in firoseabad but fortune for this time supplied the want of abilities in mahmood for chizer chan being in want of forage and grain was obliged to raise the siege and retire to fattipoor  a d      hig     chizer chan besieges mahmood in delhi chizer chan in the beginning of the year     returned by the way of rhotuck a country then in

but that famine which they designed for the sultan and his adherents recoiled upon themselves for a great drought had occasioned a scarcity of provisions between the rivers and in the neighborhood of delhi but retires insomuch that chizer chan was a second time forced to raise the siege and retire to fattipoor mahmood shaw being delivered from this imminent danger took no pains to strengthen himself against a future attack mahmood dies he took the diversion of hunting in the neighborhood of keitul where he was seized with a fever and died in the month of zecada and with him the empire of

two months he was just as unfit for the age in which he lived as he was unworthy of better times god was angry with the people of hindostan and he gave them mahmood whose only virtue was that his folly made him insensible in a great measure to those strokes of fortune which abilities much greater than his could not perhaps avert the omrahs soon after his death elected in his stead dowlat chan

brother and mahummud hassen returned to the army  sultan shirki advanced along the banks of the black river to burhanabad from thence to the village of raberi and so on to the banks of kinhire where he encamped mubarick shaw in the mean time crossing the jumna near chundwar encamped within five crores of the enemy both armies remained in their trenches for the space of twentytwo days during which

inhabitants into slavery a d      hig     turning then his forces toward raberi he wrested that country from the son of hassen chan gave it to malleck humza and afterward returned to delhi seid alum dying by the way his eldest son had the title of seid chan conferred upon him and the youngest that of suja ul muluck together with all the wealth of their father which was very great though according to the custom of hindostan it should become the property of the king  ingratitude of the sons of seid alum these favors however did not secure the faith of the sons of seid alum for they sent fowlad a turkish slave to tibberhind to stir up privately in their name an insurrection there they had formed hopes it is said that they might be sent with a force to suppress the rebellion and so have an opportunity to join the rebels but the plot was discovered and both imprisoned while in the mean time malleck eusuph and rai ibbu were sent to tibberhind to confiscate their estates and suppress the disturbance raised by fowlad  rebellion of fowlad fowlad entering into a negotiation lulled into a negligent security the imperial generals and sallying one night from his fort surprised their camp he was however so warmly received by the kings troops that he was soon driven back this did not deter him from making another effort next night at the same time making a great discharge of artillery from the works which struck a panic into the imperial troops who took immediately to their heels leaving their camp standing with all their baggage mubarick marches against him sultan mubarick upon receiving advice of that disaster was constrained to march toward tibberhind in person the rebel daily gathered strength and the king was obliged to call ameid ul muluck from moultan and several other governors to join him every thing for the expedition being prepared the sultan stopped at sursutti and dispatched the greatest part of his army to invest the fort of tibberhind fowlad sent a message to the imperial camp importing that he had a d      hig     great confidence in ameid ul muluck and said that if he should be sent with promise of pardon he himself would deliver up the place the sultan accordingly sent ameid ul muluck to tibberhind where fowlad met him a little without the gate having accordingly received assurances of pardon he promised to give up the place the next day but one of ameid ul mulucks attendants who was of fowlads acquaintance told him privately that though ameid ul muluck was a man of strict honor and would certainly adhere to his promise yet the king might not be so tender of preserving his and that it was very probable he might bring fowlad to punishment fowlad after the conference was over revolved this intimation in his own mind and repented seriously of his promise and therefore as he had both money and provisions he determined to hold out to the last  besieges him the sultan seeing that the taking of the place would be a work of time and that there would be no occasion for so great an army to besiege it he permitted ameid ul muluck to return with the forces of moultan and leaving islam chan lodi cummal chan and rai firose to carry on the siege he himself retired to delhi fowlad having held out six months he was greatly distressed and saw no means of extricating himself but by an alliance with amir shech ali governor of cabul on the part of mirza sharoch the mogul king he sent for this purpose messengers to him with large promises for his assistance the siege raised by the moguls as sultan mubarick shaw had taken no pains to keep upon good terms with the mogul the latter left cabul and being in his way joined by the gickers crossed the bea and ravaged the countries of those omrahs who carried on the siege and advancing toward tibberhind the imperial army decamped and fled fowlad for this signal service gave to shech ali two lacks of rupees and other presents and having given to him all the charge of his family exerted himself in repairing the fortifications and laying in provisions and ammunition  a d      hig     who avage the country amir shech ali crossing the suttuluz committed cruel depredations upon the unhappy country acquiring of plunder twenty times the value of the subsidy which he had received from fowlad advancing then to lahore he raised the usual tribute from secunder topha then returned toward dibalpoor desolating the country wherever he went insomuch that forty thousand hindoos were computed to have been massacred besides a greater number carried away prisoners ameid ul muluck posted himself to oppose ali at the town of tilbanna but he gave him the slip and went to chitpoor when ameid ul muluck received the sultans orders to retreat to save moultan march to moultan the flight of the imperial army encouraged the enemy to follow them beyond the ravi and to lay waste the country to within ten crores of moultan ali defeated there islam chan lodi who had been left to stop his progress  from thence the moguls advanced to cheirabad within three crores of the city and the next day which was the fourth of ramzan they made an assault upon the place but were beat back they continued however from their camp to make daily excursions toward the city putting all whom they could meet to the sword  the sultan sends an army against them the sultan being informed of these transactions sent fat chan and mubarick chan of guzerat with zirick chan malleck calla shenipile malleck eusoph kummal chan rai hibbu and other omrahs of distinction to succor ameid ul muluck who upon being joined by all these with their forces went out and offered battle to ali ali did not decline it and a furious conflict ensued in the beginning of which the moguls gained some advantage the moguls overthrown however upon the death of fat chan the gale of fortune changed and blew with the standards of hindostan shech ali at one stroke played away all his gains escaping with a few attendants only to cabul his whole army being either killed or drowned in the gelum in their precipitate flight  a d    0 hig     ameid ul muluck having pursued the runaways to shinnore returned victorious to moultan and the omrahs who had succored him repaired by the kings orders to delhi and soon after the sultan jealous of the success of ameid ul muluck called him also to court jisserit invades the empire jisserit took advantage of his absence crossed the gelum ravi and bea and fought malleck secunder topha near jillender defeated and took him prisoner with all his treasure and baggage besieges lahore he forthwith advanced and besieged lahore shech ali at the same time at the instigation of jisserit made another incursion toward moultan and having taken tilbunna by capitulation he broke his word plundered the place massacred all the men able to bear arms and carried their wives and children into captivity laying the town in ruins  fowlad taking also advantage of these disturbances marched out of tibberhind and invading the country of rai firose defeated him sultan mubarick shaw thought it now high time to march from delhi sultan mubarick raises the siege he accordingly upon the first of jemmad ul awil eight hundred and thirtyfive took the route of lahore appointing malleck surur his vizier governor of that place and to command in the van of his army malleck surur arriving at sammana jisserit raised the siege of lahore and retreated to the hills shech ali hastened back to cabul and fowlad again shut himself up in tibberhind the sultan upon this took the government of lahore from the vizier and gave it to nuserit chan birkandaz then returning encamped near panniput on the banks of the jumna sending ameid ul muluck with a part of the army to suppress some insurrections about gualier and malleck surur to besiege tibberhind he himself returning to delhi  mubarick marches against jisserit in the month of zihidge jisserit advanced again to lahore and commenced hostilities against nuserit chan which obliged the sultan in the year eight hundred and thirtysix to march from delhi as far as sammana intelligence was brought to him in that place of the death a d      hig     of his mother muchduma jehan and he immediately returned with a few attendants and after performing the funeral obsequies went back to his army after his arrival in the camp he suddenly changed his resolution and turned back toward mewat conferring the government of lahore upon malleck alleh daad lodi who promised to expel jisserit but jisserit upon hearing of the sultans return was joined by a great body of gickers who imagined that his affairs bore a better aspect so that he was in a condition to receive alleh daad lodi whom he defeated  the sultan having received the news of this overthrow and also that shech ali governor of cabul was coming toward tibberhind took again the rout of punjaab sending before him ameid ul muluck to reinforce the omrahs who were besieging tibberhind shech ali takes lahore upon his approach malleck shech ali who stood in awe of him laid aside his intentions of coming to tibberhind and turned away by forced marches toward lahore which he surprised and began a horrid scene of massacre and depredation but hearing that the sultan had reached tilbundi ali left a garrison of two thousand men in the place and retreated toward cabul ravaging the country in his way and leaving his nephew muziffer in the fort of shinnore  the sultan a second time advanced malleck secunder topha who had ransomed himself to the government of lahore dibalpoor and jillender upon which he advanced and laid siege to the city which is retaken by mubarick he took it by capitulation and permitted the garrison to retire to cabul he immediately crossed the ravi near tilbundi and invested shinnore shinnore capitulates malleck muziffer held up in that place the standard of opposition for a whole month but being hard pressed he capitulated by giving his daughter to the sultan and paying a great ransom for his liberty mubarick left a great part of his army at dibalpoor and with a select body marched himself to moultan to visit the tombs of the saints from whence he returned in a few a d      hig     days to his camp he at this time turned secunder topha again out of his government of lahore and gave it to ameid ul muluck and returned with great expedition to delhi being jealous of the power of surur ul malleck the vizier he joined kammal ul dien with him in the vizarit and the latter being esteemed a man of superior abilities he soon gained the favor of his sovereign and the people  a conspiracy formed against the sultan surur ul malleck became dissatisfied and began to project treason having gained over sidarin and sidpal two great hindoo chiefs of the tribe of kittrie miran sidder deputy to the aziz mumalick casi abdul summud lord of the private chambers and others they watched an opportunity to assassinate the king  about this time mubarick shaw had ordered a city to be founded upon the banks of the jumna calling it mubarick abad and made an excursion toward tibberhind as it were to take the diversion of hunting having on the way received advices that tibberhind was taken and being presented with the head of fowlad he returned to mubarick abad he there received intelligence that war was carrying on between sultan ibrahim shirki and sultan hoshung malavi near calpie which was a very agreeable piece of news to mubarick shaw who sought an opportunity to expel sultan shirki from his dominions he therefore gave orders to muster his army and pitching his tent without the city delayed a few days in regulating and collecting his forces during which time he continued to visit the new works without fear of danger having never given offense to his nobility except in changing or turning them out of their governments when they misbehaved  he is assasinated upon the ninth of the month of rigib in the year eight hundred and thirtyseven according to his custom he went to worship at a new mosque which he had built at mubarick abad with only a few attendants the conspirators rushed in in armor with drawn a d      hig     swords upon him and basely assassinated him surur ul malleck having previously settled matters with sultan mahummud one of the grandsons of chizer chan raised that prince to the throne  his character mubarick shaw reigned thirteen years three months and sixteen days he was esteemed a man of parts just and benevolent and though no great warrior had he lived in a virtuous age there is no doubt but he possessed talents which might render him worthy of a throne  section vi the reign of sultan mahummud shaw ben ferid chan ben chizer chan mahummud shaw mounts the throne according to the custom of the world which cannot subsist without rule the same day that sultan mubarick shaw was sent to eternity mahummud shaw was established upon the throne the ungrateful assassin surur ul malleck received the title of chan jehan and seized upon the kings treasure regalia and other effects discharging all the old omrahs from office and appointing new ones who might in time serve his ambitious views  the omrahs disguise their discontent kummal ul malleck and other omrahs who were in the camp having consulted among themselves upon hearing of the kings death resolved rather than kindle a civil war in the country to bear with the times to pay allegiance to the new king and to wait a more proper and more certain opportunity of taking revenge upon the conspirators they came into the city and paid their compliments to mahummud shaw the first preferments which the a d      hig     the viziers tyranny vizier gave away to facilitate his future schemes was to appoint the two hindoo conspirators to the governments of biana amrohi narnoul and coram and miran sidder with the title of moain ul malleck was presented with a very considerable jagier the son of seid salem was dignified with the title of chan azim seid chan and the government of several countries were conferred upon him but the omrahs and dependants of mubarick shaw were by tricks and false accusations killed imprisoned banished robbed or turned out of office  a slave of surur ul malleck whose name was rana shech was sent collector of the revenues to biana but eusoph chan lodi fought and slew him near that place the omrahs rise in arms at the same time some of the omrahs of mubarick shaw and of chizer chan who saw that there was a design on foot to deprive them of their jagiers particularly malleck chimun governor of budaoon malleck alleh daad lodi who commanded at simbol mere ali of guzerat and amir shech the turk erected the spear of rebellion upon which the vizier deceived by the behavior of kummal ul malleck gave him the command of the army and sent chan azim sidarin and his own son eusoph along with him to suppress the rebels but when they came to the village of birren kummal ul malleck intended to take revenge on sidarin and eusoph for the murder of the king he therefore acquainted malleck allah daad lodi of his resolutions who for that reason made no motion toward them this design being however discovered to the vizier he sent malleck hoshiar his own slave with a great army under pretense of succors with private instructions to prevent the effects of the plot kummal ul malleck however had at ahare joined his forces with malleck alla daad lodi before the reinforcement under the viziers slave arrived the viziers army revolts hoshiar hearing of this junction thought that there was no safety for him and he therefore fled with eusoph and sidarin to delhi kummal ul a d      hig     malleck immediately sent to call the disaffected omrahs who joined him without delay and march to delhi so that upon the last of ramzan he moved with a great army toward delhi  the vizier besieged in the citadel the vizier shut himself up in the citadel of seri which he held out three months but as the party of kummal ul malleck daily gained strength and reputation he was driven to great distress the sultan plots against him sultan mahummud shaw perceiving that his own affairs would be ruined if he should adhere to the vizier endeavored to conciliate matters with the besiegers and at the same time sought an opportunity of making his escape or cutting off the vizier  the vizier discovering this plot designed to be beforehand with the sultan accordingly upon the eighth of mohirrim with the sons of miran sidder and with some of his own

immediately betook themselves to flight is slain but the vizier was cut to pieces as he was rushing out of the door and thus met the fate which he designed for his lord the sons of miran sidder and the rest of the assassins were taken and put to death while malleck hoshiar and malleck mubarick who were parties concerned were publicly executed the kittries and other adherents of surur ul malleck

he brought with him all the other provincial omrahs hastened to the camp and were honored with dresses and other marks of favor and distinction the sultan moved toward moultan to make a parade with his army and having visited the tombs of the saints returned to his capital  and to sammana in the year eight hundred and forty he marched toward sammana and detached a part of his army against jisserit the gicker who was raising disturbances gives himself up to indolence and pleasure the country of jisserit was plundered and the king returned to delhi where he gave himself up entirely to pleasure neglecting all the cares and necessary affairs of government the accounts of the sultans luxurious indolence soon affected the state a revolt in moultan dissatisfaction began to appear first in moultan where a tribe of patans called linga rose in rebellion at the same time malleck beloli lodi who after the death of his uncle islam chan became governor of sirhind without any orders possessed himself of the city and districts of lahore and debalpoor with all the country back to panniput  malleck beloli defeats the imperial army the sultan receiving intelligence of this revolt sent his whole army against him who drove him back to the hills in the retreat many chiefs of distinction were put to the sword but malleck beloli a d      hig     recruited his army and when the sultans forces were withdrawn he again possessed himself of all the countries from which they had driven him the sultan this time sent hissam chan the viziers deputy against him who was defeated and beat back to delhi upon which malleck beloli wrote to the sultan that if he would put hissam chan to death who by his intrigues had been the occasion of this rebellion he would lay down his arms  the sultans concessions to the rebels the sultan was weak enough to listen to this arrogant proposal and accordingly gave orders for the death of hissam chan he also deprived kummal chan of the vizarit and conferred it upon hamid chan appointing another person deputy with the title of hissam chan alienate the  of his subjects the governors of the provinces observing this pusillanimous and impolitic behavior of the king predicted his destruction and endeavored to secure their own independency confusions in the empire while the subjects and zemindars foreseeing the convulsions that must have

his dominions and sultan mahmood chillegi king of malava made an attempt on the capital and in the year eight hundred and forty four advanced within two crores of the city mahummud shaw struck with terror in this urgent situation of affairs imprudently sent an embassy to malleck beloli lodi to beg his assistance beloli accordingly with twenty thousand persian horse came to delhi the  behavior of the king mahummud shaw though his army was greatly superior to the enemy was afraid to take the field by himself but committed the charge of the whole to his omrahs and reposed himself in the haram

not present he thought it was meant as an affront to him and to be on a footing with mahummud he committed the charge of his army to his sons yeaz ul dien and kuddir chan a drawn battle the two armies having engaged the troops of delhi gave way and left malleck beloli alone to dispute the field which he maintained with invincible resolution till the fugitives ashamed of their behavior returned to the action night however coming on the victory was left undecided sultan mahmood chilligi being greatly frightened by a dream that night and having heard in the morning that sultan ahmed of guzerat was advanced as far as mundo he was more and more intimidated and began to be desirous of making peace but shame prevented him from expressing his wishes a peace concluded at the same time sultan mahummud with less reason and contrary to the advice of all his counselors gave himself up to base fear and sent ambassadors with presents to his rival to beg peace  mahmood chilligi attacked and defeated by beloli sultan mahmood chilligi was overjoyed at these proposals which saved the appearance of his reputation and immediately accepting them marched from the field malleck beloli who now began justly to despise them both and to aspire to the empire marched out of the city with his own troops and pursuing sultan mahmood chilligi attacked him upon his march defeated him and took all his baggage beloli adopted by the sultan the weak sultan who did not hitherto see through his palpable intentions gave him the title of chan chanan and adopted him for his son  he marches against delhi in the year eight hundred and forty five the sultan marched to sammana giving the governments of lahore and debalpoor to malleck beloli and ordering him to expel jisserit he himself returned to his capital malleck beloli by this means became extremely powerful and recruited a great army of afghans but instead of a d      hig   0 fighting jisserit he brought him over to his party and began to seize upon several districts without any orders from the king at length without any apparent reason but his ambition he drew his army against delhi which he besieged for some months but in in the end was obliged to abandon his enterprise  the kings power declines the kings power was greatly weakened and began to decay very rapidly the zemindars of biana put themselves under the government of sultan mahmood chilligi he dies in the mean time sultan mahummud fell sick and died in the year eight hundred and forty nine his character leaving behind him the character of a weak dissolute and unwarlike prince owing to the ambition of others a throne upon which he could not sit with dignity himself he reigned twelve years and some months and his son alla ul dien succeeded him in the empire

came and swore allegiance to him this contempt of beloli the new sultan was in no condition to chastise but having collected an army in the beginning of the year eight hundred and fifty he marched to recover biana when he was upon the way there was a rumor propagated that the king of jionpoor was advancing toward delhi which though false brought back the sultan to his capital though he was told by hissam chan the vizier how ridiculous it would appear in a king to be guided by a vague report this reprimand brought upon the vizier the sultans displeasure  a d      hig     loses his reputation this step however proved ruinous to the sultans reputation and the meanest of the people feared not to say publicly that he was a weaker man and a greater fool than his father his luxury he marched in the following year to budaoon where he remained some time laying out gardens building pleasurehouses and making entertainments and then returned to delhi pretending that the air of budaoon agreed better with his health he expressed an inclination of making that city his residence to divert him from which the vizier took much pains but only incurred more and more his displeasure  the state of hindostan all hindostan was at this time divided into separate states for in the decan guzerat malava jionpoor and bengal there were princes who assumed the style and dignity of kings decayed condition of the empire while punjaab debalpoor and sirhind even to panniput was possessed by malleck beloli lodi merowli and all the country to the serai of lado within seven crores of delhi were in

subject to daood chan odi so that the city of delhi and a few small districts remained only to the king  malleck beloli makes an unsuccessful attempt upon delhi malleck beloli made about this time another attempt upon the city but was not more successful than he was before the sultan relieved from this danger began to consult the means to recover part of his lost empire advising with cuttub chan isa chan and rai partab these chiefs desirous to weaken him still more told him that the omrahs were all disgusted with his vizier that should he be turned out of office and imprisoned they were ready to pay him due allegiance and made no doubt but the affairs of the empire would put on a more favorable aspect the weak alla became the dupe of those traitors and accordingly imprisoned and disgraced a d      hig     his vizier he immediately ordered preparations to be made for removing his court to budaoon from which not all the remonstrances of his best friends could restrain him though they represented in a strong light how impolitic it would be at such a juncture to change his capital  fixes his residence at budaoon alla accordingly in the year eight hundred and fifty two set out for budaoon leaving hissam chan in the government of delhi when the sultan arrived at this new capital cuttub chan and rai partab waited upon him and told him that as long as the vizier was alive the omrahs could not be brought to trust themselves at court orders the vizier to be put to death the weak king was prevailed upon to command him to be put to death who escapes to delhi but the viziers brother having notice given him of this bloody purpose found means with the assistance of some of his friends to release him and to escape to delhi he there took immediate possession of all the sultans effects and turned his haram out of the city  and places sultan beloli upon the throne the sultan put off the time by ridiculous procrastinations and vain excuses of the weather and unlucky times till the vizier had called malleck beloli to take upon him the empire beloli glad of the opportunity amused the sultan by writing to him that he was coming to chastise the vizier till he arrived and took possession of the city taking upon himself the title of sultan beloli he however gave place to the name of sultan alla ul dien in the chutba in the year eight hundred and fifty four  he gave the city in charge to his son chaja baezid marched in person to debalpoor and collected together a great army of afghans he wrote at the same time to sultan alla ul dien that upon his account he had expelled the vizier and he received for answer from that weak prince that as his father had adopted beloli as his son he would esteem him his brother he moreover a d    0 hig     alla abdicates in favor of beloli promised to cede to him the empire upon condition that he would permit him to live quietly in the possession of budaoon  sultan beloli threw immediately the name of alla out of the chutba and spread the umbrella of empire over his own head sultan alla ul dien remained at budaoon till his death which happened in the year eight hundred and eighty three his reign in delhi being seven years and his government of budacon near twenty eight  section viii the reign of sultan beloli lodi belolis family beloli lodi was an afghan of the tribe of lodi which people forming themselves into a commercial society carried on a trade between persia and hindostan in the time of sultan firose shaw malleck ibrahim the grandfather of beloli being possessed of wealth made his way at the court of delhi and raised himself to the government of moultan malleck ibrahim had five sons malleck sultan shech malleck culla malleck firose malleck mahummud and malleck chaja who on the death of their father remained in moultan  when chizer chan was appointed to that government sultan shech received the command of all his afghan troops in the action which chizer chan had with eckbal chan sultan shech had the good fortune to kill eckbal by which means he became a great favorite with chizer chan he was accordingly appointed by that prince governor of sirhind with the title of islam chan while his brothers partook of his fortune one of whom malleck calla the father of sultan beloli had a district bestowed upon him by his a d    0 hig     brother account of his birth the wife of calla who was his own cousin being smothered by the fall of a house when with child the father instantly ripped up her belly and saved the life of the infant who afterward held the empire by the title of sultan beloli  distinguishes himself in an action calla being killed in an action with the afghans of neaz beloli went to his uncle islam chan at sirhind and upon his distinguishing himself in a battle his uncle gave him his own daughter in marriage islam chan was at this time so powerful that he retained twelve thousand afghans mostly of his own tribe in his service  islam chan recommends bloli to the government of sirhind islam chan at his death though he had children of his own come to maturity recommended beloli to succeed him the troops upon this divided into three parties one of which adhered to beloli one to malleck firose brother to islam chan who had been made an omrah by the king of delhi and the other to cuttub chan the son of islam chan but malleck beloli who was the most artful of the three found means to weaken his rivals and increase his own power  cuttub chan complains at the court of delhi cuttub chan repaired to delhi and acquainted sultan mahummud shaw that the afghans of sirhind were establishing a power which unless it was soon prevented would shake the empire the sultan immediately dispatched secunder topha with a powerful army to bring the chiefs of the afghans to court and if they disobeyed to expel them from sirhind  perfidy of the  jisserit was also instigated to take arms against them by which means they were in the end driven to the hills but upon a promise of peace and of their future good behavior malleck firose left his son shai chan and malleck beloli with his army and with some attendants went to jisserit and malleck secunder topha a d    0 hig     they notwithstanding their promise by the advice of cuttub chan imprisoned him and slew all his attendants they also dispatched part of their army to reduce beloli but he retreated to a place of safety with the women and children before he could join shai chan he was attacked and defeated and a great part of his army slain  beloli becomes powerful when jisserit had retired to punjaab beloli collected the remains of his tribe and began to raise contributions or plunder wherever he could and as he was extremely generous in dividing the spoil among his followers he soon became very powerful some time after malleck firose fled from delhi and joined him and cuttub chan repenting of his former behavior found means to be reconciled to beloli beloli soon after invaded sirhind and possessed himself of that province upon receiving intelligence of these transactions sultan mahummud shaw sent hissam chan his vizier with a great army against him malleck beloli took the field and giving the vizier battle defeated him by which his power and reputation greatly increased  is promised  by a dirvesh we are told that when beloli was yet a youth in his uncles service one day he was permitted to pay his respects to a famous dirvesh of sammana whose name was sheidai when he sat in a respectful posture before him the dirvesh cried out in an enthusiastic manner who will give two thousand rupees for the empire of delhi upon which malleck beloli told him he had only one thousand six hundred rupees in the world which he ordered his servant to bring immediately and present to the dirvesh the dirvesh accepted the money and laying his hand upon the head of beloli saluted him king  the companions of beloli ridiculed him very much for this action but he replied refl upon that tale that if the thing came to pass he had made a cheap purchase if not the blessing of a holy man could do him no harm  upon a mind naturally ambitious and in an age of superstition this prediction of the dirvesh might have great effect in promoting its own end for when a mans mind is once bent upon the attainment of one object the greatest difficulties will be often surmounted by a steady perseverance but to return from this digression  a d    0 hig     after beloli had defeated the vizier he wrote to the sultan as before related laying the whole blame of his rebellion upon the viziers conduct toward him when the sultan basely complied with his desire of cutting off the vizier beloli according to his promise waited upon the king that he might be better able to carry on his intrigues at court he managed his affairs at delhi so well that he got the government of sirhind and other districts near it confirmed to him in jagier which were the means that enabled him to mount the musnud as we have already seen in the former reign  his sons and relations he had at the time of his accession nine sons chaja baezid nizam chan who was afterward sultan secunder barba shaw mubarick chan sultan alla ul dien jemmal chan miah jacob miah musah and jellal chan and of omrahs of renown who were related to him there were thirty six in the empire  his stratagem against hamid chan as hamid chan the vizier who conferred the empire upon him had great influence still in the state he treated him for some time with honor and respect being one day in hamid chans house at an entertainment he ordered the companions whom he carried with him to make themselves appear as foolish and ridiculous as possible that the vizier might consider them as a d    0 hig     silly fellows that so he might be less upon his guard against them when they accordingly came into company some tied their shoes to their girdles and others put them up in the niches of the apartment  hamid chan asked them the reason of that extraordinary custom they replied that they were afraid of thieves when they had taken their seats upon the carpet one of them began to praise the flowers and brightness of the colors saying he would be extremely glad to have such a carpet to send home to his own country to make caps for his boys hamid chan laughed and told him he would give him velvet or brocade for that purpose when the plates and boxes of perfumes were laid before them some began to rub the finest otter of roses all over them others to drink it and others to devour whole festoons of flowers while the beetle stood no chance but was eat up cover and all some who had eat large pieces of chunam by having their mouths burnt made a terrible outcry and in this kind of foolery every one was endeavoring to outdo another while the king and the vizier were almost bursting with laughter  the vizier imagining that this behavior proceeded from the kings humor who had a mind to make merry in his house was extremely pleased and had no suspicion of men given to so much mirth the next visit the king paid to hamid chan a greater number of his attendants were admitted but as hamid chan had still a greater number of his own friends within the court it was necessary to gain admission for some more of the kings people who were stopped without by the guards the king having before instructed them how to proceed in this case they began loudly to wrangle with the guard and threw out bitter invectives against the king for permitting them to be so unworthily treated they even swore that they respected the vizier and would see him  a d      hig     the vizier hearing this ordered the doors to be thrown open and as many to be admitted as the court could contain this point being gained the king gave the signal and all his people drawing at once told hamid chans servants to remain quiet and they should come to no harm the vizier seized in his own house upon which two or three seized the vizier and bound him the king then told him that gratitude was a security for his life but that it was necessary he should retire from business and spend the rest of his days in the cares of a future state after this the king ruled without fear or control  beloli regues the western provinces the same year the eight hundred and fifty fifth of the higera he left delhi under the charge of his eldest son chaja baezid and marched toward moultan to recruit his army and to regulate all these western provinces some of his omrahs being dissatisfied at this time left him and joined sultan mahmood shirki of jionpoor who delhi besieged during the absence of beloli in the beginning of the year eight hundred and fifty six advanced with a great army and said siege to delhi sultan beloli hastened from debalpoor march by march nor halted till he reached perah within thirty miles of delhi  beloli defeats the army of sultan shirki sultan mahmood send thirty thousand horse and thirty elephants under the command of fatti chan herevi against him when the action began cuttub chan who excelled in archery having sunk an arrow in the forehead of one of fatti chans elephants the animal became outrageous and broke the lines cuttub chan in the mean time advancing against diria chan lodi one of the disaffected omrahs who had joined sultan mahmood cried out  for shame diria chan where is your honor thus to wage war against your own kindred and to invest your wife and family in the city of delhi when you ought rather to defend them against your natural enemies pursue me not said diria chan and i am gone and he immediately wheeled off followed by all the patans or afghans in fatti chans army  a d      hig     the other troops being thus deserted gave way and fatti chan was taken prisoner but having with his own hand just killed the brother of rai kirren that omrah in revenge struck off his head and sent it to the sultan the siege of delhi raised upon receiving the news of this defeat sultan mahmood raised the siege of delhi and retreated with great precipitation to jionpoor  belolis progress through several provinces their submission the sultanit of beloli became firmly established and he began to turn his thoughts upon new acquisitions his first movement was toward mewat where hamid chan submitted himself to his authority the sultan took seven pergunnahs from him and permitted him to hold the remainder in fee beloli from thence marched to birren and diria chan lodi governor of simbol presented him with seven more pergunnahs and submitted in like manner he then took the rout of koli and confirmed isah chan in that government he continued his progress to barhanabad and gave that province to mubarick chan while bowgaw was delivered over to rai partab but when he advanced to raberi cuttub chan ben hassin chan shut himself up in the fort but the sultan took it in a few days by capitulation and again settled him in the same government beloli marching from thence to attava he regulated that government and confirmed the former suba  jonah chan quitted about this time the court in disgust and joined sultan mahmood shirki from whom he received the government of shumseabad sultan shirki  upon delhi jonah instigated sultan mahmood to make another attempt upon delhi who for that purpose took the route of attava where he met sultan beloli a  the armies the first day of their appearance in sight on both sides sent out parties to skirmish but nothing remarkable was done and the next day they began to treat when it was agreed that sultan beloli should keep possession of all the countries possessed by mubarick shaw and that sultan mahmood should hold all that was in the possession of sultan ibrahim of jionpoor that the former should give up all the elephants taken in the engagement with fatti chan and the latter turn jonah chan out of his government  sultan mahmood immediately after this pacification returned to jionpoor and sultan beloli went to shumseabad to take possession of it shirki offended at beloli marches against him this latter expedition of beloli greatly offended sultan mahmood and he immediately returned to shumseabad where cuttub chan and diria chan lodi surprised his camp in the night but during the attack the horse of cuttub chan having trod upon a tentpin threw him and he was taken by the enemy and his party retreated to their own camp dies sultan beloli drew out his army in the morning but received advice that sultan mahmood had just expired and that the omrahs had set up his son mahummud shaw and by the mediation of bibi raja the young kings mother who probably had received previous assurances a peace was immediately concluded mahummud shaw returned to jionpoor and sultan beloli took the rout of delhi  before the sultan arrived at the capital he received a letter from shumsh chatoon the sister of cuttub chan conjuring him in the most tender manner not to suffer her brother to remain in captivity this prevailed upon beloli to break up the peace he had just concluded and to march toward jionpoor mahummud shaw met him near sirsutti the younger brother of mahummud shaw hassen chan fearing his brothers resentment for some trespass took this opportunity of marching off with all his adherents to kinnoge sittal chan his other brother soon followed him but the detachment which sultan beloli had sent after hassen chan met sittal chan on the way and took him prisoner the sultan determined to keep him as a ransom for cuttub chan  beloli marches against mahummud who is assassinated in the mean time the omrahs conspired against mahummud shaw and having assassinated him advanced hassen chan who had fled to kinnoge to the throne sultan beloli for what reason we know not took no advantages of these disorders but now entered into a truce with sultan hassen chan for the space of four years cuttub chan and sittab chan being interchangeably released  beloli returned toward shumseabab whither birsingh the son of rai partab came to pay his compliments treachery of diria chan but as his father had taken a standard and a pair of drums formerly from deria chan in an action that base man thought to wipe off that dishonor by assassinating birsinghi cuttub chan the son of hassen chan mubariz chan and rai partab differing with the cruel traitor about this murder were obliged to fly to sultan hassein beloli after these transactions returned to delhi  but upon account of the rebellion of the viceroy of moultan and the disorders in punjaab he marched toward that quarter upon his way he heard that sultan hassein shirki was advancing in his absence with a great army to take delhi beloli marchers against sultan hassein he therefore through necessity returned and leaving delhi in charge of cuttub chan and chan jehan he went out to meet the enemy the two armies having met at the village of chundwar hostilities continued without intermission for seven days a peace a peace was at length patched up for the term of three years  at the expiration of this truce sultan hassein invested attava took it and drew over ahmed chan of mewat and rustum chan of koli to his interest while ahmed chan of selwan the governor of biana struck money and read the chutba in his name hassein marches to  hassein with one hundred thousand horse and a thousand elephants marched from attava toward delhi and sultan beloli no ways a d      hig     intimidated by that great force marched out boldly to meet him a peace the two armies having advanced to battevara encamped for some time in sight of each other and after some skirmishes in which there was no superiority of advantage on either side they again struck up a peace  but this pacification was not permanent hassein advances toward delhi sultan hassein advanced again toward delhi some months after and was opposed at the village of sinkar and obliged to depart upon peaceable terms  much about this time the mother of sultan hassein bibi raja died at attava and the raja of gualier and cuttub chan lodi went to console him upon that occasion when in discourse cuttub chan perceived that hassein chan was a bitter enemy of beloli he began to flatter him after this manner  beloli is one of your dependants and cannot think of contending long with you if i do not put you in possession of delhi look on my word as nothing he then with much art got leave to depart from hasseins court and returned to delhi and there he told to sultan beloli that he had escaped with a great deal of difficulty from the hands of sultan hassein who was meditating a fresh war against him  sultan alla dies about this time sultan alla ul dien the abdicated emperor died at budaoon upon which sultan hassein went to settle matters at budaoon and after the funeral ceremonies were over he took that country from the children of alla hassein marches to delhi marching from thence to simbol he imprisoned mubarick chan governor of that province then marching toward delhi in the year eight hundred and eighty three he crossed the river jumna near gutteritch sultan beloli who was at sirhind upon receiving intelligence of this invasion returned with all expedition to save his capital several slight actions ensued in which sultan hassein had in general the advantage  a d      hig     cuttub chan dispatched a person to hassein informing him that sultan beloli was ready to relinquish all the countries beyond the ganges upon condition he should leave him in possession of all the provinces on this side of that river these terms being accepted they reversed their hostile spears and sultan hassein marched homeward belolis perfidy but sultan beloli in a perfidious manner broke the peace and pursuing hassein attacked him upon his march killing a great number and taking forty omrahs prisoners besides part of his treasure and equipage beloli pursued his victory and took several districts belonging to sultan hassein such as campul pattiali shumseabad sickite marhera sittali and koli appointing agents to manage them under him but when he had pursued hassein as far as arumbidger the latter stood his ground and engaged beloli the victory being dubious a peace was patched up between them the village of doupamou being settled as the boundary between the empires after this pacification sultan hassein proceeded to raberi and sultan beloli returned to delhi  sultan hassein could not however forget the perfidy of beloli he recruited his army and some time after marched against him and met him at the village of sinhar when an obstinate battle ensued in which sultan hassein was defeated and lost all his treasure and baggage which together with an addition of reputation greatly promoted the affairs of beloli sultan hassein having retreated to raberi he was followed thither by beloli and upon standing a second engagement he was again totally defeated after the battle he retreated toward gualier the raja of gualier brought him some lacks of rupees elephants horses camels and a fine set of camp equipage and accompanied him to calpie  sultan beloli went in the mean time to attava where he besieged ibrahim chan the brother of sultan hassein and took the place by capitulation he however generously made him a present a d      hig     of the fort and proceeded to calpie sultan hassein met him upon the banks of the river where they remained for some months but rai muluck chand of buxar coming over to sultan beloli showed him a passable ford in the river by which he crossed and attacking sultan hassein defeated him and drove him to jionpoor upon which sultan beloli turned off to the left toward kinnoge sultan hassein again met him near that city but he was once more defeated with great slaughter his regalia and equipage were taken and also the chief lady of his seraglio bibi conzah the daughter of sultan alla ul dien who was treated with great respect sultan beloli returned after this victory to delhi  having recruited and regulated his army he advanced the spear of hostility again toward jionpoor he conquered that country and gave it to mubarick chan lohani leaving cuttub chan lodi chan jehan and other omrahs at migouli to secure his conquests he himself went to budaoon where he soon after heard of cuttub chans death chan jehan mubarick chan and other omrahs though they kept up the appearance of fidelity were after the death of cuttub concerning measures to throw off the sultans yoke  beloli being apprized of their intentions marched toward jionpoor and drove away hassein who had made an attempt to recover it and placed barbee shaw one of his own sons upon the throne of jionpoor he himself returned to calpie which he took and gave to his grandson azim hamaioon ben baizied he directed then his march to dolepore raising a tribute upon the raja of that place who began to rank himself among belolis subjects the sultan went from thence to a place in the districts of rintimpore which he plundered and soon after returned to delhi  beloli being old and infirm divides his dominions among his sons beloli being now extremely old and infirmities beginning daily to increase upon him he divided his dominions among his sons giving a d      hig     jionpoor to barbeck shaw kurrah and manikpore to mubarick chan byrage to his nephew shech mahummud famous by the name of kalla par or the black mountain lucknore and calpee to azim humaioon whose father baezid was assassinated a little before by his own servant budaoon to chan jehan one of his old omrahs and a relation and delhi with several countries between the two rivers to his son nizam chan known afterward by the name of sultan secunder whom he appointed his successor in the imperial dignity  some time after this division the sultan proceeded to gualier and raising a tribute of eighty lacks of rupees from the raja of that place came to attava from whence he expelled sickit sing and then turned his face toward delhi he falls sick falling sick upon his march many of the omrahs were desirous that he should alter his former will with respect to the succession which they said was the undoubted right of azim humaioon his grandson the sultana upon this wrote to her son nizam chan who having heard of his fathers illness was setting out from delhi by no means to come otherwise he might be imprisoned by the omrahs at the same time the sultan by the advice of some omrahs ordered public letters to be sent him to hasten him to camp that he might see him before his death nizam chan was greatly perplexed how to act upon this nice occasion he at length was advised by cuttuluk chan the vizier of sultan hassein shirki who was then prisoner at delhi to pitch his tents without the city and to advance by very slow marches dies in the mean time the kings disease overcame him and he died at malauli in the pergunnah of sikite in the year eight hundred and ninety four having reigned thirty eight years eight months and seven days  his character beloli was for those days esteemed a virtuous and mild prince executing justice to the utmost of his knowledge and treating his courtiers rather as his companions than his subjects when he a d      hig     came to the empire he divided the treasure among his friends and could be seldom prevailed upon to mount the throne saying that it was enough for him that the world knew he was king without his making a vain parade of royalty he was extremely temperate in his diet and seldom eat at home though a man of no great literature himself

nothing to make a recompense for such kindness desiring to get a horse that he might show himself not wholly unworthy of his favor he was accordingly mounted and he perfidiously sold his honor for a compliment turning his sword against barbeck shaw which circumstance in some measure contributed to the success of secunder barbeck defeated the troops of barbeck seeing calla par charging them

the royal revenue the king ordered it to be levied upon him the omrahs dissatisfied this severity greatly disgusted the omrahs among whom mubarick chan was very much esteemed a faction accordingly arose in the army which first discovered itself by private quarrels for one day as the sultan and his court were playing a party at club and ball on horseback the club of hybut chan by accident or design fractured the scull of one soliman chizer the brother of soliman came up and returned the compliment to hybut chan quarrels in the camp so that in a few minutes the parties on either side joined in the quarrel and the whole field was in one uproar and confusion  the sultan suspects a conspiracy the sultan fearing a conspiracy fled to the palace but nothing of that kind transpiring he made another party at the same game some days thereafter and a quarrel of the same nature ensued for which shumse chan who begun it was disgraced and bastinadoed but the sultan would not be satisfied but that there was some plot in agitation and therefore ordered his guards to be selected and to keep upon the watch  a plot discovered the kings jealousies were not groundless for at that time hybut

orders  the sultan retires for four years to simbol secunder in the year nine hundred and five marched to simbol where he spent four years in pleasure and in transacting civil affairs but hearing of some bad administration of asghir the governor of delhi he sent an order to chawass chan governor of matchiwarri to march to delhi and send asghir prisoner to court the governor receiving advice of this order left delhi and threw himself at the sultans feet but not being able to form any excuse for his bad practices he was ordered into confinement  a remarkable instance of religious persecution at this time there happened a remarkable instance of religious zeal and persecution a brahmin whose name was bhodin upon being abused by a mahommedan for his idolatry happened to make a very moderate but what proved to him a fatal reply the reply was this that he esteemed the same god to be the object of all worship and therefore believed the mahomedan and hindoo religions to be equally good the bigoted mahommedan for what he thought the impiety of this answer summoned the brahmin immediately before the easy the affair making some noise by the various opinions of the public the king called together all the mahommedan doctors of fame in the empire to decide the cause after many long disputes the doctors brought in their verdict that the brahmin should be forced to turn mahommedan or be put to death the brahmin however charitable he might have been to all opinions upon religion refused to apostatize a d   0  hig  0  and accordingly died a martyr to his faith which reflects no small dishonor upon the sultan and his inquisitors  when chawass chan entered delhi he found an order from the emperor to proceed immediately to court with which he instantly complied some factious omrahs banished at the same time seid chan sirwani came from lahore who was a man of a very factious disposition and commenced some treasonable projects for which he tattar chan and mahummud shaw were banished to guzerat  in the nine hundred and seventh of the higera rai man sing of gualier sent nehal to the king with rich presents secunders designs against gualier but as this ambassador talked in too high a strain the emperor ordered him to depart and declared war against his master disturbances in biana but he was prevented from the execution of his purpose for some time by the death of chan chanan firmilli governor of biana and by those disturbances in that province which succeeded his death the government of biana having devolved upon ameid soliman the son of chan chanan who was yet too young and unexperienced for such a charge the king gave that appointment to chawass chan sifdir chan was sent with a force to reduce agra which belonged to the province of biana and had then revolted another detachment being sent at the same time to reduce the fort of dolipoor which was in the possession of raja benaecdeo who had begun to make warlike preparations here chaja bein a warrior of great fame fell by the sword which so irritated the sultan who had a great esteem for him that he marched himself against that place upon his approach rai benaecdeo left some friends in the fort and fled toward gualier but the garrison the next night evacuated the place and left the sultan to take possession of it  secunder marches to gualier he tarried there about a month and then marched to

thousands being buried in the ruins the sultan in the same year moved toward gualier and stopped by the way some time at dolipoor where he left his family and with an unincumbered army of horse proceeded to the hills to plunder some hindoo rajas from whom he took great spoils and ravaged their peaceful habitations just as the sultan was passing by the town of javer in the dominions of the raja of gualier he was attacked by a resolute body of men who had laid in ambush for him but by the bravery of awid chan and ahmed chan the sons of chan jehan the hindoos were defeated and a great

destroyed and mosques ordered to be built in their places this government was conferred upon bickin the son of mujahid chan when some envious persons gave the king information that mujahid chan had taken a bribe from the raja of awintgur when they were marching against him in order to divert the king from that resolution this being proved mujahid chan was imprisoned at dolipoor after which the king returning toward agra on the way lost eight hundred men in one day for want of water  secunder marches against narvar the sultan eyeing from his march the ruins of agra moved toward narvar a strong fort in the district of malava then in the possession of the hindoos he ordered jellal chan governor of calpie to advance before him and invest the place which was accordingly done when the sultan arrived before narvar jellal chan drew up his army out of respect that the king might review them as he passed this circumstance proved very hurtful to jellal for from that time the king became jealous of his power and determined to ruin him  the sultan surrounded the place which was eight crores in circumference and began to carry on the siege the siege was now protracted eight months when the sultan received intelligence that a treasonable correspondence was carried on between some of his omrahs and the garrison for which jellal chan and sheri chan were imprisoned in the fort of

his father proposed to meet secunder the sultan immediately sent him a dress and promised to support him in the government of chinderi against the power of his father but circumstances so fell out that it became unnecessary to take that unnatural step  the sultan in the month of shuban nine hundred and fourteen marched from narvar but after he had advanced to the river he began to consider that it would be proper to surround that fortress with another wall he therefore ordered that work to be immediately begun and then he himself took the rout of lohar at that place he bestowed calpie in jagier upon niamut chatoon the wife of cuttub chan lodi and daughter of the prince jellal chan he then directed his march toward the capital and arriving at hitgat sent a detachment against some rebels in that country and destroyed all their habitations placing small garrisons at proper distances to overawe them about this time he received advices that ahmed chan the son of mubarick chan lodi governor of lucknore had turned idolater upon which orders were dispatched to send him prisoner to court and that his second brother sud chan should take the administration of affairs in his stead  in

could not prevail upon himself to leave the presence this expression threw the sultan into a violent rage and he forthwith ordered him from his service and camp by next morning at daylight or that otherwise all his effects should be given to the soldiers as public plunder  reduces chinderi much about this time bogit chan governor of chinderi who held that place of the king of malava seeing the weakness of his own prince turned his face to sultan secunder that monarch sent amad ul muluck to support bogit in his rebellion he soon after returned to agra and issued a proclamation bearing the submission of bogit chan and his own consequent right to that country he sent more troops and omrahs to chinderi who entirely settled it as an appendage of the empire bogit chan found matters carried on in his government in such a manner that he was constrained to resign his office and come to court  after this we find no transactions worthy of memory in the empire till the year nine hundred and

come in person to take possession of it the sultan with great joy closed with the proposal and set out toward biana to which place the governor of rintimpore came to meet him and was graciously received disappointed in his designs upon rintimpore but ali chan who had been disappointed in some favors which he expected for bringing this matter to bear resolved still to prevent the a d      hig

contrary to the manners and policy of his father and grandfather behaved himself with insupportable pride and arrogance to his friends and family one foolish expression of his was that kings had no relations but that every body should be the slaves of royalty the omrahs who were always before honored with a seat in the presence were now constrained to stand by the throne with their hands crossed before them they were so much disgusted with this insolence that they privately became his enemies  a conspiracy a conspiracy therefore was formed in which it was agreed to leave ibrahim in possession of delhi and a few dependent provinces a d      hig     the empire divided and to place the prince jellal chan his brother upon the throne of jionpoor jellal chan marched from calpie by the aid and

from beri to congratulate sultan ibrahim upon his accession and in a very high strain began to blame the omrahs for dividing the empire which he said would be attended with many evil consequences designs to reunite it the omrahs sensible of the impropriety of their conduct determined as jellal chan could not yet be well established to call him back and so divest him of his newassumed royalty they accordingly sent hybut chan with deceptious letters to recall him saying that there was a scheme for him in agitation and that it was necessary he should speedily come to support it  the omrahs endeavor in vain to inveigle jellal from jionpoor but hybut chan having overacted his part by flattery and importunity jellal chan suspected a plot against himself and wrote them a genteel excuse they

despairing of taking that city left him and went to chasero shaw baber after this desertion was obliged to take the way to sirtack over rocks stones and rugged paths by which his army suffered exceedingly having lost most part of his camels and horses except two  and forty men this circumstance dispirited his troops to such a degree that they all deserted him by the time he reached barnilack except two hundred and forty men  any man but baber would have now despaired of success in his designs but though he had left a kingdom to which he might have still returned his ion prompted him to run the  of a young adventurer for another his daring attempt upon samarcand he accordingly marched directly for samarcand with the small retinue with an intention to get into that city without being discovered his hopes were that he could raise a faction among his friends while yet the city was in disorder a d      hig  0  he entered samarcand in the dusk of the evening and went to eurit

make his escape which he did accordingly without any loss  after he had got clear of the city he looked back and repented of his precipitate flight he immediately stopped in a grove where being wearied with the fatigue of the day he laid himself down upon the ground to sleep as did the greatest part of his retinue his dream in about an hour he awaked from a dream in which he imagined he saw nasir ul dien abdalla a dirvesh of great repute coming toward his house he thought that he invited the dirvesh to sit down upon which his steward spread a table cloth before him at which the dirvesh seemed greatly offended the orientals never eat abroad without a formal invitation besides these independent dirveshes live upon rice and water and will not condescend to be entertained by princes  and rose to go away the king begged he would excuse him as the offense was committed by a servant the dirvesh upon this took him by the arm and held him up toward the sky upon which he awoke and calling up his attendants related his dream and determined to make an attempt immediately upon samarcand  returns to samarcand which he surprise babers small party having mounted their horses returned and reached the bridge about midnight he detached eighty of his men before to a low part of the wall near the lovers cave which they scaled by the help of a hookrope and coming round to the gate and falling upon the guard commanded by casiter chan killed and dispersed them they immediately set open the gate and admitted the king and his small party the city was alarmed but the party proclaiming the name of baber as they passed through the streets all who were his friends flocked to him while his enemies not a d   00 hig  0  knowing his strength ran distracted from place to place to join their leaders  in a short time the alarm reached the house of chaja cuttub ul dien eiah where seven thousand usbecks were quartered they rushed out and joined shubiani chan who with eight thousand ushecks lay in the citadel of didar shubiani with one hundred and fifty men commanding the rest to wait for orders set out for the iron gate but seeing he could do nothing with that handful he retreated baber in the mean time attended by some thousands who rent the sky with acclamations followed him so close that shubiani chan could not either by words or example make one of the usbecks stand his ground samarcand submits he therefore followed them out at the opposite gate and fled toward bochara and samarcand immediately submitted to baber  this action if we consider the strength of the place the troops it contained the alarm that had been spread in the evening the small number who attempted it the uncertainty of being joined by the citizens and many other difficulties we must esteem it equal to the boldest enterprise in history the authors who relate it very justly give it the preference to any of the exploits of timur  mahummud musidter chan took this opportunity of wresting the forts of kirshi and heraz from the usbecks while abul hassen mirza from muracuss came and took kole sultan baber sent ambassadors to sultan hassein mirza and other neighboring princes his

soldier but he was deserted by his allies and soon after by his own troops only fifteen brave friends remained at last by his side with whom seeing it in vain to contend any longer with fortune he made good his retreat to samarcand he lost in this action his principal omrahs ibrahim tirchan ibrahim saar abul assim ko hyder cassim amir kiam cudgi choda birdi chilili the brother of ahmed timbol

orders or assistance the siege was continued with great obstinacy for many days numbers being killed on both sides during which time kutch beg loma kokultass and kelnizer taghai gave extraordinary examples of bravery four months had now passed in attacking and repulsing when a dreadful famine began to rage in the city the inhabitants eat their horses and even the most unclean animals while those who could not procure other provisions subsisted upon the bark of trees  though the king at the commencement of the siege had sent ambassadors to the kings of chorassan kundez buckolan and mogulistan all princes of the house of timur for succors he received no hopes of their aid forced to quit the city without hundred men he was therefore under the cruel necessity of abandoning his capital and kingdom with about one hundred friends in a dark night in the beginning of the year nine hundred and seven he escaped to tashcund whither his brother mirza jehangire came to pay him his respects his uncle sultan mahmood comforted him in his distress entertained him in a d   0  hig  0  a princely manner and gave him the city of artaba to reside in during the winter  besieged at artaba by shubiani but in the beginning of the spring he was again attacked by shubiani chan who not being able to effect any thing against the city plundered the country and retreated to samarcand his misfortunes in this manner the sultan unable to raise his head from his misfortunes lived for some time ahmed timbol having taken possession of the kingdom of indija which baber had resigned to his brother jehangire upon his taking samarcand  aided by his uncles sultan mahmood chan and his brother sultan ahmed chan were at length prevailed upon to support baber in an attempt to recover the kingdom of indija from ahmed timbol when the confederates had reached the boundaries of ferghana ahmed timbol marched out to oppose them it was agreed that sultan baber with a small detachment of moguls should march toward osh to raise a party there whilst his uncles opposed ahmed timbol baber accordingly took osh and was joined by some of the inhabitants of orgun and marinan who expelled the garrisons of ahmed timbol the king immediately marched toward indija and ahmed timbol decamped from before the confederate princes and hastened back to cover indija  defeated by timbol timbol happened by accident to fall in with babers camp when the troops were out foraging and defeated him the king escaped wounded to osh while ahmed timbol threw himself into indija and prepared for a defense the confederates besiege indija the next day the allied army of sultan mahmood and sultan ahmed appeared in sight and sat down before the place where they were joined soon after by sultan baber some time after the inhabitants of achsi called the king and put him in possession of that place the siege raised but the allied princes not being able to reduce indija raised the siege  a d   0  hig  0  in the mean time shubiani chan fearing the success of baber advanced from samarcand with a very great army toward achsi baber immediately joined his allies and they prepared to receive him totally defeated by shubiani but in this action which was very obstinate and bloody the fortune of shubiani chan prevailed and both the uncles of baber were taken prisoners the king escaped to mogulistan and the kingdom of tashcund fell into the hands of shubiani chan which greatly augmented his power  sultan babers uncles released shubiani some time after released the two brothers but sultan mahmood retired and fell into a deep melancholy when one of his friends told him that shubiani chan had poisoned him and begged to supply him with some famous theriac of chitta as a powerful antidote against poisons the prince replied yes shubiani chan has poisoned me indeed he has taken my kingdom which is not in the power of your theriac to restore  sultan baber left mogulistan and came to shudma and from thence proceeded to turmuz where amir mahummud backer prince of that place who was uneasy at the great power of the usbecks glad of babers alliance who still had the command of an army received him with great kindness and respect and gave him large presents he asks advice of mahummud backer baber said to him upon this occasion that being a long time the football of fortune and like a piece of wood on a chessboard moved from place to place vagrant as the moon in the sky and restless as a stone upon the beach he would therefore be glad of his friendly advice as he had been so unsuccessful in his own resolves mere mahummud backer replied that however incapable he was to advise him he would not withold his opinion which was that as shubiani chan was now in full possession of babers kingdom and many others which rendered him extremely powerful it would be more advisable for him to pursue his fortune a d   0  hig   0 elsewhere particularly in cabulistan which was now in a state of anarchy  the king followed this advice and in the year nine hundred and ten marched toward cabul babers ingratitude to chusero shaw passing in his way through the dominions of chusero shaw of kunduz he was entertained by him with great hospitality for which we are sorry to relate our hero made a very bad return during the time that baber resided there he stirred up a faction in chuseros court and gained over seven thousand of his troops to his own interest this plot being discovered chusero with a few servants was obliged to abandon his capital and fly to biddiulzeman mirza leaving his troops his treasure and every thing in the possession of baber  marches toward cabul baber did not fail to avail himself of these advantages he marched immediately toward cabul which had been in possession of mirza abdul rysaac the son of mirza aligh beg babers uncle who was then in his minority one zicca exerting too much authority in the country at that time disgusted the other omrahs who assassinated him in the month of zihidge confusions of that country this circumstance occasioned great convulsions in the kingdom for mahummud mokim the son of amir zulnon prince of garrimsere took advantage of the intestine divisions of the cabulians and invaded them forcing mirza abdul rysac to take shelter among the afghans baber seizes upon cabulistan he himself took possession of that country and married the sister of the former prince  affairs being in this situation sultan baber arrived upon the borders of cabul and driving mahummud mokim out of the field forced him to take refuge in his capital which baber besieged and took he then applied himself to regulate and improve that country as dominions belonging to himself  a d   0  hig     a dreadful earthquake in the year nine hundred and eleven cabulistan was thrown into great consternation by dreadful earthquakes which laid most of the cities in ruins baber endeavored to alleviate this public calamity in such a manner by his unwearied care and extensive benevolence that he gained the love and fidelity of all his new subjects  the restless genius of baber could not lie quiet his aspiring disposition began to extend his views to conquest baber invades candahar he accordingly led an army against the argons of kandahar and deprived them of the strong sort of kiliat establishing an alliance with mirza baddiulzeman of herat he marched in the same year to kussluckat which he brought into subjection and gave the government of ghizni which from a great empire was diminished into an inconsiderable province to his brother jehangire  marches to chorrasan in the year nine hundred and twelve baber marched toward chorrasan to join sultan hussein mirza who ashamed of his former behavior and irritated by fresh injuries from shubiani chan now proposed to baber that they should join in alliance against him but when baber had reached nimrosa he heard of sultan husseins death he proceeded however to chorrassan and endeavored to stir up the princes and omrahs against the usbecks he was not able to effect his purpose and he therefore returned by the way of herat toward cabul the snows were at that time very deep and prevented his passage over the hills which obliged him to cantoon his troops in hazara  disturbances in cabul when baber was thus constrained to remain at hazara mahummud hassein gurgan birlass and other mogul omrahs joining with chan mirza his cousin raised him to the throne of cabul by promoting false intelligence of the sultans death but when the news of his return reached the people they rebelled against the new government and as soon as the season permitted his approach a d   0  hig     flocked to his standard put all the garrisons into his hands except the capital where chan mirza and his adherents sustained a short siege and then capitulated quelled the principal persons concerned in the revolt were expelled the country about this time nasir mirza the sultans youngest brother who held the government of baduchshan being defeated by one of the generals of shubiani chan took refuge at cabul and as mirza jehangire had killed himself by hard drinking his government of ghizni was now conferred upon nasir mirza  in the year nine hundred and thirteen baber marched against the afghans of ghalingi who infested his country and took from them one hundred thousand sheep and some thousands of other cattle and returned baber invited to candahar the omrahs of the house of argon being greatly oppressed by the usbecks wrote to baber at this time that if he would march that way they would put him in possession of candahar the sultan did not hesitate to comply with their request he immediately set out and as he was passing kilat chan mirza begged the favor of being admitted into his presence and receiving his pardon accompanied him when he had reached the borders of candahar he wrote to shaw beg and mahummud mokem that he was so far upon his way according to their desire and that therefore he expected to see them in his camp  since the time of their writing to baber some alterations in their politics had made them repent of the application they had made so that instead of receiving the sultan in a friendly manner they prepared for war and desired he would return home but the sultan determined not to suffer such an indignity with impunity takes candahar he marched forward and engaged them at the village of gillishack near the city of candahar defeated them with great slaughter and cutting off their retreat from the city shaw

complained to shubiani chan prevailed upon him to engage in his behalf and to march toward candahar nasir mirza upon receiving this intelligence shut himself up in the town and sent expresses to his brother for assistance baber wrote him to defend the place as long as he could but if he should be driven to great distress to capitulate and come to him at cabul for that at this time he was in no condition to dispute the field with shubiani chan whose forces and finances were greatly superior besides that a defeat might ruin him for ever and overset all the projects he had formed of raising

shubiani chan after taking the place gave it back to the sons of zulnon and marched with his army toward chorrassan but no sooner had shubiani evacuated candahar than the arguniahs made an incursion and possessed themselves of the place this was an agreeable piece of news to sultan baber as they formed a barrier between him and the usbecks  humaioon  this year upon the fourth of zicat sultan baber had a son born to him in cabul whom he named humaioon who afterward became emperor of hindostan the sultan in the following year took the field against the memind afghans cabul in the absence of baber revolts and during his absence the mogals of chusero shaw who had been left to defend cabul revolted and set up abdul rys the son of aligh a d   0  hig     beg upon the throne baber deserted by his army the sultan was immediately deserted by the greatest part of his army for hearing of the rebellion in cabul they hastened home to protect their families insomuch that out of upwards of ten thousand horse which he carried to the field baber had now scarce five hundred remaining in his camp  his daring enterprise notwithstanding of these misfortunes baber boldly resolved to advance toward cabul with the few trusty friends he had left abdul rysaac upon the sultans approach came out of the city with an army ten or twelve thousand strong the sultan with his small troop advanced toward them and when he came near ordered them to halt he himself rode close up to the rebelarmy and challenged adbul rysaac to fight kills five omrahs in single combats but as he seemed to decline the combat five omrahs one after another engaged him and fell by his hand the names of the omrahs were alli shubcore alli seistani nisr bahadur usbeck jacoob tez jung and usbeck bahadar  this heroic behavior struck the rebels with so much admiration and astonishment that they refused to sight by which means the usurper was taken but so great was the sultans clemency that he pardoned him but soon after beginning to raise more disturbance he suffered the just reward of a traitor  war between pe and the usbecks the country of chusero shaw having fallen into the hands of the usbecks who took no proper means of keeping it in subjection a number of independent chiefs sprung up in buduchshan of whom the principal was zeiper chan mirza upon this by the advice of his mother sha begum who traced her genealogy to the great secunder alexander the great  began to entertain hopes and to take measures to raise himself to that kingdom having previously obtained leave of the sultan he this year left cabul and having raised a small a d   0  hig     army advanced toward the borders of buduchshan but his mother who came up in the rear was attacked by a body of kashgars and carried off prisoner while chan mirza himself was defeated and obliged to give himself up to zeiper who kept him under guard eusoph alli kockultash who had been an old servant of mirza formed a conspiracy against zeiper and assassinated him and chan mirza was raised to the throne by the people  in the year nine hundred and sixteen shaw ismaiel suffavi king of iran wrote to shubiani chan to withdraw his troops from some of the skirts of his dominions upon which he had begun to encroach to root up the tree of contention which produced bitter fruits and to plant that of friendship whose blossoms shed the most grateful perfume shubiani chan replied that it was only for those who were descended from kings to entertain thoughts of empire that it was true that shaw ismaiel though the son of a turkuman fakier had raised himself to a kingdom when there was no lord of seven nations around him to oppose him that therefore it would be now advisable for him to retire to his former obscurity and that for that purpose he sent him a staff and a beggars dish for his inheritance for that shubiani only was worthy of possessing the bride of royalty who durst kiss her through opposing swords  ismaiel suffavi answered that if empire was an inheritance by what means was it so often violated till it sell to his lot for his own part he had always considered the right of kings as sounded upon power and that the longest sword was the best title that with the latter he was at all times ready to dispute with shubiani and that though he himself had no opinion of contemptuous ostentation yet in return for shubianis present he had sent him a gridiron and spinningwheel for his amusement as for the rest that ismaiel would be his own messenger  a d      hig     having dispatched this message ismaiel immediately collected his army and marching eastward subdued chorrassan and advanced to murve before shubiani chan could make the least opposition shubiani not being then prepared to engage ismaiel in the field he shut himself up in murve but being severely reproached by shaw ishmaiel he marched out and gave him battle in which he was defeated in his flight he had the misfortune to get into a park with about five hundred princes and principal officers from whence he could find no outlet shubiani overthrown and slain he was attacked there by shaw ishmaiel and seeing no hope of escape left he and his followers fought refusing quarter till every man of them was laid dead on the field  chan mirza immediately dispatched this important news from buduchshan to sultan baber and went himself to kunduz informing him that now was the time for recovering his former dominions baber marches to recover his dominions baber accordingly in the year nine hundred and seventeen marched with all expedition toward hissar crossing the amu the oxus with chan mirza but a great army of usbecks being encamped near that city they were obliged to retreat to kunduz  clemency of ishmaiel shaw shaw ishmaiel at this time sent chan zad begum the sultans sister who had been taken in samarcand by shubiani chan and afterward married by him with all her effects to kunduz where she gave so favorable an account of the generous behavior of shaw ishmaiel that baber was induced to hope for his assistance in reinstating him in his hereditary kingdom baber solicits his aid against the usbecks he for this purpose sent him an ambassador with proper presents in the mean time in order to keep up the spirit of enterprise he marched toward hissar where he still found the usbecks greatly superior in force to him he therefore declined to attack them till he should recruit more forces this being done he advanced to their encampment and offered them battle which they accepted and baber obtained a d      hig     baber overthrows the usbecks a complete victory to which the bravery of chan mirza greatly contributed  he was in a few days after joined by ahmed sultan suffi alli chan ostagelo sharock chan afshar

rushed in the night into his tent but being alarmed by the noise he made his escape naked and reached the fort of arick before morning without one attendant and the conspirators plundered his camp and dispersed themselves he returns to cabul in this situation of affairs the sultan saw no further hope in those northern regions and therefore set out for cabul with a small retinue and upon his arrival appointed nasir mirza to the government of ghizni  in the year nine hundred and twenty four he marched toward sawad and bejoar possessed by the afghans of eusoph zehi who had been infesting his

year nine hundred and twenty four to his decisive victory over sultan ibrahim lodi when sultan secunder the king of hindostan died he was succeeded as we have already related by sultan ibrahim in whose reign the patan omrahs became so factious that they totally broke the power of that empire sultan baber reckoned this a d      hig     a good opportunity to establish himself in hindostan meditates the conquest of hindostan the conquest of which he had long meditated though he was always embroiled in other affairs  invades hindostan baber accordingly in the year nine hundred and twenty five marched his army as far as the nilaab or sind reduces punjaab he subdued all the countries in his way and crossing the river advanced to berah in punjaab raising heavy contributions for withholding his troops from plunder he sent from berah moulana murshid with an embassy to sultan ibrahim acquainting him that as that country had been for many years in the possession of the house of timur it was proper he should now relinquish his pretensions to it and so prevent the war from being carried further into his country  at this place baber received advice of the birth of another son whom he named hindal mirza marches against he gickers he appointed hassen beg governor of the conquered countries as far as chinaab and marched in person against the gickers and besieged the fort of pirhala whither hati their chief had retired the gickers were one day tempted to take the field and were defeated by do beg the sultans general while he himself cut off their retreat to the fort and obliged them to fly to the mountains returns to cabul the fort in which there was a considerable treasure fell by this means into his hands which satisfied baber for this expedition and he returned to cabul  his second expedition into hindosta in the latter end of the same year baber returned again to hindostan with an intention to take lahore and in his way chastised some patans of the tribe of eusoph zehi who disturbed his march he built a fort at peshawir and then advanced to the sind he there received intelligence that sultan seid chan of kashgar was marching into buduchshan which obliged him to return leaving mirza mahummud sultan one of the descendents of timur with four thousand horse to support his authority in that country he a d      hig     had not however reached cabul before

toward hindostan chastising the patans in his way till he reached salcot the inhabitants of which country submitted and saved their possessions but the people of seidpoor erecting the standard of defense were in the end put all to the sword their wealth given up to depredation and their children and wives carried away captive baber was here alarmed by intelligence from cabul that obliged him to return for the kandharians had invaded his country returns and ges candahar he marched against them drove them out of the field and invested their capital  he in the mean time received advice of the death of chan mirza in buduchshan and appointed his son humaioon to that government shaw beg the prince of candahar held out with great bravery against baber for the space of three years during which time the siege lasted which is taken but in the year nine hundred and twenty eight baber who was obstinate in his resolution at length reduced it and all the country of garrumsere appointing prince camiran to the government  soon after the surrender of candahar dowlat chan lodi apprehensive of sultan ibrahim sent a deputation to sultan baber at cabul begging his protection babers  expeon

of punjaab joined their a d      hig   0 forces and opposed him but they were defeated with great slaughter lahore taken baber in person marched to lahore and took it setting fire to the bazar according to a superstitious custom of the moguls  the king remained four days only in lahore and then advanced against debalpoor and debalpoor he summoned the place to surrender but as the garrison forced him to risque an assault in which he was successful he put them all to the sword dowlat chan lodi with alli chan ghazi chan and delawir chan his three sons joined him at debalpoor and the father was appointed to the government of jallender sultanpoor and other districts of punjaab which rendered him very powerful  dowlat chan lodi this dowlat chan lodi was a descendant of the race of that name who heretofore reigned at delhi he gave to sultan baber information that ismaiel jelwani may jelwani and other afghans were collected at kharah that it would therefore be advisable to dispatch a force against them the sultan agreed to this proposal and prepared to send a detachment that way suspected in the mean time delawir chan the youngest son of dowlat chan acquainted baber with whom he was a great favorite that his father and brother wanted to divide his troops to put some plan which they themselves had concerted in execution confined the sultan after being convinced of the truth of this information ordered dowlat chan lodi and his son ghazi chan into confinement he then crossed the suttuluz advanced to sirhind and there released the prisoners and gave them jagiers escapes but when they had reached sultanpoor they deserted the camp and fled to the hills the sultan upon this gave to delawir chan the title of chan chanan and both their jagiers but as the father and sons desertion greatly affected babers interest in hindostan he thought it no ways advisable to proceed to delhi this year he accordingly returned to lahore a d      hig     and having appointed governors to the different countries in his possession in hindostan set out for cabul  during babers absence dowlat chan lodi found means to seize his son chan chanan who had betrayed him and put him in chains defeats babers forces then marching with a formidable army to debalpoor fought sultan alla ul dien and baba kiska and defeating them subdued that country sultan alla ul dien fled to cabul and baba kiska to lahore dowlat chan sent five thousand sirwani afghans against salcot but mir abdul aziz of lahore immediately marched with what forces he had to the assistance of kokiltash who held the government of salcot and meeting with this detachment of afghans defeated them and returned to lahore  sultan ibrahim attacks him much about this time an army on the part of sultan ibrahim of delhi marched against dowlat chan and his son dowlat turned his army to give them battle and having met them at bidjwarrah found means to stir up a faction in his own favor in the imperial camp insomuch that such as were not disaffected were obliged to fly the camp and return to ibrahim  alla arrives at lahore sultan alla ul dien who had lost his government of debalpoor and had fled to cabul now arrived in lahore with orders from baber to all his omrahs of those parts to join him with all their forces and march toward delhi and that he would support them in person as soon as his affairs at home would permit dowlat chan and ghazi chan lodi hearing of this order wrote to the mogul omrahs that they were glad to find that sultan baber espoused the cause of alla ul dien who was the very person they themselves would choose to raise to the throne of delhi that if they would therefore send him to them they would undertake to place him upon the musmid  a d      hig     joins the two lodis the omrahs having first obtained a grant for sultan baber of all the countries beyond the sind permitted alla ul dien to join the lodis himself without complying further with the sultans orders besieger delhi when accordingly he arrived in their camp dowlat chan and his son supplied him with the greatest part of their force with which he marched toward delhi and invested it as before related with forty thousand horse in the mean time sultan ibrahim advanced against him from agra and was surprised in the night when he had reached near the city overthrown by ibrahim but by the irregular behavior of sultan alla ul diens army who in the morning dispersed themselves to plunder they were fallen upon by sultan ibrahim and defeated in their turn which obliged alla to retreat in great distress to punjaab when sultan baber heard of the defeat of alla ul dien he awoke from the dream of indolence and luxury which he had indulged for some time in cabul babers fifth expedition into hindostan and in the beginning of the spring of the year nine hundred and thirty two marched the fifth time toward hindostan he was joined by his son humaioon with a good force from buduchshan and chaja callan with the troops from ghizni he took the rout of lahore and in the way used to hunt rhinoceroses with which that country abounded and so had an opportunity of putting the personal bravery of most of his omrahs to trial as that was a dangerous and warlike exercise many of those animals were killed and some taken alive in toils  crosses the sind upon the first of rubbi ul awil baber crossed the sind and upon the banks of that river mustered his army which consisted of only ten thousand choice horse crossing then the behat he advanced to salcot where sultan alla ul dien met him and likewise mahummud alli jungjung governor of cullanore and chaja hassin the dewan for those provinces  a d      hig     dowlat chan and ghazi chan who reckoned themselves publicly in the service of alla ul dien now lay upon the banks of the ravi near lahore with an army of forty thousand men puts to flight the two lodis but when baber advanced toward them they fled dowlat to the fort of milwit and ghazi chan to the skirts of the hills dowlat taken sultan baber invested milwit and dowlat chan after a few days capitulated it seems that some days before he put on two swords and boasted what he would do to sultan baber baber now ordered those two swords to be hung round his neck and in that manner dowlat was brought to his presence but notwithstanding his behavior the sultan forgave all his crimes and took him into favor  when the gates of the fort were opened the troops pressed in in an irregular manner and began to plunder baber upon this mounted his horse and entering was under the necessity of using violence to prevent their outrages he killed upon this occasion a principal officer of his son humaioons retinue with an arrow for which he was extremely grieved as it happened by mistake the sultan by this means saved the honor of dowlat chans family who were all in the place and preserved a noble library which he had collected dowlat chan being a poet and a man of learning baber marched from thence the next day and pursued ghazi chan when chan chanan ghazi chans brother found means to escape to him and was honorably received ghazi defeated chapihoon chan who was detached in front having fallen in with ghazi defeated him and pursued him so close that he was obliged to fly to sultan ibrahim chan at delhi dowlat chan died upon this march  baber having in several actions perceived the inferiority of the patan troops to his own determined to delay no longer his final attempt upon the empire baber marches toward delhi he accordingly marched toward delhi having some letters of encouragement at the same time from a few of the malcontents at the court of sultan ibrahim when he had a d      hig     reached the banks of the giger he heard that hamid chan governor of firosa was waiting to oppose him in front with the troops of those parts humaioon defeats a patan army baber therefore sent humaioon kallan beg sultan duldi jehan beg chusero beg hindo beg abdul aziz and mahummud alli jungjung to drive hamid from his post which they effected and returned victorious to the army as this was the first battle in which prince humaioon commanded his father was greatly rejoiced and gave him the countries of firosa and jallender two days after meian an omrah of the party of ibrahim appeared in fight and desired to join babers colors with three thousand patan horse and was accordingly entertained in his service  baber arrives at shawabad baber having arrived within two stages of shawabad received intelligence that sultan ibrahim with a great army had marched out of delhi to oppose him and that daood chan and hatim chan formed his vanguard with twenty seven thousand horse the sultan immediately detached chin timur sultan muedi chaja mahummud sultan mirza adil sultan mirza with all the troops of the left wing and the squadrons of sultan juneid birlass and shaw hassein birlass against this advanced post defeats the van of ibrahims army they accordingly fell in with them the next morning at sunrise and after an obstinate conflict put daood chan and hatim chan to slight but the latter sell in the pursuit the victors took seven elephants and a great number of prisoners with whom they returned to baber but he we are sorry to relate such barbarity put them to death by way of striking terror into his enemies  preparations for a general engagement baber advancing to the field of battle encamped there six days ordering chains to be made to link the carriages of his guns together to prevent the horse breaking through them the army of sultan ibrahim by this time consisted of one hundred thousand horse and a thousand elephants that of sultan baber of thirteen thousand only when sultan ibrahim had advanced near baber ordered five a d      hig     thousand horse to storm his camp in the night but finding the enemy upon their guard this detachment returned without attempting any thing  this retreat hastened sultan ibrahim to action and accordingly he marched next morning to panniput baber at the same time advanced within six crores of ibrahims encampment upon the day after being the seventh of rigib the two armies came in sight of each other baber forms his army into order battle baber divided his troops into two lines and four grand divisions with a body of reserve in the rear of each and a few light horse to skirmish in front the first division on the right was commanded by prince humaioon with the squadron of chaja cullan beg sultan mahummud dewilde hindo beg willi beg chazin and pier kulli seistani the first on the left was under the orders of mirza mahummud sultan with the squadrons of meridi chaja ghazi sultan sultan suneid birlass and shaw hassein birlass the second on the right toward the center was commanded by chin timur sultan mirza mahummud kokultash and shaw munsoor the second to the left toward the center by mere chalifa tirdi beg and mihib alli chalifa chusero kokultash mahummud alli jungjung and mirza soliman were appointed to command the light horse or herawils in the front abdul aziz and bar tirrah in the rear of the right and kirrah keri bahadur and willi kizil in the rear of the left besides which there was a reserve in the rear of both lines that on the right commanded by malleck casim and that on the left by alli bahadur the king himself took his post in the center of the first line after having personally given orders to his generals  ibrahim draws out his army the emperor ibrahim ignorant of the art of war observed no regular order of battle but drew up his army in one great line or column of unequal depth the battle begins and ordered them to charge the mogul army vainly imagining that he could bear them down by numbers a d      hig     but he found himself soon fatally deceived the indian army broken so formidable were the moguls to the patans from their known courage and steady order that the emperors unweildy column began to break and turn thin before they came up to the charge which was directed at the center of the mogul army those who advanced were repulsed with great bravery but when they sought to retreat they found themselves surrounded for the two bodies of reserve in the rear of the mogul line had wheeled round their flanks and meeting in the center fell upon the rear of those who had advanced to the charge by which means the afghans were almost all cut to pieces the reserve having performed this service retired to their post in the rear and the mogul lines advanced sustaining various irregular charges from the indian army whom they repulsed with great slaughter  sultan ibrahim charges the moguls in person sultan ibrahim at last roused with shame and indignation advanced in person followed by the flower of his army and gave such a violent shock to the mogul line as threw it into disorder nothing now but personal bravery was left to decide the day but in this and the compact form in which the moguls whole force was wedged they were still superior to the indians ibrahim killed five thousand fell with sultan ibrahim in one small spot of ground a total overthrow of his army the patan army when their king was slain recoiled like surges from a rocky shore and the torrent of flight rolled toward the banks of the jumna dying the course of that river with blood for so far did sultan baber continue the pursuit but being wearied with slaughter he gave hope to fear and respite to death  according to the most moderate accounts there were sixteen thousand afghans killed in this action though most of the indian authors say fifty thousand of the loss of baber we have no information conquerors having it always in their power to conceal the number of their slain the fall of the  we may date from this battle the fall of the patan empire though that race afterward made many efforts a d      hig     and recovered it for a few years as we shall see in the life of humaioon  sultan baber did not fail to make the best use of his victory he immediately after the battle detached humaioon and three of his principal omrahs to agra before they could have time to recover from their consternation or to remove their wealth he also sent mahummud sultan and three other omrahs to delhi to take possession of that capital while he himself came up in the rear baber enters delhi and assumes the empire and on the twelfth of rigib entered that city the chutba was read in his name by zein sidder and after having surveyed the city and visited the tombs of the saints and heroes arrives before agra he set out for agra where he arrived the twenty fifth of the same month and immediately invested the fort which was in possession of the former government garrisoned by the troops of raja bickermagit of gualier who had been killed in the action which submits but so much had the terror of his arms now taken possession of every mind that they immediately desired to capitulate and sent him by way of ransom a perfect diamond weighing two hundred and twenty four ruttys a rutty is seven eighths of a carat  which was formerly the property of sultan alla ul dien chilligi sultan baber presented it to his son humaioon thus upon the fifth day after his arrival he was put in possession of the place in which he found the mother of sultan ibrahim who was treated with becoming respect and permitted to carry away all her wealth  reflections upon the conquest of hindostan by baber this conquest of hindostan as baber himself writes in his commentaries the commentaries of baber are still extant and reckoned one of the best performances of the kind in the east  was certainly superior to that of any former conqueror sultan mahmood of ghizni was not only a powerful emperor but the country was at that time divided into a number of kingdoms which greatly facilitated his enterprises shab ul dien ghori brought an army of one hundred and twenty thousand men with him when the kingdom a d      hig     was not so powerful the like may be said of timur who ravaged hindostan when it was torn to pieces by civil commotions but the army of sultan baber was but a handful in proportion to that of sultan ibrahim who possessed all the countries between the sind and behar and could bring five hundred thousand men to the field while baber only possessed the poor countries of cabul buduchshan and candahar the revenues of which were very inconsiderable  to what then can we attribute this extraordinary conquest in a natural light but to the great abilities and experience of baber the bravery of his few hardy troops trained up to war for their subsistence and now fired with the hopes of glory and gain but what contributed most to weigh down the scale of conquest was the degeneracy of the patans effeminated by luxury and wealth and dead to all principles of virtue and honor which their corrupt factions and civil discords had totally effaced it being now no shame to fly no infamy to betray no breach of honor to murder and no scandal to change parties when therefore the fear of shame and the love of fame were gone it was no wonder that a herd without unanimity order or discipline should fall into the hands of a few brave men this is the general tendency of wealth in all governments if the reins are not held fast the laws punctually executed and the progress of corruption checked both by private and public economy  babers generosity upon the twentieth of rigib baber went into the treasury which was very rich he reserved not a single dinar for himself but divided it among his omrahs and troops the share of the former coming to two lacks of rupees each and those of others were proportionable to their rank and stations a part was sent to cabul to be divided among babers subjects which yielded to each a silver sharoch a silver sharoch is in value about a shilling sterling  besides presents which he sent to samarcand chorrassan a d      hig     kashgur ayrac mecca medina kirbilla negif mushad and other holy places in charity this generosity which bordered upon prodigality got baber the name of a collinder whose custom it is to keep nothing for tomorrow  the provincial omrahs refuse to submit as the patans were in great terror of the moguls and had a natural antipathy to their government they still refused to submit and appeared every where in arms strengthening their forts and erecting the standard of defiance in their different provinces cazim in simbol alli chan formalli in mewat mahummud zeiton in dolepoor tatar chan in gualier hussein chan lohani in rhaberi cuttub chan in atava

throne but as it was necessary to form an alliance for their mutual defense they unanimously appointed par chan the son of diria chan lodi their general or rather king by the title of sultan mahummud and rendezvousing at kinnoge advanced toward agra at the same time may the afghan chief who had joined baber now deserted him with all his adherents even the inhabitants of the country round agra cut off his foraging parties and rendered it very difficult for him to support his cavalry or supply his troops with provisions add to this the intolerable heat of the weather by which a great many moguls not being accustomed to such a climate died  babers distressful situation in this situation of affairs baber received an address from all his omrahs advising him to return to cabul to which he replied that a kingdom which had cost him so much pains in taking was not to be wrested from him but by death alone his resolute behavior he at the same time issued a proclamation that he was determined to abide his fate in hindostan but if any person was desirous of returning to cabul preferring safety to glory and ignoble ease to the manly toils and a d      hig     dangers of war they might retire in peace and leave him only those whose valor would reflect honor on themselves and glory on their king and country  the omrahs hearing this were ashamed of their former behavior and striking their breasts swore they would never forsake him all except chaja callan whose bravery was too well established to be disputed though he was advised being at the point of death to retire to recover his health he was appointed governor of cabul and ghizni for the great services which he had rendered to the king some patan chiefs come over to his party when it was known that baber had determined not to leave hindostan as his ancestor timur had done some omrahs who were willing to be first in favor began to come over to him first shech gurin with three thousand horse from between the rivers offered his service which was accepted the next was alli chan formalli from mewat to redeem his sons who had been taken in the battle then firose chan and shech baizid chirmali with their whole dependents  casim of simbol submits much about this time an address was received from casim of simbol that bein an afghan was besieging him in his fort and that if the sultan would send him succors he would list himself among his servants the king sent kokultash with a detachment that way who engaged bein the afghan and defeated him after which casim put the moguls in possession of the fort humaioon marches against the confederate omrahs the king then sent his son humaioon with the greatest part of his army against the confederate omrahs whose forces amounted to fifty thousand horse but upon humaioons approach they retreated from kinnoge to jionpoor humaioon having prevailed upon fatie chan the former emperors vizier to join him sent him to the king at agra who treated him with the utmost respect and favor which induced several other afghan chiefs to come over to his interest  a d      hig     nizam chan governor of biana though he was now hard pressed by rana sinka who wanted to make himself master of that province still refused to submit to the kings authority which obliged baber to send baba kuli against him with a detachment which was defeated nizam governor of biana submits but rana sinka soon after reduced nizam to such extremities that he sent a deputation to sultan baber begging pardon for his offense and requesting he would support him for which he was ready to pay him due allegiance the king glad of the opportunity made no hesitation to embrace the offer and sending a force to drive off rana nizam was put in possession of the place which was settled upon him with all its dependencies for the annual payment of twenty lacks of rupees  the governors of gualier propose to submit tatar chan and saring chan who were in possession of the fort of gualier being besieged by muckit roy raja of that country in the same manner addressed the king for succors baber dispatched rehim daad and shech gurin with a detachment which defeated the raja but saring

wrote to rehim daad to endeavor to get permission to come himself into the fort and that he would find means of accomplishing the rest of his desires  gualier taken by a stratagem rehim daad for this purpose begged leave as he had enemies all around him to bring his troops under protection of the garrison for fear of a night assault and that he might be permitted the honor of paying the philosopher a visit in the garrison this being agreed to rehim daad was received into the sort with a few attendants he from time to time pretended occasion to send frequent messages in and out till the officer of the guard troubled the governor so often for leave that he desired rehim daad to send one a d      hig     of his own servants to point out such necessary people as he might want to have free ingress and egress  the officer of the guard who was a disciple of the philosopher and who had been let into the plot availed himself of this order and permitted every body rehim daads servant pointed out to pass by which means all the chosen men of the detachment were within the garrison before the entertainment was ended saring chan was told to give up the place and threatened with instant death in case of refusal so having satisfied himself of the circumstances he made a virtue of necessity and replied that had he not intended giving up the place to the king he would never

interred in a holy sepulcher  his character what shall we say of baber the wonder of the age in which he lived he mounted a throne at twelve years of age and with various turns of fortune reigned thirty eight his humanity and generosity he was a prince of great humanity and he carried his generosity to such excess that it bordered upon prodigality with respect to the first he so often pardoned ingratitude and treason that he seemed to make a principle of rendering good for evil he thus disarmed vice and made the wicked the worshipers of his virtue  his religion he was of the sect of the hanifites in whose doctrine and tenets he was perfectly versed yielding more to the evidence of reason than to the mavelous legends of superstitious antiquity he was not however forgetful of that rational worship which is due to the great creator nor a despiser of those laws and ceremonies which are founded on found policy for the benefit of the superficial judges of things his genius for the fine arts he was a master in the arts of poetry writing and music he wrote his own commentaries in the mogul language with such elegance and propriety that they are universally admired this work was translated in the reign of ackbar by chan chanan into the persian language and from it we have abridged the preceding history of the life of baber  in his person he was something above the middle size nervous and well formed his countenance was pleasant and in disposition he was easy facetious and affable  a d    0 hig     his justice to establish his reputation for justice and honor we shall relate one instance out of many when he was prince of ferghana a rich caravan of chitta and china which was crossing the mountains of indija was buried in the snow he ordered all the goods to be collected and sent messengers to china to proclaim the accident and bring the owners or their heirs to his court upon their arrival at the end of two years he entertained them hospitably and returned them all their goods not only refusing to accept a present but even to be reimbursed for his expenses  addicted to pleasure notwithstanding his great vigor in war he was much addicted to wine and women and all the fashionable pleasures of courts he sometimes used when he had an inclination to make merry to fill a fountain with wine upon which was inscribed a verse to this purpose jovial days blooming springs old wine and young maidens enjoy freely o baber for life is not twice to be enjoyed he then would sit down in the midst of his friends drink freely and feast his eyes on the daughters of beauty who danced before him  whithersoever he marched or rode he always had the road measured after him this custom obtains with the emperors of hindostan to this day he made a statute concerning the measurement of distances which has hitherto remained in force he appointed a hundred tinnabs to one crore each tinnab being forty guz a guz is not quite an english mile   his talents for war with respect to his military character he seems to have had few that could equal him he rendered the most dangerous enterprises easy by his undaunted courage and perseverance which rose above all difficulties and made him much more the object of admiration in his adversity than in the height of his prosperity nor did he forget a d    0 hig     himself in the latter but always behaved with that moderation and equanimity which characterizes a great soul  his genealogy we have already traced babers descent from timur but as he was the founder of a great dynasty it will be proper to follow his genealogy further back into antiquity the great chingez chan the son of pissuka the son of pirna had four sons of renown who were all kings and the fathers of nations their names were oktai chaan chigittai chan judgi chan and tooli chan though oktai chaan was not the eldest son yet he was by his father appointed his successor and ruled in kirrakerim and kilwaran which were the original

in judicial astrology he sitted up seven houses of entertainment and named them after the seven planets in each he gave public audience according to the ruling planet of the day ordering all the furniture paintings and also the dresses of those who waited upon him to bear something that was an emblem of the tutelar star of the house he even endeavored to suit the people who came to pay their

humaioon to follow long these innocent whims such only suited the days of peace when the mind might enjoy her harmless follies designs of his brother against him he scarcely had ascended the throne when his brother mirza camiran who was then in cabul formed a design of making himself master of punjaab to conceal his intentions he gave out that he was going to hindostan to congratulate humaioon upon his accession the king being however apprized of camirans views by his behavior in those countries through which he passed and being extremely unwilling to make war upon his brother consented to let him govern punjaab pishawir lemghan cabul candahar and biana this effectually stopped the progress of mirza camiran promotions the king in the mean time conferred the government of mewat upon mirza hindal his brother and appointed mirza askari to that of simbol the other provinces being left in the possession of the former subas  humaioon besieges callinger humaioon in the year nine

fortress in the province of oud within seven ores of benaris both shere chan and sultan bahadur were governors under the former empire and had after the death of ibrahim assumed independence  which being refused the sultan marched his army that way when humaioon lay before chinar he was informed that sultan bahadur of guzerat had turned toward him the points of his spears this obliged him to patch up a kind of a peace with shere chan and to return toward agra cuttub chan the son of shere chan whom the emperor had taken as an hostage found means on the way to make his escape and to return to his father at chinar  a conspiracy discovered mahummud ziman mirza the grandson of sultan hussein mirza aspired to the throne and was supported in his pretensions by the omrahs of chigittai the plot was discovered and the leader of the conspiracy pardoned but humaioon finding him a second time meditating treasonable practices he ordered him to be confined in the fortress of biana orders were given to put out the eyes of mahummud sultan and nuherit mirza for being the principal abettors of the princes ambitious designs but the person to whom it was entrusted to inflict this punishment saved the eyes of the former while the latter found means to escape to guzerat mahummud sultan by the aid of his sons ali mirza and shaw mirza who formed a party was carried away to kinnoge where he was joined by about six thousand moguls afghans and rajaputs  rebellion at kinnoge humaioon sent to bahadur the governor of kinnoge and commanded him to deliver up mahummud but he rejected the orders

the protection of humaioon but the emperor for what reason is not known having advanced as far as gualier encamped there for two months and returned without effecting any thing to agra rana bickermagit despairing of relief sent a crown and a considerable sum of money to bahadur which induced him to raise the siege  sultan bahadur sultan bahadur whose affairs were now in a very prosperous situation by the reduction of mendu and other places began to show his contempt of humaioon by advancing the conspirator mahummud to great honors he also prompted sultan alla ul dien the son of the emperor beloli lodi to attempt to possess himself of the throne of delhi sends an army against humaioon he for this purpose made tatar chan the son of sultan alla ul dien his general and dispatched him with forty thousand men against humaioon with which he subdued biana and advanced to the environs of agra  this pressing danger awaked the king from his lethargy he immediately sent mirza hindal with a force to oppose tatar chan when the armies approached one another there was so great a desertion from tatars troops that in the space of ten days ten thousand horse scarce remained to him he however resolved with these to stand his ground and give battle to the imperial army which is totally defeated but he was totally overthrown lost the most of his troops three hundred officers of distinction and his own life mirza hindal after this victory retook biana and all the other places which had before fallen into the hands of the enemy and returned in triumph to agra  bahadur marches

he called dien panna he soon after marched toward a d      hig   0 humaioon sends him a punning letter saringpoor which then held of bahadur as sultan of guzerat and wrote to him a punning couplet unworthy of the dignity and majesty of a king chitor in the persian language signifies in what manner and upon this was founded the miserable witticism contained in the verses the words were o thou plunderer of the city of chitor in what manner can thou conquer the idolaters for when thou would wish to conquer chitor thou know not in what manner the king comes to conquer thee  bahadur answered humaioon in his own strain and in the following words bahadurs answer i who am the plunderer of chitor will conquer the idolaters by valor and he who dares not succor chitor shall see in what manner he himself shall be conquered the wit is wretched on both sides but he who began the pun is most to blame  calls a council of war sultan bahadur after sending the above billet to humaioon called a council of war it was the opinion of the majority that as humaioon had all his force with him it were better to raise the siege and march against him and thus to take up the war by the roots others urged that humaioon was so rigid in his religious principles that he would not disturb them in their war with idolaters that therefore it was most advisable to finish the siege which was now far advanced and afterward to think of other matters  bahadur himself favored the latter opinion the siege was accordingly continued and humaioon piquing himself upon his religious principles continued loitering at saringpoor till sultan bahadur had taken the fort takes chito and marches against the emperor bahadur in the year nine hundred and forty one marched with great expedition against humaioon who hearing of his approach marched forward to meet him the two armies appeared in front of each other near munsoor sultan bahadur who had collected a great train of artillery by advice of his a d      hig     entrenches his army engineer romi chan entrenched his army and placed his cannon in redoubts in his front this prevented humaioon from risquing an attack and both armies continued in sight of one another for the space of two months daily skirmishes were in the mean time fought with various success  humaioon cuts off his supplies humaioon finding that he could not draw bahadur out of his trenches employed all his attention to cut off his supplies he ordered his horse in successive bodies of five or six thousand to scour the rear of the enemy by which means famine began soon to be severely felt in their camp men horses elephants and camels perishing daily in great numbers  cowardice and flight of bahadur bahadur instead of making one brave effort to relieve himself permitted base fear and despair to seize upon him and with only five friends left his camp in the night and fled toward mindu this was no sooner known than the flight became general the chiefs dispersing themselves with their adherents his army is routed and he himself besieged in mindu humaioon in the morning ordered the pursuit to commence which was continued as far as mindu with great slaughter of the unfortunate wretches who had neither the power to escape nor the means to defend themselves bahadur threw himself into mindu and the place was closely invested  mindu taken by surprise in a few days three hundred moguls scaled the walls of mindu in the night and though the garrison consisted of many thousands such was their panic that they all betook themselves to flight bravery of humaioon and sidder chan bahadur escaped to chapanier which was then the capital of guzerat while sidder chan his amir ul omrah who was dangerously wounded not able to proceed farther shut himself up in the sort of sunkar where being besieged he capitulated the second day and was on account of his excellent character received into great favor sidder chan during the pursuit saved sultan bahadur a d      hig     when almost taken by humaioon by throwing himself in between the kings till his master had an opportunity of making his escape but he himself was attacked with such violence by the king in person that after receiving many wounds he got off with great difficulty  humaioon pursues sultan bahadur the king three days after the taking of mindu renewed the pursuit after sultan bahadur who having taken all his treasure and jewels out of mahummud abad and chapanier fled toward amudabad the king giving up the city of chapanier to plunder and committing the siege of the citadel which still held out to dowlat chaja birlass continued to pursue bahadur the unfortunate sultan hearing of his approach fled to cambait but humaioon pursuing him thither he retired to the island of deo humaioon

mostly in the citadel of chapanier he returned to carry on that siege achtiar chan who commanded in the place defended it with great bravery but though he had some years provision in the fort he was covetous of more and took in daily supplies from a certain part of the citadel which was covered by a thick wood  his stratagem the king one day reconnoitring the place observed the proceedings of achtiar chan with regard to the provisions he immediately seized upon a party of country people who carried the supplies through the woods he persuaded or rather commanded them to carry him in disguise to the place they had admittance the king made the necessary remarks returned to his camp and the same night ordered a parcel of iron spikes to be made  a d      hig     be a gallant exploit takes chapanier he himself with three hundred select men went to the place while feigned attacks were made upon every other quarter of the fort as the access to this part of the fortress was extremely difficult the attention of the enemy was entirely drawn toward the different assaults this furnished the king with an opportunity of fixing his iron spikes in the wall by which means thirtynine officers mounted and the king himself made the fortieth before sunrise his whole detachment was within the walls when he displayed a signal which had been previously settled with his troops they accordingly made a violent assault upon all sides and humaioon in the mean time at the head of his detachment cried out alla akbar that is god is greatest and forcing his way sword in hand through the enemy possessed himself of one of the gates he immediately opened it and admitted his troops and all except achtiar chan and his family who were in an outwork were put to the sword the governor defended himself so bravely that he obtained a capitulation  the great strength of this place the numerous garrison and the boldness of the attempt by which it fell rendered this action of the king equal in the opinion of all mankind to any thing of the like nature recorded in history divides the spoil among his troops here the treasure of guzerat which had been collected in the course of many years was distributed among the troops he gave to the officers and soldiers what wealth could be heaped upon their respective shields proportioning the value of the things to their rank and merit all the wealth of room chitta and fring the turkish empire china and europe  which had been there collected to a vast amount was delivered over to plunder  bahadur sultan levies forces sultan bahadur having secured himself in deo sent amad ul muluck chirkuss to ahmedabad to collect the revenues and levy a d      hig     troops he found himself soon at the head of fifty thousand men and was daily gaining strength and reputation humaioon having intelligence of the transactions of bahadur appointed tirdi beg to command the fort of chapanier and the adjacent countries and marched in person with his army toward ahmedabad his army overthrown amad ul muluck drew out his army to oppose him and falling in with the vanguard of the imperialists commanded by mirza ashkari he was defeated before the rest of the army could be brought up to the engagement  the king for this signal service appointed mirza ashkari governor of the splendid city of ahmedabad humaioon reduces all guzerat he divided then the provinces of guzerat among his omrahs and marched against burhanpoor burhan nizam shaw amud ul muluck and the other princes of the decan apprehensive of his designs to reduce chandez wrote to him letters of submission and allegiance  the insurrection under shere chan these letters had scarce arrived when the news of the insurrection of shere chan came to the king he however reduced all the countries about burhanpoor then marched round to mindu amud ul muluck in the mean time in conjunction with the omrahs of guzerat began again to acquire strength and marched with an army toward ahmedabad  humaioon in the mean time invested chinar and reduced it after a siege of six months having then gained the passes he entered bengal shere chan in the mean time carried away the treasure of the princes of gour and bengal whom he had reduced and fled to the mountains of jarcund the king continued his march to gour the capital of bengal took it and commanded it to be called ginnitabad the paradisial city  having resided in that city for the space of three months he was obliged on account of the moist air of that a d      hig     country by which the greatest part of his army fell sick as well as by the rebellion of mirza hindal at agra to return  the brothers disagree mirza hindal the kings brother was sent to suppress mahummud sultan mirza who we have already observed had escaped to kinnoge but instead of performing that service he as soon as he saw himself at the head of an army began to aspire to the throne he accordingly marched back to agra where he discovered his treasonable intentions by putting some of the principal people who rejected his authority to death he thus enforced obedience and throwing away every disguise ordered the chutba to be read in his own name and with all the ensigns of royalty marched to delhi and besieged it  the king having heard of these proceedings left jehangire beg and ibrahim beg to command in bengal and hastened toward agra when he was about half way mahummud zeman mirza who had formerly joined sultan bahadur returned from sind and being promised a pardon joined the king with a considerable party in the mean time shere chan finding the kings army so much weakened by sickness and desertion and his affairs further perplexed by the rebellion of mirza hindal marched with his troops from rotas and came behind the king on the jossa perhaps the sone or carimnassa  both armies lay three months inactive at a time when the king ought to have run all hazards being every day insulted and more and more distressed by the enemy who prevented his crossing the river  mirza camiran mounts the throne in agra to add still to humaioons misfortunes his other brother mirza camiran instead of assisting him ungenerously aspired to his throne and marched with ten thousand horse from lahore when he arrived at delhi mirza hindal prevailed upon him to join his forces with his own after which they both continued the siege  a d      hig     fuchir ul dien alli who commanded in the city acquainted mirza camiran that he could never think of betraying his trust and rather than be so ungrateful to his prince he was determined to hold out to the last drop of his blood but that if he would first possess himself of the capital of agra and entirely subdue his brother he would then and not till then give up the city of delhi when mirza camiran and his brother found him so determined and that the siege would cost them much blood and time they set out together for agra  when they had reached the environs of that city the jealousy which the brothers naturally entertained of each other the eyes of both being turned toward the throne broke out into open war mirza hindal being deserted by many of his party fled to alwir with five thousand horse and three hundred elephants and mirza camiran entering agra assumed all the imperial ensigns  humaioon endavors to bring over his brothers to his interest sultan humaioon endeavored by every possible argument with his brothers to bring about a coalition of interests against shere chan telling them that their family quarrels would certainly in the end lose them that mighty empire which had cost their father so much pains to conquer and involve the family of chigittai in one common ruin that it was therefore advisable to join against the common enemy and afterward divide the empire amongst themselves they reject his proposals these arguments had no weight with his brothers who were so blinded by ambition that they were determined rather to lose all than be contented with a part they vainly hoping that after shero chan had defeated sultan humaioon they should be able to subdue shere chan and each had the solly to suppose that he should be able to exclude the other and so reign alone  humaioon makes peace with shere chan at this juncture shere chan sent shech chelili a dervish of great reputation to sultan humaioon to treat about a peace a d      hig     which the king accepted with gladness upon the following conditions that shere chan should content himself with bengal and behar which he was to hold in the kings name paying a small acknowledgment  treachery of shere chan when the conditions were signed and ratified by mutual oaths humaioon trusting too much to the faith of his enemy permitted a free intercourse between both armies this was what the perfidious shere chan aimed at by the peace he accordingly next morning surprised the sultans camp before daybreak and totally defeated him as the bridge of boats which the sultan had been preparing was not finished there was no way of escape left but by plunging into the river all the boats being seized by a part of the enemy who had turned the rear of the emperors army humaioon totally overthrown humaioon his nobles and a great part of his army were forced into the stream where eight thousand moguls exclusive of hindoos were drowned among whom was mahummud ziman mirza this terrible overthrow happened to humaioon in the year nine hundred and forty six  escapes to agra the king by the assistance of a waterman having with great difficulty swam across the river with a few who had survived the slaughter of this dreadful day fled to agra mirza camiran hearing of this defeat hastened from agra to alwir to consult with his brother mirza hindal he is joined by his brothers finding that now the afghans were likely to prevail they were ashamed of their behavior to their brother and when it was too late thought proper to support him in the mean time all the mogul omrahs who were dispersed in the provinces seeing that the power of their nation had sustained such a violent shock found it also necessary to unite their strength they accordingly hastened from all quarters to agra jehangire beg and ibrahim beg having left bengal and even mahummud sultan a d    0 hig     mirza who had rebelled in kinnoge joined now in the general cause against the afghans  quarrels between the brothers the three brothers having met at agra held daily consultations but mirza camiran who was not earnest in reconciling their different interests brought all their councils to nothing and proposed to return to lahore to which resolution he was very much instigated by chaja callan beg sultan humaioon used every argument to prevent his departure but the ambitious camiran was determined to be every thing himself or to give no assistance to his brother  these impolitic disputes had lasted six months when mirza camiran was seized with a false appetite which he too much indulged and consequently became afflicted with a lientery which he imputed to poison given him by his brothers mirza camiran forsakes the king he immediately set out for lahore leaving a thousand horse with secunder sultan under pretense of assisting his unfortunate brother the inhabitants of agra were greatly discouraged at camirans departure so that many of them fearing the issue of the war accompanied him mirza hyder disgusted with this behavior staid behind and joined humaioon to whom he was of great service  shere chan advances to the gang shere chan who had remained quiet during these disputes now advanced with an army to the banks of the gang and detaching his son cuttub chan over the river possessed himself of the adjacent provinces  humaioon having received intelligence of these motions ordered cassim hassein sultan usbeck in conjunction with eadgar mirza and secunder sultan against him with a great army the imperial generals defeat and slay cuttub chan they met the enemy near calpie where an obstinate engagement was fought in which victory declaring for the moguls cuttub chan with a a d    0 hig     great part of his army was cut off and his head sent to agra the generals at the same time invited the king to come and have the honor of conquering shere chan in person  humaioon marches against shere chan humaioon accordingly marched with a hundred thousand horse and crossing the gang near kinnoge sat down for the space of a month before the army of shere chan which consisted of little more than half his number in the mean time mahummud sultan mirza and his sons who were remarkable for their treachery and ingratitude fled to the enemy with all their adherents drawing many more after them which again plunged the sultan into distress is deserted by a great part of his army for his army being dispirited began to desert by thousands to complete his misfortunes the rainy season now commenced and his camp was quite overflowed with water insomuch that the tents seemed afloat the king therefore resolved to move his camp to higher ground  on the tenth of mohirrim nine hundred and forty seven he put his army in motion and overthrown he was attacked by shere chan on his march and defeated with great slaughter having unfortunately as in the former action the river then close to his rear the flight turned that way and some thousands to avoid the swords of the enemy chose a more ignominious death in the water a few only escaped with the king over the river with whom he fled to agra the rest submitted themselves to the conquerors or dispersed by various routs  shere chan advances to agra shere chan immediately after this victory advanced toward agra the king was forced to retreat to lahore and on the first of rubbi ul awil of that year joined the greatest part of his mogul omrahs who had been dispersed since the action pursues the king shere chan still continuing the pursuit to make the best use of his victory crossed the river of jullanpoor upon which the sultan upon the a d      hig     who takes the route of tatta first of rigib passed the river of lahore and retreated toward tatta and bicker mirza camiran now sensible of his ungenerous and impolitic behavior was himself obliged to fly toward cabul and saw an empire wrested from his family by the effects of that base envy which could not behold even a brothers greatness without pain  his embassy to the governor of tatta humaioon having crossed the sind on his way to bicker halted at lori and sent an ambassador with a horse and dress to mirza shaw hassein governor of tatta to request his aid that he might be able to possess himself of guzerat mirza shaw hassein seeming to listen to his request detained the king by various artifices and excuses for five months by which means his small army distressed for want of pay daily diminished in numbers his brother hindal deserts the king mirza hindal his brother in the mean time left him and went to candahar being invited thither by kirrachi chan governor of that province mirza eadgar nasir proposed at the same time to quit humaioon but this unfortunate king took great pains to keep him firm to his interest giving him the government of bicker but he had no sooner taken possession of that place than he began to strengthen himself and to hatch treason  humaioon besieges sewan humaioon in the mean time had with his little army laid siege to sewan for seven months without effect when shaw hassein desirous of getting the place into his own hands advanced with a great force from tatta and surrounding both the garrison and the besiegers prevented supplies from being carried to either his great distress humaioons army were soon greatly distressed as well as the garrison the king driven to extremities requested mirza eadgar to join him with what forces he had in bicker but this ungrateful man chose rather to be prevailed upon to join mirza shaw hassein who promised him his daughter and to secure him in his government he slies toward bicker he immediately deserted the kings interest at this dangerous crisis and humaioon was obliged to retreat precipitately from before sewan toward bicker a d      hig     he could not even obtain in that place a few boats from his own perfidious subjects to waft his small army over the river after a search of some days and wandering along the banks he discovered some boats that had been sunk raised them and transported his troops to the other side  eadgar nasir submitting notwithstanding this accumulation of misfortunes humaioon had strength enough left to strike terror in eadgar nasir mirza who to avoid his resentment came and made his submission the necessity of the times obtained his pardon raises a sedition but in return for humaioons clemency he began to raise sedition among his troops and privately to draw them over to his own interest this treason being communicated to the king the traitor upon being taxed with it appeared at the head of his troops in open rebellion but the principal officers of the rebellious saction refused to attack their king so that an action was prevented when both parties were formed in order of battle  humaioon obliged to fly the king being in no condition at that juncture to contend with the rebel thought it high time to provide for his own safety elsewhere he therefore marched by the way of jasselmere to raja maldeo then the most potent hindoo prince in hindostan having before received an invitation from him but as he was passing through the territories of jasselmere the raja of that country sent a force to oppose him the king defeated them and passed on to the boundaries of maldeo where he halted and sent a messenger to the raja  but few keep faith with a king when he is under the cloud of misfortunes raja maldeo plots against him maldeo seeing he had nothing to fear from humaioon sound in his own mind no principle to love him he therefore resolved if possible to seize the king and send him to shere shaw one of maldeos servants who had formerly lived under humaioon having intelligence of this design immediately informed the king  a d      hig     he flies humaioon mounted his horse at midnight and fled toward amercot which is about one hundred crores from tatta his horse on the way falling down dead with fatigue he desired tirdi beg who was well mounted to let him have his but so ungenerous was this man and so low was royalty fallen that he refused to comply with his request the troops of the raja being close to his heels he was necessitated to mount a camel till one nidim koka dismounting his own mother gave the king her horse and placing her on the camel ran himself on foot by her side  his great distress the country through which they fled being an entire sandy desert the troops began to be in the utmost distress for water some ran mad others fell down dead nothing was heard but dreadful screams and lamentations calamitous situation of his retinue to add if possible to this calamity news arrived of the enemys near approach humaioon ordered all those who could fight to halt and let the women and baggage move forward the enemy not making their appearance

shech ali shech ali with about twenty brave men resolved to sell his life dear having repeated the creed of martyrdom he rushed upon the enemy and the first arrow having reached the heart of the chief of the party the rest were by the valor of this handful put to flight the other moguls joined in the pursuit and took many of their camels and horses they then continued their march found the king sitting by a well which he had fortunately found and gave him an account of their adventure  the kings dreadful situation for want of water marching forward the next day from this well they were more distressed than before there being no water for two days journey on the fourth day of their retreat they sell in with another well a d      hig     which was so deep that the only bucket they had took a great deal of time in being wound up and therefore a drum was beat to give notice to the caffilas when the bucket appeared that they might repair by turns to drink the people were so impatient for the water that as soon as the first bucket appeared ten or twelve of them threw themselves upon it before it quite reached the brim of the well by which means the rope broke and the bucket was lost and several fell headlong after it when this fatal accident happened the screams and lamentations of all became loud and dreadful some lolling out their tongues rolled themselves in agony on the hot sand while others precipitating themselves into the well met with an immediate and consequently an easier death what did not the unhappy king feel when he saw this terrible situation of his few faithful friends  the next day though they reached water was not less fatal than the former the camels who had not tasted water for several days now drank so much that the greatest part of them died the people also after drinking complained of an oppression of the heart and in about half an hour a great part of them expired  arrives and is humanely received at mercot a few with the king after this unheard of distress reached amercot the raja being a humane man took compassion on their misfortunes he spared nothing that could alleviate their miseries or express his fidelity to the king

returning thanks to god left his family under the protection of raja rana and by the aid of that prince marched against bicker but a mutiny arising among the troops they dispersed so that nothing could be effected some of the kings own omrahs deserted him and the gallant shech ali one of his a d      hig     principal adherents is defeated and flies toward kandahar was killed in an action in which humaioon was defeated the king fled toward kandahar and was on his way joined by byram chan from guzerat mirza camiran had at that time taken the fortress of kandahar from his brother mirza hindal and mirza ashkari governed there by his appointment mirza shaw hassein wrote to mirza ashkari that the king was in the utmost distress and that if he would now favor him so meritorious an action could not be forgot is obliged to fly to chorrassan ashkari instead of listening to this request attacked the king when he approached obliging him to leave behind him his son and fly himself with the sultana mariam muckani and only twentytwo horse to chorrassan mirza ashkari expressed great sorrow at the kings escape and plundering all his effects carried the young prince ackbar to

part of shaw tamasp ul husseini of iran is received kindly by the persian governor of seistan he brought humaioon to seistan and treated him with the greatest respect presenting him with all the money he was worth and furnishing the sultana with slaves the king received just what supplied his occasions and returned the rest and by the king of persias son he from thence set out for herat and was in that city met by sultan mahummud the king of persias eldest son this prince forgot nothing of that generosity and politeness which so remarkably distinguished his character he provided the unfortunate exile very effectually with all necessaries for his journey to court in his progress toward the capital of iran all the governors of the provinces and great men paid him their compliments and made magnificent entertainments for him when he arrived at kizvi he dispatched byram chan to the persian king at ispahan and waited his answer let us now leave humaioon to give an account of the transactions in hindostan during his exile  section ii history of shere shaw before his accession to the imperial throne a d      hig     shere shaws family the original name of shere shaw was ferid his father was hassin of the soor tribe of the afghans of roh when sultan beloli placed his foot on the musnud of empire the grandfather of shere shaw ibrahim soor came to delhi in quest of military service  of the afghans of roh the original seat of the afghans was roh this word in their language signifies a mountainous country it extended they say in length from sewad and bijore to the town of sui in the dominions of buckurast and in breadth from hussin abdal to rabul this tract in its fertile valleys contained many separate tribes among the number of these was that of soor who derive themselves from the princes of ghor one of the sons of the ghorian family whose name was mahummud soor having left his native country placed himself among the afghans of roh and was the father of the tribe of soor which was esteemed the noblest among them  ibrahim soor arrives at delhi ibrahim soor arriving at delhi engaged himself in the service of an omrah of the court of beloli when the empire fell to secunder jemmal chan an omrah was appointed suba of jionpoor who took hassen the son of ibrahim in his retinue his son hassin obtains a jagier he found him a youth of parts and favored him so much that in a short time he gave him the pergunnahs of schsaram and chawasspoor tanda in jagier for which he was to maintain five hundred horse hassen had eight sons ferid and nizam of one mother of a patan family the other sons were born of slaves  a d      hig     ferid flies from his fathers house hassen had no great love for his wife and he therefore neglected her sons ferid upon this left his fathers house and enlisted himself a soldier in the service of jemmal chan hassen wrote to jemmal chan sub of jionpoor upon this occasion requesting him to send back his son that he might be educated but all that jemmal chan could say had no effect upon ferid jionpoor he said was a better place for instruction than sehsaram applies himself to letters and he affirmed that he would attend to letters of his own accord this he did to so much purpose that he soon could repeat the works of shech sadi and was besides a proficient in all the learning of the country he however employed most of his time in history and poetry being supported by the liberality of jemmal chan  is reconciled with his father after three or four years had passed hassen came to jionpoor and by the mediation of friends the father and son were reconciled hassen gave ferid the charge of his jagier and remained himself at jionpoor ferid when he took leave of his father said that the stability of government depended on justice and that it would be his greatest care not to violate it either by oppressing the weak or permitting the strong to infringe the laws with impunity when he arrived at his jagier he actually put this resolution in practice by rendering justice to the poor and reducing to order such of his zemindars as opposed his authority he by this means had his revenues punctually paid and his country well cultivated his reputation grew apace for all his actions discovered uncommon genius and resolution  who is pleased with his behavior hassin coming to visit the pergunnahs was extremely pleased with the management of his son and therefore continued him in his office but the father had a slave by whom he had three sons soliman ahmed and mudda and the old man was extremely sond of her she told him that now her son soliman was grown up a d      hig     and that he ought to provide for him she day after day continued to teaze hassin for the superintendency of the pergunnahs for soliman this gave the old omrah great concern knowing the superior abilities of ferid he resigns the management of the jagier the son hearing that the domestic peace of his father was destroyed by the importunities of his favorite made a voluntary resignation of his trust which was accordingly conferred upon soliman  goes to agra ferid and his brother nizam set out immediately for agra and entered into the service of dowlat chan one of the principal omrahs of sultan ibrahim ferid by his good behavior soon insinuated himself into his masters affection dowlat desired him one day to tell him what he was most desirous to obtain and that he would use his interest with the sultan in his favor ferid replied that his father was now in his dotage and wholly guided by an artful mistress who had deprived both himself and his brother of their patrimonial inheritance and had procured their jagier for her own spurious offspring that if dowlat would therefore by his interest at court procure the jagiersonnad in his name he would promise to provide for his father and maintain five hundred good horse for the service of the empire  the emperor refuses to grant him his fathers jagier dowlat chan accordingly preferred this request to the sultan who replied that he must be a bad man indeed who reviled and undermined his own father dowlat chan retired in silence and acquainted him of the answer he had received but comforted ferid by telling him that he would take another opportunity to urge his request which upon his fathers death he obtains in the mean time the father of ferid died and dowlat chan obtained the emperors grant with which the two brothers set out to sehsaram with a grand retinue  soliman upon the arrival of his brothers evacuating the country went off to mahummud chan soor who held the purgunnah of a d      hig     chond and kept up a force of fifteen hundred horse and complained of the behavior of ferid his brother soliman complains of him to mahummud soor mahummud chan told him that baber having invaded hindostan a war between him and sultan ibrahim was unavoidable that therefore if he should accompany him when called to the imperial army he would endeavor to get him redress soliman was too impatient to wait so long in suspense mahummud chan therefore sent a person to ferid to treat about a reconciliation ferid replied that he was willing to give him a proper share of his fathers inheritance but that he must be excused from parting with any of his power repeating at the same time the old adage that two swords could never rest in one scabbard  who forms designs against him soliman could not be satisfied with sharing the government and therefore nothing was settled between the brothers this irritated mahummud chan so much that he resolved to compel him to the measures which he himself had proposed ferid being informed of this resolution began to provide for his own security but news arriving of sultan ibrahims death the whole country was thrown into confusion ferid resolved not to lie idle in the midst of the troubles which ensued he joined par chan the son of diria chan lohani who had subdued behar and assumed the royal dignity under the name of sultan mahummud or mahmood as the sultan was one day on a hunting party he roused an enormous tiger which ferid immediately attacked and killed with one blow of his fabre  for this bold action which was done in the sultans presence he was honored with the title of shere chan shere signifies a lion   shere chan rose gradually to great influence and favor in the sultans service he was even appointed tutor to the sultans son jellal chan he in the mean time requested permission to go to hi jagier but he was detained there by business till his leave of absence a d      hig     expired sultan mahummud dissatisfied with this behavior reproached him one day in public with breach of promise he is accused to sultan mahmood and mahummud chan an omrah being present took that opportunity of accusing him of treasonable designs and with favoring the interest of sultan mamood the son of sultan secunder the sultan was by this means so incensed against him that he intimated at the same time a design to deprive him of his jagier and to confer it upon his brother soliman as a just punishment for his offense and the only thing that could bring him to a proper sense of his duty  proceedings against him the sultan however having a great esteem for shere chan against whom nothing was yet proved laid aside the violent measure to which he was instigated by mahummud he at the same time by way of alarming him gave orders to his accuser to enquire into his fathers estate and make an equal division of it among all the brothers mahummud chan glad of this order sent one of his servants to shere chan to acquaint him that his brothers according to the sultans commands were to have their proportionable dividends of the estate which he had hitherto so unjustly withheld from them  the nature of tenures in hindostan shere chan returned for answer that mahummud was very much mistaken in this matter that there were no heritable estates in hindostan among mahomedans for that all lands belonged to the king which he disposed of at pleasure that as he himself had a personal grant of his jagier his brethren were entirely out of the question that he however had already consented to give to his brother soliman a part of the money and movables according to law  shere chan attacked when the messenger returned with this answer to mahummud chan who was then at jiond he was enraged at so flat a denial and raising all his forces sent them against shere chan under the command of shadi his adopted slave accompanied by soliman and a d      hig     ahmed his orders were to take possession of the country and to leave a force with soliman to protect him in the jagier  who determines to oppose him this resolution being quickly taken shere chan had not time to collect his people but upon the first alarm he wrote to malleck sook his deputy in the pergunnah of chawasspoor tandah to harrass the enemy with what troops he had but to avoid an action till he joined him in person but malleck sook desirous to distinguish himself gave them battle and lost his life and the victory  this disaster weakened shere chan so much that he was in no condition to oppose mahummud he flies to kurrah he therefore evacuated the country and fled to juneid birlass suba of kurrah and maneckpoor on the part of sultan baber he made the suba a handsome present was taken into favor and obtained a body of troops to recover his country returns and defeats mahummud with these he defeated mahummud who fled to the mountains of rhotas so that he not only possessed himself of his own country but added several other pergunnahs to his jagier which he now held of sultan baber having rewarded the moguls who had assisted him he permitted them to return to their master he at the same time levied troops and was joined by his former friends who had fled to the hills which rendered him very formidable in those parts  his generosity to him shere chan having thus established himself in his jagier performed an act of generosity which if it was not intended to deceive the world does him much honor he recalled mahummud chan who had fled and put him in possession of his former jagier this generous treatment converted his greatest enemy into one of his best friends  shere having settled his affairs left his brother nizam in charge of his country and paid a visit to his benefactor juneid birlass at a d      hig     kurrah goes to agra birlass was then going to agra and shere resolved to accompany him thither he was upon this occasion introduced to sultan baber and attended that prince in his expedition to chinderi  after shere had staid some time in the mogul camp and observed their manners and policy he one day told a friend that he thought it would be an easy matter to drive those foreigners out of hindostan his friend asked him what reason he had to think so shere replied his opinion concerning the moguls that the king himself though a man of great parts was but very little acquainted with the policy of hindostan and that the vizier who held the reins of government would be too much biassed in favor of his own interest to mind that of the public that therefore if the patans who were now at enmity among themselves could be brought to mutual concord the work was completed and should fortune ever favor him he imagined himself equal to the task however difficult it might at present appear his friend burst out into a loud laugh and began to ridicule this vain opinion  his behavior at the kings table shere a few days after had at the kings table some solid dishes set before him with only a spoon to eat them he called for a knife but the servants had orders not to supply him with one shere not to lose his dinner drew his dagger without ceremony and cutting up his meat made a hearty meal without minding those who diverted themselves at this odd behavior when he had done the king who had been remarking his manner turned to amir chalisa occasions a reflection of baber and said this afghan is not to be disconcerted by trifles and is likely to be a great man  he privately withdraws shere chan perceiving by these words that the king had been informed of his private discourse to his friend fled the camp that night and went to his own jagier he wrote from thence to juneid birlass that as mahummud chan had prevailed on sultan a d      hig     mahmood chan of behar to send troops against his jagier he had in haste left the kings camp without waiting upon him for leave is reconciled with sultan mahmood of behar he by this means amused juneid birlass from chastising him and at the same time made up matters with sultan mahmood with whom he became a greater favorite than before  who dies sultan mahmood dying a short time after was succeeded by his son jellal chan a minor the young princes mother sultana dudu acted as regent and conferred the principal offices in the government upon shere chan shere chan manages the government the sultana dying soon after the administration fell wholly into his hands  muchdum alum the governor of hadgeepoor on the part of sultan mahmood of bengal being guilty of some misdemeanor threw himself under shere chans protection sultan mahmood to revenge this insult ordered cuttub chan governor of mongier with a great force against behar as the forces of behar were inconsiderable in comparison of those of bengal shere chan made many overtures for accommodating differences but to no effect overthrows the  of bengal finding no arguments could prevail but the sword he resolved to stand the unequal encounter in which his superior skill and bravery acquired him a complete victory cuttub chan was slain and all his treasure elephants and camp equipage taken which greatly advanced the designs of shere chan  a plot against his life after this victory the patan tribe of lohani envying the fortune of shere formed a conspiracy to take away his life shere discovered the plot taxed jellal chan with it who was privy to the conspiracy being very jealous of the great influence of his minister he offers to resign he told on this occasion to the young prince that there was no necessity of taking such a base method of getting quit of him for that if he should but once signify his inclination shere was ready to resign that government which he lately so successfully protected the prince a d      hig     either suspecting his sincerity or being equally suspicious of the other omrahs would by no means consent to his resignation this so much disgusted the conspirators that they took every possible measure to make a breach between the prince and his minister  shere obliges his master the sultan of behar to fly shere finding that he had no security but in maintaining his power by the unlimited use he made of it justly excited the princes jealousy to such a pitch that one night accompanied by his omrahs he fled to sultan mahmood of bengal and implored his aid to expel shere chan who had usurped his throne  mahmood of bengal assists him with an army sultan mahmood joining his compassion for the young prince to his personal hatred for shere sent ibrahim chan the son of cuttub chan with a considerable army against the usurper the bengalians besieged shere in a mud fort for a long time without success so that ibrahim was obliged to send home for succors which is overthrown by shere shere chan being informed of this circumstance came out offered battle and by means of a common stratagem ordering his troops to fly at the first onset to draw the enemy into an ambush defeated them and took all their guns and elephants ibrahim chan was slain in the action and the young prince fled in great distress to bengal  all behar submits to him shere by this victory became lord of all behar and grew daily more and more formidable taje chan was at this time governor of the strong fort of chinar which he had held for himself ever since the death of sultan ibrahim lodi his wife lade mallecke who was barren yet for whom he had a very great affection being envied by his other wives by whom he had children they instigated their sons to make away with her but one of the sons who had undertaken the murder missed his blow and only inflicted a slight wound taje chan alarmed by her cries came to her assistance and drew his sword to kill his son the son seeing no means to escape assaulted his father and slew him the sons of taje chan were yet a d      hig     too young to be entrusted with the government and lade mallecke drew the reins into her own hands by her address among the chiefs and zemindars shere chan by marriage obtains the possession of chinar shere chan informed of these transactions set a treaty of marriage on foot with lade mallecke which was soon concluded shere seized upon chinar and the dependant districts which was a great acquisition to his power there being a considerable treasure in the place  much about this time sultan mahmood the son of sultan secunder lodi having taken protection with rana sinka by his assistance and that of hassen chan mewati advanced against sultan baber and were defeated as we have already seen at janveh sultan mahmood flying to chitor was from thence invited by the omrahs of lodi who were gathered together at patna and by them proclaimed king sultan mahmond lodi possesses himself of behar he made himself soon master of all behar shere chan perceiving that he could not draw the omrahs over from the sultans interest and that he had not sufficient force to oppose him submitted to his authority and by that means saved a part of behar which the sultan permitted him to retain the sultan told him at the same time that if he should effectually assist him in recovering jionpoor from the moguls he would return behar to him and a contract to that effect was drawn up and executed between them  shere chan obtains leave to visit his jagier shere chan some time after obtained leave to return to shessaram to levy troops and sultan mahmood marching with an army against the moguls sent him orders to join but as shere delayed for some time the sultan persuaded by his omrahs that he was playing a loose game marched his army through his jagier on his way to jionpoor shere came out to meet him had an elegant entertainment provided for his reception and then marched with him to jionpoor the troops of humaioon evacuated the province upon their approach so that the afghans took possession of the country as far as lucknore  a d      hig     humaioon lay at this time before callinger and having heard of the progress of the afghans he marched against them he betrays sultan mahmood lodi mahmood having on this occasion given a superior command to bein baezid shere chan who thought himself illused betrayed his master and wrote a private letter the night before the action to hindoo beg one of the mogul generals acquainting him that he esteemed himself a servant of babers family to whom he owed his advancement and that he would be the cause of defeating the afghans next day he drew off his troops in the action which occasioned mahmoods defeat for which service he was greatly favored by humaioon sultan mahmood after this defeat retreated to patna retired from the world and in the year nine hundred and forty nine died in orissa  refuses to give up chinar to humaioon humaioon after his victory returned to agra and sent amir hindoo beg to shere chan to take possession of the fort of chinar shere excused himself and obliged hindoo beg to retreat humaioon returned immediately with his whole army to besiege chinar and having invested it he received a letter from shere chan acquainting him proposes terms to humaioon that he esteemed himself one of the servants of the house of baber from whom he first obtained a government and that he had expressed his fidelity by being the occasion of the late victory that therefore if the king would permit him to retain the government of the fort he was willing to pay him the proper revenues of the lands which he held and would send his son cuttub chan with five hundred horse to be maintained at his own expense in the sultans service  which are  as at this juncture the affairs of guzerat by the conquests of sultan bahadur required the kings presence and considering also the strength of chinar humaioon consented to these terms and accordingly being joined by cuttub chan and isey chan hajbil with five hundred horse he marched toward sultan bahadur the king a d      hig     however had scarcely reached guzerat when cuttub chan deserted with his horse and returned to his father shere reduces behar and enters bengal shere immediately raised what forces he could and reduced behar not satisfied with this success he pursued his fortune and penetrated into the heart of bengal having fought with the omrahs of that country several sharp battles before he could make himself master of the passes which were defended a whole month  besieges sultan mahmood lodi in gour sultan mahmood of bengal shut himself up in gour which shere chan for a long time besieged one of the zemindars of behar having raised a disturbance he left chawass chan to carry on the siege and returned himself to behar provisions becoming at length very scarce in gour sultan mahmood fled in a boat to hadjepoor and shere chan having settled affairs in behar returned and pursued him overthrows mahmood mahmood being necessitated to give battle was defeated and being wounded in the engagement fled his kingdom which immediately fell into the hands of the conqueror  humaioon turns his arms against him humaioon returning from his expedition to guzerat thought it necessary to put a stop to the rising power of shere chan he for that purpose turned toward the reduction of chinar jellal chan who commanded there left the defense of the place to ghazi soor and retired to the hills of bercundah from whence he very much annoyed the besiegers takes chinar the siege had been carried on six months when rumi chan who commanded the kings artillery by some kind of a floating battery which he sent down the river close to the wall reduced the place  marches toward bengal humaioon left two hundred soldiers in garrison there and marched toward bengal sultan mahmood who as we have already observed was wounded in the action with shere chan threw himself under the protection of humaioon when the king had advanced to gurhi which is the frontier of bengal he found that shere chan had a d      hig     sent jellal chan chawass chan and a good detachment to guard that pass the king sent jehangire kulli beg and some other omrahs to dislodge them but they were repulsed in several attacks forces the passes being however supported by more troops and the whole army appearing in sight a successful assault was made and the moguls became masters of the pass drives shere chan to the mountains of jarchund jellal chan fled to his father shere chan at gour who being in no condition to engage so superior a force evacuated that capital carried off all his wealth to the mountains of jarcund and begun to project a scheme for possessing himself of rhotas that he might there lodge his family and wealth in security  shere chan by a stratagem takes the impregnable fortress of rhotas to take rhotas by open force was an impossible attempt it was therefore necessary to devise some stratagem by which success might be hoped shere for this purpose sent a message to raja berkiss who was in possession of this impregnable fortress and told him that as he himself was going to attempt the recovery of bengal he hoped from their former friendship that he would permit him to send his family and treasure into the place with a few attendants the raja at first rejected this request but shere chan sent an artful ambassador to the raja a second time with some handsome presents acquainting him that it was only for his women and treasure he requested the rajas protection that should he be fortunate enough to conquer bengal he would make proper acknowledgments for the favor on his return but if he should lose his life in the contest he rather chose that his family and wealth should fall into his hands than into those of the moguls his inveterate enemies  the raja permitting himself to be deluded by his avarice determined when once in possession of the treasure to keep it and therefore consented to sheres request shere chan having provided covered doolies the same with sedan chairs  filled them all except two or three which were to go first with armed men and arms he at the a d      hig     same time filled five hundred money bags with ball and appointed some of his best soldiers to carry them in the disguise of slaves with sticks in their hands to help the treasure up the mountain the men who carried the doolies were disguised in the same manner this train accordingly set out and the first and second dooly being examined at the gate were found to contain only old women so further examination was neglected the raja was in the mean time busy in counting the bags which he now reckoned part of his own fortune when the doolies had reached the house which the raja had appointed the wolves rushed out among the sheep and begun to dye the fold with their blood the porters used their staves till they supplied themselves with arms from the doolies they easily mastered the garrison who were off their guard and admitted shere chan who was encamped at a small distance the raja himself with a few followers found means to escape into the woods by a private passage behind the fort  thus fell one of the most impregnable fortresses in the world into the hands of shere chan together with much treasure which had been accumulating there for ages the merit of the invention of this stratagem is not due to shere the fort of asere in the decan was long before taken in the same manner by nasir chan faroki governor of chandez  description of rhotas rhotas is built upon the level top of a mountain the only entrance to it is a very narrow road through a steep ascent of one crore from the foot of the hill to the gates which are three in number one above another defended by guns and rollingstones the square contents of the fortified table land on the top of the mountain is more than five crores in this space are contained towns villages and corn fields and water is found a few feet from the surface on one side runs the river sone under an immense precipice and another river in the same manner passes close to the a d      hig     other side and both meeting a little below form the hill into a triangular peninsula there is a very deep valley on the third side full of impervious woods which spread all over the mountains and render all access that way next to impossible  shere chan had now a secure retreat for his family and his friends began to acquire fresh spirits by this piece of success humaioon in the mean time spent three months in luxurious pleasures at gour or lucknouti he there received advices that mirza hindal his brother had revolted in agra and mewat that he had put shech phoul to death and coined money in his own name humaioon marches back toward agra he therefore left jehangire kulli beg with five thousand horse in gour and returned toward agra  by the excessive rains and bad roads the kings cavalry and beasts of burden perished in great numbers on his march by fatigue and want of forage is totally  by shere chan shere chan who had now raised a numerous army entrenched himself on the banks of the jossa in a place by which the king must of necessity pass and by treachery defeated him with great slaughter in the manner which we have already related shere did not immediately push forward to the capital anxious to leave no enemy behind him he returned to bengal engaged jehangire kulli beg in several battles defeated him and at length cut him and his army to pieces  section iii the history of the reign of shere shaw the afghan shere shaw  shere shaw immediately after the reduction of bengal assumed the imperial title struck the coin and read the chutba in his own name he marched the next year with a great army toward agra the unfortunate humaioon was by this time deserted a d      hig     by his brother mirza camiran and hated by his mogul omrahs on account of his attention to his turkuman mercenaries he however crossed the river with one hundred thousand horse and met shere chan who had but fifty thousand shere as we have

omrah and hybut chan neazi with a great army in the north west shere shaw returned toward agra he was in that city informed that chizer chan sirik whom he left suba of bengal had married the daughter of mahmood the former sultan of that province and held the state of a sovereign prince reduces the  bengal having experienced in his own fortune the danger of permitting such behavior to go unpunished he marched immediately to bengal chizer chan being unexpectedly surprised submitted without trouble and was imprisoned shere shaw very prudently divided the kingdom of bengal among a number of omrahs independent of one another and appointed kasi fazilit a native of kurrah famous for his learning and policy to superintend the whole he himself after these transactions retired to agra  in the year nine hundred and forty nine shere made a motion toward malava having advanced as far as gualier suja chan afghan who had before inverted the place on the part of shere shaw found means to settle matters with abul casim beg governor of a d      hig   0 takes gualier gualier for humaioon and he delivered up that strong fortress into his hands  reduces malava shere shaw having entered malava mullu chan governor of that province submitted without a blow being however a few days after alarmed by something he fled from the kings camp and hadjee chan was appointed to that government suja chan had also a jagier conferred upon him in that country shere shaw having marched from thence to rintimpore mullee chan fell upon the governor of malava and upon suja chan but he was defeated suja chan having acquired all the honor of the victory hadjee chan was superseded and recalled and the government conferred upon suja  takes rintimpore shere shaw arriving before rintimpore had the address to get possession of that important fortress from the governor on the part of sultan mahmood lodi who had still kept it the emperor after taking rintimpore returned to agra he remained in that city a whole year settling the internal police of the empire and regulating his army he in the mean time ordered hybut chan to wrest moultan from the bellochies this hybut soon effected by defeating fatti chan bellochi and entirely subduing that country he had on account of this exploit the title of azim humaioon conferred upon him  he marches against raja paran for keeping two thousand concubines in the year nine hundred and fifty paran mull the son of raja suckdeo parbia having conquered some neighboring pergunnahs kept no less than two thousand concubines and dancing girls in his zinnana the king resenting this indignity marched and invested him in the sort of raisein the siege being protracted for a long time paran mull began to treat of a capitulation this was granted to him upon the honorable terms of marching out with all his arms treasure family garrison and effects paran accordingly marched out with four thousand rajaputs and trusting to the faith which had been pledged encamped at a small distance  a d      hig   0 his treachery and cruelty but shere shaw who never kept the faith of treaties was easily persuaded by his base ministers particularly by amir ruffi ul dien suffvi infamously to violate his honor he surrounded the rajaputs and ordered them all to be massacred he however paid very dear for this horrid piece of cruelty and treachery the rajaputs placing death in one eye and revenge in the other sought till every man of them was laid dead on the plain and above double their number of the assassins  shere shaw after this infamous transaction returned to agra he marches toward marwar having remained there a few months to refresh and recruit his army he marched toward marwar during his march he entrenched himself every night as well for security as to exercise his troops and make them expert in this necessary service when he came to cross the sands he formed redoubts all round him with gabions in this manner he entered the country of the raja of nagor and todpoor whose name was maldeo and esteemed the most powerful raja in hindostan he opposed the king with fifty thousand rajaputs and both armies lay thirty days in sight of one another  shere shaw would now have been glad to retreat quietly but the danger was too great at the same time the enemy was so advantageously posted as to render an attack too hazardous and  in the midst of this alarming situation a successful stratagem suggested itself to the king raja maldeo having conquered that country to which he had no right by inheritance shere shaw forged a letter in the hindoo language and character in the name of the rajas generals addressed to himself setting forth that being conquered by the raja they had through necessity served him till then with fidelity but that they were in secret very weary of his yoke that if he would therefore reinstate them in their former possessions they were willing to make him a due acknowledgement for the favor on this letter shere superscribed as usual in persian that they should fear nothing desiring a d      hig     them to persevere in their intentions and that they might rest assured that he would comply with their demand  this letter was purposely thrown into the way of the raja who being always in dread of his omrahs was easily deceived he therefore declined the battle which he intended to give that day he was even more and more confirmed in his unjust suspicion by the eagerness which they expressed to engage upon the fourth day he ordered a retreat gallant proposal of rajaput omrah but cunia one of his principal omrahs having found out in what manner the raja had been deceived by these forgeries endeavored to persuade him of his mistake having found that the rajas suspicions could not be removed he told him that the suspected treachery was unprecedented among true rajaputs and that he was determined to wipe off the stain which the raja had thrown upon their reputation by his own blood or the conquest of shere shaw with his own tribe  he returns with his own tribe and attacks shere the raja continued to retreat but the gallant cunia with a few other chiefs and ten or twelve thousand men turned back with an intent to surprise shere shaws camp they however by some mistake lost their way and it was fair day light before they saw the enemy shere shaw immediately formed and came out against them though the kings army by the smallest computation consisted of eighty thousand fighting men this handful of brave rajaputs repulsed them repeatedly and would have certainly defeated them if jellal chan selwani had not at that instant arrived with a fresh reinforcement to join the imperial army after an obstinate battle the rajaputs are cut to pieces shere falling upon the rajaputs with renewed vigor broke them and the brave cunia with almost his whole army were cut to pieces  shere shaw finding himself in possession of a victory of which he had at one time despaired exclaimed remarkable saying of shere shaw that for a handful of barley he had almost given the empire of hindostan to the wind this a d      hig     grain it seems was all the scanty produce of that sandy country for which the inhabitants fought with so much obstinacy raja maldeo having heard of this action and the loss of so many brave men fell into deep affliction and being for his pusillanimity deserted by the greatest part of his army he retreated among the mountains of sodpoor  he takes chitor shere shaw after this bloody victory turned his army toward the fort of chitor which was surrendered to him by capitulation he then directed his march to rintimpore and gave that country in jagier to his son adil chan who fixed his residence there and sits down before callinger the sultan in person moved toward callinger which is esteemed one of the strongest forts in hindostan the raja of callinger on account of the kings treacherous behavior to paran mull would make no submission but prepared himself for hostilities besieges the place shere shaw having drawn a line of circumvallation begun to carry on his approaches to the place he raised mounds of earth for his artillery and sunk mines under the rock the royal batteries were now advanced very near the walls breaches were made and a general assault ordered when a live shell which had been thrown against the fort by the imperialists rebounded back into the battery in which the king stood the shell burst in the midst of a quantity of powder which had not been properly secured several gunners were blown up the king burnt by the blowing up of powder the king shech chalile mulla nizam danishmund and diria chan serwani were burnt in so terrible a manner that they were carried for dead to their tents  in this dreadful condition the king began to breathe in great agonies he however encouraged the continuance of the attack and gave orders till in the evening news was brought him of the reduction of the place he dies he then cried out thanks to the almighty god and expired the death of shere shaw happened on the twelfth of ribbi ul awil in the year nine hundred a d      hig     and fifty two he spent fifteen years in a military life before he mounted the throne and he sat upon the musnud five years as emperor of hindostan  his character the character of shere shaw is almost equally divided between virtue and vice public justice prevailed in the kingdom while private acts of treachery dishonored the hands of the king he seemed to have made breach of faith a royal property which he would by no means permit his subjects to share with him we ought perhaps to ascribe this vice to the ambition of shere had he been born to the musnud he might have been just as he was valiant and politic in war had he confined his mind to his jagier he might merit the character of a virtuous omrah but his great soul made him look up to the throne and he cared not by what steps he was to ascend  his magnificence shere shaw left many monuments of his magnificence behind him from bengal and sennargaum to the sind or nilab which is fifteen hundred crores about three thousand of our mile  he built caravanserais at every stage and dug a well at the end of every crore besides he raised many magnificent mosques for the worship of god on the highway wherein he appointed readers of the koran and imams he ordered that at every serai all travelers without distinction of country or religion should be entertained according to their quality at the public expense he at the same time planted rows of fruit trees along the roads to preserve travelers from the scorching heat of the sun as well as to gratify their taste  was the first who established regular horse posts horseposts were placed at proper distances for forwarding quick intelligence to government and for the advantage of trade and correspondence this establishment was new in hindostan such was the public security during his reign that travelers and merchants a d      hig     throwing down their goods went without fear to sleep on the highway  it is said that shere shaw being told that his beard grew white replied it was true that he had obtained the empire toward the evening his attention to business he divided his time into four equal parts one he appropriated to public justice one to the regulations of his army one to worship and the remainder to rest and recreation he was buried at sessaram in a magnificent sepulcher which he had built in the middle of a great tank or reservoir of water  section iv the reign of selim shaw the son of shere shaw when shere shaw was numbered with the dead his eldest son adil chan whom he appointed his successor was at rintimpore and his younger son jellal in the village of rewin near phetah the omrahs who favored jellal more than his brother then at so great a distance prevended the necessity of filling the throne as soon as possible they for that purpose dispatched expresses to jellal chan who arrived in five days in the camp jellal chan mounts the throne by the  of selim shaw jellal by the influence of isah chan hugab and his party mounted the throne in the fortress of callinger upon the seventeenth of ribbi ul awil in the year nine hundred and fifty two and assumed the title of islam shaw which by false pronunciation was turned to that of selim shaw by which name he is more generally known  he writes to his brother selim shaw having taken upon him the imperial dignity wrote to his elder brother in the following words adil being at so great a distance and i so near to prevent disturbance i took upon me a d      hig     the command of the army till his return but my intentions are only to forward my brothers interest and to support his authority  he is placed a second time upon the musnud jellal after writing this letter marched from callinger toward agra and at kurrah was met by chawass chan who renewed the ceremonies of royalty and placed selim shaw a second time on the throne holding a magnificent festival upon that occasion from kurrah selim shaw wrote another letter to his brother begging in the most affectionate terms that he would come and see him  his brothers answer adil chan wrote to the omrahs of selim shaw particularly to cuttub chan naib isah chan neazi chawass chan and jellal chan selwani to know to what purpose he was invited and what he was to hope from them he at the same time returned to his brother for answer that if he would send these four omrahs to him with proper assurances he would come selim shaw sent accordingly the four omrahs to adil shaw to assure him in the most solemn manner that he would permit him if he pleased to depart after the first interview but that as the omrahs had invested him with the imperial power he could not be so ungrateful as to desert them however to make some compensation to adil for the empire he was determined to give him his choice of any of the provinces in free jagier  adil shaw upon these assurances proceeded to agra when he had reached the village of sikri now fattepoor  selim shaw was out on a hunting party near that place and appointed carpets to be spread for their interview the interview of the brothers here the brothers dissembled the greatest affection for one another and after some discourse set out for agra their designs against one another selim shaw who wanted to seize his brother gave private orders that only a few of his retinue should be admitted into the citadel but adil shaw had also given orders to his people to press in at all hazards which they accordingly did in spite of all opposition  a d      hig     transactions in the palace selim shaw saw that without running a great risque nothing could be effected against his brother who was so much upon his guard he therefore had recourse to flattery and dissimulation he even proceeded so far as to lay hold of adils hand to place him upon the throne adil shaw who was naturally a timorous and indolent man rejected this proposal knowing how little he had to trust from the omrahs and a deceitful ambitious brother selim shaw was well aware of all this before he made this extraordinary offer  adil makes a solemn resignation of the empire just as selim expected so it fell out adil shaw intimidated by the disturbance which had been made at the gate made a voluntary resignation of his birthright and placing selim shaw on the throne saluted him emperor this was instantly followed by all the court who were waiting with impatience the issue of this extraordinary farce they immediately advanced to the throne in succession and according to their rank presented their nazirs offerings made upon public occasions to the emperor  while others exhibited the ceremony of the isar isar or tessiduck is a ceremony used upon the accession of a prince to the throne the omrahs running three times round the king waving an offering of money in a charger three times over the monarchs head this money is afterward delivered over to the royal almoner to be distributed in charity as indeed are all offerings made to the emperor  crying out aloud we offer our lives and fortunes to the king  adil obtains the province of biana in jagier the ceremonies being ended cuttub chan and the other omrahs who had passed their words to adil shaw requested that as he had pitched upon biana for his jagier he according to promise should be regularly invested with that province and permitted to depart selim shaw consented and all matters being settled he gave adil leave to quit agra accompanied by isah chan and chawass chan  a d      hig     but after two months selim gave to ghazi mahli one of his eunuchs a pair of golden fetters to go and bring adil shaw prisoner adil shaw having timeous intelligence of this design against him set out for mewat where chawass chan then resided he acquainted that omrah with tears of his brothers baseness chawass chan kindles a rebellion in favor of adil chawass chan whose honor was concerned in this affair was rouzed with compassion for the unfortunate prince he seized upon ghazi mahli placed his fetters upon his own legs and exalted the spear of rebellion against selim shaw  the interest of chawass was great among the omrahs he wrote to them private letters and brought many over to his party he marches toward agra a great army was soon raised and chawass with adil shaw and isah chan marched toward agra he upon his way received letters from cuttub chan and jellal chan who thought themselves dishonored by the kings behavior assuring him of their assistance  selim in great perplexity when the confederate omrahs arrived before agra selim shaw at this unexpected visit was thrown into the utmost perplexity he called cuttub chan and jellal chan to his presence and reproached them for not dissuading him from that impolitic step which had drawn upon him such dangerous consequences cuttub chan replied that the business was not yet irremediable that he would undertake to settle every thing in an amicable manner selim shaw not suspecting the fidelity of the two omrahs immediately desired that they should go to adil shaw and compromise affairs  proposes to fly to chinar when they were gone selim shaw discovered to his friends his intentions of flying to chinar where the treasure was lodged and there to raise an army to reduce his brother whom he was not at present in a condition to oppose is dissuaded by isah chan and resolve to stand his ground isah chan hujab dissuaded him from this resolution he told him that he had with him ten thousand chermalli patans who had served him before he ascended a d      hig     the throne whom he could not suspect of disaffection besides many other faithful servants that therefore it was the height of folly to trust the empire which god had given him to the future caprice of fortune when he had it in his power to defend it instantly in the field do not said isah throw away the friends whom you have acquired in your prosperity with a vain hope to pick up others in the season of distress the wisest course for you continued the omrah is to appear at the head of your troops and to fix the foot of resolution on the field of war this will secure your wavering troops and intimidate the enemy  selim shaw encouraged by this bold advice resolved to stand his ground he immediately dispatched a message to cuttub chan and the other omrahs who had not yet set out to accommodate matters with adil and commanded them to his presence he told them that having altered his mind he was resolved not to trust his faithful omrahs in the hands of his enemies he forthwith ordered his troops to their arms marched out of the city and formed his army on the plain  engages the enemy and overthrows them the omrahs who had promised to favor adil shaw seeing their king in the field ashamed to betray him were necessitated to fight which greatly disconcerted chawass chan who every minute expected they would join him he however sought with great bravery but he was overthrown  adil shaw disappears adil shaw after this unfortunate battle fled toward patna but he soon disappeared and was never heard of afterward chawass chan and isah chan neazi fled to mwat selim shaw sent an army in pursuit of those omrahs but they came off victorious at firospoor the imperial army being soon after reinforced the rebel chiefs were obliged to retreat among the mountains of cmaoon selim sent cuttub chan in pursuit of them and he plundered all a d      hig     the countries lying about the skirts of the hills without effecting any thing against them  selim shaw after these transactions marched to chinar on the way he was informed of the treasonable correspondence of jellal chan with adil before the late decisive battle and ordered him to be put to death together with his brother who was concerned in the conspiracy the king having arrived at chinar he took out of that fortress all the treasure sent it to gualier and returned himself to agra  cuttub chan finding that selim was no stranger to the part which he had acted in the late disturbances was afraid to return to court he fled therefore to hybut chan at lahore known by the title of azim humaioon and claimed his protection selim shaw sent orders to lahore that cuttub should be sent to agra with which azim humaioon complied several suspected persons punished the unfortunate cuttub upon his arrival was sent prisoner to gualier with many other suspected persons particularly shebaz chan lohani the kings brotherinlaw whose eyes were put out azim humaioon and suja chan suba of malava were much about this time called to court the first excused himself and the latter obeying the summons had the address to clear himself of what he was accused and so was reinstated in his government  the king marches to rhotas the king after these transactions moved toward rhotas to bring the treasure which his father had deposited in that place to agra seid chan the brother of azim humaioon deserted him on the way and fled to lahore a rebellion the king from this circumstance concluded that a rebellion was in agitation which determined him to return immediately to agra he soon assembled his forces from all quarters and marched to delhi where he ordered the new city which humaioon had built to be walled in with stone at delhi a d      hig     suja chan joined him with the army from malava selim marched to lahore the king remained only a few days in delhi to regulate his army and then took the rout of lahore  the rebels meet  ambatta azim humaioon chawass chan and other disaffected chiefs with double the kings forces came out before selim at ambatta selim arriving

with my honor to have any patience with a rebellious army and at these words he ordered his line to be formed and to advance against them   it happened very fortunately for the affairs of selim that upon the preceding night there had arisen a dispute among the rebel generals about the succession to the throne chawass chan insisted that search should be made for adil shaw and azim humaioon strenuously affirmed that the empire was no mans inheritance but should always follow the fortune of the sword this plainly pointed out his own views  on this head animosity and faction arose so that as soon as the rebels had formed the line chawass chan retreated with all his troops without striking a blow this circumstance so much discouraged the remaining part of the rebels that their resistance was faint and an unexpected victory fell to selim   but in the midst of this tide of good fortune the sultan narrowly escaped with his life from a daring attempt of seid chan the brother of

king in the mean time heedless of what passed spent his time in all the luxurious debaucheries of the haram having heard much in praise of some of the former kings particularly ferose shaw for their great generosity he mistook prodigality for that virtue and to outdo them all opened the treasury and lavished it on good and bad without distinction when he rode out he used to head his arrows with gold which he shot among the multitude this foolish extravagance soon made away with the great treasures of his predecessors and all his reward from the people was the nickname of andili which in the hindoo language signifies literally the blind and metaphorically the foolish  when the lowborn himu found himself invested with the whole executive power of the empire his pride and insolence exceeded

velvet tents and possessed the dignities of the spear drum and colors  secunder seeing this formidable army began to repent of his invasion and made overtures of peace the only condition he asked was the government of punjab but sultan ibrahim passed up with the pride of his own superiority would grant him no terms a d      hig     and therefore both armies drew up and engaged secunder shaw

led his army against adil shaw defeated and slew him the anarchy and confusions in hindostan at this period rendered it impossible to continue the direct chain of our history in the order of time we therefore must turn back to what we have omitted of the history of secunder shaw and humaioon  section vii the reign of secunder shaw soor and the fall of the patan empire secunder shaw having ascended the throne of agra in the year nine hundred and sixtytwo he made a magnificent festival and calling together all his omrahs spoke to them to this effect secunder shaw his speech to the omrahs i esteem myself as one of you having thus far acted for the common weal i claim no superiority sultan beloli raised the tribe of lodi to an uncommon height of glory and reputation shere chan by unparalleled conduct and resolution rendered the tribe of soor famous to all posterity and now humaioon heir to his fathers conquests is watching for an opportunity to destroy a d      hig     us all if therefore you sincerely affect my government and will throw aside private faction and animosities our kingdom will be adorned with all the flowers of prosperity but if you should think me incapable of that great charge let an abler head and a stronger arm be elected from among you that i also may swear allegiance to him that with my life and fortune i may support him and endeavor to keep the empire of hindostan in the hands of the afghans who have ruled it for so many ages by their valor  they elect him king the omrahs after hearing this speech answered with one accord we unanimously elect you the nephew of shere shaw for our lawful sovereign calling then for a coran all swore allegiance to the king and to preserve unanimity among themselves however in a few days they began to dispute about governments honors and places the flames of enmity were kindled higher than ever and every one reproached his fellow with perfidy of which he himself was equally guilty  he is repeatedly defeated by the moguls humaioon in the mean time marched toward punjab tatar chan fled from the new fort of rhotas to delhi and the moguls subdued all the country as far as lahore secunder shaw upon receiving these advices sent forty thousand horse under the command of tatar chan and hybut chan to expel the moguls but this army was defeated lost all their elephants and baggage never drawing bridle till they arrived at delhi secunder shaw though sensible of the disaffection and factious state of his army marched with eighty thousand horse toward punjab and engaging byram chan the turkuman the tutor of prince akbar near sirhind was defeated and fled toward the mountains of sewalic the empire of hindostan with this victory fell again into the hands of the house of baber and flourished while in the mean time sultan adil died in bengal  section viii the transactions of humaioon from his arrival in persia to his return to hindostan a d      hig     humaioon arrives in persia we have already seen that humaioon having arrived at kizvi in iran dispatched byram chan to the persian monarch at ispahan that omrah accordingly waited upon shaw tamasp at nilack kidar between abher and sultania and received an answer which testified the kings great desire to have an interview with humaioon the unfortunate sultan accepted with joy of the invitation and in the month of jemmad ul awil in the year nine hundred and fifty one had a conference with shaw tamasp the son of shaw ismaiel suffvi and was royally entertained  the king of iran one day in conversation asked humaioon by what means his weak enemy became so powerful humaioon replied by the enmity of my brothers the persian then told him the political manner of treating brothers is not such as they received from you and being at that time at table as soon as shaw tamasp was done eating byram mirza his brother who attended him as a servant came with the basin and ewer for him to wash to attend the sovereign in any menial office about his person is the greatest honor that can be conferred upon a subject in the east  when this was done tamasp turned to humaioon and resuming the discourse said in this manner you ought to have treated your brothers humaioon out of compliment to the king seemed to assent to what he said which so much offended byram mirza the kings brother that he never after could forgive him while he resided at court he took every opportunity to calumniate humaioon to the king and was ever harping in his ears how much against the interest of persia it was that a prince of the line of timur should sit a d      hig     upon the throne of hindostan this maxim byram mirza took care to inculcate upon all who had the kings confidence this circumstance greatly retarded the affairs of humaioon and at length wrought so visibly upon the kings disposition that the unfortunate fugitive began to fear death or imprisonment  the kings sister and some omrahs favor the cause of humaioon in the mean time sultanum begum the kings sister and cusi jehan of kizvi the high chancellor in conjunction with hakim noor ul dien one of the kings privy counselors taking compassion upon humaioons distressed situation joined their interests to work a reconciliation and to reinstate him in the favor of the king the wit of sultanum begum had a great effect upon this occasion she one day produced a stanza of verses to the king of her own composition in the name of humaioon extolling his devotion and happy turn of expression in the praise of ali this greatly pleased tamasp zealous for the sect of the shiahs who differ from the sinnites the sect whose tenets humaioon followed the shiahs hold ali to be the only assistant of mahommed in his apostolic function but the sinnites believe in four adding osman omar and abubecker to ali  the king in short told his sister that if humaioon should become a shiah and enforce that doctrine in hindostan he would assist him to recover his empire sultanum begum having acquainted humaioon of these particulars he was not so much wedded to a sect as to lose a kingdom for an immaterial difference in a point of religion he accordingly returned for answer that he had always privately favored the opinions of the shiahs which was partly the occasion of the animosity subsisting between him and his brothers  shaw tamasp soon after had a private conference with byram chan examined him concerning the policy and state of hindostan and when he had satisfied himself upon that head he promised that his son murad who was then but an infant with his general biddai a d      hig     the king gives him ten thousand horse chan cadjar should accompany humaioon with ten thousand horse to chastise his brothers and drive them out of cabul candahar and buduchshan every thing accordingly was in a short time got in readiness and humaioon took leave of the persian king he told him that he had long proposed to take a tour through tibrez and ardebiel to visit the tomb of shech suffi and then to proceed on his expedition the king consented to this proposal and issued orders to all governors through whose territories humaioon was to pass to supply him and his army with all necessaries and treat him in a manner becoming his dignity  humaioon having visited and paid his devotions at the shrine of suffi marched with the young prince murad toward candahar humaioon takes garrimsere he invested the fort of garrimsere took it and read the chutba in his own name mirza ashkari who commanded at candahar for camiran hearing of these proceedings sent the young prince the son of humaioon mahummud akbar to his uncle at cabul and prepared the fort of candahar for a siege  humaioon invests candahar humaioon invested it upon the seventh of mohirrim in the year nine hundred and fifty two the siege had been carried on for six months when humaioon sent byram chan with a message to mirza camiran then at cabul a tribe of the patans of hazara attacked byram with great resolution but they were defeated and that omrah having obtained an audience of mirza camiran according to his instructions made a demand of candahar and required a resignation of all those provinces which he had usurped from his brother humaioon but it was not to be expected that mirza camiran would as yet listen to such a demand and so the ambassador departed without effecting any thing  the persians discontented the persian kisselbaches soldiers were now beginning to be discouraged by the length of the siege and discontented at being commanded by a d      hig     moguls this circumstance might have obliged humaioon to raise the siege had he not been joined by mahummud sultan mirza aligh beg mirza cusim hussein sultan mahummud mirick shere askun beg fusil beg and other omrahs who disgusted with mirza camiran had left his service some of the besieged deserted also and joined the king candahar taken by capitulation these favorable circumstances revived the sinking spirits of his army and equally depressed those of the besieged mirza ashkari desired to capitulate his request was granted upon honorable terms he gave up the place and much ashamed of his former behavior waited upon the king  put into the hands of the persians the fort of candahar as had been stipulated with shaw tamasp was given to his son mirza murad the winter having now come on the young prince murad biddai chan abul fat sultan afshar and sufi willi sultan aridmullu took up their quarters in the fort without admitting the mogul omrahs this so much disgusted them that some having no quarters went off to cabul while mirza ashkari with a view of raising more disturbance also fled ashkari however was pursued and brought back prisoner  humaioon finding inaction more dangerous to his affairs than war marched toward cabul the young prince murad of  on the way he heard of the death of the young prince murad at candahar upon which he returned with a view to retain that fort as a place of security till he should make further conquests buddai chan would not hearken to his proposal which silenced the king who could not confident with gratitude or his own promise compel him to deiver up the pla  but the urgency of his affairs soon obliged humaioon to depart from these punctilios of honor he therefore tacitly permitted byram chan mirza aligh beg and hadgee mahummud chan to take what means they could to render themselves masters of the place these omrahs accordingly sent hadgee mahummud chan a d      hig     humaioon by a stratagem seizes upon candahar and a few enterprizing men disguised like cameldrivers among a string of camels which was then bringing provisions into the fort they fell upon the guards and dispatched them while byram chan and mirza aligh

king marches to cabul the king marched immediately toward cabul mirza eadgar nasir the brother of baber flying at this time from mirza shaw hussein arghu to cabul in conjunction with mirza hindal the kings brother joined humaioon the king encamping in the environs of cabul before the army of his brother was every day joined by some of camirans troops who deserted his standards even kipla beg one of mirza camirans principal omrahs came over with all his adherents this so much weakened mirzas army that he was necessitated to shut himself up in the city invests and takes that city humaioon invested the place but as it was only slightly fortified camiran evacuated it without fighting and fled to ghizni  which he enters the king sent mirza hindal in pursuit of his brother and on the tenth of ramzan nine hundred and fifty two entered cabul where he found his son akbar then four years old with his mother beguma and taking him in his arms he repeated a verse to this purpose joseph by his envious brethren was cast into a well but he was exalted by providence to the summit of glory  mirza camiran being shut out of ghizni flies to dawir and bicker the gates of ghizni were shut against mirza camiran and he was therefore obliged to take refuge at dawir among the patans of hazara being very ill received there he went to bicker to mirza shaw hassein who gave him his daughter in marriage and prepared to support him  a d      hig     humaioon marches against buduchshan humaioon having left his son akbar under the tuition of mahummud ali tiggai in cabul marched in person in the

from thence turned toward talichan where he fell sick he however recovered at the end of two months and all the factions which had begun to prevail in his army soon subsided chaja moazim the brother of chuli begum one of the sultanas  having had a quarrel at this time with chaja reshid killed him and fled to cabul where he was ordered to be imprisoned by the king  mirza camiran having heard that his brother had marched to buduchshan made an excursion to ghorebund on the way he fell in with a caravan of merchants whom he robbed of all their camels horses and goods mirza camiran seizes ghizni

government of buduchshan to mirza soliman and that of kunduz to mirza hindal he himself returned to cabul defeated a d      hig     the army of camiran which opposed him at zohac ghorebund came to the town of the afghans called deh afghan where shere afkun beg and all the army of mirza camiran had again assembled to oppose him but the king overthrew them there also and slew shere afkun beg in the action humaioon defeating his brother in several actions sits down before cabul he proceeded from thence to cabul and sat down before that city skirmishing every day with the enemy mirza camiran having received intelligence that a caravan was passing wherein there was a great number of fine horses sent shere alli a bold enterprizing officer with a strong detachment to seize and bring it into the city humaioon marched round the walls and cut off shere allis retreat so that when he came to enter the city he was attacked and defeated with great slaughter  several chiefs join the king mirza

pharsangs on their way when they found that humaioon did not send troops to seize them nor attempt to detain them as a d      hig     they imagined they were ashamed of their own behavior and thought

upon pier mahummud and abdul aziz chan that they thought proper to retreat within the city  the king was desirous of pursuing the enemy this resolution had it been followed would certainly have had a good affect as the enemy were preparing to evacuate the place but unfortunately the king suffered his own better judgment to be overruled by his omrahs who suggested their apprehensions from mirza camiran and advised the king to incamp somewhere near the city which would fall into his hands in the course of things this pernicious advice was accordingly followed no ground proper for incamping being near the king was obliged to retreat to a small distance the troops a d      hig     being ordered to move back apprehended that danger was near when the enemy actually construed the retreat of

pass to sind the king informed of his motions sent a party to intercept him but kirrache chan and hasim hussein sultan who had remained with humaioon wrote privately to camiran and acquainted him with all that past these perfidious omrahs being now ashamed of no villainy told camiran that as the greatest part of the kings troops were detached from his person if he would return they would join him in the action camiran did not let this favorable opportunity slip through his hands he returned by the way of kipchach whither the king having intelligence of him advanced to meet him the battle was

however gained no advantage but the death of his brother being overthrown by humaioon and obliged to take shelter again among the patans the king after this victory returned to cabul and in gratitude to the memory of hindal who had so well expiated his former disobedience by his services and blood he gave the daughter of that prince rickia sultana begum to his son akbar in marriage he conferred at

got nothing but mischief to themselves by adhering to camiran they withheld their aid and expelled him from their country  he flies to selim shaw the desolate camiran fled to hindostan and was reduced to solicit the protection of selim shaw whom he beheld by his own baseness ruling his fathers empire but it was not expected that selim would treat camiran favorably the unfortunate fugitive fled from

assistance of humaioon to quell some disturbances in cashmire the king accordingly marched toward hindostan and crossed the nilab sultan adam the prince of the gickers fearing the kings resentment for giving protection to mirza camiran imprisoned the unhappy man and acquainted the king that he was ready to deliver him over to any body he should be pleased to send mirza camiram delivered up to the king the king dispatched monim chan to sultan adam and mirza camiran was accordingly given up to him and brought to the king  the chagittais to a man solicited that he should be put to death that he might distress them no more but the king would by no means consent to embrue his hands in the blood of his brother however deserving he was of death humaioon on account of his lenity was threatened with a general sedition in his army and every body openly complained of that merciful disposition in the king by which his subjects were so often involved in misfortunes at the general request of the army his eyes are put  he was at last though much against his will necessitated to permit them to render camiran blind by means of antimony  a d      hig     the king visits him some days after this sentence was executed upon the unfortunate prince the king went to see him camiran immediately rose and walked some steps forward to meet him saying the glory of the king will not be diminished by

crimes requested leave to proceed on a pilgrimage to mecca camiran goes on a pilgrimage to mecca and dies there his request was granted and he proceeded by the way of sind having resided three years

cashmire selim shaw having at that time advanced to punjaab his omrahs represented to humaioon that if he should enter cashmire as there was but one pass through which he could return that selim shaw might block up his rear and reduce him to great distress the king however would not listen to their representations but marched toward cashmire having advanced about half way a mutiny arose in the army and the greatest part of the omrahs refused to proceed while others actually returned to cabul returns this obliged humaioon to take a circuit by the way of sind ordering a fort called bickeram to be built in his rout in bickeram he left a garrison under secunder chan  when the king arrived in cabul he sent his son akbar to his government of ghizni under the charge of jellal ul dien mamood

marched toward candahar by the way of ghizni byram chan who was quite innocent of the charge when he heard of the kings approach came out with five or six friends only to congratulate him upon his arrival and to lay his offerings at his feet the king soon plainly perceived that he had been abused and satisfying byram chan with reasons for his coming spent two months there in festivity the calumniators of byram chan were disgraced and he himself loaded with favors byram chan was however afraid that the repeated calumnies of his enemies might find way at last into the kings mind he therefore earnestly requested that the government should be bestowed on some other omrah and that he might be permitted to attend his sovereign but the king would by no means consent to a thing which might have the appearance of a slur upon the conduct of his faithful servant when they parted byram chan obtained the district of dawir for bahadur chan and shubiani chan who remained with him  the inhabitants of delhi and agra invite him to hindostan much about this time an address was received from the inhabitants of delhi and agra acquainting humaioon that selim shaw was dead and that all the tribes of the patans were engaged in a civil war that it was therefore a proper opportunity for the king to return and take possession of his empire humaioon was in no condition to raise a sufficient army for that enterprise and he became extremely melancholy  humaioon communicates his uneasiness to his omrahs the king being one day upon a hunting party told some of his omrahs that he was very uneasy in his mind about the execution of his designs upon hindostan a curious method of divination some of them who were desirous to make the attempt consulted among themselves and hit upon a successful stratagem to bring the king to an immediate resolution they therefore told him that there was an old method of divination by sending a person before and asking the names of the three first persons he met from which a conclusion good or bad might be formed according to their meaning the king being naturally superstitious ordered this to be done he sent three horsemen in front who were a d      hig     to come back and acquaint him of the answers they received the first horseman who returned told the king that he had met with a traveller whose name was dowlat fortune or prosperity

upon the banks of the river of bidgwarrah a d      hig     it being winter the patans kindled great fires of wood in their camp which byram chan observing he crossed the river with a thousand chosen horse and advancing near their camp without being discovered began to gall those who crowded round the fires with arrows which raised an uproar in the camp but the patans instead of extinguishing their fires which prevented them from seeing the enemy while the enemy had a fair view of them by means of the light threw on more wood which is overthrown by byram chan in the mean time the whole of

ingratitude and contempt he was learned a lover of literature and the generous patron of the men of genius who flourished in his time in battle he was valiant and enterprizing but the clemency of his

attention to any malicious insinuations which might be suggested to the royal ear by his enemies the young prince having thus expressed the genuine sentiments of his soul to byram he made him swear by the soul of his father humaioon and by the head of his own son that he would be faithful to the great trust which was now reposed in him  a council of war is called a council of war was immediately called in which byram chan presided the majority of the omrahs were of opinion that as the enemy consisted of above a hundred thousand horse while the royal army scarce amounted to twenty thousand it

unmilitary crimes with which he was justly charged when akbar returned byram chan waited upon him and informed him of what he had done he excused himself for not acquainting the king of his intentions by insinuating that he was certain his royal clemency was so great that notwithstanding tirdis crimes he would have forgiven him which at such a time would be attended with very dangerous consequences as the hopes of the moguls rested upon every individuals strict performance of duty he affirmed that negligence was in such a critical situation as great a crime as treason and ought to meet with an equal punishment but that on the other hand desert should meet with reward for a dangerous crisis is the season of strict justice in both respects without his reward the soldier becomes languid and discontented when he fears no punishment he becomes negligent and insolent  a d      higer     the king saw into the propriety of the measure but he shuddered at the inhumanity of the punishment he however thanked byram for the service which he had done him and indeed though the policy of that minister was severe it had the intended effect among the omrahs they saw that they had nothing to hope

the elephants galled with lances arrows and javelines became quite outrageous and submitting no longer to command fell back and disordered the afgan ranks  the bravery of himu himu who rode a prodigious elephant still continued the action with great vigor at the head of four thousand horse in the very heart of the moguls being at last pierced through the eye with an arrow the greatest part

the enemy he immediately marched from the field and took possession of delhi from that city he dispatched mullu pier mahummud shirwani manager of the private affairs of byram toward mewat to seize the treasure of himu which was deposited in that place this service was accomplished with some loss on the side of the moguls and the empire in some measure returned to its former tranquillity  section ii the history of sultan akbar from the death of himu to that of byram chan the persians besiege and take kandahar sultan hussein the grandson of shaw ismaiel suffvi advanced this year by the orders of shaw tamasp of iran and laid siege to kandahar after a sharp engagement before the walls with mahummud kandahari who commanded in the place as deputy of byram chan the city fell into the hands of the persians chizer chaja chan was at the same time defeated by secunder shaw and obliged to fly to lahore  the king marches toward punjab the king having received intelligence of this double disaster put his army in motion and marched toward punjab secunder shaw who had advanced as far as callanore retreated upon the a d      higer     kings approach to the fort of mancot which had been built by selim shaw besieges secunder shaw in mancot and takes that place by capitulation akbar besieged secunder in that fortress for the space of six months he then began to treat about surrendering the place upon conditions and chan azim being sent into the fort to settle the terms of capitulation secunder proposed to that omrah to give his son as a hostage to the king for his future obedience if he himself should be permitted to retire to bengal this being granted on the part of akbar sheck abul rhiman the son of secunder shaw was in the month of ramzan     brought to the king with presents consisting chiefly of elephants secunder shaw was permitted to retire to bengal and mancot was delivered up to akbar the king left a trusty governor in the place and proceeded to lahore  byram chan disgusted with the king byram chan being privately disgusted at favors which the king had conferred upon some persons whom he suspected to be enemies to himself for some days refused to come to court the king in the mean time happened to amuse himself with an elephant fight and the outrageous animals chanced to run over the tents of byram chan the minister immediately suspected that this was done designedly by the king and he sent to acquaint him that he was sorry to see that he had disobliged the king but that if he deserved akbars dislike he would be glad to know the crime he had committed that he might be the better able to make his excuse and then retire for ever from the presence the king was touched with an imputation which his soul abhorred but he condescended to acquaint byram that the circumstance from which his ungenerous suspicious arose was a mere accident this however did not satisfy byram chan who still continued to suspect that the kings mind was estranged from him  a d      higer     vindictive disposition of byram the king soon after this transaction marched from lahore to delhi chaja callan who was proud of his family and of the signal services which he had rendered to the king set himself up to oppose byram chan in his administration that vindictive minister to get rid of his antagonist condemned him to death upon very slight pretenses which raised great commotions among the omrahs the king also expressed his dislike of this violent proceeding for the whole had been done without his orders  breach between him and the king upon this occasion high words arose between the king and his minister and the former in a few days set out for agra though the king did not discover what had passed between him and byram the cause of his journey was no secret at court the people sided with their young king in this quarrel and the power of the minister began to decline visibly every day the enraged byram in the mean time endeavored to recover his authority by rigor and severity  he punishes the insolence of pier mahummud much about this time mullu pier mahummud who had been formerly a retainer of byram chan was on account of his great abilities preferred to the high office of tutor to the king he soon engrossed a great share of the kings favor and the pride of advancement began to swell in his heart he used often to make the omrahs who attended his levee to wait whole hours and at last to send them word that he could not see them which insolent behavior gave great offense to many byram chan himself was little better treated one day by mahummud and he took it so much amiss that by virtue of his own authority he sent the tutor prisoner to biana from thence he banished him to guzerat and there shipped him off for mecca to prosecute his devotion  a d      higer     the king being offended byram projects an expedition against gualier the king was highly offended at this proceeding as it seemed to debar him from even the liberty of disposing of his own private favors the artful minister perceiving the sultans rage projected an expedition against gualier to divert the kings attention to an other object that fortress was then in the possession of bibil one of the slaves of selim shaw who held it for mahummud shaw adili bibil hearing of akbars design against him wrote to ram shaw a descendant of raja man singh that as his ancestors had been masters of gualier and as he did not think himself capable to hold out the place against the king he would put it into the possession of the raja for a reasonable sum  gualier delivered up to akbar ram shaw glad at this offer immediately moved toward the fort but kika chan who possessed a jaghier from the king in the neighborhood of gualier raised all his vassals and attacking ram shaw defeated and drove him into the dominions of rama kika immediately after this victory returned and invested the fortress bibil seeing himself thus besieged made overtures of capitulation the king being informed of this circumstance ordered chaja mahummud chan with a detachment to give bibil the terms he required and to sieze upon the fortress the traitor accordingly being gratified with some money and a promise of future favor delivered up the important castle of gualier  actions of chan ziman in the course of the same year chan ziman to wipe off some aspersions under which he lay exerted himself in a particular manner in the kings service for he subdued all the provinces near jionpoor and benaris which till then were in the hands of the patans  a d      higer     transactions at court sheck mahummud ghori the brother of sheck phul who having been firmly attached to the chegittai or mogul interest during the late supremacy of the patans had fled to guzerat this year returned to court with his family and was very favorably received by the king who ordered byram chan to provide for him in a manner suitable to his dignity mahummud ghori trusting too much to the kings authority neglected to pay that court to byram chan which that haughty minister expected byram therefore took every possible means to avoid to serve mahummud and made things so very disagreeable to him that he left the court and retired to his old family residence at gualier  an expedition against malava this being represented to the king revived his former discontent against byram chan the artful minister soon observed a visible alteration in the countenance of his sovereign he therefore formed an expedition against malava to turn the kings active mind from the private politics of the court byram accordingly called bahadur the brother of chan ziman from debalpoor and gave him the command of the army destined to act against baz bahadur who then ruled over malava  transactions at court the king much about this time went out upon a hunting party and made a progress as far as secundra within forty miles of delhi between the rivers mahim his fosterbrother joined him there and told him that his mother was extremely ill at delhi and was very desirous to see the king great power of byram chan he immediately set out for delhi and shabul dien ahmed chan neishapuri an omrah of five thousand who then commanded in the city came out to meet akbar with presents that omrah was in great perplexity how to act he was assured that byram chan would impute the kings journey to delhi to his intrigues a d      higer     and would not fail to get rid of him as he had done of musuai beg he therefore acquainted the king of his apprehensions and begged he might be permitted to make a pilgrimage to mecca the king was very much affected upon hearing this request by observing how formidable the power of his minister was become to all his friends but after he had considered the many obligations under which he and his family lay to that able man he could not think of removing him to lessen however in some measure the apprehensions of ahmed chan the king wrote byram that he had of his own accord proceeded to delhi and not at the instigation of any person but merely to pay his respects to his mother that therefore a letter from him to appease the minds of those who were apprehensive of his displeasure would be extremely necessary byram chan returned for answer that he should never entertain resentment against any whom the king was pleased to honor with his favor he moreover sent hadjee mahummud seistani and tirdi beg to delhi with assurances of his loyalty and absolute obedience to the kings royal pleasure  a faction accuses him to the king in the mean time shabuldien ahmed chan finding the king disposed to protect him and to hear accusations against byram chan gave a loose to his tongue one day in public against that minister he was joined by the whole court whom he had previously attached to his interest a breach between him and the king in short so many crimes were alleged against byram chan particularly his designs in favor of abul casim the son of mirza cameran that the king was alarmed and thought it necessary to curtail his authority when therefore hadjee mahummud and tirdi beg arrived instead of being admitted to an audience they were immediately imprisoned  a d      higer     transactions at court this breach between the king and byram chan is related with other particulars by abul fazil one day at agra says that great man one of the kings elephants in the rtting season attacked an elephant of byram chan and killed him byram for this offense commanded that the keeper of the kings elephants should be put to death without giving any notice to the sultan akbar was greatly displeased with this piece of cruelty especially when he found that the poor man was innocent having lost all his command over the outrageous animal soon after continues abul fazil as byram chan was taking his pleasure in a barge on the river one of the elephants which had been carried down to the water run furiously against the barge and had almost sunk it before by the uncommon efforts of the rider he was brought to obedience the minister naturally of a suspicious and unforgiving temper imagined that these were actually plots laid against his life and he publicly petitioned the king to punish the rider of the elephant the king to appease byram and to remove all suspicions ordered that the elephantrider should be sent to him to be punished at discretion but byram either to make an example to others or to gratify his resentment against the innocent man who might even be said to have saved his life ordered him also to be put to death  the king was highly incensed by these two instances of byrams presumption and cruelty his displeasure became visible to the court and there were not wanting many who made it their business by private insinuations to increase his resentment the king at length came to the resolution of depriving byram of the reins of government which required some delicacy in the present situation of affairs some authors mention a scheme a d      higer     suggested to akbar by his nurse this was she that the king went to visit at delhi  upon this occasion to get possession of the seals which were in byram chans possession they also say that she discovered to him that ministers design to confine him which she had accidentally heard in a conversation between byram and the queen mother this say they was the circumstance that determined akbar to leave agra abul fazil mentions nothing of this affair for that historian informs us with greater probability that the whole was concerted between adam chan and mahim anigah on the part of the young king who now began to be tired of a tutor and thought he was capable of acting for himself but to return from this digression  byram chan is disgraced when it became public that the deputies from byram chan had been imprisoned by the king every body predicted the ruin of the minister and endeavored to shake him off as fast as possible they flocked daily to akbar by hundreds to delhi the king takes the administration of affairs into his own hands that young prince immediately issued a proclamation throughout the empire that he had taken the administration upon himself and that henceforth no orders but his own should be obeyed byram chan being dismissed from the regency  shaw abul mali invades cashmire shaw abul mali who had been confined in lahore having before this time found means to escape went to cummal chan the gicker and engaged him in an expedition against cashmire he is defeated but they were defeated with great slaughter mali flying to debalpoor joined himself with bahadur chan seistani and stirred him up to rebel but bahadur chan repenting of his resolution a quarrel ensued between them taken and confined and abul mali was driven to sind from that place he fled to guzerat and from a d      higer     thence to jionpoor from whence chan ziman by the order of byram chan sent him prisoner to agra he was sent to perpetual imprisonment in the fort of biana  various schemes of byram chan byram chan finding that he had no farther hopes from the king began to form a resolution of going to malava to reduce that country and found an independent kingdom to accomplish his purpose he proceeded to biana and called bahadur chan and other omrahs who had been sent upon the expedition to malava before him but perceiving that he was deserted by those omrahs in whom he placed his chief confidence he began to despair of succeeding in that enterprise he therefore released abul mali from his confinement intending by his assistance and that of chan ziman to attack the patans of bengal and to fix himself in that kingdom but before he had proceeded many days on this scheme he changed his resolution and took the way of nagore with a design to make a pilgrimage to mecca upon which bahadur chan kika chan and many other omrahs who had determined to follow his fortunes took leave of him his irresolute behavior but so irresolute was the unfortunate byram become at a time too when firmness constancy and perseverance were absolutely necessary that like a person infatuated he had no sooner reached nagore after having lost all his friends than he changed again his resolution of going to mecca and began to assemble troops with a view to conquer punjab  when the king was informed of this new scheme of byrams he sent mere abdul latif shusvini his own preceptor with a message to him to the following purpose the kings message to him till now our mind has been taken up with our education and the amusements of youth and it was our royal pleasure that you should be responsible for our empire but as it is now our intention to govern a d      higer     our people by our own judgment and pleasure let our wellwisher contract his skirts from the business of the world and retire to mecca without thirsting after vanity and ambition  he resolves to go to mecca byram chan upon receiving this letter professed passive obedience and sent his ensigns of state elephants banners and drums by the hand of hussen kulli beg zul kudder to the king he then returned to nagore to prepare for mecca being now abandoned by all his friends except willi beg zul kuddur ismaiel kulli chan shaw kulli chan merhum hassen chan tughlich shech gaddai and chaja muziffer alli jurbutti the rest having joined the king among the latter was abul mali who coming up to akbar when hunting neglected to dismount when he made his obeisance for which he was immediately confined  repents of his resolution and levies forces byram chan having proceeded on his pilgrimage as far as bickanere repented of his resolution and returned again to nagore where he began to assemble troops the king being informed of that proceeding marched to jidger mulla pier mahummud being now returned from his banishment to which he had been condemned by byram chan was thought a proper person to carry on the war against him he was accordingly dignified with titles by the king and sent with an army toward nagore the king in the mean time returned to delhi and sent orders to monim chan at cabul to repair to court  he returns toward punjab byram chan upon the approach of pier mahummud chan set out for punjab and was closely pursued by that omrah when he arrived at the sort of tibberhind h threw all his baggage into that place which was commanded by one of his adherents by name shere mahummud but this traitor no sooner had got byrams effects into the place than he began to reckon a d      higer     upon them as his own and turned out the guard which the unfortunate minister had sent to take charge of his baggage byram chan set out from thence for debalpoor which was then governed by one of his old friends dirvesh mahummud usbeck when he came near the place he sent his secretary chaja muziffer ali to wait upon him but that ungrateful man pretending to be affronted at byrams request confined the secretary and sent him to the king byram chan who had conceived great hopes from his friendship was astonished at a behavior so common to men in adversity and set out in great perturbation of mind toward jallender  defeated the king had by this time recalled pier mahummud chan and appointed chan azim to reduce punjab and to quell the rebellion of byram chan chan azim coming up soon after with byram chan at matchiwarrah a battle ensued which was maintained with great bravery on both sides chan azims line being broke by the enemy flies to the mountains of sewalic but at length several of byram chans principal officers being killed he was defeated and obliged to fly to the mountains of sewalic  after this victory the king appointed chaja abdul mugid hirrivi to the government of delhi by the title of asiph chan and marched in person to lahore when akbar had reached ludhana munim chan met him in his way from cabul and being graciously received was honored with the title of chan chanan and made prime minister of the empire  the king pursues him into the mountains the kings army having advanced near the mountains of sewalic a detachment of light horse entered the hills where the zemindars of that country had convened in support of byram chan to guard the passes but they were driven from post to post a d    0 higer     upon which byram chan in great distress sent his slave jemmal chan to the presence to represent his unfortunate situation and to implore the kings mercy  byram chan submits akbar immediately dispatched mulla abdulla sultanpuri with assurances of his clemency and to bring the unhappy byram to court accordingly in the month of ribbi ul sani he was received at some distance from the camp by a considerable number of omrahs whom the king had ordered to meet him he was brought into the presence with every possible mark of favor and distinction when he appeared within sight of the king he hung his turban round his neck and suddenly advancing threw himself in tears at the foot of the throne is received with every mark of distinction by the king the king instantly stretched forth his hand ordered him to rise and placed him in his former station at the head of the omrahs to dispel at once his uneasiness and grief the king honored him with a splendid chelat and spoke to him after the following manner if byram chan loves a military life he shall have the government of calpe and chinderi in which he may exercise his martial genius if he chooses rather to remain at court our favor shall not be wanting to the great benefactor of our family but should devotion engage the soul of byram to perform a pilgrimage to mecca he shall be escorted in a manner suitable to his dignity  he resolves on a pilgrimage to mecca byram chan replied the royal confidence and friendship for me must be now diminished nay they are past the hopes of recovery why then should i remain in the presence the clemency of the king is enough for me and his forgiveness for my late errors a sufficient reward for my former services let then the unfortunate byram turn his face from this world to another and pursue his pilgrimage to mecca the king assented to his a d    0 higer     request and ordered a proper retinue for him with  0000 rupees a year to support his dignity byram soon after took leave of the king who with a few attendants left the camp and went to agra  takes the way of guzerat byram chan took the way of guzerat with an intention to proceed by sea to mecca when he arrived in the suburbs of the city of guzerat which was then governed by musi chan lodi on the part of actemad chan sovereign of the country he was accosted by mubarick chan lohani whose father in the battle with himu byram chan had killed is basely assassinated by an afgan chief the wretch pretended to embrace the unsuspecting byram drew a dagger and basely stabbed him to the heart a mob of afgans fell immediately upon byrams retinue and plundered them this murder

ten crores of his capital before he could prevail with himself to quit the pillows of indolence and then in the best manner the time and his own confusion would permit he prepared for action which is reduced but the bold chigittai upon the first onset shook his order of battle and sent him with streaming eyes and a broken heart toward burhanpoor  the king suspecting adam of treasonable intentions marches toward him adam chan after the victory distributed the spoil and the governments of malava among his omrahs reserving the treasure royal ensigns and the ladies of the haram for himself he sent nothing except a few elephants to the king of what was customary on those occasions akbar fearing from this behavior that he entertained treasonable intentions put the royal standard in motion toward him when the imperial ensigns appeared before shakeran the governor of that fort on the part of bas bahadur delivered it up to the king the sultan from thence made a sudden excursion by night and in the morning arrived before saringpoor he met adam chan coming out with an intention to besiege shakeran he permitted that omrah to pay his respects and then he carried him back to the city he submits and is pardoned adam chan suspecting the kings displeasure and the cause of his visit laid all the treasure and spoil at his feet he excused himself by alleging that he reserved every thing till he should have the honor of presenting them to akbar in person the king saw through his designs but preferring clemency to rigor he drew the pen of forgiveness over his crime  akbar kills an enormous tygress the king soon after returned toward agra hunting one day on the way near narvar a great royal tygress with five young ones took the road before him akbar advanced to the animal while his retinue stood trembling with fear and astonishment to behold the event the king having meditated his blow spurred a d      higer     on his horse toward the fierce tygress whose eyes flamed with rage

particular manner in this action so that the two brothers were esteemed the boldest warriors of the age but reckoning too much on their services they neglected to send to the king the elephants which they had taken in the battle which were always considered as royal property  the king dissatisfied with chan ziman the king though he gave to the brothers all due praise for their valor would by no means permit any violation of his laws or encroachment upon his prerogative this determined him to march toward jionpoor who submits himself to his royal clemency but when he had arrived at kurrah the brothers sensible of his resolution and their own misbehaviour advanced to congratulate him with all the spoils which they had taken and other suitable presents the king whose generosity and clemency could be only equalled by his spirit returned all except what belonged properly to the exchequer at the same time he gave them a gentle reproof for their neglect and afterward engaged their affections

progress toward delhi as he was passing by the college of mahim annigah a slave of the rebel mirza hussein by name kuttlick fowlad who had been sent to assassinate the king fixed an arrow in his bow and pointed it toward the sky the royal retinue imagining that the villain was going to shoot at some bird flying overhead gazed upward he immediately lowered his aim to the king who was at some distance upon his elephant and let fly his arrow which lodged itself some inches deep in akbars shoulder in a moment a thousand swords were drawn and the people cut one another each anxious to kill the assassin who was in a moment hewn to pieces the surgeons being called the arrow was with great difficulty extracted on the place before all the people the king not shrinking once at the operation in about ten days the wound was closed up akbar returned to agra and soon after appointed asaph chan herdi suba of kurrah and maneckpoor  the governor of malava revolts the king did not rest many days at agra before he set out for narvar to hunt elephants he had ordered abdulla chan usbeck governor of malava to send his trained elephants to assist in this amusement which he neglected to do the king was very much enraged at his disobedience and made a sudden incursion into malava though the periodical rains were at their height mahummud casin chan neishapuri governor of saringpoor joined the king by the way he flies to guzerat when akbar had reached ugein abdulla chan with all his forces and treasure fled to guzerat the king pursued him about twentyfive crores a d      higer     with a small body of cavalry the rebel stood his ground and fought with such success that akbar thought proper to return from the pursuit to mindu where he surveyed the buildings erected there by the princes of the race of chillige the king of chandez in the decan submits to akbar while akbar remained in that city mira mubarick shaw king of chandez paid him homage and gave him his daughter in marriage the king conferred the government of malava upon shirra bahadur and returned toward his capital  the king upon the way near the village of sipiri fell in with a great herd of wild elephants he ordered his cavalry to surround them and he drove them with great difficulty into a kedda or fold constructed for that purpose one of the male elephants of a prodigious size finding himself confined strode over the ditch bore down the wall and the pallisadoes before him and made his way into the plain three trained elephants were sent after him he stood to fight and before they could overcome and take him he afforded very great diversion to the king who was remarkably fond of the boisterous contention of those enormous animals  transactions at agra in the year     chaja moazim the brother of chuli begum and husband to the kings aunt for some impropriety of behavior was thrown into prison where he died the same year the old fort of agra which was built of brick was demolished and the foundation of the new one of red freestone laid and though a great and magnificent work was finished in four years  the usbeck omrahs rebel by the intrigues of abdulla chan the usbeck there was a report propagated that the king on his account had taken a dislike to all the usbeck race and proposed to confine all the a d      higer     omrahs of that nation who were in his service this calumny gained so much credit that secunder chan ibrahim chan usbeck and others who had governments about jionpoor and behar turned their heads from obedience and drew over chan ziman bahadur chan and shubiani chan to their party asaph chan hirrevi who held the government of kurrah on account of some disputes with the collector of the kings revenues took part in their rebellion in a short time their army consisted of thirty thousand horse with which they possessed themselves of all the territories near behar and jionpoor  the policy of akbar news of this rebellion being brought to the king he seemed to take no notice of it he ordered his troops to attend him on a hunting party toward narvar in the opposite direction to the enemy he accordingly employed himself in taking elephants for some days during which time asherif chan a scribe was sent privately to secunder chan to endeavor to bring him over from his faction lashkar chan bukshi was sent with a great body of horse to seize the treasures of asaph chan upon whom the king had a large demand which was the sole cause of that omrahs rebellion  a digression concerning asaph chans war with the queen of gurrah it seems that when asaph chan was made an omrah of five thousand and obtained the government of kurrah and maneckpoor he obtained permission of the king to subdue a country called gurrah or kattuck lying between the provinces of rintimpore malava behar and the decan at that time the kingdom of gurrah now part of orissa and bundelcund was governed by a queen whose name was durgautti famous for her beauty and accomplishments her dominions were about one hundred and fifty crores in length a d      higer     and about fifty in breadth yet so flourishing was the country that in this small tract there were about seventy thousand towns and villages well inhabited which had the good fortune never to have fallen under the dominion of foreigners  asaph chan having heard of the riches of this country disturbed the peaceable inhabitants unaccustomed to the sound of war with constant depredations he at length marched against them with six thousand horse and about double that number of infantry the queen with fifteen hundred elephants eight thousand horse and some foot prepared to oppose him like a bold heroine she led on her troops to action clothed in armor with a helmet upon her head mounted in a howdar on an elephant with her bow and quiver lying by her side and a burnished lance in her hand though her troops had not been accustomed to action the love of liberty and the example of their queen inspired every breast with a lions courage their eagerness to engage made them march in disorder toward the enemy which the queen observing commanded them to halt and forming her line anew gave her troops strict orders to march on slowly as compact as possible and to observe the signal to engage when it should be displayed from the elephant of the royal standard  in this manner she received the enemy whom she quickly repulsed and pressing upon them laid six hundred mahommedan horsemen dead on the field she pursued the rest till the evening with great slaughter when night came on the queen halted with her army and gave them orders to wash and refresh themselves that they might be prepared for a night attack upon the enemy before they could recover from their consternation but her vizier and the rest of her chiefs less daring and consequently a d      higer     less prudent than this heroine opposed this salutary measure and seditiously insisted on returning to the field of battle to bury their friends she accordingly returned unwillingly and after the dead were burnt again addressed her chiefs and solicited them one by one to accompany her to storm the mahommedan camp none of them however had the spirit to second her in this daring enterprise they vainly imagined that the enemy would of their own accord evacuate the country  the omrahs of gurrah soon found that they were fatally frustrated in their hopes asaph chan to wipe away the disgrace which he sustained the day before and finding what enemy he had to deal with advanced in the morning toward the queen with his artillery which in the preceding action he had left behind him on account of the badness of the roads the queen upon asaphs approach advanced to a narrow pass and prepared to oppose him the mogul scouring the pass with his artillery soon opened to himself a way into the plain beyond it where the queens army were drawn up in order of battle raja bier shaw the queens son a young prince of great hopes as soon as the mahommedan army came into the plain made a resolute charge and exhibited prodigies of valor he repulsed the enemy twice but in the third attack being wounded he became faint with loss of blood when he was just falling from his horse his mother who was mounted on an elephant in the front of the battle observed her son ready to expire she immediately called to some of her people to carry him back to the rear many of them accordingly crowded around him some with a friendly intention to serve him but more to have an opportunity to quit the field the loss of the raja in short together with the retreat of so many with his body struck a pannic into the rest so that the unfortunate queen was left with only three hundred men in a d      higer     in the field the heroine however seemed no ways affected by her desperate situation she stood her ground with her former fortitude till she received an arrow in her eye she endeavored to extricate it from the wound but as she tugged it part of the steel broke short and remained behind in the mean time another arrow passed through her neck which she also drew out but nature sinking under the pain a dimness swam before her eyes and she began to nod from side to side of the howdar a wooden tower on the back of the elephant  she however recovered from her fainting by degrees and a brave officer of her household by name adhar who drove her elephant singly repulsed numbers of the enemy whithersoever he turned the outrageous animal begged permission as the day was now irretrievable to carry the queen from the field she rejected the proposal with a noble disdain it is true said she we are overcome in war but shall we ever be vanquished in honor shall we for the sake of a lingering ignominious life lose that reputation and virtue which we have been so solicitous to acquire no let your gratitude now repay that service for which i lifted up your head and which i now require at your hands haste i say let your dagger save me from the crime of putting a period to my own existence  adhar burst into tears and begged that as the elephant was swift of foot he might be permitted to leave the field and carry her to a place of safety in the mean time the queen finding that the enemy crowded fast around her and that she must be taken prisoner she suddenly leaning forward seized the dagger of adhar and plunging it into her bosom expired the death of the queen rendered asaph chans victory complete six hindoo chiefs upon their elephants still stood firm and ashamed a d      higer     of being outdone by a woman dedicated their lives to revenge the death of the queen  asaph chan a few days after this battle laid siege to joragur where all the treasures of this noble family had been for ten generations deposited the hopes of gain rendered the moguls desperate they begun to attack the fort with uncommon resolution till the place was taken the young raja bravely exerting what little strength he had left lost his life in defense of his independence and kingdom the unfortunate garrison according to their barbarous custom had performed the joar the joar is a general massacre of the women and children  this dreadful ceremony was performed after this manner a house was filled with wood straw and oil the unfortunate victims were forced in and fire set to the horrid pile when the bloody conquerors who had brought this dreadful calamity upon the miserable hindoos entered the place they found two women still alive and untouched by the flames one of them was called camelawilli the sister of the deceased queen and the other the daughter of the raja of biragur who had been brought to be espoused by the young raja of gurrah these two ladies were reserved by asaph chan for the king the riches of joragur in gold silver jewels and precious effects were invaluable of gold alone there were found in one treasury one hundred and one chests of mhers when asaph chan had glutted his avarice and ambition with the blood and treasure of this brave though peaceable family he took up his residence in that country his view was to maintain his conquest against the king and he therefore did not return to his government of kurrah that avarice which prompted him to this public robbery prevented him from presenting the king with his part of the plunder out of a thousand a d      higer     elephants which he had taken though all should fall to the share of the king he sent him only two hundred of the worst and sent no part of the jewels and treasure it was therefore this just demand which the king had upon asaph that made that ambitious omrah join in rebellion with the disaffected usbecks  the king marches against asaph chan falls sick and returns the king having found that lashkar chan could effect nothing against asaph he determined to march in person into gurrah having therefore left narvar he continued his rout for some days toward gurrah his generals defeated akbar being seized with a fever on account of the heat which in that sandy soil was excessive he returned to agra dispatching shahim chan sellaori shaw biddai chan mahummud amin and other omrahs against secunder chan by whom they were defeated and the two last taken prisoners the king apprized of this disaster sent menim chan chanan with an army some days journey in front and in the month of shawal     followed in person with all the forces that he could raise  the king marches against lucknow when the king had arrived at kinnoge he selected a body of horse and made an excursion toward lucknow to surprise secunder chan who was in that place but secunder chan being informed of his approach evacuated lucknow and fled to chan ziman with whom he crossed the ganges asaph chan submits the king proceeding to jionpoor asaph chan sued for pardon and by the mediation of mudgenu chan was admitted to the presence and again restored to favor upon settling his accounts concerning the plunder of gurrah  a few days after asaph chan was detached with five thousand chosen horse against the enemy he came to the ferry of nirhin a d      higer     and was opposed in crossing the river his misbehaviour but instead of making any dispositions to gain the passage he sat down and passed the time in riot and foolish negociations for which he had no authority the king being informed of asaphs negligence stripped him of his jagier and flight to gurrah asaph with his brother vizier chan relinquished his troops and set out with great expedition to gurrah  motions of the rebels the king sent chan chanan to take charge of the army which asaph had forsaken and the rebels in the mean time under secunder chan and bahadur chan crossed the jumna and raised disturbances in the provinces between the rivers while chan ziman opposed the imperial army at the ganges the king being informed of these motions detached shaw biddaw chan and other omrahs under the command of mere moaz ul muluck to stop the progress of bahadur chan chan ziman submits but in the mean time chan ziman repenting of his disloyalty sent a number of elephants and other presents to the king and monim chan interceeding for his pardon the king was prevailed upon to receive him into favor and draw the pen of oblivion over his crimes he confirmed him in all his estates and honors which he had forfeited by his rebellion  the imperial army under moaz ul muluck overthrown by the rebels mere moaz ul muluck having come up with secunder chan and bahadur chan was upon the point of engaging them when he received a letter from bahadur chan acquainting him that his brother chan ziman had sent his mother with presents to the king to intercede for pardon and therefore that he would be glad to avoid extremities till he heard the consequence of that negotiation mere moaz ul muluck who had heard nothing of this matter thinking it to be a political fetch to gain time or lull him to security paid no regard to it but drew out a d      higer     in order of battle secunder chan who commanded the van of the rebel army made the best disposition the time would permit to receive him but was obliged to retreat with great loss toward the body of the army which by this time was formed by bahadur chan the imperialists who from the flight of secunder chan concluded the victory already their own pursuing in an irregular manner were received so warmly by bahadur chan that they were repulsed in turn and would never more show their face to the pursuers so that the rebels gained a complete victory and great spoil mere moaz ul muluck fled with the scattered remains of his army to kinnoge  chan ziman upon the news of this defeat again rebels akbar in the mean time as peace was concluded with chan ziman went to take a view of the fortifications of chinar and the city of benaris when the news of the late defeat of the imperialists arrived in the royal camp chan ziman though so lately pardoned being destitute of every principle of gratitude loyalty and honor again deserted and took possession of ghazipoor and the adjacent territories the king enraged at this baseness flew into a violent passion with chan chanan by whose mediation he had pardoned ziman he immediately ordered zimans mother to be confined and with all expedition marched toward the traitor who upon his approach fled to the hills the rebels take jionpoor bahadur chan taking advantage of the kings absence from jionpoor entered that place and took the citadel by escalade where he released his mother and confined asherif chan the governor with all the principle persons in the garrison  which is retaken by the king the king hearing of the taking of jionpoor gave over the pursuit of chan ziman and returning toward that city issued out orders to all the viceroys of the provinces to join him with all their forces upon akbars approach bahadur chan evacuated a d      higer     jionpoor and fled toward benaris chan ziman pardoned a second time chan ziman now seeing such preparations against him in all the provinces which remained firm in their allegiance began again to despair of success and had the confidence to address the king a second time for pardon which by a strange perversion of policy and an unjustifiable act of clemency or rather weakness in the king he obtained as well as a confirmation of all his estates and honors the king after passing his royal word for all these favors ordered ziman to come to court but the traitor excused himself by pretending that shame for his past offenses would not permit him to appear in the presence till time should erase his behavior from his majestys mind that as soon as the king should return to agra both he and his brother bahadur chan would accept the honor which the royal benevolence intended to confer upon them  the kings weakness it surprises it even disgusts the friends of the memory of the renowned akbar to find that he should admit of this excuse or trust to the oath of a man already perjured but the sincere mind of akbar could not suspect in others that baseness which was a stranger to his own soul he returned to agra and left this snake to collect fresh poison when akbar had arrived at agra he sent mendi cassim chan with four thousand horse to drive asaph chan out of his government of gurrah which he had usurped  chan ziman again revolts chan ziman as might have been forseen took this opportunity to strengthen his party treason still fermented in secret within his soul and he invited asaph chan to join him asaph accepted of the proposal and left gurrah in possession of cassim chan ziman in the mean time forgetting his oath to wait on the king at agra during six months maintained himself in a a d      higer     princely independance over all the eastern provinces asaph chan who had by this time joined him finding himself neglected and treated with contempt fled to kurrah his original jagier was pursued by bahadur chan defeated and taken prisoner in the mean time his brother vizier chan who escaped in the action rallied the troops and returning surprised the conquerors and rescued asaph chan out of their hands the brothers then fell upon kurrah and possessed themselves of that country  an embassy from cabul an ambassador about this time arrived from mirza mahummud hakim the kings brother who governed cabul acquainting him that mirza soliman of buduchshan ever since he had defeated and killed shaw abdul mali continued to read the chutba of cabul in his own name that he had appointed mirza sultan to act in that city in his behalf which had obliged hakim to expel him from that office for which affront mirza soliman was again preparing to invade cabul he therefore earnestly entreated akbars aid to oppose him  the king issues orders to aid his brother at cabul the king fearing more from the encroachments of his northern enemies than from the soft sons of the eastern provinces immediately ordered the omrahs of punjab and mahummud kulli chan of moultan to assist mirza mahummud hakim as soon as ever they should be certain of the enemies attempts upon cabul feredoon chan cabuli who was one of the kings omrahs was also sent from the presence with what troops he retained in pay to succor hakim but before the royal orders arrived either at punjab or moultan and consequently long before any succors could reach cabul mirza soliman had invested that city mirza mahummud hakim evacuated it in a few days and retreated to the nilab where he a d      higer     met feredoon chan coming to his assistance this treacherous omrah proposed to hakim to sieze upon lahore assuring him that akbar was in no condition to oppose him being involved in a war with the usbeck omrahs that after he should be possessed of that rich and powerful province he would find little difficulty in driving mirza soliman out of cabul  hakims designs upon lahore mirza mahummud hakim insensible of the baseness of this project ungratefully began to take measures to put it in execution and marched to lahore in conjunction with feredoon chan hakims design upon lahore being noised abroad the omrahs of punjab particularly cuttub ul dein annigah and pier mahummud chan threw all their forces into the city and prepared for a vigorous defense besieges that city mirza mahummud hakim sat down before the place and used every art and persuasion to bring over those omrahs to his interest but without effect  the king marches toward lahore the king enraged as well as alarmed at this rebellion laid aside his intended expedition against the usbecks and turned his arms toward lahore he began his march toward that city on the   th of jimmad ul awil     leaving agra under the government of monim chan chanan akbar having arrived at sirhind the news of his approach reached lahore the citizens immediately began to beat their drums to sound their trumpets and to make every demonstration of joy this unusual noise waked mirza hakim who was asleep in his tent he asked the meaning of that uproar and was told that the king was come expeditiously from agra hakim retreats with precipitation mirza hakim believing that the king was already at his heels mounted his horse without delay and retreated precipitately with his cavalry toward cabul he a d      higer     came very opportunely to that city and took it by surprise mirza soliman having retired to buduchshan during the winter  akbar arrives at lahore the king in the mean time advanced to lahore where he spent a few days in hunting he then sent back mudginu chan to possess himself of kurrah and manneckpoor which asaph chan had seized much about this time the sons of mirza sultan governor of simbol rose in rebellion this insurrection was crushed in the bud by the other jagierdars of the adjacent territories who defeated the young rebels and drove them toward malava they however possessed themselves of that country without much opposition there being at that time no imperial forces in that province mirza sultan upon account of the rebellion of his sons was seized and imprisoned in biana where he soon after died  the king marches against the usbeck omrahs the usbeck omrahs improved the kings absence to their own advantage and extended their conquests on all sides this obliged the king to return to agra before which city he ordered all his forces from the provinces to rendezvous he was in a few weeks ready to take the field against the rebels with two thousand elephants and above a hundred thousand horse chan ziman at that time besieging eusoph chan in the sort of sherigur hearing of the kings approach retreated to kurrah in which place bahadur chan had invested mudgenu chan the king closely pursued ziman but when he had reached raibarrili he heard that the rebel was crossing the ganges with an intention to march to malava and join the sons of mahummud sultan or to make an alliance with the king of the decan  the king swims across the ganges on his elephant accompanied with  00 horse only the king hastened his march and arrived at the ferry of manneckpoor in the evening no boats could be procured and akbar a d      higer     impatient to engage the rebels mounted his elephant and contrary to the advice of all his omrahs took the river which was then very deep and had the good fortune to pass over in safety one hundred horse plunged into the stream and swam after the king akbar in the morning came before the enemies camp with his hundred horse and mudgenu chan and asaph chan joined him immediately with all the garrison of kurrah  he comes before the rebel army the enemy not suspecting that the king would attempt to cross the river without his army had spent the night in festivity and could hardly believe their senses when they heard the royal drums beating the imperial march charges them they at length in the utmost confusion began to form their line but before they were in complete order akbar charged them with great violence baba chan cashkal at the head of the kings light scouts penetrated through the camp of the rebels as far as the tents of chan ziman where he was repulsed by bahadur chan and driven back with precipitation among the kings ranks which occasioned some disorder among the files of mudgenu chan bahadur chan in the mean time turned toward the center where the king commanded in person akbar observing him came down from his elephant and mounting a horse pressed toward him but by this time an arrow having killed bahadur chans horse he was obliged to retreat on foot among his own troops the king immediately commanded his few elephants to advance those animals engaging furiously with those of the enemy killed some of them upon the spot and drove back the rest among their own ranks  the rebels totally overthrown chan ziman encouraging his men still continued the action with great bravery till his horse having received two wounds he was obliged to quit him and while he was mounting another a d      higer     he was trodden to death by an elephant the rebels now fell into confusion distracted for want of orders they turned their face to flight bahadur chan was taken prisoner and carried before the king what evil had i done to you said akbar thus to provoke you to draw the sword of treason against me he ordered that particular care should be taken of bahadur but some of the omrahs as soon as the kings back was turned fearing that his clemency would pardon that consummate rebel prevented it by putting him immediately to the sword akbar though it is highly probable that he would have forgiven bahadur made no inquiries concerning his death the heads of the brothers were sent to punjab and cabul jan alli beg usbeck ear alli mirza beg chushal beg and mier shaw mahummud buduchsi were also taken prisoners and carried by the king to jionpoor where they were trodden to death by elephants this decisive action happened upon the first of zihidge     and is an instance of the daring intrepidity of the renowned akbar  the king settles the eastern provinces and returns to agra the government of kurrah was conferred upon chan chanan and soon after secunder chan who was besieged in the fort of jud fled to gorrickpoor the rebellion of the usbecks being thus quashed and the peace of the eastern provinces restored the king in the month of mohirrim     returned in triumph to agra  section iv the history of the reign of akbar from the year     to the total reduction of the kingdom of guzerat in     a d      higer     akbar marches against rana sing and reduces malava during the rebellion of the usbeck omrahs rana udai singh had taken great advantage of the kings distress this determined akbar without remaining long at agra to march against him the king having arrived before the fort of suisoob the governor evacuated the place and retreated to his master surjun raja of rintimpore akbar left a garrison in suisoob and proceeded to the fort of kakeran on the frontiers of malava the sons of sultan mahummud mirza who had possessed themselves of mindu hearing of the emperors progress were greatly distressed to complete their misfortunes aligh mirza died at that time and his adherents fled with precipitation toward guzerat  the king invests chitor the king left malava under the charge of shab ul dein ahmed shaw neshapuri and marched from kakeran to expel the rana from chitor the rana left eight thousand disciplined rajaputs with a great store of provisions in the fort of chitor which is built on a mountain and retired himself with his family to an inaccessible place the king immediately invested chitor and set five thousand pioneers to work in throwing up trenches and carrying on approaches to the place an accident in carrying on the siege when he had completed two batteries and carried two mines under different bastions he endeavored to spirng them at once but one of them going off before the other blew up one of the bastions and made a d      higer     a practicable breach two thousand men who were prepared to storm advanced immediately upon a supposition that both of the mines had been sprung they divided into two bodies in order to enter at once both breaches one of the parties advancing near the bastion perceived that the mine had not been sprung but before they could retreat it blew up and killed above five hundred of the moguls and about double that number of the enemy who were crowded on the bastion among the latter were fifteen omrahs of distinction the explosion so terrified those who were entering the breach that they retreated in the utmost consternation  the king kills the governor of chitor with his own hand another mine was immediately carried on by the king but as he was one day standing in one of the batteries he perceived jeimal the governor of the place very assiduous in filling up the breaches and giving orders for the defense the king immediately called for a fuzee and took so good an aim that he lodged the ball in jeimals brains and laid him dead on the spot  the spirit of the besieged fell with their chief and in the utmost despair they performed the horrid ceremony of the joar put all their wives and children to the sword and burned their bodies with that of their governor on a prodigious funeral pile chitor stormed the imperial army perceived what was going on by the light of the fire they advanced under the cover of night to the breach which they found abandoned so that they entered the place without opposition it was daylight before a number sufficient to attack the enemy could enter then the king in person led on his men and the unfortunate garrison devoting themselves to death had retired to their temples akbar perceiving that he must lose a great number of his troops in case of a close attack ordered a distant fire to be kept up upon the desperate a d      higer     rajaputs till he had introduced three hundred elephants of war which he immediately ordered to advance to tread them to death  a dreadful slaughter the scene became now too shocking to be described brave men rendered more valiant by despair crowded around the elephants seized them even by the tusks and inflicted upon them unavailing wounds the terrible animals trod the rajaputs like grasshoppers under their feet or winding them in their powerful trunks tossed them aloft into the air or dashed them against the walls and pavements of the garrison which consisted of eight thousand rajaputs and of forty thousand inhabitants thirty thousand were slain and the most of the rest taken prisoners a few escaped in the confusion by tying their own children like captives and driving them through the kings camp they by this means passed undiscovered being taken for some of the followers of the camp  the king returning toward agra is in danger from a tiger the government of the strong fort of chitor was given to asaph chan hirrivi and the king returned toward his capital on the way a tiger happened to be rouzed before him he gave orders that nobody should touch the animal and riding forward himself he began to wound him with arrows the terrible animal stood growling on a rising ground near the king and being enraged by his wounds he ran directly toward the king who stood to receive him with his lance one of his attendants called adil fearing the consequence rushed between akbar and the tiger and d a fortunate blow at the animal but he himself was tossed under his paws and would have in a moment expired had not some others rushed to his assistance and given the tiger a deadly wound which both saved the king and adil from imminent danger  a d      higer     disturbances in guzerat quelled akbar having arrived at agra received advices that ibrahim hussein and mahummud hussein mirza had revolted from chingez chan prince of guzerat and were again returned to malava having commenced hostilities with the siege of ugein the king dispatched killitch chan indijani and chaja yeas ul dien kisvini to expel them upon the approach of this army the husseins raised the siege and retreating precipitately to the nirbudda crossed that river and fled again toward guzerat  akbar invests rintimpore in the month of regib in the year     the king marched from agra with an intention to reduce rintimpore where raja surjan who had bought that strong fort from hujaz chan one of the dependants of selim shaw prepared to defend himself to the last extremity on the   d of ramzan     the king invested the place and having properly reconnoitered it ordered a great battery to be constructed on an adjoining hill called rin he with great difficulty dragged up his heavy artillery to this eminence two of the pieces being capable to receive a stone ball of six or seven maunds or one of iron of thirty maunds the size of these guns might be reckoned incredible did there not remain to this day in india pieces of as extraordinary a bore particularly one at arcot and another at dacca  which he takes by capitulation in a few days a part of the wall and a great number of the houses were laid in ruins and at the end of the month the garrison driven to difficulties solicited to capitulate the conditions proposed by them were to have the liberty of retiring unmolested leaving all their wealth and effects to

shaw hearing about this time that the king meditated an expedition against him fearing the fate of rintimpore and chitor made terms for the delivery of the place which was accordingly put into the hands of the king  upon the  d of mohirrim     the king had another son born to him in the house of shech selim it seems the king had left some of his beautiful mistresses in the house of shech selim to receive the benefit of the prayers of that holy man  whom he called mahummud murad he upon this account made another pilgrimage to ajmere and ordered the town to be fortified with a stone wall who

mirza aziz koka who was jagierdar of that place presented him with a large pishcush the king from thence passed to lahore hussein kulli chan a turkuman governor of that city and province came also out to meet him in the same manner with great presents  he returns to agra on the first of siffer     the sultan left lahore and returned by the way of firosa to ajmere and from thence proceeded to agra secunder chan usbeck who had been lurking about the woods of bengal and committing ravages on the inhabitants was about this time seized by monim chan and sent to the king who according to his usual clemency forgave him  the king esteeming the village of sikri fortunate to him as two sons were born to him there by the means of the prayers of the saints with whom he left his favorite mistresses he ordered the foundation of a city to be laid there which after the conquest of guzerat he called fattepoor the city of victory  the king invades the kingdom of guzerat in the year   0 the kingdom of guzerat being torn to pieces by intestine divisions akbar seized upon that opportunity to declare war against it he therefore marched to ajmere under a pretense of a pilgrimage and from that place detached chan callan before him toward guzerat the king followed at some distance with the main body of the army akbar in his way appointed rai singh to the government of joelpoor the residence of raja maldeo whom on account of some misdemeanor he deposed when the emperor arrived at nagore he received advices of the birth of another son on the  d of jimmad ul awil in the house of the holy shech danial whom he with great propriety called danial a d      higer   0 as it was to the saints prayers no doubt he owed this piece of good fortune one might be tempted to think that as akbar left his wives in charge of the saints of sikri he owed some of his sons to more than the prayers of these holy persons it bring the opinion of the mahommedan doctors as well as of some grave divines among ourselves that prayer is more effectual when the means are used   which submits without a blow the king appearing with his army on the confines of guzerat shere chan fowladi an omrah of distinction who defended the frontiers abandoned his post and fled with precipitation the king took immediate possession of pattan and gave the government of it to seid ahmed chan he from that place moved his standard of victory toward ahmedabad but before he had marched two stages sultan muziffer came to meet him and without a blow surrendered his kingdom into the hands of akbar so that the king entered ahmedabad the capital of guzerat in as peaceable a manner as if he had been entering agra to account for this it may not be improper to say something concerning the state of guzerat at that period  the state of guzerat sultan mamood king of guzerat having sometime before this event died his omrahs particularly seid mubarik actemad chan and amad ul muluck who possessed all the power of the government during the minority of the prince sultan ahmed the son and successor of sultan mamood finding him begin to think for himself were unwilling to part with their power and found means privately to make away with him but to keep up the appearance of loyalty they raised a child of doubtful birth to the throne on whom they imposed the name of sultan muziffer and divided the kingdom among themselves in the following manner ahmedabad cambait and some other provinces were possessed by actemad chan anduka dolukch and some other countries by juil chan the grandson of seid mubarick a d      higer   0 surat biroge birod and japanier by chingez chan the son of amad ul muluck while other omrahs who had influence in the state had the rest of the kingdom partitioned among them the nominal king sultan muziffer was in the mean time cooped up by actemad chan in ahmedabad during this oligarchy the government became very oppressive by continual wars and civil dissentions this made the unhappy people of guzerat turn their eyes toward akbar to relieve them from their petty tyrants who like vultures gnawed the bowels of their country the easy conquest of guzerat was therefore no ways surprising as the nominal king tired of his situation hoped more from the favor of a foreign prince than from his own factious and independent omrahs  akbars transactions in guzerat but to return from this digression the second day after the kings entrance into ahmedabad he was waited upon by the principal omrahs of guzerat who hastened to make their submission but aligh chan and hujaz chan two abyssinian omrahs were ordered into confinement as they gave some evident signs of discontent ibrahim hussein mirza was still at the head of an army in biroge and mahummud hussein mirza at the head of another considerable force near surat the king therefore resolved to reduce them aichtiar ul muluck one of the omrahs of guzerat having broke his parole of honor and fled at this time all the other omrahs were ordered into close confinement when the king arrived at the port of cambait he appointed chan azim mirza aziz governor of ahmedabad  exploits of akbar against ibrahim hussein ibrahim hussein mirza who we have already observed was in biroge hearing of akbars approach and suspecting the fidelity of rustum chan rumi one of his principal officers assassinated him and discovered an inclination to march into a d      higer   0 punjab to raise disturbances in that quarter the king receiving intelligence of this design about midnight left his camp in charge of chaja jehan and calliche chan and with a chosen detachment marched himself that night with all expedition to cut off ibrahims retreat the next day he reached the river mhenderi which runs by the town of sirtal with only forty horse the rest having lagged behind with fatigue the enemy being encamped on the opposite bank of the river and in sight the king thought it prudent to proceed no further till the rest of his detachment should arrive had ibrahim therefore known any thing of the art of war he might have easily taken akbar prisoner but that unenterprizing officer made no attempt of that kind till the king was joined by a fresh detachment which had been ordered some days before to surat and happened to be then encamped at a little distance  he attacks  000 of the enemy with  0 horse this small party consisted only of seventy horse at the head of which there happened to be five principal omrahs seid mamood chan baherra raja buguan dass raja man singh shaw kulli chan myram and raja surjun of rintimpore with these the king without waiting for more troops took the desperate resolution to attack the enemy one thousand of whom commanded by ibrahim hussein waited to receive him while the main body of the army pursued their march it happened very fortunately for akbar that the enemy instead of permitting him to come into the plain opposed him between two hedges where not above six horsemen could fight abreast the king in this narrow pass put himself upon the footing of a private trooper and performed extraordinary seats of personal valor which however avail little to wipe away the folly of this piece of his conduct whom he totally overthrows at last the courage which akbars behavior naturally raised in his followers made them as desperate as a d      higer   0 himself so that after a long engagement with the enemy sword in hand they beat them back and at last totally defeated them with the loss only of one omrah and a few private men  akbar besieges surat ibrahim hussein fled to his army but such was their consternation and opinion of akbars prowess that the greatest part of his forces deserted him which was all the advantage that could be gained by such a victory the king contenting himself with what he had done desisted from the pursuit and waiting till his army came up marched and invested surat in the mean time the omrahs of guzerat collected themselves in the environs of pattan and held a council how to proceed they agreed that ibrahim hussein mirza should prosecute his scheme of raising disturbances in punjab and that mahummud hussein mirza shaw mirza and shere chan fowladi should invest pattan they expected by these means to draw the king from the siege of surat  ibrahim totally defeated by rai sing at nagore ibrahim hussein mirza having arrived at nagore rai sing governor of jodpoor who had pursued him came up with him one day toward the evening at a place where there was no water to be found but what ibrahim possessed this made the troops of rai singh who were in great distress for water call out to attack the enemy this favorable disposition and the necessity of the attempt made rai singh though much inferior to the enemy join battle ibrahims horse being killed and he himself dismounted in the first charge his army imagining that he was actually slain gave ground the enemy took such advantage of their confusion that the whole efforts of ibrahim were not capable to recover the disorder and he was totally routed he fled with great precipitation toward delhi and from thence to simbol  a d      higer   0 the omrahs of guzerat defeated before pattan in the mean time mahummud hussein mirza and the other omrahs carried on the siege of pattan which was defended by seid ahmid chan barhey mirza aziz koka coming to his relief with the army from ahmedabad the omrahs raised the siege went out to meet him and gave him battle aziz koka had at first the disadvantage both his wings being thrown into disorder but his troops continuing steady in the center he at last gained ground and improving the advantage put them to flight toward the decan  akbar takes surat the king in the mean time made a breach in the walls of surat and had raised several mounts from which he battered the city and commanded the streets when he was preparing for a general assault the garrison desired to capitulate their terms were agreed to the city delivered up and the king returned to ahmedabad he distributed all the governments of guzerat among the friends of mirza aziz koka his fosterbrother and on the  d of ziffer in the year     returned by the way of ajmere to agra  section v the history of the reign of akbar from the year     to the reduction of cabul in     ibrahim hussein mirza flies to punjab ibrahim hussein mirza arriving at simbol as we have already mentioned heard that the omrahs of punjab under hussein kulli chan were besieging the castle of nagracot he therefore marched into punjab which he expected to a d      higer     find unguarded and after plundering it he had resolved to join his friends in guzerat by the way of sind  he is expelled out of punjab and totally defeated near tatta hussein kulli chan was therefore under the necessity of raising the siege and marching after ibrahim through all punjab without being able to come up with him till he reached the environs of the city of tatta upon the sind there hussein kulli attacked his camp as he was one day out hunting at some distance from his line of march musaood hussein mirza ibrahims brother who commanded in his absence was obliged therefore to form the line sending in the mean time an express to his brother concerning his situation but before ibrahim arrived his brother was defeated and taken prisoner having lost some thousands of his men in the engagement ibrahim returning from hunting met his routed army and rallying a part of them renewed the combat he was however repulsed with great loss and obliged to fly toward moultan  he is defeated taken and put to death in moultan in moultan the unfortunate ibrahim was again attacked by the billochees wounded taken prisoner and delivered up to muchsuse chan governor of moultan who beheaded him muchsuse chan in conjunction with hussein kulli chan carried his head and all his effects to agra to present them to the king akbar ordered the head to be set up above one of the

mirza aziz koka that aichtiar ul muluck guzerati and mahummud hussein mirza were joined with considerable armies had possessed themselves of several countries in guzerat and had invested him in ahmedabad  a d      higer     the king sets out for guzerat with great expedition as it was now the rainy season and to march a great army impracticable with that expedition which the urgency of the situation of affairs required the king selected two thousand horse and sent them off before him then with three hundred omrahs and officers mounted upon camels he proceeded at the rate of four stages every day each stage is about twenty english miles  and came up with the detachment of horse at pattan where he was joined by a thousand more his whole force then consisted of three thousand horse and three hundred camels with this small army he continued his march with the same expedition to ahmedabad and upon his arrival within four miles of the city ordered the imperial drums to beat his own march which was the first news the enemy had of his approach this struck the soldiers with such a pannic that it was with difficulty their officers could keep them from immediate flight they however formed at length the line while mahummud hussein with a few horse went to the banks of the river to reconnoitre  arrives unexpectedly before the enemy hussein saw at some distance suban kulli who had been sent on the same business by the king he asked him across the river what army that was suban kulli replied that it was the army of the king of kings the other said that is impossible for it is yet but fourteen days since one of my spies saw the king at agra and i perceive no elephants which always attend the emperor suban kulli then told him it is but nine days since the king put his foot in the stirrup and it is well known elephants cannot march at that rate but all the cavalry are come up  comes to battle with them mahummud hussein returned immediately to his camp and sent achtiar ul muluck with five thousand horse to watch the gates of ahmedabad he himself marched with seven thousand a d      higer     horse against the king akbar had by this time reached the banks of the river and discovering the enemy he drew up to receive them expecting every moment to be joined by the troops in the city but they were blocked up by the enemy he then saw that his whole dependence must rest on his own troops to render them more desperate by cutting off all hopes of retreat he crossed the river and drew up before the enemy on the plain mahummud hussein mirza placing himself in the center with his moguls shaw mirza on his right with the afghans and rajaputs and shere chan fowladi on his left with the abassinians and the horse of guzerat advanced to the charge  and totally defeats the enemy the king having also drawn up his small army in three divisions commanded by their several officers he posted himself with his body guard consisting of a hundred horse in the rear of the center the battle now being joined with great fury on both sides the king with his guard wheeled round his right flank and fell furiously on the left flank of the enemy his troops observing their king thus exposing himself in the midst of danger made an uncommon effort of valor and charged the enemy so warmly that they were repulsed with great loss mahummud hussein mirza who was wounded in the action attempting to leap over a hedge with his horse fell from his saddle and was taken prisoner several persons contending about the honor of taking hussein the king asked him who was the man who took him hussein replied nobody the curse of ingratitude overtook me  the king in imminent danger when the kings forces were warm in the pursuit he himself remained on a rising ground with about two hundred horse on a sudden a great body of troops appeared moving toward him he immediately dispatched a person to know who they were a d      higer     he brought back intelligence that they were the forces of achtiar ul muluck who had been left to guard the gates of ahmedabad the troops who were with the king began to be very uneasy at their situation and gave many intimations of their desire of retreating but akbar would by no means desert his post he ordered them instantly to prepare to charge and break through the enemy at the same time commanding the drums to beat up the royal march  he charges  000 of the enemy with  00 horse the enemy hearing the drums made no doubt but the whole army was behind the hill and retreated with great precipitation the king pursued them to some distance to keep up the pannic which had seized them whilst these things happened where the king commanded in person rai singh to revenge some former quarrel basely embrued his hands in the blood of mahummud hussein mirza who had been left in his possession achtiar ul muluck having also fallen from his horse in his flight was killed by one of the kings guards who was pursuing him with great eagerness  chan azim aziz koka finding now that the blockade was withdrawn from the gates came out to meet the king akbar entered ahmedabad the same day and continued chan azim in his government then by the way of ajmere hastened toward agra after having performed a service which though glorious reflects more honor upon his intrepidity than upon his conduct  the a of bengal rebel in the course of the same year daood ben soliman governor of bengal drew his neck from the yoke of obedience monim chan chanan was sent against him who brought him to a treaty after some successful engagements the king dissatified a d      higer     with this peace committed the affairs of bengal to raja jodermul and sent him with orders to expel daood entirely out of his government or to oblige him to pay a certain yearly tribute superior to the small acknowledgement which he had formerly made daood being threatened at the time with a civil war by one lodi who discovered an inclination to usurp the kingdom consented upon jodermuls appearance to pay the tribute demanded he then found means to seize upon lodi whom he put to death he is overthrown daood relieved from that domestic danger broke the treaty with the king and advancing against chan chanan and raja jodermul engaged them at the confluence of the sool gang and sirve where being defeated he lost his fleet of boats and all his baggage chan chanan crossed immediately the river and laid siege to patna  the king sets out for bengal the king informed of these transactions set out from agra in the middle of the rains with as many troops as could be contained in a thousand boats he halted a few days at benaris where he was joined by the forces which marched overland he immediately embarked the whole and fell down to patna and on his way he received the news of the reduction of becker by jesu chan who had been sent against that place akbar having arrived within a few miles of patna heard that isah chan neazi one of the enemies principal generals had marched out of the fort and fought chan chanan but that he was defeated and lost his life so that the place was upon the point of being evacuated the king therefore sent chan alum with three thousand horse to possess himself of the fort of hadgeepoor on the opposite bank of the river and to endeavor to harrass the enemy in their retreat should they be already gone if not to stop them chan alum accordingly took that place by assault and made fat chan the governor and the garrison prisoners daood intimidated a d      higer     by this sent a herald to the king to beg terms of accommodation  the king challenges the suba of bengal to a single combat the king returned him for answer that he granted him his life but that he must trust every thing else to his clemency after making his submission but if he should be obstinate enough to hold out some few days merely to give him trouble he could have no reason to hope for pardon and though said the king i have a thousand in my army as good men as you rather than fatigue my troops with a siege i will put the whole upon the issue of a single combat between you and me and let him take the fort who shall best deserve it who declines and flies daood did not choose to accept the challenge nor even to put him to farther trouble but took boat at the watergate that night and fled down the river soon after all his army evacuated the place the next morning the king pursued them and took four hundred elephants and the greatest part of their baggage he then returned to patna conferred the government of that place and its dependencies upon chan chanan then returned without pursuing his conquest farther to agra  transactions at agra chan azim from guzerat and chan jehan from lahore came to pay their respects to the king and returned afterward to their respective governments akbar at the same time conferred the title of muziffer chan upon chaja muziffer alli and appointed him to command a force

daood  kudgera an afghan chief of great bravery who commanded daoods vanguard attacked the vanguard of chan chanan commanded by chan alum and defeated and killed that omrah the afgan pursued the runaways through the center of their own army which were by that time drawn up in order of battle chan chanan observing the disorder hastened himself with a small body to renew the ranks kudgera attacked him in person and wounded him in several places so that he was obliged to quit the field and he was soon followed by his army the valiant kudgera being killed by an arrow chan chanan rallied his troops and being a little recovered led them back to the charge he found daoods army intent upon the plunder and soon put them to flight taking all their elephants  raja jodermul being detached to pursue the enemy came up with daood on the banks of the chin which he could not cross the rebel finding no means for escaping faced about to defend himself raja jodermul did not choose to provoke daood too far and immediately sent intelligence of what had passed to chan chanan that omrah notwithstanding his wounds which were very bad hasted to that place daood surrendered himself upon terms and was permitted to retain orissa after which chan chanan returned the city of gore which had been the capital of bengal till the time of shere who on account of the badness of the air had made chawasspoor tanda the metropolis was now greatly decayed chan chanan admiring the antiquity and grandeur of that place gave orders to repair the a d      higer     palaces and made it his residence

pilgrimage to mecca after which he returned to buduchshan and found means to reinstate himself in his dominions some omrahs at court who envied the greatness of mirza aziz koka viceroy of guzerat accused him to the king of treasonable intentions they so far prevailed upon him that he recalled him from his government and confined him kokas readiness to comply with the imperial order convinced akbar that he was no ways guilty but that the whole proceeded from the malice of his enemies however shab ul dein ahmed chan neishapuri who was advanced to the government of guzerat had sufficient

in a circle when chan jehan made a home charge upon the center of the enemy which was sustained with great bravery at length however the gale of victory blew on the imperial standards and the enemy were dispersed like leaves before the autumnal wind daood being taken prisoner was according to the barbarous custom of war when the king was not present put to death by the conqueror in cold blood

defeated him and took possession of his pergunnahs but callapar in the mean time with eight thousand horse surrounded him and thought to have obliged him to surrender masoom chan breaking down the wall of the town in which he was shut up rushed out unexpectedly upon the enemy in the action which ensued masoom chans horse was killed by a stroke of the trunk of the elephant callapar immediately rode up and he himself was in the most imminent danger of being crushed to death had he not wounded the elephant with an arrow in the eye which rendered the animal so unruly that he would obey no command he therefore rushed back through the afgan troops carrying off callapar a d      higer     which made his army believe that he fled and they quickly followed him callapar was soon overtaken and slain  masoom after this victory returned and joined muziffer chan who left shabass chan cumbo to blockade the fort of rhotas and marched against raja chander sein from whom he took the fort of

could not gratify the ambition of the conquered king he made his escape to guzerat while akbar was at allahabad and by the assistance of shere chan stirred up a rebellion in that kingdom the king upon the first intelligence of this insurrection sent actemad chan in quality of governor to guzerat and recalled shab ul dien who was suspected of favoring sultan muziffer after the arrival of the new

with the remainder of his army and a large train of artillery toward the borders of adil shaws dominions prince murad and chan chanan laid siege to ahmednagur in the month of ribbi ul sani  00  they employed themselves in carrying on approaches raising mounts erecting batteries and sinking mines while chand bibi defended the place with a manly resolution and wrote to adil shaw for assistance at the end of three months the besieged had carried five mines under the wall and bastions the besiegers destroyed two of the mines by countermines and continued to search for the others  bravery of the garrison the prince upon the first of regib having prepared for the assault set fire to the trains upon which the three charged mines taking effect blew up fifty yards of the wall but when the moguls waited in expectation of blowing up two mines the besieged recovered from their surprise and defended the breach with great bravery the valiant female leader appeared veiled at their head and gave orders with such prudence and spirit that the assailants were beat off in their repeated attempts the heroine stood all night by the workmen and the breach was filled up before day with wood stones earth and dead bodies  the moguls come to a treaty with the besieged in the mean time it was rumoured abroad that joheil chan the chief eunuch of adil shaw was upon his march in conjunction with the forces of nizam ul muluck with an army of seventy thousand horse to raise the siege there being at the a d      higer  00  same time a scarcity of provisions in the mogul camp the prince and chan chanan thought it advisable to enter into treaty with the besieged it was stipulated by chand bibi that the prince should keep possession of berar and that ahmednagur and its dependencies should remain with her in the name of bahader the grandson of burhan shaw  the siege is raised these terms being ratified the prince and chan chanan marched toward berar and repairing the town of shapoor near battapoor took up their cantonments in that place the prince espoused here with great magnificence the daughter of bahader the son of raja alli chan and divided the province of berar among his

in shapoor marched with twenty thousand horse to oppose the enemy on the banks of a river in that country called the gang having stopped for some days to inform himself of the situation and strength of the enemy he forded the river and drew up on the opposite bank on the   th of jimmad ul sani  00  joheil chan who commanded the succors sent by adil shaw taking the chief command drew up before the moguls the troops of nizam ul muluck on the right those of cuttub ul muluck on the left and his own in the center a d      higer  00  he then advanced carrying in his face the insolence of his own prowess mixed with a contempt for the enemy  a drawn battle chan chanan posted himself in the center to receive him raja alli chan and raja ram chund being at the head of a body of herawils in his front to begin the attack the charge was made with such intrepidity on the side of the moguls that they broke through the herawils of the enemy and fell upon joheil chan they were however repulsed by a heavy discharge of artillery small arms and rockets which did great execution particularly among the rajaputs and the troops of chandez who advanced under raja alli chan and raja ram chund both those chiefs were killed with above three thousand of their horse the center being broke the usbecks and moguls on the left wing gave way also and joheil chan remained master of the field on that side but chan chanan who had shifted his post to the right during the action had made an impression there and was pursuing the enemy without knowing what had happened on the left night in the mean time coming on and joheil chan equally ignorant of what had happened on his left thought he had gained a complete victory he however contented himself as it was now dark with keeping possession of the field and permitted his troops to plunder the baggage to secure their plunder half of his army deserted to lodge their spoils in places of security joheil chan with the remainder sat in the dark without knowing whither to proceed  chan chanan in the mean time returning from the pursuit fell in with joheil chans artillery within a small distance of that general and thinking the enemy entirely routed determined to remain there till morning with the few that continued with him for by far the greater part of his army a d      higer  00  thinking themselves defeated had fled full speed to shapoor while things were in this perplexing situation joheil chans troops began to light up fires and flambeaus where they stood having heard that chan chanan was near the mogul general being informed also by his spies that the enemy was in his neighborhood he ordered some pieces of artillery to be loaded and fired among them which threw them into great confusion joheil chan immediately ordered all the fires to be extinguished and shifting his ground sent scouts all round to collect such of his troops as were dispersed over the plain and in the adjacent villages  in the mean time chan chanan blew his trumpets and beat to arms according to his manner which being heard by such of his troops as were dispersed over the field they hastened toward him in small detachments several of the moguls meeting with others of the enemy in the dark they fought and formed such a scene of horror and confusion as is not easy to be described while allah allah resounded from all sides and every eye was fixed upon the east in expectation of the dawn when the day exalted his beams joheil chan was seen marching toward the moguls with twelve thousand horse though the army of chan chanan did not exceed four thousand he determined once more to dispute the field and formed his line to oppose the enemy the battle now joined with redoubled fury on both sides but joheil chan after exhibiting the most daring acts of valor sunk at last under fatigue and wounds and fell from his horse a body of his dependants bore him instantly off his army according to custom followed him and left chan chanar master of a bloody field chan chanan in no condition to pursue the runaways returned to shapoor to join the prince and the rest of his army   higer  00   akbar having about this time received advice of the death of abdulla chan the usbeck who had long threatened an invasion from the north returned in security from lahore to agra having in that city heard of chan chanans victory he sent him a chelat and a fine horse as marks of his particular favor as private animosities had long subsisted between the prince and chan chanan which being much inflamed by the intrigues of mahummud chan now rose to a dangerous height the king therefore thought it imprudent to leave them longer together he dispatched shech eusoph chan mushaddi and shech abul fazil the celebrated historian to the prince chan chanan recalled to court and in the year  00  recalled chan chanan to the presence but though the whole misunderstanding had plainly sprung from the princes froward and jealous dispoposition the

afterward removed to agra and laid by the side of his grandfather humaioon the kings grief for the death of his son instead of extinguishing his desire of conquering the decan only enflamed it the more to divert his mind from sorrow in the mean time the omrahs of nizam ul muluck having gained some slight advantages defeated shere chaja one of the kings omrahs who possessed the country of bear

sultan selim in the mean time the prince danial and chan chanan entered the decan and as bahader the son of raja alli chan was not found like his father firm to his allegiance and had shut himself up in asere they halted upon the banks of the gang near pattan and endeavored to persuade him over to their interest in the mean time the king had reached mindu and dispatched orders to them to proceed to ahmednagur and invest that fort for that he himself would take up asere in his way  chan chanan and prince danial invest ahmednagur the prince and chan chanan accordingly marched with about thirty thousand horse toward ahmednagur abhing chan buchsi and other omrahs of the decan fled from that city and left the moguls to invest the place the king first endeavored to bring over bahader by fair means but he would not listen to terms akbar therefore marched to burhanpoor and sent his omrahs to besiege asere which lay only three crores from that place after the siege had continued a considerable time the air in the place on account of the number of troops which were cooped up in it became very unhealthy this occasioned a pestilence which sweeped the hindoos off in great numbers

affected the king who was in a declining state of health that he every day became worse akbar dies till upon the   th of jemmad ul sani in the year  0   he left that world through which he moved with so much luster after having reigned fiftyone years and some months  his character mahummud akbar was a prince endued with many shining virtues his generosity was great and his clemency without bounds this latter virtue he often carried beyond the bounds of prudence and in many instances past the limits of that justice which he owed to the state but his daring spirit made this noble error seem to proceed from a generous disposition and not from an effeminate weakness of mind  his character as a warrior was rather that of an intrepid partizan than of a great general he exposed his person with unpardonable rashness and often attempted capital points without using that power which at the time he possessed  but fortune and a daring soul supplied the place of conduct in akbar he brought about at once by desperate means what calm caution would take much time to accomplish this circumstance spread the terror of the name of this son of true glory so wide that hindostan ever subject to the convulsions of rebellion became settled and calm in his presence he raised a wall of disciplined valor soldiers against the powers of the north and by his own activity inspired his omrahs with enterprise  he loved glory to excess and thirsted after a reputation for personal valor he encouraged learning with the bounty of kings and delighted in history which is in truth the school of sovereigns as his warm and active disposition prompted him to perform actions worthy of the divine pen of the poet so he was particularly fond of heroic compositions in verse  in short the faults of akbar were virtues carried to extremes and if he sometimes did things beneath the dignity of a great king he never did any thing unworthy of a good man  history of the mogul empire from its decline in

upon his design of giving some time or other to the public a complete history of the reigns of the posterity of timur in india by retailing the very imperfect accounts already published in europe  but as to translate from the persian language is a task of labor and difficulty his engaging further in works of this kind will depend entirely upon the reception the public shall give to his first

greater abilities who may hereafter turn their thoughts to the subject  the transactions of the court of delhi since the invasion of nadir shaw are very little known in the west they have not even in

them this consideration has induced the translator of ferishtas history to throw together the most material events which happened in the empire since the memorable irruption of the persians in the year      he derives his authority for some of the facts from a persian manuscript now in his hands concerning six years of the reign of mahummud shaw and as to the rest he principally follows a short sketch of the affairs of the empire given to him in writing by his intimate friend the rai raian secretary of state to the present mogul  to continue the line of connection between the preceding history and the reign of mahummud shaw who sat upon the throne of delhi when the invasion of nadir shaw happened it may not be improper just to mention the succession of the kings from akbar to that period it is necessary to observe that after consulting the most authentic persian histories the author of this account finds himself obliged to differ from all the european writers who have treated on the subject with regard to the duration of most of the reigns  a d   0  upon the death of akbar his son selim ascended the throne in agra upon thursday the  0th of jemmad ul sani in the  0   year of the higera he upon his accession assumed the title of jehangire and reigned twentytwo years nine months and twenty days with much more reputation and success than could have been expected of so weak a prince his death happened upon sunday the   th of siffer in the  0   year of the higera       sultan kurrum the third son of jehangire mounted the throne at agra upon the  th of jemmad ul sani in the year  0   and under the title of shaw jehan reigned thirtytwo years three months and twenty days he was deposed by his third son the famous aurungzebe who dated the commencement of his reign from the first of ramzan in the  0   of the higera aurungzebe upon his accession took the name of allumgire though shaw jehan was confined during the time his four rebellious sons dara shekoh sultan suja aurungzebe and morad buksh contended for the crown yet as aurungzebe prevailed over his brothers and dated his reign from the year  0   we have included the time of the civil wars in the reign of his father        allumgire having reigned fifty years two months and twentyeight days died in a very advanced age at ahmednagur in the decan upon friday the   th of zicada in the      of the higera    0  mahummud mauzim aurungzebes second son succeeded his father in the throne under the title of bahadar shaw he died after a short reign of four years and eleven months and was succeeded by his eldest son moaz ul dien       moaz ul dien under the title of jehandar shaw reigned eighteen months some writers do not include him in the succession of kings as the succeeding emperor the son of azim ul shaw the second son of bahadar shaw under the name of firrochsere dated his reign from the death of his grandfather       firrochsere according to his own computation reigned six years he was blinded and afterward put to death by the two seids upon the   th of jammad ul sani in the    0 of the higera       raffeih ul dirjat the son of raffeih ul shaw the third son of bahadar shaw was raised to the throne by the ambitious seids and after a nominal reign of three months was put to death by the same faction by whose interest he had obtained the crown  his brother raffeih ul dowlat succeeded him but he died in a few days       mahummud shaw the son of jehan shaw and grandson of bahadar shaw acceded to the throne of delhi in the month of shawal of the year    0 of the higera  mahummud shaw having rid himself of the two seids abdalla chan and hassen chan who had so long tyrannized in the empire raising and deposing kings at pleasure gave himself wholly up to indolence and the enervating pleasures of the haram the distractions before mahummuds accession occasioned principally by the ambition of the seids gave the first mortal wound to the mogul empire under which it has ever since languished most of the omrahs either envying or dreading the power of the seids formed ambitious schemes of independence in their respective provinces which the aparent debility of the regal authority very much favored  cuttulich chan who as nizam ul muluck commanded all the provinces of the decan being sensible of the weakness of mahummud maintained a great standing army under a pretense of keeping the unsubdued hindoo rajas and mahrattor these are they who are known in europe under the disfigured name of marattoes chiefs in awe but the real design of this force was to found an independent kingdom for the nizam in the decan as hassen caco bemeni had done in the reign of tuglick shaw this hassen caco mounted the throne at kilbirga in the decan which city e called from himself hassenabad upon the   th of ribbi ul achir in the    of the higera he assumed the title of sultan alla ul dien   to facilitate his ambitious views the nizam ul muluck began to extend his power in the decan by the reduction of the neighboring rajas though the revenues of his government must have been very considerably increased by these conquests he remitted none to the delhi and at the same time to weaken the empire he encouraged or at least permitted the mahrattors to make hostile incursions into the interior provinces these irregular marauders ravaged the kingdoms of malava narvar biana and ajmere in such a manner that no revenues could be paid by the unfortunate inhabitants  the weak mahummud instead of checking this insolence by the sword disgraced the dignity of the house of timur by submitting to become in a manner tributary to these despicable banditti he agreed to pay them the chout or fourth part of the revenues of those provinces which had been subject to their depredations from this pusillanimous conduct of mahummud we may date the irretrievable decline of the mogul empire that opinion which supports government in every country was now destroyed in india and each petty chieftain began to start into a prince as he had nothing to fear from a government which had betrayed such evident symptoms of timidity  chan dowran sumsam ul dowla was at this time amir ul omrah or captain general of the empire as the offices of paymastergeneral and commander in chief of the troops are injudiciously joined in one person in hindostan chan dowran had such an influence in the state that he engrossed to himself all the ministerial power he left in short nothing but their names in the government to the king and his vizier kimmir ul dien chan  chan dowran was sly artful insinuating of an active and intriguing disposition in appearance assuming no authority when at the same time he directed every thing he executed in public as by the kings orders whatever he himself had resolved upon in private as the indolent mahummud was even averse to the trouble of thinking the suggestions of this artful omrah who was full of plausibility and prompt to execute whatever he advised were always grateful to the royal ear the captain general though personally brave permitted his masters authority to be daily insulted by despicable enemies he foresaw that to take the field without the king would probably put an end to his influence over him for he knew that the disposition of mahummud was sickle and inconstant and apt to be swayed to any thing by every artful person near him  dowran made many unsuccessful attempts to persuade mahummud to accompany him to the field the dissolute monarch was not to be removed from the luxurious indolence of the palace the mahrattors in the mean time continued their inroads they ravaged the province of guzerat and raised the chout as far as the indus they returned back from that river by the way of ajmere and biana and spread their devastations to the very gates of agra  the captain general though much against his inclination found himself obliged to march against these plunderers but instead of chastising them he ingloriously promised to pay them the chout upon condition they should immediately evacuate the provinces  the barbarians gaining courage by this submission and trusting very little to promises extorted by fear from dowran crossed the jumna near calpee with a design to plunder the province of oud sadit chan who then possessed that subaship opposed them between the rivers in the district of korah and gave them a total defeat they fled to feridabad near delhi whither they were closely pursued by sadit who had on his way joined the imperial army under dowran  before the united armies under dowran and sadit came up the mahrattors made an attempt to plunder delhi they were opposed without the walls by two imperial omrahs hassen chan and amir chan the former of whom was killed in the action the mahrattors had now possessed themselves of the suburbs when kimmir the vizier coming up with an army put them to flight but notwithstanding these repeated defeats the mahrattors found means to retreat with a great booty to the decan  the king and his ministers finding that the nizam of the decan favored the incursions of the mahrattors devised many schemes to inveigle him to court that they might deprive him either of his life or government the crafty nizam penetrating into their designs conceived an implacable resentment against chan dowran who he knew was at the bottom of the whole affair but as the empire notwithstanding its growing imbecility was still sufficiently strong to reduce the nizam had he broke forth in open rebellion he thought it most prudent to obey the royal command he however previously strengthened his interest at court by a coalition with many great omrahs who were disgusted with the insolence of dowran  cuttulich chan having taken a step so necessary for his own safety set out for court leaving his son ghazi ul dien in the government of the decan he arrived at agra with a retinue or rather an army of  0000 men and as he held the office of vakeel muttuluch for the nature of this office see the preface  he expected to command chan dowran and to draw all the reins of government into his own hands  sadit chan suba of oud pluming himself upon his success against the mahrattors aspired to the ministerial power the king continued to favor dowran and to support him against the nizam for however weak mahummud was he could not but see through that ambitious governors designs by his behavior for some years back but as the nizam had upon the spot a force to protect his person and a strong party at court and as his son a man of great parts commanded all the provinces of the decan the king was assured that to deprive cuttulich chan of his government would occasion a revolt which in its consequences might prove fatal to the royal house of timur  in the mean time sadit chan finding that he could not effect any thing against the united interests of the nizam and vizier who had joined factions was easily brought over to their party the terms of this coalition were that when the nizam and vizier should force themselves into the management of the affairs of government sadit chan should be appointed buckshi paymastergeneral of the forces  with the title of amir ul omrah which dowran at that time possessed  the accession of sadit and his party did not render the faction of the nizam and vizier sufficiently strong to turn dowran from his high employ he had absolute possession of the royal ear and the army who depended upon him for their pay remained firm to his interest the faction of the malcontents was reduced to despair and nizam ul muluck to gratify his resentment against dowran concerted with sadit a plan which gave the last stroke to the tottering authority of the crown  the famous nadir shaw king of persia was at this juncture in the province of candahar the disaffected omrahs resolved to invite him to hindostan they foresaw that a persian invasion would occasion confusions and distractions in the empire which must facilitate their own schemes of independence in their respective governments it must at any rate ruin chan dowran which was a very capital object to men possessed of such inveterate animosities against that minister  whether the nizam did not even extend his views to the empire itself admits of some doubt many sensible men in india think that he did and affirm that his opinion was that nadir shaw would depose mahummud and to secure his conquest extirpate the family of timur he argued with himself that as it was not probable that the persian would fix his residence in hindostan he hoped for his services to secure to himself the viceroyship a d      of that empire and that afterward time and circumstances would point out the line of his future proceedings  full of these ambitious projects and at the same time to avenge himself of his political enemy the nizam in conjunction with sadit wrote to nadir shaw that monarch received their letters at candahar and in an answer to them pointed out many difficulties which he had to surmount in the proposed invasion he represented to them that it would be extremely difficult to penetrate even into cabul and peshawir which provinces nasir chan had governed for twenty years with great reputation and kept in pay a formidable army of moguls and afgans that should he even force his way through the government of nasir there were five great rivers to cross in punjab where zekirriah chan subadar of lahore would certainly oppose him and that even should he get over those obstacles the imperial army still remained to be defeated  nizam ul muluck and his colleague in treason endeavored to remove the kings objections by assuring him that they would bring over the governors of the frontier provinces to their faction and that as they themselves commanded one half of the imperial army little danger was to be dreaded from the other nadir shaw began his march from candahar with a great army march about the vernal equinox of the      of the higera he took the rout of ghizni and the governor of that city came out with presents and submitted himself and the province to the king agreeing to pay the usual revenues to persia nadir shaw continued his march from ghizni to cabul which city he immediately invested shirza chan an omra of seventy years of age was at this time governor of cabul being summoned a d      he refused to surrender and made the proper dispositions for an obstinate defense  the king of persia finding that neither fair promises nor threats could induce shirza to open the gates of cabul assaulted the place for six days together in this desperate manner many of the bravest soldiers who suffer most upon these occasions fell without making any impression on the besieged upon the seventh day nadir shaw found means to bring over to his party nasir chan governor of the province of cabul the son of that nasir who was for twenty years subadar of peshawir that traitor with the provincial army presented himself at that gate of the city which was opposite to the side of the attack and sent a letter to the gallant shirza he requested immediate admittance to the place to prevent his being cut off by the enemy insinuating that his forces when joined with the garrison would be a match for the persians in the field  the unfortunate shirza not suspecting the treachery of the young omrah consented to receive within the walls the women and baggage of the provincial army but insisted that the troops should encamp before the gate till they should consult together what was best to be done upon this urgent occasion  the women and baggage were accordingly admitted with a proper guard and shirza with a few attendants went out to have an interview with nasir no sooner was shirza out of the city than the king of persia began a general assault while one abdul rahim an officer of the traitor nasir seized upon shirza and confined him  a d      the two sons of shirza ignorant of their fathers fate in the mean time defended the gates with great firmness and resolution till one of them was killed by that part of nasirs army that had been admitted into the city the remaining brother in this desperate situation knew not which enemy he ought to oppose while the garrison struck with terror and confusion deserted their posts upon the wall nadir shaw took advantage of this panick forced open the gates took the place massacred many of the inhabitants and inhumanly put to death the gallant shirza chan and his son  the king of persia found in the treasury of cabul two crores of roupees and effects to the value of two crores more in these were included four thousand complete suits of armor inlaid with gold four thousand of polished steel four thousand mails for horses and a great quantity of fine tissues and dresses deposited in cabul by shaw jehan nadir shaw remained at cabul seven months before he would attempt to cross the indus he in the mean time kept up a correspondence with the conspirators in delhi and maturely settled his plan of operations he at length put his army in motion and directed his march to pishawir  nasir chan subadar of pishawir had wrote repeatedly to the court of delhi for succors but chan dowran in his answers affected to despise the king of persia and insinuated that it was impossible he could meditate the conquest of hindostan he however promised from time to time that he himself would march with the imperial army and drive the invader back to persia the disaffected omrahs wrote at the same time to nasir to make the best terms he could with nadir a d      shaw for that there was little hopes of his being reinforced with any part of the royal army  nasir chan finding himself neglected by the court after a faint resistance surrendered himself prisoner to the king of persia november  0 upon the  0th of shaban he was soon after taken into favor by that monarch and appointed one of his viziers nadir shaw had by this time crossed the attock or the nilab one of the most considerable of the five branches of the indus he issued out an order to ravage the country to spread the terror of his arms far and wide  daily advices of the approach of the persians came to delhi a general consternation among the people and a distraction in the councils of the government ensued the king and his minister dowran were so weak that either they did not suspect the treachery of the disaffected omrahs or took no measures to prevent their designs new obstacles were daily thrown in the way of the military preparations of dowran till the nizam and his colleagues thought that the procrastination which they had occasioned had sufficiently weakened the imperial cause  december   upon the first of ramzan the vizier the nizam ul muluck and dowran encamped without the city with a great train of artillery and began to levy forces nadir shaw during these transactions crossed the bea and on the first of shawal appeared before lahore zekeriah chan governor of the city and province who was encamped with  000 horse before the walls retreated into the city he the next day marched out and attacked the persians      january a general rout of his army was the consequence and the conquerors were so close to the heels of the runaways that they possessed themselves of the gates  zekeriah a d      waited immediately upon nadir shaw with a nazir of half a lack of roupees was politely received by that monarch and lahore was preserved from being plundered  the king of persia continued his march toward delhi and february    upon the   th of zicada appeared in sight of the imperial army mahummud shaw was encamped upon the plains of karnal so that only the canal which supplied delhi with water divided the armies the moguls had only possessed themselves of that ground about two days before the arrival of nadir shaw and had thrown up entrenchments and redoubts before them mounted with five hundred pieces of artillery the army which the king now commanded in person consisted of   0000 horse exclusive of irregular infantry this unweildy body of militia was composed of all sorts of people collected indiscriminately in the provinces by the omrahs who thought that a sufficient number of men and horses was all that was necessary to form a good army subordination was a thing unknown in the mogul camp the private soldier as well as the omrah acted only by the impulse of his own mind  the persians though not so numerous as the moguls were under some degree of regulation the rank of nadir shaws officers was determined and his own commands were instantly and implicitly obeyed severe to excess he pardoned no neglect or disobedience in his omrahs he has even been known to send an essawil a macebearer to a general at the head of  000 horse with orders to make him halt and receive corporal punishment for a misdemeanor in the front of his own men though this rigor may be thought in europe too tyrannical and repugnant to a military spirit yet in a country where the principles of honor are a d      little known fear is the strongest motive to a strict performance of duty  sadit chan february    upon the   th of zicada having outmarched his baggage joined the imperial army just as he was receiving an honorary dress from mahummud shaw advice came that the herawils of nadir shaw had attacked his baggage sadit chan requested of the king to be permitted to march out against the herawils the whole of this attack was a plan concerted between nadir shaw and the traitor in order to draw the moguls from their entrenchments the king however laid his commands upon sadit to wait until the next morning when by the favor of god he intended to march out with his whole army to give the persians battle  but so little did sadit regard mahummuds orders that as soon as he had quitted the presence he issued out with  0000 horse which he had brought from his government and attacked the enemy a mock engagement now commenced between sadit and a part of the persian army who were ordered to retreat before him he sent repeated messages from the field to the king requesting more troops and that he would drive the enemy back to persia  mahummud justly incensed at the disobedience of sadit would not for some time permit any succors to be sent to him chan dowran at length prevailed with the king to permit him with   000 men to support sadit when chan dowran came up to the field sadit in a feigned attack joined the persians and permitted himself to be taken prisoner his design was to get the start of his partner in treason nizam ul muluck in engaging the persian monarch in his interest   in the mean time the troops of sadit being strangers to the treachery of their commander joined chan dowran and continued the engagement chan dowran was immediately attacked on all sides by the bulk of the persian army he however for some time maintained his ground with great firmness and resolution and was at length unwillingly drawn from the field though he had received a wound which soon after proved mortal by three repeated messages from the king commanding his immediate attendance  mahummud shaw was with good reason apprehensive that nizam ul muluck who was then in the camp was preparing to seize him which made him so anxious for the presence of dowran when the wounded general appeared before the king he told him the situation of affairs and earnestly entreated him to permit him to return to the field with the troops which were under his immediate command as captain general consisting of   000 men together with two hundred pieces of cannon grant my request said he and you shall never see me return but in triumph  the king was now perplexed beyond measure he dreaded the designs of the nizam should dowran be absent and at the same time he durst not permit the traitor to march out of the lines for fear he should join the persians he therefore fell into the common error of weak minds and hesitated in hopes that delay would give birth to a more favorable concurrence of events  he was deceived the happy moment for the preservation of himself and the empire was now upon the wing his troops maintained still their ground under muzziffer the gallant brother of dowran and a reinforcement would turn the scale of victory in their favor  a d      when chan dowran quitted the field the command of those moguls who were engaged devolved upon his brother muzziffer that brave omrah made a violent charge upon the persian army and penetrated to the very door of nadir shaws tent there for want of being supported from the camp muzziffer assil ali chan dowrans son raja gugermull mere mullu eadgar chan and twentyseven officers of distinction covered one small spot of ground with their bodies ten thousand common mogul soldiers were slain in this desperate action which had almost proved fatal to nadir shaw for his whole army were upon the point of giving way several great detachments having fled back forty miles from the field of battle after the engagement the few that remained of the moguls retired within the entrenchments fraser says that only  000 persians were engaged but we have reason to doubt his authority as we derive our account from several persons who were present in the action   chan dowran though wounded had that night an interview with the nizam ul muluck it was agreed that the whole army should next morning march out of the lines and attack the persians in their camp but when the morning came chan dowrans wound which he had received in the arm was so much inflamed that he could not act and therefore the meditated attack was delayed in the evening of the   th a mortification ensued which was then attributed to something applied to the wound by a surgeon bribed by the nizam and many in india still continue in the same belief february    be that as it will chan dowran expired that night amidst the tears of his sovereign who had a great friendship for him  a d      when this brave omrah on whom alone the hopes of mahummud shaw rested was dead nizam ul muluck stood unrivalled in the management of affairs the whole authority devolved upon him and the king became a cipher in the midst of his own camp the traitor finding now the power of the empire in his hands under a certainty of being able to dispose of the king at any time according to his own pleasure set a treaty on foot with nadir shaw for the immediate return of that monarch into persia so little hopes had the persian at this time of conquering the mogul empire that he actually agreed for the pitiful sum of fifty lacks of roupees to evacuate hindostan  sadit chan who we have already observed was in the persian camp hearing of these transactions used all possible means to break off the treaty the regard of nadir shaw to his plighted faith was not proof against the lucrative offers of sadit that omrah promised to pay to the persian two crores of roupees out of his own private fortune upon condition he should reduce the nizam and place himself at the head of the administration  in the mean time the nizam who was now appointed amir ul omrah by mahummud finding that nadir shaw broke the treaty began to talk in a high strain and to make preparations for coming to action with the persians to which the king strenuously urged him but the active spirit of nadir shaw was not idle during these transactions he possessed himself of several strong posts round the indian camp and totally cut off their supplies of provisions the nizam perceiving that he must act with great disadvantage if he should march out of his lines and attack the persians began to renew the treaty and offered more than sadit had done to nadir shaw  a d      february  0 mahummud being informed that these two villains without his communication were making separate bargains about himself and his empire and that he even had not the shadow of authority in his own camp took a sudden resolution to throw himself upon the clemency of nadir shaw a declared enemy said he to the few friends who still adhered to him is by no means to be dreaded so much as secret foes under the specious character of friends having therefore previously acquainted the persian of his intentions he set out in the morning of the  0th in his traveling throne with a small retinue for nadir shaws camp  the king of persia upon the moguls approach sent his son nisir alla mirza to conduct him to the royal tent nadir shaw advanced a few steps from his musnid and embraced mahummud and sitting down placed him upon his left hand the substance of their conversation has been already given to the public by fraser and therefore we shall only observe here that nadir shaw severely reprimanded mahummud for his pusillanimous behavior in paying the chout to the mahrattors and for suffering himself to be invested in his camp in the very center of his dominions without making one single effort to repel the invasion  nadir shaw after this conversation retired to another tent called to him his vizier and consulted with him what was best to be done with mahummud in this critical situation the vizier told him that should he confine the king the nizam who commanded the army would immediately act for himself and as he was an able officer they might meet with great difficulty in reducing him but that should the king be permitted to return to the camp with assurances of friendship and protection a d      a party would join mahummud that would at least be a balance against the influence of the nizam  nadir shaw saw the propriety of what his vizier advised he immediately returned to the royal tent and told mahummud that as hitherto the imperial house of timur had not injured the persians it was far from his intentions to deprive mahummud shaw of his kingdom but said he with a determined look the expense of this expedition must be paid and during the time of collecting the money my fatigued army must refresh themselves in delhi  february    the emperor made little reply to nadir shaws discourse he was however permitted to return to his camp and the persian began to lay schemes to seize the nizam one casim beg was employed in this affair he in nadir shaws name made the nizam many protestations of friendship and obtained a promise that he would visit that monarch in his camp he accordingly upon the   th set out and was immediately upon his arrival in the persian lines seized and together with some great omrahs who attended him confined  february    mahummud shaw looking upon the nizams confinement as a plan laid by the traitor himself in order that he might negotiate matters with the persian with more security determined to pay a second visit to nadir shaw  that monarch had by this time secured most of the mogul omrahs one after another and when mahummud upon the   th arrived in the camp a tent was pitched for him near the royal pavilion the unfortunate mahummud was carried into his tent and left for some time alone a collation was brought him and he ate very heartily without betraying any symptoms of being affected with his unhappy a d      situation nadir shaw was greatly astonished when he heard of mahummuds behavior and exclaimed what kind of man must this be who can with so much indifference give his freedom and empire to the wind but we are told by the wise that greatness of mind consists in two extremes to suffer patiently or to act boldly to despise the world or to exert all the powers of the mind to command it this man has chosen the former but the latter was the choice of nadir shaw  though mahummud was hindered from returning to his own camp he was permitted to have all his domestics about him who amounted to three thousand a thousand kisselbash horse mounted guard upon him but this pretended honor which was conferred upon him was a certain badge of his forlorn condition in the mean time kummir ul dien the vizier surbullind chan nizam ul muluck and all the principal mogul omrahs were kept in the same kind of honorable confinement the persian had now nothing to fear from an army without officers he entered the camp seized upon the ordnance the military chest the jeweloffice the wardrobe and armory  he ordered three months pay to be immediately advanced to his troops and the best of the artillery he sent off to cabul  march  upon the  d of zehidge nadir shaw moved from karnal toward delhi the emperor guarded by ten thousand men marched a few miles in his rear the mogul army were at the same time ordered to march in two irregular columns one on each side of the persians the front of whose column was advanced two miles beyond the other two by continued marches nadir shaw arrived upon the  th in the suburbs of the city he himself at the head of   000 horse entered the city next day  a d      the king of persia finding himself in possession of delhi called nizam ul muluck and sadit chan into his presence and addressed them in the following extraordinary manner are not you both most ungrateful villains to your king and country who after possessing such wealth and dignities called me from my own dominions to ruin them and yourselves but i will scourge you all with my wrath which is the instrument of the vengeance of god having spoke these words he spit upon their beards and turned them with every mark of indignity from his presence  after the traitors were thrust out into the court of the palace the nizam addressed himself to sadit chan and swore by the holy prophet that he would not survive this indignity sadit chan applauded his resolution and swore he would swallow poison upon his return home the nizam did the same and both determined in appearance upon death retired to their respective houses  sadit chan in the mean time sent a trusty spy to bring him intelligence when the nizam should take his draught the nizam being come home appeared in the deepest affliction but having privately intimated his plot to a servant he ordered him to bring him the poison the servant acted his part well he brought him an innocent draught with great reluctance the nizam after some hesitation and having formally said his prayers drank it off in the presence of sadits spy and soon after pretended to fall down dead  the spy hastened back to his master and told him that the nizam had just expired sadit ashamed of being outdone in a point of honor by his fellow in iniquity swallowed a draught of a d      real poison and became the just instrument of punishment to his own villainy the nizam was not ashamed to live though none had greater reason he even prided in that wicked trick by which he had rid himself of his rival and afterward actually enjoyed the intended fruits of all his villainies  the persian in the mean time placed guards upon the gates of delhi with orders to permit no person whatever to pass in or out without his special license these strict injunctions were given to prevent the inhabitants from evacuating the place and from carrying away their wealth he at the same time issued his commands that no person whatsoever should be molested but he demanded twentyfive crores as a contribution for sparing the city  whilst the magistrates were contriving ways and means to raise this enormous sum by laying a tax in proportion to their wealth on individuals famine began to rage in the city as all communication with the country was cut off march  0 upon the  0th nadir shaw ordered the granaries to be opened and sold rice at a certain price this occasioned a prodigious mob in all the public bazars particularly in the shawgunge or royal market a persian kisselbash in this market seeing a man selling pigeons seized by force upon his basket the fellow to whom the pigeons belonged made a hideous outcry and proclaimed aloud that nadir shaw had ordered a general pillage  the mob immediately fell upon the kisselbash who was protected by some of his own countrymen a great tumult arose and some persons bent upon more mischief cried aloud that nadir shaw was dead and that now was the time to drive the persians out of the city the citizens who in general carried a d      arms drew their swords and began to cut to pieces the persians wherever they could be found the report of the death of nadir shaw flew like lightning through every street in delhi and all places were filled with tumult confusion and death it was now dark and the persians who had been straggling through the city returned to the citadel except two thousand who were killed by the mob  about twelve oclock at night the king of persia was informed of these transactions he immediately ordered what men he had with him under arms and putting himself at their head marched out as far as the musgid of roshin ul dowlat he thought it prudent to halt there till daylight should appear he in the mean time sent for the nizam sirbillind chan and kimmir ul dien and threatened to put them to instant death charging them with fomenting these tumults they swore upon the coran that they were innocent and he pardoned them  march    when day began to appear a person from a neighboring terrace sired upon nadir shaw and killed an officer by his side the king was so enraged that though the tumult had by this time totally subsided he ordered the officers of the cavalry to lead their squadrons through the streets and some musketeers to scour the terraces and to commence a general massacre among the unfortunate inhabitants this order was executed with so much rigor that before two oclock in the afternoon above  00000 without distinction of age sex or condition lay dead in their blood though not above one third part of the city was visited by the sword such was the panic terror and confusion of these poor wretches that instead of bravely opposing death the men threw down their arms and with their wives and children submitted themselves like sheep to the slaughter a d      one persian soldier often butchered a whole family without meetings with any resistance the hindoos according to their barbarous custom shut up their wives and daughters and set fire to their apartments and then threw themselves into the flames thousands plunged headlong into wells and were drowned death was seen in every horrid shape and at last seemed rather to be sought after than avoided  the king of persia sat during this dreadful scene in the musgid of roshin ul dowlat none but his slaves durst come near him for his countenance was dark and terrible at length the unfortunate emperor attended by a number of his chief omrahs ventured to approach him with downcast eyes the omrahs who preceded mahummud shaw bowed down their foreheads to the ground nadir shaw sternly asked them what they wanted they cried out with one voice spare the city mahummud said not a word but the tears flowed fast from his eyes the tyrant sheathed his sword and said for the sake of mirza mahummud i forgive  no sooner had he pronounced these words than according to our author the massacre was stopped and so instantaneous was the effect of his orders that in a few minutes every thing was calm in the city he then retired into the citadel and inquired into the original cause of the tumult seid neaz chan the superintendant of the royal market for having been active in this affair was put to death kisrah chan a brave omrah for having defended his house against the persians who came to massacre his family but who had not been concerned in the tumult was beheaded  a d      the tyrants thirst for blood was not yet satisfied he sent detachments daily to plunder the villages near delhi and to put all the inhabitants to the sword six thousand of the inhabitants of mogulpurra were cut off for a very trivial offense he sent a party into the royal market where the tumult first arose and ordered seven hundred persons to be seized indiscriminately and to cut off their noses and ears  when now all disturbances were quelled by the blood of the unfortunate delhians the king of persia had leisure to pillage the city at pleasure he seized upon the public treasure and the regalia of mahummud shaw in the treasury several vaults were discovered in which much wealth lay concealed as well as many valuable effects in the public treasury was found in specie three crores of roupees in the private vaults near two crores more the jewaer channa the jeweloffice was estimated at twentyfive crores including the tucht taoos which alone cost ten the royal wardrobe and armory were valued at five crores six crores were raised in specie by way of contribution upon the city and about eight crores in jewels all which together with horses camels and elephants amount to about fifty crores or sixtytwo millions five hundred thousand pounds of our money  great cruelties were exercised in levying the contributions upon the city under an arbitrary government like that of india individuals find it necessary to conceal their wealth some omrahs therefore who had very little were taxed very high whilst others who were rich came off with a moderate sum many of the former under the supposition that they actually possessed more wealth were after they had given all they were a d      worth in the world tortured to death whilst others to avoid pain shame and poverty put with their own hands an end to their miserable existence  upon the   st of mohirrim the king of persia celebrated the nuptials of his son mirza nasir alli with the daughter of ezidan buksh the son of kaam buksh and grandson of the famous aurungzebe the shaw himself discovered a violent desire to espouse the beautiful daughter of muzisser chan the brother of chan dowran he was slain in the battle at karnal  but he was prevented by one of his wives who had the art to command the furious spirit of nadir shaw which the rest of the world could not control  during all these transactions the gates of the city were kept shut famine began to rage every day more and more but the shaw was deaf to the miseries of mankind the public spirit of tucki a famous actor deserves to be recorded upon this occasion he exhibited a play before nadir shaw with which that monarch was so well pleased that he commanded tucki to ask what he wished should be done for him tucki fell upon his face and said o king command the gates to be opened that the poor may not perish his request was granted and half the city poured out into the country and the place was supplied in a few days with plenty of provisions  the king of persia having now raised all the money he could in delhi reinstated mahummud shaw in the empire upon the third of siffer with great solemnity and pomp he placed the crown upon his head with his own hand and presented him with a rich chelat distributing at the same time forty more among the mogul omrahs he then gave to the emperor some instructions concerning the regulation of his army to which he a d      added some general maxims of government he put him upon his guard against the nizam who he plainly perceived aspired above the rank of a subject had not i said the king of persia foolishly passed my word for his safety the old the nizam was near ninety years of age traitor should not now live to disturb mahummud  every thing being ready upon the  th for nadir shaws return to persia strict orders were issued to his army to carry no slaves away nor any indian women contrary to their inclinations upon pain of immediate death before his departure he obliged mahummud formally to cede to the crown of persia the provinces of cabul peshawir kandahar ghizni moultan and sind or in general all those countries which lie to the northwest of the indus and attoc the whole of the treasure which nadir shaw carried from hindostan amounted by the best computation to eighty millions of our money  when this destructive comet to use the expression of our indian author rolled back from the meridian of delhi he burnt all the towns and villages in his way to lahore and marked his rout with devastation and death but before he disappears behind the mountains of persia says our author continuing the metaphor of the comet it may not be improper to throw some light on the character of this scourge of hindostan nadir shaw together with great strength of body was endued with uncommon force of mind innured to fatigue from his youth struggling with dangers and difficulties he acquired vigor from opposition and a fortitude of soul unknown in a life of ease his ambition was unbounded and undisguised he never fawned for power but demanded it as the property of his superior parts had he been born to a throne he deserved it had he continued a d      a subject his glories would have been less dazzling but more permanent and pure  in a country where patriotism and honor are principles little known fear is the only means to enforce obedience this rendered nadir shaw so cruel and inexorable that often in his rage and the hurry of action he inflicted general punishments for the crimes of a few courage which he possessed in common with the lion was his only virtue and he owed his greatness to the great defects of his mind had his eye melted at human miseries had his soul shuddered at murder had his breast glowed once with benevolence or had his heart revolted at any injustice he might have lived to an old age but he would have died without the name of nadir wonderful   section ii the conclusion of the reign of mahummud shaw the king of persia having evacuated hindostan the nizam began to discover his own ambitious designs his rivals were now all removed some by his villainy and others by favorable accidents without opposition the management of affairs fell into his hands though he engrossed in fact the whole power he delegated the great offices of state to others the name of vizier was retained by kimmir ul dien and that of buckshi or captain general was conferred upon the nizams son ghazi ul dien chan he appointed emir chan subadar of allahabad which so disgusted mahomed chan bunguish to whom that government was promised by the former administration that he left the court without leave and repaired to his jagier at ferochabad  the government of oud being vacant by the death of sadit chan that subaship was conferred upon an omrah called seifdar jung together with the title of burhan ul muluck the nizam having nothing to fear from the subas of the other provinces continued them in their employs notwithstanding the severe blow which the empire had just received no measures were taken to revive the declining power of the crown this was by no means the interest of the nizam who now assumed every thing of the king but the name  mahummud shaw having suffered himself to be divested of his power in his capital it could not be expected that his authority should be much regarded in the provinces the nabobs and rajas throughout the empire paid now little attention to the firmans of the court of delhi each of them entertained ideas of independence and actually possessed a regal authority in their governments  the mahrattors who had for some time back made large strides to establish the ancient hindoo government in india a d    0 in the year      made an incursion into the carnatic with an army of eighty thousand horse under the command of ragojee having forced the passes of the mountains they fell unexpectedly upon do ali nabob of that province in subordination to the nizam who was governorgeneral of the decan the forces of do ali were defeated and he himself together with his son hassin ali fell in the action after having exhibited extraordinary feats of bravery and firmness  sipadar ali the son and chunder saib the soninlaw of do ali had still considerable armies under their command but both having views upon the government of the province instead of opposing the mahrattors committed hostilities upon one another the consequence was that they were obliged to shut themselves up in places of strength the first in velour and the latter in trichinopoly the enemy were by this means permitted to ravage the province at their leisure and to raise heavy contributions upon the inhabitants  sipadar ali finding he could effect nothing in the field against the mahrattors set a negotiation on foot with them by the means of his fathers minister who had been taken prisoner in the action by those barbarians it was at last determined in private that upon condition the mahrattors should immediately evacuate the carnatic they should receive one hundred lacks of roupees at stated periods and that as a security for the payment of this sum they should be put in possession of the territory of a d    0 trichinopoly one of the terms was that sipadar alishould be acknowledged nabob of the carnatic  ali having thus strengthened himself with the alliance of the mahrattors his brotherinlaw thought it prudent to pay him homage at arcot not knowing that trichinopoly and those districts which he possessed had been made over to the mahrattors the barbarians in the mean time returned to their own dominions but about six months thereafter they made a second irruption into the carnatic to take possession of the territories which had been privately ceded to them by sipadar ali chunder saib shut himself up in trichinopoly and after sustaining a siege of three months was upon the seventh of mohirrim      obliged to surrender at discretion  these transactions in the decan did not disturb the peace at delhi the king and his ministers continued in a profound lethargy ever since the invasion of nadir shaw and seemed indifferent about the affairs of the distant provinces but a pressing danger at home roused them for a moment a fellow from the low rank of a grasscutter raised himself to the command of a gang of robbers as in the debilitated state of government he committed for some time his depredations with impunity his banditti by degrees swelled to an army of twelve thousand men he immediately assumed the imperial ensigns under the title of daranti shaw this mushroom of a king was however soon destroyed azim alla a gallant omrah was sent against him with an army from delhi he came up with the rebels cut the most of them to pieces and slew daranti in the action this happened in the      of the higera  a d      in the month of regib      sipadar ali nabob of the carnatic was assassinated by his brotherinlaw mortaz ali who immediately acceded to the musnud but a general mutiny arising in the army the murderer was obliged to fly from his capital in a female dress and mahummud chan the son of sipadar was proclaimed suba of the carnatic  the nizam who claimed the sovereignty of the decan seeing these repeated revolutions in the carnatic without his concurrence began to prepare to leave the court of delhi he settled his affairs with the ministry and returned to hydrabad he immediately collected an army and in the month of ramzan      marched toward the carnatic with near threehundred thousand men in the sisser of      the nizam arrived at arcot without opposition and found the country in such anarchy and confusion that no less than twenty petty chiefs had assumed the titles of nabob the nizam made a regulation that whoever should take the name of nabob for the future without permission should be publicly scourged and raised immediately abdulla chan one of his own generals to the subaship of arcot ordering the son of sipadar ali into confinement he at the same time possessed himself of the city of trichonopoly by means of a sum of money which he gave to malhar raw who commanded there on the part of the mahrattors  the nizam without drawing the sword thus settled the affairs of the carnatic he returned in triumph to golcondah whither abdulla chan the new governor of arcot accompanied him abdulla returning toward his government was the first night after his taking leave of the nizam found dead in his bed not without suspicion of poison from anwar ul dien chan who succeeded him in the nabobship of arcot in the year       a d      the nizam in this absolute manner disposed of the provinces of the decan without the concurrence of the court and actually became king of that country though he never assumed that title in the mean time the nizams son ghazi ul dien chan overawed mahummud shaw at delhi and left that indolent prince no more than the mere shadow of royalty  whilst the decan that great limb of the mogul empire was cut off by the nizam aliverdi chan usurped the government of bengal behar and orissa this fellow was once a common soldier who together with his brother hamed came from tartary in quest of service to delhi in that city they continued for some time in the service of the famous chan dowran and afterward became menial servants to suja chan nabob of cattack suja chan after the death of jassier chan succeeded to the government of the three provinces of bengal behar and orissa  the two tartars being possessed of good natural parts and some education rose gradually into office and were greatly favored by the nabob hodjee hamed had in a manner become his prime minister and by his political intrigues in the haram obtained the place of naib or deputy of the province of behar for his brother aliverdi who was then a captain of horse  aliverdi was not long established in his high employ when he began to tamper with the venal ministry of delhi for a separate commission for the province which he then held of suja chan money which has great influence in every country is all powerful in hindostan aliverdi strengthened his solicitations a d      with a round sum and by the means of chan dowran became independent suba of behar  suja chan dying soon after was succeeded in the subaship of bengal by his son sirfaraz chan we do not mean to insinuate that he had any right of inheritance to his fathers government or that the subadary had been established in his family by any grant of the crown which was contrary to the established laws of the empire but the government was now so weak that the nabobs took upon themselves to bequeath their governments to their sons which were afterward through a fatal necessity generally confirmed to them from delhi  sirfaraz being a man of a haughty and imperious disposition soon lost the affection of all his officers he disgraced hodjee hamed and tarnished the honor of the powerful family of jagga seat hamed however took advantage of the general disaffection to sirfarazs government he formed a conspiracy against the nabob and invited his brother aliverdi to invade bengal aliverdi accordingly marched from patna in the month of ramzan      and entering bengal defeated and killed sirfaraz chan at geriah near muxadabad and without further opposition became suba of the three provinces  the weak emperor instead of chastising the usurper with an army from delhi fell upon an expedient at once disgraceful and impolitic the mahrattors threatened mahummud for the chout which before the persian invasion he had promised to pay them and he gave them a commission to raise it themselves upon the revolted provinces the suu suu in the shanscrita language signifies glorious raja the chief of the mahrattors sent accordingly an army of  0000 horse from a d      his capital of sattara to invade bengal this force under the conduct of boscar pundit ravaged with fire and sword all those districts which lie to the west of the ganges  aliverdi who was a brave soldier defended himself with great resolution but he owed more to his villainy than to his arms having found means to assassinate the leader of the mahrattors he forced them to retreat  when the news of this horrid murder reached the ears of the suu raja he ordered two other armies into bengal one by the way of behar and another by that of cattack the first was commanded by balla raw and the latter by ragojee  aliverdi not being able to cope with this great force in the field had recourse to art he sowed dissension between the two chiefs set a private treaty on foot with balla raw who having received two years chout evacuated the provinces leaving his colleague to make the best terms he could for himself the scale was now turned against the mahrattors ragojee retreated to cattack and with constant incursions and flying parties greatly harrassed the provinces the good fortune of aliverdi at length prevailed and he saw himself independent sovereign of bengal behar and orissa though to quiet the minds of the people he pretended to possess grants from the court which he himself had actually forged  we have been purposely succinct on the manner in which the decan and bengal were dismembered from the empire as the facts are already pretty well known in europe we return now to the affairs of the interior provinces this subject has hitherto been touched by no writer and very few europeans in asia have made any considerable enquiries concerning it  a d      during these transactions nothing happened at delhi but the intrigues and factions of a weak and corrupt administration in the year      ali mahummud a patan of the rohilla tribe zemindar of bangur and awla began to appear in arms ali was a soldier of fortune and a native of the mountains of cabulistan who some years before his rebellion came to delhi with about three hundred followers of his own tribe and was entertained in the service of mahummud shaw being esteemed a gallant officer the command of a small district upon the road between delhi and lahore was conferred upon him where he entertained all vagrants of his own clan who came down in quest of military service from their native mountains in this manner ali expended all the rents of his district and he was hard pressed for the payment of the crowns proportion of his income by the fogedar of muradabad to whom he was accountable  hernind the fogedar despairing to get any part of the revenue from ali mahummud by fair means prepared to use force he raised   000 of his own vassals with a design to expel or chastise the refractory zemindar ali by the assistance of his northern friends who lived upon him defeated the fogedar with great slaughter and thus laid the foundation of the rohilla government now so formidable in hindostan  kimmir ul dien the vizier upon receiving intelligence at delhi of this blow to the regal authority dispatched his own son mere munnu a youth of great bravery with an army of  0000 against the rebels mere munnu crossing the jumna advanced to a place called gurmuchtisher on the banks of the ganges and found that ali mahummud had acquired so much strength since his late victory that he feared the issue of an engagement a negotialion therefore was set on foot and after a d      the armies had lain three months in sight of one another a treaty was concluded the conditions were that ali mahummud should keep possession of the countries formerly comprehended in the government of hirnind upon paying the ancient revenues to the crown and that in the mean time one years payment should be advanced in four months  after this treaty was ratified mere munnu returned to delhi but the appointed time elapsed without any payments on the part of ali mahummud he continued to strengthen himself annexed more districts to his government and ravaged the neighboring countries to subsist his army he in short became formidable enough to rouse the indolent mahummud shaw from his lethargy that monarch took the field with fifty or sixty thousand horse and in the year      crossed the jumna  ali mahummud upon the kings approach retreated across the ganges and shut himself in bangur a place of some strength where the imperial army invested him the rebel for the first two nights made successful sallies and killed many in the camp of mahummud shaw the king however having drawn lines of circumvallation round the fort after a short but bloody siege obliged the garrison to capitulate ali made terms for his own life and he was brought prisoner to delhi where he remained in confinement for six months  the patan chiefs who were always in private enemies to the government of the moguls casting their eyes upon ali mahummud as a very proper person to raise their own interest solicited the emperor for his release the weak monarch granted their request but the patans not yet satisfied obtained for ali mahummud a d      the fogedarship of sirhind  this was such wretched policy in the court of delhi that nothing but downright infatuation folly and the last degree of corruption in the ministry could ever have permitted it to take place the consequence was that ali mahummud collected his dispersed tribe kept possession of sirhind of several districts between the rivers and beyond the ganges without remitting one roupee to court  we have already seen that all the provinces to the northwest of the indus were ceded to nadir shaw when that conqueror was assassinated in persia achmet abdalla a native of herat who had raised himself in his service from the office of chobdar or macebearer to that of chazanchi or treasurer found means with the assistance of his own tribe in the confusion which succeeded the shaws death to carry off three hundred camels loaded with wealth to the mountains of afganistan this treasure enabled abdalla to raise an army and to possess himself by degrees of the districts of the mountains herat part of chorrassan and all the provinces ceded by the crown of hindostan to the king of persia thus abdalla laid the foundation of an empire in those countries which formerly composed the great monarchy of ghizni  achmet abdalla perceiving the declining state of the mogul government in hindostan crossed the attock in the beginning of the year    0 and raising contributions upon his march advanced toward delhi with  0000 horse the poor delhians were struck with universal panic the king himself was sick and there were distractions in the councils of the ministers the pressure of the danger cemented all their differences ahmed shaw the prince royal kimmir ul dien the vizier seid sullabit a d      chan and seifdar jung took the field with  0000 horse and marched to oppose the invader  the imperial army left delhi upon the   th of sisser and advanced to a place called minoura ten crores beyond sirhind abdallas army were here in sight and both afraid of the issue of a battle strongly entrenched themselves in this situation they remained for thirty days sometimes skirmishing and at other times negotiating but ahmed shaw having no money to give abdalla would not retreat  abdalla in the mean time found means to advance some pieces of artillery which bore upon the flank of the imperial army in the evening the vizier being at prayers received a shot in the knee and died that night as he was very much esteemed by the army which in reality he commanded though the prince bore the name it was proposed to ahmed shaw by mere munnu the viziers son to conceal his death lest the troops who depended upon his courage and capacity should be affected by that accident the prince seeing the propriety of this measure called together a few of his principal omrahs and held a council of war it was resolved that the body of the vizier should be mounted upon his own elephant in the howadar supported with pillows and that in the morning by daybreak they should issue out of the camp and engage the enemy  orders were accordingly given that night to the omrahs to hold their troops in readiness and their respective stations appointed to each in the morning before day the imperial army was in motion but abdalla having previous notice of their intentions had prepared to receive them in his camp the young prince ahmed led the attack with uncommon bravery a d      and was gallantly seconded by mere munnu who performed surprising feats of personal valor  the persian defended himself with equal resolution for the space of three hours at length his entrenchments were trodden down by the elephants and the imperial army poured into his camp  an unfortunate circumstance at this instant totally changed the face of affairs issur singh the son of joysingh raja of amere who commanded twenty thousand horse rode up to the viziers elephant for orders and discovered that he was dead issur singh was naturally a coward and only wanted an excuse to hide his head from danger he turned immediately his face from the field and was followed by all his troops the flight of so great a part of the army drew many after them particularly seifdar jung nabob of oud abdalla not only recovered his troops from their confusion but pressed hard upon the imperialists in his turn  mere munnu upon this urgent occasion displayed all the bravery of a young hero together with all the conduct of an old general he formed in a column and encouraging his troops by words and example bent his whole force against abdallas center he at the same time dispatched a messenger to issur singh and seifdar jung assuring them that abdalla was already defeated and if they would return and assist him in the pursuit he would permit none of them ever to repass the indus the stratagem had the desired effect they returned in full gallop to the field and renewed the charge with great bravery  abdalla having almost assured himself of the victory was by this unexpected check thrown into great confusion mere munnu took immediate advantage of the enemys consternation a d      drove them off the field and pursued them five crores beyond their camp the loss was nearly equal on both sides but a complete victory remained to the moguls for which they were entirely indebted to the surprising efforts of mere munnu  a single defeat was not enough to discourage abdalla who was a brave officer he collected his discomfited army disgraced some of his chief omrahs conferred their rank and honors upon others rewarded those who had behaved well and with his sword drawn riding through and through his troops encouraged them again to action the moguls were not a little surprised next morning to see abdalla whom they prepared to pursue with his army drawn up in order of battle before their camp  this uncommon confidence in a defeated enemy threw a damp upon the courage of the conquerors they contented themselves with forming the line and with standing in expectation of the charge  abdalla as the prince had some advantage of ground at the same time declined coming to action and in the evening encamped at a small distance  the second day was spent in skirmishes and a distant cannonade but upon the third to use a persian expression the interval of battle was closed and the shock was very violent though irregular armies of horse make little impression upon a solid body of welldisciplined infantry yet when they engage one another upon equal terms each trusts to the strength of his own arm and the battle is in general extremely bloody this irregular kind of attack it must be allowed requires a greater degree of personal courage where man to man is opposed than to stand wedged in a close battalion where the danger may indeed be as great but not so apparent  a d      the young prince ahmed distinguished himself in a particular manner in this action and mere munnu tenacious of the glory he had already acquired was not to be resisted abdalla after an obstinate resistance was again driven off the field and pursued across the suttuluz here abdalla in spite of his misfortunes like an able and gallant commander put the best face upon his affairs he had lost all his artillery and baggage and being now less incumbered than the imperial army he made a forced march and taking a circuit to the right repassed the river and next day to the astonishment of the prince and mere munnu was heard off eighteen crores in their rear in full march toward delhi  intelligence of abdallas march being received in the capital every thing fell into the utmost confusion and a general panic prevailed ghazi ul dien the nizams son being at court collected what forces he could and marched out of the city to oppose abdalla the enemy hearing of this army in their front would proceed no further his troops with one voice told abdalla that before they advanced toward delhi it was necessary to defeat the imperial army which was behind them he was therefore constrained to march back toward the prince and mere munnu who expected a third battle but abdalla thought it prudent to decline it and by night repassed the moguls and continued his rout to lahore  a change of affairs at the court of delhi happening at this time prevented the prince and mere munnu from pursuing abdalla they encamped on the banks of the suttuluz where ahmed shaw proposed to confer the subaship of lahore upon any of his omrahs who would undertake to recover it from abdalla after this offer had been declined by all of them it a d      was accepted upon these terms by mere munnu who with a division of the army marched toward lahore while ahmed shaw returned with the rest to delhi mahummud shaw had an inviolable friendship for his vizier kimmir ul dien chan in the tottering state of the regal authority all his confidence was reposed in that minister when therefore the news of kimmirs death came to him at delhi he immediately considered his own affairs as desperate he retired to a private apartment and wept bitterly all night in the morning he mounted the throne as usual to give public audience and whilst every flattering courtier was running out in praise of the deceased the emperor seemed much affected he at last exclaimed o cruel fate thus to break the staff of my old age  where now shall i find so faithful a servant  with these words he fell into a fit to which he was sometimes subject and expired sitting upon his throne  the death of mahummud shaw happened upon the  th of ribbi ul sani in the    0 year of the higera after a disastrous reign of thirty years the court endeavored to conceal his death till his son prince ahmed should arrive he accordingly upon the  th day after his fathers decease entered delhi being sent for by express from ghazi ul dien chan who was supposed by the ignorant vulgar who are always ready to ascribe sudden deaths to violence to have made away with mahummud shaw  mahummud shaw was remarkably comely of a stately stature and affable deportment he was no small proficient in the learning of his country and he wrote the arabic and persian languages with the greatest elegance and propriety he was personally brave but the easiness and equality of his temper made his actions appear undecisive and irresolute goodnatured a d      to a fault he forgave in others crimes which his own soul would abhor to commit and thus he permitted his authority to become a victim to an illjudged clemency naturally indolent and diffident of his own abilities his mind perpetually fluctuated from one object to another his passions therefore took no determined course of their own but were easily diverted into any channel by whatever person was near him  the soul of mahummud said a mogul who knew him well was like the waters of a lake easily agitated by any storm but which settle immediately after the winds are laid if his easiness or irresolution in politics led him into many errors he bore with indifference if not with sortitude the misfortunes which were their natural consequence  born in the sunshine of a court brought up in the bosom of luxury confined within the walls of a zennana and in a manner educated among eunuchs as effeminate as those whom they guard we are not to wonder that the princes of the east should degenerate in a few generations if to these obstructions to the exertion of the manly faculties of the soul we add the natural lenity of mahummud a common but unfortunate virtue in the race of timur it ought not to surprise us that in a country like india his reign should be crowded with uncommon misfortunes had his fate placed mahummud in europe where established laws supply the want of parts in a monarch he might have slumbered with reputation upon a throne and left behind him the character of a good though not of a great prince  section iii the history of the reign of ahmed shaw a d      upon the   th of ribbi ul sani in the year    0 of the higera ahmed shaw the son of mahummud mounted the throne of delhi the first act of this reign was the appointment of seifdar jung the irresolute suba of oud to the vizarit this fellow was originally a merchant of persia known there by the name of abul munsur he traveled to india to sell his commodities and was retained there as an accomptant by the famous sadit chan governor of oud he behaved so much to his masters satisfaction in that station that he advanced him to a command in the army and conferred upon him his daughter in marriage his alliance with sadit so much raised his interest at the court of delhi that upon the death of his fatherinlaw he was raised to the subaship of oud though he was a very bad soldier such was the smoothness of his tongue and plausibility of behavior that he passed upon the weak as a man of considerable parts which together with some knowledge in the finances paved his way to the high employ of vizier ghazi ul dien continued bukshi and no other material changes in the administration happened upon the accession of ahmed  the war with abdalla which was now carried on in punjab by mere munnu with various success engrossed the attention of the court of delhi for the greatest part of the imperial army was employed in that service advices in the mean time arrived from the decan of the death of the famous nizam ul muluck in the one hundred and fourth year of his age and a d      that his second son nasir jung acceded to the government it may not perhaps be out of place here to give a short sketch of the character of the nizam who for a long time made so great a figure in india  the nizam though no great warrior was reckoned a consummate politician in a country where low craft and deceit without any principles of honor and integrity obtain the appellation of great parts the dark designs of his mind lay always concealed behind an uncommon plausibility and eloquence of tongue his passions were so much under his command that he was never known to discover any violent emotion even upon the most critical and dangerous occasions but this apathy did not arise from fortitude but from deep dissimulation and designs it was with him an unalterable maxim to use stratagem rather than force and to bring about with private treachery what even could be accomplished with open force he so habituated himself to villainy that the whole current of his soul ran in that channel and it was even doubtful whether he could for a moment divert it to honesty to bring about his most favored designs if the nizam showed any tendency to virtue it was by substituting a lesser wickedness for a greater when fraud and circumvention could accomplish his purpose he never used the dagger or bowl to sum up his character in a few words without shame he was perfidious to all mankind without remorse a traitor to his king and country and without terror a hypocrite in the presence of his god nasir jung the nizams son having rebelled was at the head of a great army the deceitful old man counterfeited sickness so well and wrote such pathetic letters to nasir requesting to see him before he died that the young fellow was taken in the snare visited his father and was imprisoned   a d      when the news of nizam ul mulucks death came to delhi ghazi ul dien who was his eldest son applied to the king for his subaship but nasir jung being possessed of his fathers treasure raised a great army and marched from aurungabad toward delhi not on pretense of war but to pay his respects to the emperor ahmed dreaded nothing more than this ceremonious visit from a man at the head of so great a force he judged that nasir jung under that specious pretext covered a design to extort from him a confirmation of the subadary of the decan he therefore durst not favor the pretensions of ghazi to the provinces of the decan and consequently was reduced to the necessity of confirming nasir jung in his usurpation thus the storm was diverted and the new nizam returned to aurungabad  in the year      caim chan bunguish jagierdar of ferochabad having differed with ali mahummud a neighboring zemindar they both drew out their vassals and dependents and fought about ten crores above ferochabad and caim chan was defeated and slain seifdar jung the vizier being informed of these transactions sent orders to raja nevil roy his deputy in the province of oud to confiscate the estate of caim chan the deputy rigorously executed the viziers orders he seized upon caim chans five sons together with five of his adopted slaves confined and afterward assassinated them at allahabad ahmed chan another son of caim chan remained still alive and in order to revenge the death of his brothers raised the patan tribe of which he was now acknowledged chief and marched against nevil roy who had collected all his forces to oppose him  a d      in the beginning of the year      the two armies met at a place near lucknow called callinuddi the patans were scarcely four thousand strong but the army of the deputy of oud consisted of at least twenty thousand the patan chief inspired by revenge and vigorously supported by his friends attacked in person nevil roy in the very center of his army and slew his enemy with his own hand the army of nevil roy seeing him fall immediately quitted the field their artillery and baggage and soon after almost the whole province of oud fell into the victors hands  when the news of this disaster arrived at delhi seifdar jung the vizier talked in a very high strain and requested of the emperor that he might be permitted to lead an army against ahmed chan the sultan consented but the season being far spent before the army was levied the expedition was deferred till the solstitial rains should be over in the month of mohirrim      the vizier with an army of eighty thousand men marched from delhi and without distinction of age sex or condition put all the patans he could find to the sword ahmed chan was not intimidated by this great force with scarce twelve thousand men he marched from ferochabad and met the imperialists at shuru sahawir near that city  the day happened to be very windy and ahmed improved that circumstance to his own advantage he wheeled to windward and the dust flew in such clouds in the face of the imperial army that they did not discover the motions of ahmed but ascribed the darkness which involved themselves to the effects of a whirlwind common at that season of the year the enemy however like a thunderbolt issued from the bosom of this storm and at once struck the moguls with terror and dismay a d      the patans made such good use of their swords that they soon covered the field with dead and the cowardly seifdar jung without making one effort was the first of his army who fled the jates and rohillas though thus shamefully deserted by their general made head against ahmed chan and found means to carry off the greatest part of the artillery which consisted of twelve hundred pieces of various bores but neither of those tribes returned the guns to the king they carried them to their own forts to strengthen themselves against his authority  this overthrow was a dreadful stroke to the tottering empire the greatest part of the province of oud was lost the jates a numerous tribe of hindoos who possessed a large territory near agra and the rohillas a patan nation who inhabited the greatest part of the country between delhi and lucknow seeing the whole imperial force baffled by a petty chief began to throw off their allegiance seifdar jung in the mean time arrived with a small part of his army at delhi and ghazi chan advised the king to put him to death for the disgrace which he had drawn upon his arms this punishment would not have been too severe for the viziers bad behavior but that minister had strengthened his interest by a coalition with juneid chan the chief eunuch  the queen mother begum kudsia being a woman of gallantry had for want of a better lover fixed her affection upon the chief eunuch she had the address to direct the weak monarch in every thing and to keep him in leadingstrings upon the throne juneid chan though in no public employ by means of kudsias favor held the helm of government and by his influence not only saved the viziers life but continued him in his office  a d    0 in the course of the same year a treaty was concluded with the mahrattors who were spreading their devastations over the southern provinces the chout was stipulated to be regularly paid by the empire to those troublesome barbarians ahmed shaw ordered an army to be levied to recover the province of oud and it was soon completed by the accession of forty thousand mahrattors who inlifted themselves in the imperial service but instead of putting himself at the head of his forces the weak emperor by the advice of his mother and her gallant gave the command of it to his vizier that he might have an opportunity to retrieve his lost honor  raja sourage mull prince of the jates by the acquisition of the mahrattors to the imperial army judged it prudent once more to join the vizier with all his forces so that the ministers army now consisted of no less than one hundred thousand men seifdar jung marched from delhi in the year      against ahmed chan but the raja of the jates instead of aiding him found means to frustrate all his designs having spent a whole campaign without coming to action he patched up a very dishonorable peace and returned to delhi with the mahrattor mercenaries at his heels mutinous for want of their pay  the demand of the mahrattors amounted to fifty lacks of roupees which the government was in no condition to pay and the sum gradually increased with the delay ghazi ul dien who had been for some time soliciting for a royal commission for the subaship of the decan promised to pay off the mahrattor debt upon condition he should receive from the emperor that appointment ahmed shaw was glad upon any terms to pet rid of those clamorous and dangerous mercenaries and accordingly issued out the imperial sunnuds to ghazi that omrah having a d      satisfied the mahrattors in their demands upon ahmed engaged them immediately in his own service and having added to them a great army of either troops obtained his own office of buckshi for his son ghazi a youth of fifteen years of age and marched toward the decan  the elder ghazis brother nasir jung suba of the decan and his son muziffer who had succeeded him in the government were both dead sillabut jung the third son of the old nizam now sat upon the musnud which ghazi claimed by the right of primogeniture in the month of zehidge      he with an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men arrived in the environs of aurungabad the forces of his brother sillabut jung the reigning suba were somewhat inferior in number but they were strengthened by a body of french mercenaries which in all probability would insure to him the victory sillabut jung however was afraid of the issue of a general battle and after some slight skirmishes he found means to prevail with his uncles wife to take off his competitor with poison thus did the perfidious sillabut jung secure to himself the empire of the decan without a rival  but to return to the transactions of the court of delhi seifdar jung the vizier finding that his own influence declined and that juneid chan the favorite eunuch carried all before him invited him to an entertainment and contrary to the laws of hospitality and altogether forgetful that he owed to juneid his own life and fortune assassinated him by the hands of ishmaiel chan one of his adopted slaves ahmed shaw being informed of this presumptuous villainy flew into a violent rage degraded seifdar jung from the vizarit and banished him the court this was the effect of a sit of passion for the unfortunate king was a d      in no condition in fact to exert so far his authority the perfidious vizier finding that he had nothing to hope from submission broke out into open rebellion he soon after by the assistance of the jates advanced to delhi and besieged ahmed shaw and young ghazi the buckshi in that city  the son of kimmir ul dien who in the reign of mahummud held so long the vizarit was raised under the title of chan chanan to the vacant employ of seifdar jung and began to show some abilities in his new office young ghazi who was a youth of extraordinary parts defended the city with great resolution for three months the rebels were at last so dispirited that ghazi ventured to attack them in the field and gained a complete victory seifdar jung fled toward his former subaship of oud and left his allies the jates under raja sourage mull to extricate themselves from the perilous situation to which he had brought them  the rebellion of seifdar happened in the year      the jates being deserted by him were in no condition to keep the field against ghazi they fled before the imperial army under akebut chan to their own territories near agra that general invested the strong fortress of billemgur which he took by capitulation but so little did he regard his plighted faith to the garrison that he put them all to the sword the jates in the mean time came before the imperial army but diffident of their own strength in the field they separated their forces and shut themselves up in their forts the imperial general also divided his army into detachments and laid at once siege to the two strong forts of dieg and combere lying in the territory between agra and delhi  a d      ghazi ul dien in the mean time to carry on more effectually the war against the jates obtained permission from the emperor to call in forty thousand mahrattors under their two chiefs jeiapa malhar raw and raganut raw by this acquisition of strength the imperialists were enabled to carry on the sieges with vigor at delhi young ghazi and the new vizier contended for the command of the army this contest was afterward fatal in its consequences but for the present ghazi ul dien prevailed he marched with a reinforcement from delhi and upon his arrival in the country of the jates took the command of the imperial army  the sieges continued two months after the arrival of ghazi and the garrisons were reduced to the last extremities the imperialists in the mean time had expended all their ammunition and ghazi was upon that account obliged to dispatch akebut mahmood to delhi with a good force to bring him the necessary stores the vizier seeing that the strong holds of the jates must soon fall into the hands of ghazi should he be supplied with ammunition and being extremely jealous of any thing that might throw honor upon his rival poisoned the mind of the weak king against his buckshi by means of forged letters and villainous insinuations that the young omrah aspired to the throne the enterprizing genius and great abilities of ghazi gave some color to suspicions of that kind and the unfortunate ahmed instead of promoting his own cause against the jates took every measure to prevent the success of ghazi  the king accordingly begun to levy forces in delhi and wrote a letter to raja sourage mull the chief of the jates to make an obstinate defense and that he himself would soon relieve him that under pretense of joining the army under ghazi he would ad      attack that general in the rear and at the same time display a signal to the raja to sally from the fort of combere  thus the king as if infatuated by his evil genius planned his own ruin his letter fell into the hands of ghazi whose friends at court had informed him of the intrigues of the vizier struck with the kings ingratitude and urged on by selfdefence he immediately resolved upon open hostility he raised the sieges and crossed the jumna to oppose ahmed shaw and his vizier who were marching down between the rivers  the king hearing of ghazis approach halted at secundra and endeavored by fair promises to bring back that omrah to his duty ghazi in answer to the kings message returned to him his own letter to raja sourage mull he wrote him at the same time that he could place no confidence in a man who plotted against his life for no crime if to serve the state was not one what mercy continued ghazi can i expect from ahmed in the days of rebellion when he treated me as a traitor in the days of loyalty and friendship a prince that is weak enough to listen to the base insinuations of every sycophant is unworthy to rule over brave men who by the laws of god and nature are justified to use the power which providence has placed in their hands to protect themselves from injustice  the king perceived by the strain of this letter that ghazi was resolved to push him to the last extremity he however durst not engage him in the field he made the best of his way to delhi and was so closely pursued by ghazi that that omrah possessed himself of one of the gates upon which ahmed shaw and the vizier shut themselves up with a small party in the citadel ghazi immediately invested the place and the a d      king after a faint resistance surrendered himself ghazi after reproaching him for his intentions against his life committed him and the vizier to the charge of akebut mahmood the unfortunate sultan was deprived of sight the next day by the means of an hot iron it is said by some that this was done by akebut mahmood without orders to show his zeal for the service of his patron but from the general character of ghazi we have no reason to doubt his being concerned in this crime  thus ended the reign of the unfortunate ahmed shaw a prince who in his first exploits appeared with some luster when he mounted the throne as if action degraded royalty he altogether gave himself up to indolence to save the trouble of thinking he became the dupe of every specious flatterer and at last fell the unlamented victim of his own folly he possessed all the clemency of the house of timur but that virtue was now in some measure a vice in a country so corrupt and in an age so degenerate though ahmed was not defective in personal courage he may truly be said to be a coward in mind dangers appeared formidable to him through a troubled imagination which upon trial he had fortitude to surmount  he sat upon the throne of delhi seven lunar years and one month and was deposed in the month of jemmad ul awil in the      of the higera  the power and extent of the empire were very much diminished in the reign of ahmed shaw all the provinces except those between the frontiers of the jates a few miles to the east of delhi and lahore to the west were in fact dismembered from the government of the house of timur though they paid a nominal allegiance the rich kingdom of guzerat was divided between the mahrattors and a patan tribe called babbe the a d      decan was usurped by the nizam ul mulucks family bengal behar and orissa by aliverdi chan and his successors oud by seifdar jung doab by ahmed chan bunguish allahabad by mahummud kuli and the countries round agra by raja sourage mull the chief of the jates  budaoon and all the provinces to the north of delhi were in the hands of mahummud ali sadulla chan and other chiefs of the rohilla tribe of patans a number of petty rajas started up into independent princes in malava bucht singh seized upon the extensive territory of marwar and madoo singh reigned in the provinces round joinagur and amere  the gallant mere munnu still opposed the torrent of invasion from the north he maintained the war with success against abdalla for the provinces of moultan and punjab and for a short space of time supported the declining empire every petty chief in the mean time by counterfeited grants from delhi laid claim to jagiers and to districts the country was torn to pieces by civil wars and groaned under every species of domestic confusion villainy was practiced in every form all law and religion were trodden under foot the bands of private friendships and connections as well as of society and government were broken and every individual as if amidst a forest of wild beasts could rely upon nothing but the strength of his own arm  section iv the history of the reign of allumgire sani ad      upon the same day that ahmed shaw was deprived of sight ghazi ul dien released from confinement eaz ul dien the son of moaz ul dien and grandson of bahadar shaw the son and successor of the famous aurungzebe this prince was placed by ghazi upon the throne by the name of allumgire to begin his reign with an act of beneficence he ordered seventeen persons of the imperial house of timur to be released from prison to grace his coronation it may not be improper here to say something concerning the inauguration of the mogul emperors  when a prince is for the first time seated upon the throne with the royal umbrella over his head the omrahs according to their dignity are ranged in two lines before one upon his right the other to his left hand a herald then proclaims his titles and the omrahs each in his station advance with an offering in gold which he himself receives from their hands the superintendant of the kitchen brings then a golden salver with bread confections and other eatables over which the king joined by the whole court repeats a form of grace and then he eats a little and distributes the remainder with his own hand among the nobility this latter is an ancient mogul ceremony introduced by the family of timur the emperor mounts then his stateelephant and attended by all the court moves slowly toward the great musgid throwing as he advances gold silver precious stones and pearls among the populace in the musgid he repeats a prayer and afterward divine service is performed by a d      the sidder ul suddur or the metropolitan of delhi the chutba or the genealogy and titles of the king are then read and he returns to the palace with the same magnificence and pomp the mogul emperors are never crowned but upon some festivals they sit in state under a large golden crown which is suspended by a chain to the roof of the presence chamber and serves the purpose of a canopy  allumgire found himself as much a prisoner upon the throne as he was formerly in his confinement he was not a man of parts sufficient to extricate himself from the toils of that power to which he owed his advancement but had he made no efforts to acquire some authority the empire might have been perhaps restored to its original dignity and splendour by the very extraordinary abilities of ghazi ul dien  that omrah now possessed the office of the vizarit allumgire without the capacity of guiding the operations of government himself began to turn all his mean parts to thwart the schemes of the vizier without considering whether the measure was right or wrong it was sufficient that it came from the vizier for the emperor to oppose it by his minions  this aversion in the king to ghazi did not long escape the penetrating eyes of that young omrah he knew that he was surrounded by many enemies and therefore was unwilling to resign an employ from which he derived protection to his own person in the mean time all business was suspended and the two factions like armies afraid of the issue of a battle watched the motions of one another  nothing remarkable happened at delhi during the first year of allumgire but the assassination of the former vizier about six months after his imprisonment by the orders of ghazi ul dien  a d      but in the course of this year the empire received a severe blow on its frontiers by the death of the gallant mere munnu by a fall from his horse he had in many engagements defeated abdalla and recovered from him the whole province of lahore no sooner was this brave omrah dead than abdalla reconquered all he had lost and advancing to lahore confirmed his son then an infant in the government of that place under the direction of an experienced omrah  the great success of abdalla in the northwest began to rouse the court of delhi it was at last resolved that ali gohar the present emperor  allumgires eldest son should in conjunction with ghazi ul dien the vizier march with the imperial army against the persians the treasury was now empty and the few provinces subject to the empire were grievously oppressed for money to raise a force for this expedition  in the beginning of the year      the imperial army consisting of  0000 men under the prince and young ghazi took the field they advanced to a place called matchiwarra about twenty crores beyond sirhind they found abdalla so well established in his new conquests that they thought it prudent to proceed no further the whole campaign passed in settling a treaty of marriage between the vizier and the daughter of mere munnu it seems that omrah to strengthen his interest at the court of delhi had before his death promised his daughter to ghazi but after that event both the young lady and her mother were extremely averse to the match when the imperial army lay at matchiwarra the vizier inveigled both the ladies from lahore to the camp and finding all entreaty was in vain to obtain their consent he with peculiar baseness closely confined them to intimidate them into a compliance this together with oppressing a d      the provinces through which he marched comprehended the whole exploits of ghazi on this expedition after spending all the public money in this vain parade the prince and vizier without striking a blow returned to delhi  the cause of this inaction of the vizier proceeded from advices which he daily received from court the king and his faction gained strength during his absence and he foresaw his own ruin in case he should meet with a defeat from abdalla upon his return to delhi he found it necessary in order to support his declining authority to act with great rigor and tyranny some omrahs he removed with the dagger and others he deprived of their estates he confined the king in the citadel and did whatsoever he pleased as if he himself was vested with the regal dignity  allumgire finding himself in this disagreeable situation adopted a very dangerous plan to extricate himself he wrote privately to abdalla to advance with his army to relieve him from the hands of his treacherous vizier he promised that upon his arrival on the environs of delhi he should be joined by the bulk of the imperial army under the command of nigib ul dowla a rohilla chief to whom ghazi had delegated his own office of buckshi when he rose to the employ of vizier thus the weak allumgire to avoid one evil plunged headlong into greater misfortunes  abdalla having received these assurances from the king marched from cabul where he then kept his court entered hindostan with a great army and in the year      appeared before delhi the vizier marched out with the imperial forces to give him battle but in the field he was deserted by his a d      friend nigib ul dowla with the greatest part of his army the ignorance of ghazi ul dien of a plot so long carried on is a great proof of his extreme unpopularity the consequence was that ghazi was obliged to throw himself upon the clemency of abdalla who had sworn vengeance against him should he ever fall into his hands but such was the address of the vizier that he not only found means to mollify the persian but even to make him his friend he was however at first turned out of his office but he was soon after restored by abdalla himself who now disposed of every thing as if he was absolute king of delhi  abdalla entered the city and laid the unfortunate inhabitants under a contribution of a crore of roupees a sum now more difficult to raise than ten crores in the days of nadir shaw the persian remained two months in delhi the unhappy allumgire not only found that his capital was robbed but that he himself was delivered over again into the hands of a person who had now added resentment to ambition and power  the persian after these transactions took the prince hedad buxsh brother to the present emperor as hostage for allumgires future behavior and having forced mere munnus daughter to solemnize her marriage with ghazi marched toward agra he on his way laid siege to muttra took it by assault and having sacked the place put the inhabitants to the sword for the enormous crime of attempting to defend their lives and property after this scene of barbarity abdalla advanced to agra which was held on the part of the king though the jates had all the country round agra they had not yet possessed themselves of that city by fazil chan this omrah defended the city with such resolution that abdalla a d      after sustaining some loss thought it prudent to raise the siege but being exasperated at this repulse he spread death and devastation through the territories of the jates who unable to cope with him in the field had retired into their strong holds from which they at times issued and cut off his straggling parties  the persian returned to a place called muxadabad about eight crores from delhi allumgire came out to pay his respects to him and by his conduct seems to have been perfectly infatuated when the cries of his distressed people reached heaven that contemptible monarch instead of endeavoring to alleviate their miseries either by force or negotiation was wholly bent on the gratification of a sensual appetite the cause of his visit to abdalla was to obtain his influence and mediation with sahibe zimany the daughter of mahummud shaw whom he wanted to espouse the princess herself being averse to the match when kings instead of exerting their talents for the protection of their people suffer themselves to be absorbed in indolence and sensuality rebellion becomes patriotism and treason itself is a virtue  in the mean time the news of some incursions from the western persia into the territories of abdalla recalled that prince from india malleke jehan the widow of mahummud shaw and her daughter sahibe zimany claimed his protection against allumgire he carried them both to cabul and some time after espoused the daughter himself  the persian having evacuated the imperial provinces the vizier became more cruel and oppressive than ever he extorted money from the poor by tortures and confiscated the estates of the nobility upon false or very frivolous pretenses to these tyrannies he was no less driven by the necessity of supporting an army to enforce his authority than he was by the natural avidity and cruelty of his own unprincipled mind  a d      the king and his eldest son ali gohar were in the mean time kept state prisoners the latter made his escape in the year      and levying six thousand men at rowari began to raise the revenues of the adjacent territories after he had continued this vagrant kind of life for nine months the vizier by the means of insidious letters in which ittul raw chief of the mahrattors raja dewali singh raja nagor mull and many other omrahs swore to protect him inveigled him to delhi but in violation of all oaths and fair promises he was instantly confined by ghazi in the house of alla murda chan where he remained for the space of two months  the vizier having received intelligence that the prince was privately attaching some omrahs to his interest and fearing that by their means he might again make his escape determined to remove him to the citadel he ordered a detachment of five hundred horse to execute this service the prince not only refused to comply with the viziers orders for his removal but ordered the gates of the house to be shut and with a few friends betook himself to arms the houses of the nobility in hindostan are surrounded by strong walls and in fact are a kind of small forts the viziers troops found it therefore extremely difficult to reduce the prince he was besieged closely for two days and finding that he could not defend himself much longer from the thousands that surrounded the house he formed the gallant resolution to cut his way through the enemy  he imparted his intentions to his friends but they shrunk from his proposal as impracticable at last six of them seeing him resolved to attempt this desperate undertaking alone promised to accompany him on the morning of the third day a d      they mounted their horses within the court the gate was suddenly thrown open and they issued forth sword in hand with the prince at their head he cut his way through thousands of ghazis troops with only the loss of one of his gallant followers raja ramnat and seid ali were the two principal men concerned in this extraordinary exploit the other four being common horsemen seid ali was wounded but four and the prince escaped without any hurt  the prince having thus forced his way through the viziers army issued out of the city and arrived at a place called vizierabad about six crores from the suburbs ittul raw the mahrattor chief lay encamped with ten thousand horse at vizierabad ittul had been hired as a mercenary by the vizier to support him in his tyrannical proceedings but resenting ghazis breach of promise to the prince and not being regularly paid he now thought of plundering the country under the sanction of ali gohars name he received him therefore with very great respect and promised to support him  the prince and ittul raw accordingly continued for the space of six months to raise contributions on the provinces to the south of delhi but as the petty chiefs of villages had during the confusions of the empire constructed mud forts whither they retired with their families and effects at the approach of danger the mahrattors found great difficulty in supporting themselves as none of those forts could be reduced without a regular siege in which they were very little skilled ittul raw tired of this kind of unprofitable war proposed to the prince to retire to gualier where the mahrattors had now established a government promising to give him a tract of country for his maintenance a d      ali gohar thanked the mahrattor for his generous proposal but declined to accept of it  his eyes were now turned to another quarter nigib ul dowla who had at the kings request betrayed ghazi ul dien to abdalla was upon the reinstatement of the vizier in his office obliged to fly to his jagier of secundra between the rivers about forty crores below delhi the prince looked upon him as the most proper person to conduct his affairs he accordingly took leave of ittul raw crossed the jumna arrived at secundra and was received with great respect by nigib ul dowla who however did not think proper to join heartily in his cause  to return to the transactions at delhi ahmet abdalla had no sooner settled his affairs than he prepared for another expedition into hindostan he resolved to support his army with the plunder of that country and to keep them in action there for other enterprises more arduous he accordingly marched from candahar and in the month of ribbi ul awil      arrived in the environs of delhi the unhappy allumgire applied to him for relief and if possible exaggerated his own misfortunes and the unheard of villainies of his vizier he at the same time by his emissaries stirred up factions in the army of ghazi who had marched out of the city to give battle to abdalla the discerning mind of that minister soon penetrated into the kings machinations against him he did not for a moment hesitate what to do his hands had already been imbrued in blood and he started not at murder he resolved to take off the king and then to let future events direct his line of action  ad    0 though the king was in some measure a prisoner he was permitted to keep his guards and a great retinue of servants they pitied his misfortunes and became firmly attached to his interest abdalla who was near with his army seemed to give some encouragement to allumgire and that princes party acquired strength every day the vizier saw himself hemmed in upon all sides by enemies he therefore thought it high time to assassinate his master  he knew the weakness and superstition of the mind of allumgire he therefore trumped up a story concerning a fakier who prophesied and wrought miracles at the kottulah of ferose shaw the poor enthusiastic king just as ghazi expected expressed a great desire to see the holy fakier as it would derogate from the reputation of the pretended saint to pay a visit even to a king allumgire resolved to confer upon him that piece of respect  but he had no sooner entered the apartment where the holy impostor sat than two assassins started from behind a curtain cut off his head with a scimiter and threw his body out of a back window upon the sands of the jumna it lay there two days without interment none daring to pay the last office to the remains of their unfortunate king this tragedy was acted at delhi in the month of ribbi ul sani       such was the end of allumgire who in an age of peace and tranquillity might have lived with some reputation and have died with the character of a saint but the times required uncommon abilities in a king and the most vigorous exertion of the manly faculties of the soul neither of which that unhappy monarch in any degree possessed his struggles therefore against the ambition of ghazi were puerile and impotent had he employed the assassin against the breast of that treacherous minister justice would have warranted the blow had he possessed ad    0 courage to have aimed it with his own hand a thousand opportunities were not wanting what then can be said in favor of a man who durst not make one manly effort for his authority or resent indignities which he daily received in person  the perfidious vizier ordered the body of the king after lying two days exposed on the sand of the jumna to be privately interred he then took another prince of the blood and placed him upon the throne by the name of shaw jehan  section v transactions at the court of delhi from the death of allumgire sani to the present times a d      nigib ul dowla who had some time before the assassination of allumgire made up matters with the vizier had the address to retain the office of buckshi shocked at the villainy of ghazi or desirous to transfer to himself the whole power he again betrayed that minister and went over with all his forces to abdalla ghazi in consequence of this desertion found himself obliged also to make peace with the invader  these factions proved fatal to the unhappy delhians abdalla laid the city under heavy contributions and enforced the collection with such rigor and cruelty that the unfortunate inhabitants driven to despair took up arms the persian ordered a general massacre which without intermission lasted for seven days the relentless durannies the tribe of which abdalla is the chief are distinguished by that name were not even then glutted with slaughter but the stench of the dead bodies drove them out of the city a great part of the buildings were at the same time reduced to ashes and many thousands who had escaped the sword suffered a lingering death by famine sitting upon the smoking ruins of their own houses thus the imperial city of delhi which in the days of its glory extended itself seventeen crores in length and was said to contain two millions of people became almost a heap of rubbish  a d      the miseries of the unfortunate delhians were not yet at an end the mahrattors who now without intermission traversed the empire for plunder advanced to partake of the spoils of delhi with abdalla jincow and malharraw accordingly occupied the environs of the city the persian marched but against them and both armies joined battle at a place called mudgenu tuckia two crores from the depopulated capital the mahrattors were defeated and pursued one hundred and fifty crores from the field but they in the mean time gave abdalla the slip turned his rear and set out in full march for delhi the durannies however were so close to their heels that before they could attempt any thing against the city they were a second time obliged to retreat  in the mean time news arrived that the mahrattor chiefs were advancing with another very numerous army from the decan with a professed design to reestablish the ancient hindoo government bisswass raw baow and ibrahim chan ghardi commanded this force which independent of the army of mahrattors whom abdalla had already defeated consisted of one hundred thousand horse the mahommedans were struck with terror they thought it necessary to join abdalla to support the faith suja ul dowlat who had succeeded his father the infamous seifdar jung in the province of oud ahmed chan bunguish chief of the patans and all the petty chieftains of the rohillas hastened with their forces to delhi  the mahrattors had now entered the territories of the jates and summoned raja sourage mull to join them though sourage mull as a hindoo wished for the extirpation of mahommedism in india he was too jealous of the power of the mahrattors to obey their orders enraged at his obstinacy a d      they carried fire and sword through his dominions compelled him at last to join them with fifty thousand men  the maharattors now consisted of two hundred thousand horse and the mahommedans whom ahmet abdalla commanded in chief of near one hundred and fifty thousand the eyes of all india were now turned toward the event of a war upon which depended whether the supreme power should remain with the mahommedans or revert again to the hindoos upon the approach of the mahrattors abdalla evacuated delhi and having crossed the jumna encamped on the opposite bank  the mahrattors immediately entered the city and filled every quarter of it with devastation and death not content with robbing the miserable remains of abdallas cruelty of every thing they possessed they stripped all the males and females quite naked and wantonly whipped them before them along the streets many now prayed for death as the greatest blessing and thanked the hand which inflicted the wound  famine begun to rage among the unfortunate citizens to such a degree that men fled from their dearest friends as from beasts of prey for fear of being devoured many women devoured their own children while some mothers of more humanity were seen dead in the streets with infants still sucking at their breasts  but let us now draw a veil over this scene of horror  ghazi ul dien found by this time that abdalla was become his enemy and inclined to the interests of nigib ul dowla he therefore endeavored to make up matters with the mahrattors but his proposals were rejected he then turned himself to the raja of the jates who was in the field an unwilling auxiliary to the mahrattors and persuaded him to desert their cause and a d      retire to his own country whither he himself accompanied him thus ended the public transactions of ghazi ul dien who crowded into a few years of early youth more crimes and abilities than other consummate villains have done into a long life of wickedness and treachery though he did not possess the decan the fruits of his grandfathers uncommon crimes he may truly be said to have been the genuine heir of the parts and treasons of that monster of iniquity and villainy  the mahrattors when they entered delhi confined shaw jehan who had borne the title of royalty for a few weeks and to quiet the minds of some mahommedan omrahs who aided them raised to the throne jewan bucht the eldest son of prince ali gohar who had by this time assumed the title of shaw alum in behar but this young prince had he even abilities to reign had now no subjects left to command for he may be considered as the image of a king set up by way of insult in the midst of the ruins of his capital  abdalla being informed of the desertion of the jates was extremely desirous of repassing the jumna and to come to battle with the mahrattors he for this purpose marched up along the bank opposite to the enemy to kungipurra a place of some strength possessed by nizabat chan an independent rohilla chief the persian summoned him to surrender which he refused and the place was consequently taken by assault and the garrison and inhabitants put to the sword  the mahrattors at the same time marched up upon the side of delhi and too confident of their own strength permitted abdalla without opposition to cross the jumna by the ford of ramra but observing him more bold in his motions than they expected they became somewhat afraid and entrenched themselves at a d      karnal in the very same ground which was occupied formerly by mahummud shaw while abdalla chose the more fortunate situation of nadir shaw  both armies lay in their entrenchments for twelve days skirmishing at times with small parties abdalla in the mean time found means to cut off some mahrattor convoys with provisions and by the vigilance and activity of his durannies to prevent all supplies from coming to the enemys camp  as famine began to rage among the mahrattors they were necessitated to march out of their lines upon the  0th of jemmad ul sani      and to offer battle to abdalla which he immediately accepted the first shock was extremely violent the mahrattors advanced with great resolution and charged abdalla sword in hand with such vigor that he was upon the point of being driven off the field when suja ul dowlat well known to the british in india and ahmed chan bunguish the patan chief of doab fell upon the flank of the mahrattors with ten thousand horse  this circumstance immediately turned the scale of victory abdalla recovered from his confusion renewed the charge and drove back the enemy should we credit common report fifty thousand mahrattors fell in this action and in the pursuit but be that as it will the battle was extremely bloody for all the generals of the vanquished excepting malhar raw who fled upon the first charge were slain  abdalla after having pursued the mahrattors for the space of three days returned to delhi he wrote from thence letters to prince ali gohar who had proclaimed himself king in the province of behar under the title of shaw alum requesting him to return to delhi and to take upon him the management of the affairs of government shaw alum was too prudent to a d      trust himself in the hands of abdalla and therefore that prince whose affairs on the side of persia required his presence confirmed jewan bucht the present emperors eldest son upon the throne of delhi under the tuition of nigib ul dowla from whom he exacted an annual tribute abdalla after these transactions returned to cabul  no sooner had abdalla evacuated delhi than the jates commenced hostilities against nigib ul dowla they seized upon camgar chan zemindar of ferochagur and appropriated to themselves his wealth and territory the minister upon this took the field the jates advanced against him with a great army under the conduct of their chief raja sourage mull the jates being much superior to the force of nigib ul dowla became confident of success so that when the armies approached within a few miles of one another near secundra the raja went carelessly out with some of his officers upon a hunting party nigib ul dowla being informed of this circumstance by means of his spies immediately detached a party of five hundred horse under seidu a bold partizan in quest of the raja  seidu fell in with sourage mull whose party consisted of about three hundred they engaged sword in hand with great resolution on both sides but at length the jates were cut off to a man and the rajas head was brought to nigib ul dowla who was then upon his march to attack the enemy the unexpected appearance of nigib in the absence of their prince and best officers struck the jates with universal panic when at that very instant a horseman advancing at full speed threw the rajas head into their line this circumstance completed their confusion so that nigib ul dowla defeated them with ease and pursued them sword in hand some crores from the field of battle  a d      the minister after this victory returned to delhi but he had not long remained in that capital before joahir singh the son and successor of sourage mull hired twenty thousand mahrattors under malhar raw and advanced with all his forces to delhi nigib ul dowla was not capable to cope with the jates and their auxiliaries in the field he shut himself up in the city where he was besieged for three months and at last reduced to great distress however a handsome present to malhar raw saved him upon this critical occasion the jates finding themselves betrayed by their mercenaries were obliged to patch up a peace and retire into their own country these transactions happened in the year      of the higera nigib ul dowla has been since frequently attacked by the jates to the east and the seiks to the west but he still maintains his ground with great resolution and ability  but to return to the adventures of the prince ali gohar who under the title of emperor now reigns in the small province of allahabad we have already observed that he after parting with the mahrattors threw himself upon nigib ul dowla at secundra he could not however prevail upon that omrah to take up arms in his favor he therefore left secundra with a small retinue of servants who lived at their own expense in hopes of better days with their prince with these he arrived at lucknow one of the principal cities of the province of oud where suja ul dowlat kept then his court suja ul dowlat received the king with seeming great respect and paid him royal honors but this was only the false politeness of an indian court which is always less deficient in ceremony than in says it was not the interest of suja ul dowlat who by the villainies of his father the infamous seifdar jung had become an independent prince to revive the power of the empire he therefore declined all connection with the affairs of ali gohar he however made him a nasir of some elephants horses and half a lack of roupees in money and insinuated to him to leave his court  ali gohar in this distressed situation turned toward allahabad mahummud kuli chan at that time possessed that city and province mahummud received the prince with friendship as well as respect for being a man of an enterprizing genius he entertained great hopes of raising himself with the fortunes of the shaw zadda shaw zadda literally signifies the kings son a title by which ali gohar was distinguished during the life of his father allumgire sani  after maturely deliberating upon the plan of their future operations it was resolved that instead of relieving the unfortunate allumgire from the tyranny of ghazi at delhi they should endeavor to possess themselves of the provinces of bengal and behar the revenues of which might enable them to support a sufficient army to restore the power of the empire though the shaw zadda was the undoubted heir of the empire yet to take away every pretense of right from jaffier ali chan whom the british on account of his villainies had raised to the government of bengal he obtained a private grant of the subaships of the three provinces from his father at delhi  every thing being now concerted public orders were issued to the neighboring rajas and sogedars to repair to the standard of the shaw zadda while mahummud kuli chan raised all the troops of allahabad camgar chan one of the principal fogedars of behar pulwan singh raja of budgepoor bulbidder raja of amati and many other both hindoo and mahomedan chiefs obeyed the summons and joined the prince soldiers of fortune in the mean time stocked to him from all quarters so that ali gohar found himself soon at the head of sixty thousand men  in the month of ribbi ul sani of the year      the shaw zadda marched from allahabad toward bengal the particulars of this war are well known let it suffice to mention here that the prince was unsuccessful in all his attempts upon bengal and was at last obliged to surrender himself to the commander of the british forces at geiah in behar he received intelligence soon after of the assassination of his father at delhi he was accordingly proclaimed emperor at patna but nothing being done for him by the british the unfortunate prince found himself obliged to throw himself into the hands of suja ul dowlat who in the absence of kuli chan had seized upon the province of allahabad the villainy of suja ul dowlat did not rest there he invited kuli chan to a conference and basely assassinated him  suja ul dowlat having possessed himself of the kings person closely confined him he at the same time mocked the unhappy man with a farce of royalty and obliged him to ratify all grants and commissions which might serve his own purposes under the sanction of these extorted deeds suja ul dowlat made war upon the neighboring states in which however he was not very successful when cassim ali chan was driven from the subaship of bengal suja ul dowlat joined him in order to recover his government he was defeated at buxar by the british and the king being in his flight left behind him threw himself a second time under our protection  a d      he hoped now that as suja ul dowlats dominions fell into the hands of the british in consequence of this victory that they would confer them upon him but the unfortunate prince deceived himself he had no money and consequently had no friends suja ul dowlat was still possessed of wealth and the virtue of the conquerors was by no means proof against temptation they restored to him his dominions and by a mere mockery of terms called injustice by the name of generosity a small part of the province of allahabad was allotted to the king for a subsistence and the infamous son of a still more infamous persian pedlar enjoys the extensive province of oud as a reward for a series of uncommon villainies  but the transactions of the british subas in india will furnish materials for a distinct history we shall not therefore break in upon that subject in this place as to mention them slightly would be in some measure detracting from the fame which those great men have so justly acquired  section vi of the present state of hindostan a d      the short sketch which we have given in the preceding sections of the history of hindostan may serve to throw light on the decline of the great empire of the moguls in that part of the world we saw it gradually shrinking into itself till the race of timur are at last confined within the narrow limits of an insignificant province it must however be allowed that the uncommon misfortunes of that family proceeded no less from their own weakness than from the villainy of their servants had a man of parts succeeded the debility of mahummud shaws government the ancient glory of the empire might have been still restored the revolted subas were not then well established in their independence and the gallant resistance which abdalla met with in the reign of ahmed showed that the moguls could still defend themselves from foreign invasions  this like other great states fell into pieces more by domestic factions than by foreign arms even the ministers of the unfortunate mahummud were men of parts those who managed the affairs of ahmed were possessed of great abilities and in the reign of allumgire sani young ghazi displayed an uncommon and enterprizing genius but virtue had fled from the land no principle of honor patriotism or loyalty remained great abilities produced nothing but great crimes and the eyes of individuals being wholly intent upon private advantage the affairs of the public fell into ruin and confusion  a d      as from the ruins of the extensive empire of the moguls many independent governments have started up of late years it may not be improper in this place to take a cursory view of the present state of hindostan to begin with the northern provinces we have already observed that candahar cabul ghizni pishawir with a part of moultan and sind are under the dominion of ahmet abdalla that prince possesses also upon the side of persia the greatest part of chorrassan and seistan and all bamia on that of tartary abdalla in short reigns over almost all the countries which formed the empire of ghizni before it descended from the mountains of afganistan to lahore and delhi it is highly probable that as kerim chan has settled the western persia he may soon extend the empire to its ancient boundaries toward the east and drive abdalla into hindostan so that a third dynasty of kings of india may arise from among the afgans  the revenues of abdalla are very considerable amounting to about three crores of roupees but as he is always in the field and maintains an army of  00000 horse to defend himself from the persians and tartars he is in great distress for money this circumstance obliges him not only to oppress his own subjects but also to carry his depredations to foreign countries during the competition of the seven conspirators for the throne of persia abdalla had little to fear from that quarter but as kerim chan has established himself by the defeat and death of his rivals it is extremely probable that abdalla will soon feel as we have already observed the weight of his arms as chorrassan and seistan are properly provinces of the persian empire  however abdalla is at present at peace with kerim and has taken that favorable opportunity for invading hindostan he had in april      defeated the seiks in three different actions and advanced to sirhind about forty crores from delhi with an army of fifty thousand horse it is supposed that nigib ul dowla who in the name of the present emperors son manages the affairs of delhi had as he himself was hard pressed by the seiks and jates called in abdalla to take upon him the government nigib ul dowla by our best intelligence marched out of the city to meet his ally with forty thousand men the armies lay in fight of one another and they were busy in negotiation and in settling a plan for their future operations abdalla in the mean time wrote circular letters to all the princes of india commanding them to acknowledge him king of kings and demanding a tribute suja ul dowlat in particular had received a very sharp letter from him upbraiding him for his alliance with infidels and demanding the imperial revenues which that suba had converted to his own use for some years back  such was the situation of the affairs of ahmed abdalla by our last accounts from delhi this prince is brave and active but he is now in the decline of life his person is tall and robust and inclinable to being fat his face is remarkably broad his beard very black and his complexion moderately fair his appearance upon the whole is majestic and expressive of an uncommon dignity and strength of mind though he is not so fierce and cruel as nadir shaw he supports his authority with no less rigor and he is by no means less brave than that extraordinary monarch he in short is the most likely person now in india to restore the ancient power of the empire should he assume the title of king of delhi  the seiks border upon the indian dominions of abdalla that nation it is said take their name of seiks which signifies disciples from their being followers of a certain philosopher of thibet who taught the idea of a commonwealth and the pure doctrine of deism without any mixture of either the mahommedan or hindoo superstitions they made their first appearance about the commencement of this century in the reign of bahadar shaw but were rather reckoned then a partiticular sect than a nation since the empire began to decline they have prodigiously increased their numbers by admitting proselytes of all religions without any other ceremony than an oath which they tender to them to oppose monarchy  the seiks are at present divided into several states which in their internal government are perfectly independent of one another but they form a powerful alliance against their neighbors when they are threatened with invasions an assembly of the states is called and a general chosen by them to lead their respective quotas of militia into the field but as soon as peace is restored the power of this kind of dictator ceases and he returns in a private capacity to his own community the seiks are now in possession of the whole province of punjab the greatest part of moultan and sind both the banks of the indus from cashmire to tatta and all the country toward delhi from lahore to sirhind they have of late years been a great check upon the arms of abdalla and though in the course of the last year they have been unsuccessful against that prince in three actions they are by no means subdued but continue a severe clog upon his ambitious views in india  the chief who leads at present the army of the seiks is jessarit singh there is also one nitteh singh who is in great esteem among them they can upon an emergency muster  0000 good horse but though in india they are esteemed brave they choose rather to carry on their wars by surprise and stratagem than by regular operations in the field by their principles of religion and government as well as on account of national injuries they are inveterate enemies to abdalla and to the rohilla powers  to the east of the dominions of the republic of the seiks lie the countries which are possessed by the rohilla afgans nigib ul dowla whose history is comprehended in the preceding sections is from his power as well as from the strength of his councils and his own bravery reckoned their prince he possesses the city of delhi in the name of the family of timur together with a considerable territory around it on both the banks of the jumna and his revenues amount to one crore of roupees he publicly acknowledges the unfortunate shaw alum at allahabad king and allows a pension to his son jewan bucht who without any power maintains a kind of regal dignity at delhi  nigib ul dowla has been known when hard pressed by his hostile neighbors to raise  0000 horse but his revenues are not sufficient to support one tenth part of that number he continues to take the held under the name of buckshi or captain general of the mogul empire and though he has not the power or perhaps the inclination to assist the king he keeps up a friendly correspondence with him and without any necessity prosesses obedience and a show of loyalty  besides nigib ul dowla there are chiefs of the rohilla race who are perfectly independent but when danger presses they unite with him their forces the most respectable of these chiefs is hasiz rhimut who possesses a considerable district between the rivers the next to him in power is doondi chan and with him we may number mutta hussein jacob ali chan fat chan zurein and others of less note who command independent tribes beyond the ganges to the north of delhi  the whole power of the rohillas may amount to  00000 horse and an equal number of infantry upon an emergency but these are so wretchedly appointed and ill paid that they furnish more of ridicule than they can impress of terror in the field their infantry are armed with rockets pointed with iron which they discharge in vollies among cavalry which frighten more with their noise and uncommon appearance than by the execution which they make the rohillas are remarkable for nothing more than their natural antipathy to the mahrattors which might be turned to advantage by the british in their future views upon hindostan but the truth is that the hindoos and mahommedans so equally balance one another in that country that by supporting one we may with great facility command both  there is a small government of the patans to the east of the rohilla tribes their district is bounded by the dominions of the present king by those of suja ul dowlat and by the territories of the jates the capital of this petty principality is ferochabad which is situated upon the banks of the ganges a few crores above the ruins of the celebrated city of kinnoge ahmed chan bunguish who made a great figure against seifdar jung the father of suja ul dowlat rules over this district ahmed is more distinguished by his abilities and personal bravery than by the extent of his power his revenues do not exceed fifty lacks but he always keeps a standing force of two or three thousand good horse which he pays well and upon an emergency he raises all his vassals who consist of about  0000 men his country is full of forts and he has consequently been hitherto able to defend himself against the mahrattors jates and suja ul dowlat who have respectively invaded his dominions  the city of agra and a very considerable tract of country round it extending along the jumna from forty crores below that city to within five of delhi and stretching back to gualier and barampulla are now in the hands of a hindoo nation called the jates the raja who commands the jates is descended of the ancient race of the jits who possessed the banks of the indus as far back as the reign of sultan mahmood of ghizni from their prince the whole body of the jates though made up of many distinct tribes and sects take their name but others with less probability trace it to jate which in the hindoo language signifies a labourer  the jates made no figure in the mogul empire as a nation till the reign of allumgire commonly known in europe by the name of aurungzebe in that monarchs expedition to the decan they were first heard of as a gang of banditti under an intrepid fellow called chura mun they were then so daring as to harrass the rear of the imperial army after the death of allumgire the jates took advantage of the growing imbecility of the empire and fortifying themselves among the hills of narvar spread their depredations to the gates of agra mokun singh who after the death of chura mun commanded the jates took upon himself the title of raja their power increased under bodun singh and sourage mull which last was dignified with titles from the emperor  joahir singh the son of sourage mull now reigns over the jates and is a very weak prince his revenues do not exceed two crores of roupees his dominions like the rest of india being harrassed by the mahrattors he may upon some occasions be able to bring into the field sixty or seventy thousand men but he cannot keep long in pay one third of that number the dominions of the jates abound with strong fortresses such as dieg cumbere and aliver in one of which their prince frequently resides though he spends the most part of his time at agra  to the southwest of the jates mudoo singh a rajaput raja possesses a very considerable territory and resides for the most part at joinagur he is the son of joy singh a prince famous for his knowledge in astronomy and other mathematical sciences he entertained above a thousand learned brahmins for some years in rectifying the calendar and in making new tables for the calculation of eclipses and for determining the longitude and declination of the stars  the revenues of mudoo singh are not very considerable being reckoned only eighty lacks his dominions being woody mountainous and consequently ill cultivated he can however raise forty thousand men and he himself is esteemed a good soldier  bordering upon mudoo singh upon the frontiers of the decan is the extensive country of marwar ruled at present by bija singh the son of bucht singh and grandson of jessawind singh marwar when the empire was in a flourishing condition yielded annually five crores of roupees at present its revenues do not amount to half that sum on account of the incessant depredations of the mahrattors its next neighbors  the next hindoo government to marwar is that of odipour the raja of this country is distinguished by the name of rana that prince more from his nobility of family than from his power assumes a superiority over all the rajas of hindostan his dominions were formerly very extensive but of late years they have been circumscribed within narrower bounds his territories abound with mountains and forests and are almost surrounded by the kingdoms of malava and guzerat his revenues are inconsiderable and he cannot bring into the field above fifteen thousand men  in the valleys between the mountains of odipour there are many petty independent rajas bundi cottu rupnagur jesselmere and bianere being governed by their respective princes each of whom can muster six or eight thousand men  the mahrattors are the most considerable hindoo power in hindostan the principal seat of their government is sattarah and sometimes puna on the coast toward bombay though the genuine mahrattors all over india do not exceed  0000 men yet from their superior bravery and success in depredation thousands of all tribes enlist themselves under their banners these instead of pay receive a certain proportion of the plunder by this means an army of mahrattors increases like a river the farther it advances so that it is no uncommon thing for a force of ten or twelve thousand genuine mahrattors to grow into  00000 before they arrive in the place which they destine to plunder  the present chief of the mahrattors is ragenot raw the son of bagiraw he possesses one half of guzerat and all the territories between that province and the decan he has of late years extended his conquests to all the provinces of malava and to a part of allahabad having reduced himmut singh raja of gualier anarid singh raja of badawir anarid singh of chunderi and the princes of dittea orcha elichpoor bandere and jassey all of whom have become tributary to the mahrattors they have moreover possessed themselves of orissa which ought in propriety to be annexed to the subaship of bengal according to the late grant of the king to the british thus the dominions of the mahrattors extend quite across the peninsula of india from the bay of bengal to the gulf of cambait or cambay  the amount of the revenues of the mahrattors cannot easily be ascertained they must however be very considerable they subsist their armies by depredations on their neighbors and are become the terror of the east more on account of their barbarity than their valor they never want a pretense for hostilities they demand the chout or fourth part of the revenues of any province and in case of a refusal they invade plunder and lay waste the country their horses being very hardy their incursions are sudden unexpected and dreadful they generally appoint a place of rendezvous and their invasions are carried on by detached parties should a considerable force at any time oppose them they decline coming to action and as they invigorate their hardy horses with opium their flight like their incursions is very expeditious  the armies of the mahrattors do not like the troops of other indian powers incumber themselves with bazars or markets they trust for their subsistence to the countries through which they march they are armed with firelocks some with matchlock guns and others with bows spears javelins swords and daggers they have within three years back made some advances toward forming a disciplined army of infantry they have accordingly at present ten or twelve battalions of seapoys uniformly clothed and armed  all the powers of india being now sensible of the advantages which the british have gained by disciplined infantry turn their thoughts to a similar regulation in their armies and to improve their artillery which was formerly too unweildy and illmounted to be of any service in the field  to the east of malava and to the south of allahabad is the country of bundelcund governed by hindoput his territories are of a considerable extent and very fertile and he moreover draws great wealth from his diamond mines of hieragur and punagur he also claims a right to the mines of sommelpour but another raja possesses them at present  the annual revenues of hindoput amount to near two crores of roupees including the profits arising from his mines these he farms out to merchantadventurers who purchase a certain number of superficial feet of ground and they are permitted to dig down perpendicularly as far as they please diamonds beyond a certain weight are the property of the prince who has inspectors to superintend the works  the raja of bundelcund possesses the impregnable fortress of callinger and several other considerable strong holds he has notwithstanding been obliged to compound for a certain tribute with the mahrattors who generally paid him an annual visit between bundelcund and cattack in orissa lie the rajaships of patna and sommelpour which are not very considerable the country being mountainous woody and unhealthy and the inhabitants barbarous in every respect  part of the province of allahabad is now possessed by shaw alum by birthright and title though nothing less so in power emperor of hindostan he keeps the poor resemblance of a court at allahabad where a few ruined omrahs in hopes of better days to their prince having expended their fortunes in his service still exist the ragged pensioners of his poverty and burden his gratitude with their presence the districts of korah and allahabad in the kings possession are rated at thirty lacks which is one half more than they are able to bear instead of gaining by this bad policy that prince unfortunate in many respects has the mortification to see his poor subjects oppressed by those who farm the revenue while he himself is obliged to compound with the farmers for half the stipulated sum besides the revenue arising from allahabad and korah which we may at a medium estimate at twelve lacks the british pay to the king twentysix lacks out of the revenues of bengal which is all shaw alum possesses to support the dignity of the imperial house of timur  it may not perhaps be unacceptable to the public to delineate in this place the character of that unfortunate prince  shaw alum is robust in his person and about six feet high his complexion is rather darker than that which was common to the race of timur and his countenance is expressive of that melancholy which naturally arose from his many misfortunes he possesses personal courage but it is of the passive kind and may be rather called fortitude to bear adversity than that daring boldness which loves to face danger  he has been so often dismounted in the course of ambition that he now fears to give it the rein and seems less desirous to make any efforts to retrieve the power of his family than to live quietly under the shadow of its eclipsed majesty  his clemency borders upon weakness and his good nature has totally subverted his authority he is daily induced by importunity to issue out orders which he takes no means to enforce and which he is certain will not be obeyed from this blemish in the character of shaw alum arose the half of his misfortunes for the great secret of establishing authority is to give no orders which cannot be enforced and rather to suffer small injuries than show resentment without the power of punishing  his generosity is more than equal to his abilities and too often ill bestowed he is too much addicted to women and takes more pains to maintain his haram than to support an army  but though we cannot call him a great prince we must allow him to be a good man his virtues are many but they are those of private life which never appear with luster upon a throne his judgment is by no means weak but his passions are not strong the easiness of his temper is therefore molded like wax by every hand and he always gives up his own better opinion for those of men of inferior parts  he is affable in his conversation but seldom descends to pleasantry upon the whole though shaw alum is by no means qualified to restore a lost empire he might have maintained it with dignity in prosperous times and transmitted his name as a virtuous prince to posterity it is with great regret that the author from his regard to truth cannot speak more favorably of a prince to whom his gratitude and attachment are due for repeated testimonies of his esteem and friendship  the territories of suja ul dowlat who possesses the province of oud border upon those of the king his revenues amount to near two crores of roupees out of which he pays nothing to the emperor though he pretends to recognize his title as his sovereign since his defeat at buxar suja ul dowlat attends very much to the discipline of his army and the proper regulation of his finances he has already formed ten battalions of seapoys and has made great improvements in his artillery when the news of abdallas late invasion came he levied twelve thousand horse upon a better footing than is generally practiced in hindostan he is now the ally of the british in india and as his revenues will never enable him to support himself in the field against them it is probable his principle of fear for he has none of honor or gratitude will make him stand to the letter of the treaty  suja ul dowlat is extremely handsome in his person about five feet eleven inches in height and so nervous and strong that with one stroke of the sabre he can cut off the head of a buffalo he is active passionate ambitious his penetrating eye seems at first sight to promise uncommon acuteness and fire of mind but his genius is too volatile for depth of thought and he is consequently more fit for the manly exercises of the field than for deliberation in the closet  till of late he gave little attention to business he was up before the sun mounted his horse rushed into the forest and hunted down tigers or deer till the noon of day he then returned plunged into the cold bath and spent his afternoons in the haram among his women  such was the bias of suja ul dowlats mind till the late war ambitious without true policy and intoxicated with the passions of youth he began a wild career in which he was soon checked stung with the loss of reputation his passions have taken another course his activity is employed in discipling his army and he now spends more time at the comptoir of his finances than in dallying with the ladies of his seraglio his authority therefore is established his revenues increased and his army on a respectable footing but with all his splendid qualities he is cruel treacherous unprincipled deceitful carrying a specious appearance purposely to betray and when he embraces with one hand will stab with the other to the heart together with being heir to the fruits of his fathers crimes he inherits all his latent baseness of mind for if we except personal courage he possesses not one virtue more than seisdar jung  the province of oud is situated to the northeast of the ganges bordering upon behar from which it is on the one side divided by the river deo or gagera and on the other by the carumnassa the country is level well cultivated and watered it is divided on the north by a chain of mountains from thibet in the valleys which intersect that immense ridge of hills there are several independent rajas too inconsiderable to be formidable to suja ul dowlat  the provinces of bengal and behar are possessed by the british east india company in reality by the right of arms though in appearance by a grant from the present emperor this is not a proper place to enter into particulars concerning those provinces it may suffice to observe that bengal and behar including what is called the companys lands and duties upon merchandise yielded in april        0      sicca roupees the expenses of government the tribute to the king and a pension to a nabob set up on account of the villainies of his father amounted to     0000 roupees and consequently the balance in favor of the company was  0       roupees or        l   s of our money  the british force in bengal consists of three battalions of europeans and thirty of seapoys regularly armed disciplined and uniformly clothed so that we are much superior even upon that establishment to any other power at present in hindostan  in the decan the british are almost as powerful as in bengal we support mahommed ali as nominal nabob of the carnatic while in fact we govern the country without control having the possession of the garrisons and the disposal of the revenues the power of the nizam who resides at hydrabad though he possesses all the province of golconda is of late very much circumscribed he however still maintains an army of  0 or  0000 men but without discipline and ill paid they are by no means formidable he some time ago entered into a treaty with the british but he has of late shown no disposition to adhere to it long  hydernaig a soldier of fortune who by his personal merit raised himself from a common seapoy to be sovereign of almost all the coast of malabar threatened last year to attack the nizam if he did not break his unnatural alliance with the british the part which the nizam will take upon this occasion will entirely depend on the spirit of the councils of the british on the coast  as hydernaig had also threatened mahommed ali nabob of the carnatic it was judged prudent to march an army against him in march      but what success may have attended the expedition has not hitherto reached europe  hydernaig is said to have thirty disciplined battalions of seapoys twenty thousand good horse and a great train of artillery wrought by five hundred european renegadoes this prince having served in person in european armies models his troops upon their plan pays punctually and enforces discipline with rigor together with being an able politician he is a daring active and impetuous soldier and if he is not immediately crushed he may prove the most dangerous enemy that the british have hitherto met with in the east he is at present the most formidable prince in all india and he will no doubt take advantage of the divided state of that country and endeavor to extend his conquests  thus have we in a few words endeavored to give a general idea of the present state of hindostan the reflections which naturally arise from the subject might swell this work into a volume it is apparent however from what has been said that the immense regions of hindostan might be all reduced by a handful of regular troops  ten thousand european infantry together with the seapoys in the companys service are not only sufficient to conquer all india but with proper policy to maintain it for ages as an appendage of the british crown  this position may at first sight appear a paradox to people unacquainted with the genius and disposition of the inhabitants of hindostan but to those who have considered both with attention the thing seems not only practicable but easy  that slavery and oppression which the indians suffer from their native princes make the justice and regularity of a british government appear to them in the most favorable light the great men of the country have no more idea of patriotism than the meanest slaves and the people can have no attachment to chiefs whom they regard as tyrants soldiers of fortune are so numerous in india that they comprehend one fourth of the inhabitants of that extensive country they are never paid one third of the stipulated sum by the princes of hindostan which renders them mutinous and discontented but they would most certainly approve themselves obedient faithful and brave in the service of a power who should pay them regularly  in a country like india where all religions are tolerated the people can have no objection to the british on account of theirs the army might be composed of an equal number of mahommedans and hindoos who would be a check upon one another while a small body of europeans would be a sufficient check upon both the battalions ought to be commanded altogether by european officers who if they do their duty properly and behave with justice to their men may attach them to their persons with stronger ties than any troops born in europe but if justice is not observed to soldiers human nature in this as in all countries will and must revolt against oppression  at present the black officers of the seapoys must rise from the ranks this is sound policy and ought to be continued men of family and influence are deterred by this circumstance from entering into the service these officers are therefore entirely our creatures and will never desert a people among whom alone they can have any power for no acquired discipline will give weight to a mean man sufficient to bring to the field an army of indians  the advantages of a conquest of hindostan to this country are obvious it would pay as much of the national debt as government should please to discharge should the influx of wealth raise the price of the necessaries and conveniences of life the poor on the other hand by being eased of most of their taxes would be more able to purchase them  but say some grave moralists how can such a scheme be reconciled to justice and humanity  this is an objection of no weight  hindostan is at present torn to pieces by factions all laws divine and human are trampled under foot  instead of one tyrant as in the times of the empire the country now groans under thousands and the voice of the oppressed multitude reaches heaven it would therefore be promoting the cause of justice and humanity to pull those petty tyrants from the height to which their villainies have raised them and to give to so many millions of mankind a government founded upon the principles of virtue and justice  the task is no less glorious than it is practicable for it might be accomplished with half the blood which is often expended in europe upon an ideal system of a balance of power and in commercial wars which must be attended with little eclat as they are destitute of striking and beneficial consequences  finis
