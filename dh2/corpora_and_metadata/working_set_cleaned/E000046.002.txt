of seeing you again before you leave the country i inclose you an order on the inspectors at shockoe for two hhds of tobo which i consign to you and give you also the trouble of shipping as i am too far from the spot to do it myself they are to be laid out in the purchase of the articles on the back hereof you will observe that part of these articles such as are licensed by the association are to be sent at any event another part being prohibited are only to be sent if the tea act should be repealed before you get home if it is not you will observe a third class to be sent instead of those which are prohibited i am not without expectation that the repeal may take place i believe the parliament want nothing but a   colorable motive to adopt this measure the conduct of our brethren of new york affords them this you will observe by my invoice that i have supposed my tobo to clear me £ 0 sterl per hhd should it be less dock the invoice of such articles as you think i may get in the country—in consequence of your recommendation i wrote to waller last june for £   sterl worth of books inclosing him a bill of exchange to that amount having written to benson pearson for another parcel of nearly the same amount i directed him to purchase them also of waller i acquainted both of the necessity of my situation brought on by the unlucky loss of my library and pressed them most earnestly to lose not a day in sending them yet i have heard not a tittle from either gentlemen—i mentioned to you that i had become one of several securities for a gentleman of my acquaintance lately engaged in trade i hope and indeed hear he is doing very well i would not therefore take any step to wound his credit but as far as it can possibly be done without affecting that i must beg you to have me secured it can surely do no mischief to see that his remittances are placed to the credit of the money for which we stand engaged and not of any new importations of goods made afterwards i must rely entirely on your friendly assistance in the matter which i assure you gives me concern as should my friend prove unsuccessful and ill foe may render any person unsuccessful it might sweep away the whole of my little fortune—i must once more trouble you for my friend ogilvie the commissary promised to write   in his favor to the bishop by neeks i did not see his letter and with this gentleman i believe no farther than i see i wrote by the same opportunity to ogilvie and apprised him of the commissarys engagement should your route to the ship be thro wmsburgh i would trouble you to know whether he has in truth written or not the inclosed letter to ogilvie you will please to deliver with our most earnest advice that he lose not a day in coming over—one farther favor and i am done to search the heralds office for the arms of my family i have what i have been told were the family arms but on what authority i know not it is possible there may be none if so i would with your assistance become a purchaser having sternes word for it that a coat of arms may be purchased as cheap as any other coat—the things i have desired you to purchase for me i would beg you to hasten particularly the clavichord which i have directed to be purchased in hamburgh because they are better made there and much cheaper leave me a line before you go away with instructions how to direct to you thomas jefferson feb  0      monticello james ogilvie to james ogilvie  monticello feb  0      dear ogilvie —i wrote you a line from wmsburgh last october but lest that may have miscarried i take this oppty of repeating what was material in that on receipt of your letter and oh   shame of your only letter of march       0 which came not to hand till august we took proper measures for prevailing on the commissary to withdraw his opposition but lest you should be uneasy in your situation in the mean time i directed mr t adams by the means of his partners perkins and brown to let you know they would answer any calls from you in this your friend mr walker insisted on joining me in october i transmitted to the commissary a certificate of your conduct in life on which he promised to write in your favor by neeks and tho i did not see the letter i expect he did by the same oppty i wrote to you inclosing a duplicate of the certificate of which you might avail yourself if the commissary should fail us again about the same time i wrote from wmsburgh to a gentleman of the vestry in orange to secure for you a vacancy which had happened in that parish by the death of martin i have had no answer but the parish is still vacant which gives me hopes it is kept for you mr maury incumbent in fredericksville parish of which i was when you were here has a tempting offer from another quarter i know not whether he will accept of it if he should we shall do for you all that can be done in your absence but for gods sake let not that be a moment longer than is of absolute necessity your settlement here would make your friends happy  i think would be agreeable to yourself your dulcinea is in health her brother t strachan is settled with y walker for life another reason for her and you to wish for a residence with us he is wishing to take to himself a wife and nothing obstructs   it but the unfeeling temper of a parent who delays perhaps refuses to approve her daughters choice i too am in that way and have still greater difficulties to encounter not from the forwardness of parents nor perhaps want of feeling in the fair one but from other causes as unpliable to my wishes as these since you left us i was unlucky enough to lose the house in which we lived and in which all its contents were consumed a very few books two or three beds c were with difficulty saved from the flames i have lately removed to the mountain from whence this is dated and with which you are not unacquainted i have here but one room which like the cobblers serves me for parlour for kitchen and hall i may add for bedchamber and study too my friends sometimes take a temperate dinner with me and then retire to look for beds elsewhere i have hope however of getting more elbow room this summer but be this as may happen whether my tenements be great or small homely or elegant they will always receive you with a hearty welcome if any thing should obstruct your setting out immediately for virginia i would beg the favor of you to send the things i asked of you to purchase by some careful captain coming on james river such of them as were for my buildings or for house keeping i am particularly in want of nothing material occurs relative to the health and fortunes of your friends here they are well in both as far as i can recollect them i conclude my epistle with every wish for your felicity which friendship can inspire adieu and believe me to be yours sincerely   thomas jefferson      inscription for an african slave       shores there are blessd shores for

somewhat doubtful when you left the country how far my little invoice delivered you might be complied with till we should know the fate of the association  i desired you to withhold purchasing the things till you should hear farther from me the day appointed for the meeting of the associates is not yet arrived however from the universal sense of those who are likely to attend it seems reduced to a certainty that the restrictions will be taken off everything but the dutied articles i will therefore venture to desire that branch of my invoice may be complied with in which were some shoes and other prohibited articles since if contrary to our expectations the restrictions should be continued i can store or otherwise dispose of them as our committees please i must alter one article in the invoice i wrote therein for a clavichord i have since seen a fortepiano and am charmed with it send me this instrument then instead of the clavichord let the case be of fine mahogany solid not veneered the compass from double g to f in alt a plenty of spare strings and the workmanship of the whole very handsome and worthy the acceptance of a lady for whom i intend it i must add also ½ doz pr india cotton stockings for myself   0 sterl pr pair ½ doz pr best white silk do and a large umbrella with brass ribs covered with green silk and neatly finished by this    change of the clavichord into a fortepiano and addition of the other things i shall be brought in debt to you to discharge which i will ship you of the first tobacco i get to the warehouse in the fall i expect by that time and also from year to year afterwards i must send you an invoice with tobacco somewhat enlarged as i have it in prospect to become more regularly a paterfamilias—i desired the favor of you to procure me an architect i must repeat the request earnestly and that you will send him in as soon as you can—i shall conclude with one petition that you send me the articles contained in my invoice and written for above as soon as you receive this as i suppose they may be bought ready made and particularly the fortepiano for which i shall be very impatient by this means i may get them in octob which will prevent my being obliged to purchase as i must do if they do not come in time thomas jefferson aug        monticello robert skipwith to robert skipwith monticello aug        i sat down with a design of executing your request to form a catalogue of books to the amount of about  0 lib sterl but could by no means satisfy myself with any partial choice i could make thinking therefore it might be as agreeable to you i have framed such a general collection as i think you would wish and might in time find convenient to procure out of this you will chuse for yourself to the amount you mentioned for the present year and    may hereafter as shall be convenient proceed in completing the whole a view of the second column in this catalogue would i suppose extort a smile from the face of gravity peace to its wisdom let me not awaken it a little attention however to the nature of the human mind evinces that the entertainments of fiction are useful as well as pleasant that they are pleasant when well written every person feels who reads but wherein is its utility asks the reverend sage big with the notion that nothing can be useful but the learned lumber of greek and roman reading with which his head is stored i answer everything is useful which contributes to fix in the principles and practices of virtue when any original act of charity or of gratitude for instance is presented either to our sight or imagination we are deeply impressed with its beauty and feel a strong desire in ourselves of doing charitable and grateful acts also on the contrary when we see or read of any atrocious deed we are disgusted with its deformity and conceive an abhorence of vice now every emotion of this kind is an exercise of our virtuous dispositions and dispositions of the mind like limbs of the body acquire strength by exercise but exercise produces habit and in the instance of which we speak the exercise being of the moral feelings produces a habit of thinking and acting virtuously we never reflect whether the story we read be truth or fiction if the painting be lively and a tolerable picture of nature we are thrown into a reverie from which if we awaken it is the fault of the writer i appeal to every reader of feeling and sentiment    whether the fictitious murther of duncan by macbeth in shakespeare does not excite in him as great a horror of villany as the real one of henry iv by ravaillac as related by davila and whether the fidelity of nelson and generosity of blandford in marmontel do not dilate his breast and elevate his sentiments as much as any similar incident which real history can furnish does he not in fact feel himself a better man while reading them and privately covenant to copy the fair example we neither know nor care whether lawrence sterne really went to france whether he was there accosted by the franciscan at first rebuked him unkindly and then gave him a peace offering or whether the whole be not fiction in either case we equally are sorrowful at the rebuke and secretly resolve we will never do so we are pleased with the subsequent atonement and view with emulation a soul candidly acknowleging its fault and making a just reparation considering history as a moral exercise her lessons would be too infrequent if confined to real life of those recorded by historians few incidents have been attended with such circumstances as to excite in any high degree this sympathetic emotion of virtue we are therefore wisely framed to be as warmly interested for a fictitious as for a real personage the field of imagination is thus laid open to our use and lessons may be formed to illustrate and carry home to the heart every moral rule of life thus a lively and lasting sense of filial duty is more effectually impressed on the mind of a son or daughter by reading king lear than by all the dry volumes of ethics and divinity    that ever were written this is my idea of well written romance of tragedy comedy and epic poetry—if you are fond of speculation the books under the head of criticism will afford you much pleasure of politics and trade i have given you a few only of the best books as you would probably chuse to be not unacquainted with those commercial principles which bring wealth into our country and the constitutional security we have for the enjoiment of that wealth in law i mention a few systematical books as a knowledge of the minutiae of that science is not necessary for a private gentleman in religion history natural philosophy i have followed the same plan in general—but whence the necessity of this collection come to the new rowanty from which you may reach your hand to a library formed on a more extensive plan separated from each other but a few paces the possessions of each would be open to the other a spring centrically situated might be the scene of every evenings joy there we should talk over the lessons of the day or lose them in music chess or the merriments of our family companions the heart thus lightened our pillows would be soft and health and long life would attend the happy scene come then and bring our dear tibby with you the first in your affections and second in mine offer prayers for me too at that shrine to which tho absent i pray continual devotions  in every scheme of happiness she is placed in the foreground of the picture as the principal figure take    that away and it is no picture for me bear my affections to wintipock clothed in the warmest expressions of sincerity and to yourself be every human felicity adieu argument in godwin et al vs lunan  oct      i was of counsel for the libellant also and though i thought the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the court established    beyond a doubt yet i conceived it did not follow thence that they might deprive the defendant of his parish because visitation and deprivation are no parts of the office of an ecclesiastical judge to prove this it was proposed to enquire into the first establishment of christian churches in great britain to develope their several kinds and constitutions to see who is entrusted with their care and visitation and to apply the principles which this enquiry would evolve to the parochial churches of our own country on the first introduction of christianity into great britain it is certain there were no parochial divisions the bishops and their clergy lived in common and occasionally sent out itinerant preachers to those places where the people seemed disposed to receive them but when the number of converts became considerable and the tract of country they occupied extensive this occasional mission was found inconvenient and a division into districts or parishes took place this is supposed by some to have been in the time of archbishop honorius anno     but mr selden and others think it of later origin it is not pretended that this division was then made as it now remains into small parishes it is probable that at first they were few and large till time and the progress of conversion made it necessary to divide and subdivide them   burns eccles law    the king his great lords and thanes for the accommodation of their tenants having built churches on their manors obliged their tenants to pay tythes    to these churches for though a law of ethelwolf so early as the year     humes history of england had given tythes to the clergy yet it left the people at liberty to pay them where and to whom they pleased a grievance to the drones among the ecclesiastics not entirely rectified till a law of king edgar c   obliged them to pay them to the mother church of the parish debtur omnes decimæ primariæ ecclesiæ and quam parochia pertinet   bl     the church being situated then on the soil of the lord being built by himself and the tythes paid from his tenements and tenants gave him a natural right to employ any clerk for the celebration of divine service whom he should choose   inst     b the same circumstances would give him a right to remove the clerk whenever he should become deficient in duty hence arose the rights of donation or the disposition of church livings by laymen   bl     gibs     watson c    in process of time however an encroachment was made by the bishops on some of the lay patrons who possessed churches of the donative kind they insisted and in some instances prevailed on the patron to give the bishop a right of previously examining the person to whom the church was to be given for this purpose the patron was to present him to the bishop who on examination admitted him able and instituted him into the cure or refused him altogether and a maxim was soon established of once presentative and always presentative   inst     a this innovation is said by selden to have been introduced by that pious saint and martyr thomas    à becket in the time of henry ii seld tyth c    but lord coke seems to think that it was not done till the time of pope innocent iii which was in the reign of our john   inst  0  and thus was introduced a second class of churches distinguished by the name of presentatives of the residue of the parishes after the donatives and presentatives were taken off the bishops and clergy still retained the care and appointed persons to officiate at the several churches these churches they doubtless sometimes built themselves and sometimes procured leave to convert the old british temples into christian churches and so may in some degree be considered as the founders of them   bum e l    light as this foundation was it gave them some color for collating the clerk and this having been exercised by them from the infancy of christianity has acquired the force of immemorial custom and given reality to the right now known by the name of collation so that at present churches are comprehended as dr blackstone rightly says under the classes of donatives presentatives and collatives   bl    donatives are those churches originally founded and endowed by the crown or lay subject or perhaps by both which lie merely in the gift of the lay patron whose deed of donation is an absolute investiture of the clerk without presentation to the bishop or any other ceremony presentatives are churches originally founded in the same manner by a lay patron and which though at first donatives were by encroachment by the bishops subjected to presentation to them for their examination  0 admission or refusal the reasons of refusal are however examinable by the temporal courts on an action of quare impedit if brought by the patron   inst     collatives are those remnants of the old parishes left after the king and great men had taken off their manors the right of collating to which is by immemorial custom vested in the bishop of the donative and presentative church the lay founder is patron a right acquired by the acts of foundation fundidatio and endowment donatio of the collative church the bishop is patron because he is quasi the founder of that having built it himself or been principally instrumental in procuring it to be built or applied to the purpose of religion see   bl               bl               inst  0  having investigated the nature of the several kinds of churches and shewn the origin of the rights of patronage it remains to enquire what these rights are  st nomination or the right of naming the clerk  nd donation or induction which is the investing with actual possession  rd visitation which is the superintending his conduct after he is in possession the latter is the object of the present enquiry as it includes deprivation which is only one of the higher degrees of punishment exercisable by the visitor so said my lord holt in the case of the bishop of st davids v lucy salk     by allowing his power to visit all is admitted for he that may visit may deprive as well as censure these being but several degrees of ecclesiastical punishment and by the    henry viii and the   el c   the only power given to the ecclesiastical commissioners was to visit    without a word of deprivation yet they were always allowed a power to deprive so that the visitor of the church whoever he be is the person empowered to deprive the incumbent with respect therefore to the right of visitation as it is one of the rights of patronage arising from foundation and endowment so it will in general be found coupled with them thus in collative churches the bishop alone visits he having in some degree been the founder of the church in a donative church the patron is visitor because he originally founded the church and so its constitution is the work of his hands a point which i shall presently incontestably prove in presentative churches indeed the right of continuing to superintend or in other words to visit seems to have been encroached on when the right of approving the nominee was first acquired to the bishop   mod    it might perhaps be thought that if the bishop was the proper person to judge of the fitness of the clerk he would be the proper person to judge also how long that fitness continued but whatever may be the cause why the presentative church varies in this instance from the general rule that the right of visitation follows the foundation is immaterial because it will be shown that our churches are donatives to the visitation of which therefore i shall confine my future enquiries lord holt in his argument in the case of philips v bury holts rep     expressed himself in these words but private and particular corporations for charity founded and endowed by private persons are subject to the private government of those who erect them and    therefore if there be no visitor appointed by the founder i am of opinion that the law doth appoint the founder and his heirs to be visitors the founder and his heirs are patrons and not to be guided by the common known laws of the kingdom but such corporations are as to their own affairs to be governed by the particular laws and constitutions assigned by the founder it was said the common law doth not appoint a visitation at all i am of another opinion the law doth in defect of a particular appointment make the founder visitor if he is silent during his own time the right will descend to his heirs yelv    and   cro  0 so   edward iii  0 and   ass    so that patronage and visitation are necessary consequences one upon another for this visitorial power was not introduced by any canons or constitutions ecclesiastical it is an appointment of law it arises from the property which the founder had in the lands assigned to support the charity and so he is the author of the charity the law gives him and his heirs a visitorial power that is an authority to inspect their actions and regulate their behavior as he pleaseth indeed where the poor are not incorporated according to the case in  0 co there is no visitorial power because the interest of the revenue is not vested in them but where they are incorporated there to prevent all perverting of the charity there is by law a visitorial power and it being a creature of the founders own it is reason he and his heirs should have that power unless they please to devolve it elsewhere in our old books deprived by patron and deprived    by visitor are all one for it is a benefit that naturally springs out of foundation and it is in his power to transfer it to another and so in   jur eccles     by twisten whenever there is a cure of souls the church is visitable either by the bishop if it belongs to him if to a layman he must make delegates if to the king my lord keeper does it and he cites   mod    and the author adds i presume the judge in this case is to be understood as to the mans making delegates to mean if he finds himself unequal to his duty then he is bound in conscience to delegate commissioners qualified for it but not that he may not do it himself though he be really able for it is to be observed if his commissioners do otherwise than he is convinced in his conscience they ought he may still undertake and determine it himself according to conscience and as he may so take it up i conceive no reason can be shewn why he cannot do it in the first instance for his commissioners are but in aid of him and i conceive in this case his power though more absolute may be compared to the ordinarys authority who though ordinarily he judges by his chancellor or other official yet he may sit himself and determine matters within his limited jurisdiction if he pleases and have as is to be presumed abilities moore     fayrechild v gayre pasch   jac en bank le roy sur un special verdict suit adjudged que lincumbent dun benefice donative poit resigner a son patron et que il esteant del foundacon le patron

donative and exempt from all ordinary jurisdiction and the incumbent may resign to the patron and not to the ordinary neither can the ordinary visit but the patron by commissioners to be appointed by him so that this much is certain that in donative churches the right of visitation is in the patron and here we must note that in the case of the kings donatives he does not visit in person but may make commissioners for that purpose and if he does not make them his chancellor acts ex officio for him thus by f n b    a the king may have a prohibition directed to the ordinary that he shall not visit the hospitals which are of the kings foundation or of the foundation of his predecessors because that the chancellor of england ought to visit them and no other and so is it of the kings or his progenitors free chapels no ordinary shall visit them but the chancellor of england s p dav    b if the king doth found a church hospital or free chapel donative he may exempt the same from ordinary jurisdiction and then his chancellor shall visit the same nay if the king do found the same without any special exemption the ordinary is not but the kings chancellor to visit the same co lit     a but the king may if he pleases make a special commission   h      dy     as in the case of waldron v pollard dyer     the king gave a commission to visit his donative so in the case of the college of william and mary in this country which is of royal foundation    the king did by his charter appoint commissioners for the purpose of visitation and prescribed the rules for keeping up a perpetual succession of them so that it appears that the patron of a donative is visitor of right and where the king is patron he may appoint commissioners but if he does not his chancellor visits ex officio for him and indeed it is worthy the attention of this court that if as an ecclesiastical court they should take on them to visit our clergy and it should appear they are not visitable for any ecclesiastical court the error is not excused by the law in this as in other cases where a judge happens to be mistaken in his opinion but he incurs the penalties of a premunire which are a forfeiture of property outlawry and perpetual imprisonment of the person these were first introduced by the stat    r   for drawing causes of temporal cognisance and all cases of advowsons are tryable by the temporal courts only in curiam romanam vel alibi the word alibi has been construed to extend to any ecclesiastical court thus in    co    for as it was resolved by all the justices pasch   jac reg est contra coronam et dignitatem regiam when any ecclesiastical judge doth usurp upon the temporal law because as in all those writs it appeareth the interest or cause of the subject is drawn ad aliud examen that is when the subject ought to have his cause ended by the common law where unto by birthright he is inheritable he is drawn in aliud examen viz to be decided and determined by the ecclesiastical law and this is truly said contra coronam et dignitatem regiam and this appears by    all the prohibitions which are infinite which have been directed to the high commissioners and others after the said act by   eliz a fortiori he who offends in a premunire shall be said to offend contra coronam et dignitatem regiam and this in effect answers to all the aforesaid objections but yet other particular answers shall be given to every of them as to the third although the court by force of high commission is the court of the king yet their proceedings are ecclesiastical and for this if they usurp upon the temporal law this is the same offence which was before the said act of  0 eliz for this was the end of all the antient acts that the temporal law shall not in any manner be emblemished by any ecclesiastical proceedings as to the fourth although it be a new court yet the antient statutes extend to it within this word alibi and divers new bishopricks were erected in the time of henry viii and yet there was never any question but that the antient acts of premunire extended to them and in bro abr i find it expressly determined to be a premunire to call the incumbent of a donative before an ecclesiastical visitation per aliquos benefice donative per le patron tantum est lay chose et levesque ne visitera et ideo ned deprivera et donque sil mella in ce il est in le case de premunire et in ce case suit barloo evesque de bathe tempore e   et suit arct de obteiner un pardon eo que il avoit deprive le deane de welles que suit un donative per letters patents le ray per acte de parlament ent sait tamen   e   supra ne adjudge   ass p    bro abr premunire    so that my conclusions    from the premises so far as necessary in the present question are that donative churches being originally founded by a laypatron and being still subject to his donation are likewise subject to his sole visitation the ecclesiastical judge having no right to intermeddle and again that if the patron be a subject he may visit either in person or by commissioners if he be the king he may also appoint commissioners but if he make no appointment the chancellor visits ex officio our last enquiry is to what class belong the churches of our government are they collatives are they presentatives or are they donatives collatives they are not because these were described as having existed immemorially and been all that time disposed of by the bishop which immemorial usage had confirmed the right in law but our parishes pretend to no immemorial existence for that would make them older than our government itself they have been erected by acts of assembly long within memory to be found by any one who will recur to our records nor was there ever an instance of collation to one of them by a bishop if an act of parliament make a particular district a particular separate distinct parish the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical court does not attach upon it for this clear reason that it was not such immemorially parish st john clerkenwell   geo   b r   jur eccl     neither are our churches of the presentative kind because of these the distinguishing characteristic is that though of lay foundation yet the bishop has acquired a right of having the clerk presented for his    examination admission or refusal but no such right was ever pretended in our churches nor was there ever an instance in them of presentation to a bishop but they are of the donative kind these were said  st to have been founded by laymen  nd not to be subject to presentation to a bishop  rd to lie purely in the gift of the patron now let us see if these characters are not applicable to our churches the act of assembly      c   directs that a church shall be built in every parish and c   that the expenses of building and keeping it in repair provision for the poor and maintenance of the minister be levied on the people of the parish c   that there be a glebe laid out in every parish and a convenient house built for the abode of the minister and that a maintenance be provided for him which shall be worth eighty pounds per annum besides his perquisites and glebe the act of      c    instead of the £ 0 given the minister by that of      c   gives him sixteen thousand pounds of tobacco besides his perquisites to be levied by the vestries in their respective parishes and lastly the act of      c    old edns sect   confirms this salary to them to be levied by the vestry upon the titheable persons in their respective parishes and sect   directs that the glebe shall contain two hundred acres of good land at the least and that there shall be built on it a convenient mansion house kitchen barn stable dairy meat house cornhouse and garden the expenses of which are to be levied on the titheable persons in the parishes here it might be thought prima facie perhaps that as the    parishioners pay the money they are the founders and endowers but a little attention will i think discover this to be a fallacy the parishioners are indeed the persons ordered to furnish the money but the erection of the parishes and gift of the salary or in other words the foundation and endowment of the church is the act of the legislature they direct an officer to levy sixteen thousand pounds of tobacco on the titheable persons of the parish as soon as it is in his hands it is the money of the public and then they order him to pay it to the minister of the parish just as if the founder of a church should endow it with an annuity which by his charter of donation should be payable out of his manor of blackacre his tenants of that manor though they furnished the money would hardly be considered as the founders and endowers suppose the legislature instead of directing the payment of these expenses to be levied on the particular parishioners had ordered the payment out of the public purse the foundation and endowment would surely then have been their acts but what difference can it produce if instead of ordering the parish collector to pay the money to the treasurer and him again to the minister they adopt the shorter method of making the collector pay it immediately to the minister our own country furnishes a decisive refutation of this notion the college of william and mary is endowed with duties on skins furs liquors tobaccos paid by the exporters and importers though given by the legislature yet was it never supposed that that college was founded or endowed by the exporters or  0 importers of these commodities as little then can the parishioners though the parochial taxes be assessed on them be called the founders and endowers of our churches the truth is the parish is erected the church and its soil given and also the endowment by the legislature or in other words by the community whom they represent now that is a civil not an ecclesiastical body the churches are therefore of lay foundation again if we consider the community as made up of king and people the king will then be the patron of our churches it being a known branch of the royal prerogative that where the king and his subjects are joint founders the rights of patronage vest in the king   bl    or if we consider it in a constitutional point of view the same consequence will be evolved for wherever an act of parliament or of assembly erects a new office without prescribing the particular mode of appointing the officer it belongs to the king to make the appointment and for this reason that possessing the executive power of the laws it is his peculiar duty to see each act carried into execution which cannot be unless an officer is appointed   bl     on this principle is almost every officer in great britain as well as in virginia appointed by the crown the acts erecting the offices never prescribing the mode of appointment unless where they mean to give it from the crown if then our acts of assembly erecting cures of souls and declaring that they shall be given to ecclesiastics of a certain sect have not said by whom the nomination shall be it will follow that the king who is to see the law executed must nominate persons    for that purpose we have but two acts relative to this matter the act of      c   says that a minister producing to the governor letters of ordination from some bishop in england and subscribing c the governor is to induct them into any parish that shall make presentation of him this law without doubt gave the nomination to the parishioners collectively though it preserved to the crown the right of donation or actual investiture but the impropriety and inconvenience of popular elections of priests and the unfitness of the people to judge of their qualifications had soon caused the vestries to usurp this right and even their unreadiness to choose where the choice was to be followed by immediate assessments for maintenance together with the doubt at what time the king might interpose to supply the vacancy induced the necessity of altering the constitution of the churches in this respect in      therefore the right of nomination was restored to the crown except for the first twelve months after an avoidance during which it was given to the vestrymen of the parish act      c    old edns s   and whereas it is doubted how long the right of presentation of a minister to a parish remains in the vestries in this colony for settling that matter be it enacted that the sole right of presentation shall be and remain in the several vestries for and during the term of twelve months next after a vacancy shall happen in their respective parishes but perhaps it may be thought that the right of choosing given by this act to the vestries in the first instance is another mark of foundership and if they are founders of    course they are visitors this must be answered by distinguishing between the act of nomination which is given them for a twelve month and of donation or induction which is reserved to the crown and is better expressed by the word investiture nomination is defined by cowell to be a power to appoint a clerk to a patron of a benefice and he says the word invest signifies to give possession others says he define it thus investiture est in suum jus alicujus introductio a giving livery of seisin or possession this in donative churches is effected by the single deed of donation without other ceremony donatives are given and fully possessed by the single donation of the patron in writing without presentation institution or induction gibs       burn eccl l     and in collatives and presentatives it is effected by induction induction is by the canon law called corporal possession and is compared in the books of common law to livery and seisin by which possession is given to temporal estates gibs     burn eccl l     so that the right given the vestry is barely to name for one twelve month whereas the crown is on that nomination to make the deed of donation or give corporal possession the act indeed for nomination uses the presentation the sense of which as used in the ecclesiastical law is to present to a bishop and is in its nature and effect very different from nomination and for donation it uses the word induction which has indeed the same meaning of delivering actual possession only that it is usually applied to the delivery of a different kind of church however our legislators    of      were not critics in the language of the law and it matters not since they have plainly enough signified what they meant these rights of nomination and investiture are generally indeed in the same person and are both exercised by one and the same act thus when in a donative a patron makes a deed of donation it is a nomination as well as an investiture but they may be separated as happens when the patron grants away the next avoidance there the grantee has only the right of nominating but the grantor or patron is to invest for says gibs     the right of nomination may be in one person and the right of presentation in another and this is where he who was seized of the advowson doth grant unto another and his heirs that as often as the church becomes void the grantee and his heirs shall nominate to the grantor and his heirs who shall be bound to present accordingly in such case it was agreed by the whole court in the case of shirley and underhill mod     that the nomination is the substance of the advowson and the presentation no more than a ministerial interest   burn eccl l     now this is precisely the case between our vestries and the crown under the act of assembly the king being considered as the founder and patron of the church if nothing had been said would have possessed both rights of nomination and vestiture but the acts give the vestries for one twelve month the right of nominating to the governor the person whom he is to induct or invest with possession it is similar to the case of sheriffs and inspectors who are nominated by the court    but commissioned or invested with their office by the governor so in the case of a clerk it is not the nomination by the vestry but the governors investiture which puts him into possession and entitles him to the temporalities of his cure so that while the act takes from the king pro tempore and transfers to the vestry the right of nomination which was one of the rights incident to his patronage it leaves him the ensigns of that right to wit investiture and still the estate in law which was in the king is made to pass from him by his act of investiture and not from the vestry by their nomination so that like the case before cited of the grant of a next avoidance though the nomination be in the grantee yet the presentation to the bishop if it be presentative or the deed of donation if it be donative must be by the patron he still continues the patron and he not the grantee possesses the right of visitation thus then it may be stated in fewer words the king is the patron of all our churches the rights of patrons are  st nomination  nd investiture  rd visitation only one of these rights viz nomination was taken away and that but for a limited time the other two of vestiture and visitation were not touched and consequently still remain in him we may safely therefore conclude that our churches are donatives because they wear the three characteristics of donatives   they are of lay foundation   they are not subject to presentation to a bishop   they lie in the gift of the patron that patron is the king and though one    right of patronage viz nomination is taken away pro tempore yet the others of vestiture and visitation still remain in him the latter is the power now called into exercise and his majesty having never been pleased to appoint commissioners for that purpose it is to be exercised by his chancellor here that is by the members of this honorable court who possess the powers of a chancellor not indeed sitting on this bench of chancery but as a court of visitation at any other time or place at which you shall think proper to call the incumbent before you thomas jefferson june

him to do this however it is better that your correspondents prevent it which cannot be done with certainty but by their sending in their answers in proper form before the next court i am this moment leaving town having just taken time to inform you of this measure    thomas jefferson feb         virga mcpherson to chas mcpherson  albemarle in virga feb         dear sir —encouraged by the small acquaintance which i had the pleasure of having contracted with you during your residence in this country i take the liberty of making the present application to you i understood you were related to the gentleman of your name mr james mcpherson to whom the world is so much indebted for the elegant collection arrangement and translation of ossians poems these pieces have been and will i think during my life continue to be to me the sources of daily pleasures the tender and the sublime emotions of the mind were never before so wrought up by the human hand i am not ashamed to own that i think this rude bard of the north the greatest poet that has ever existed merely for the pleasure of reading his works i am become desirous of learning the language in which he sung and of possessing his songs in their original form mr mcpherson i think informs us he is possessed of the originals indeed a gentleman has lately told me he had seen them in print but i am afraid he has mistaken a specimen from temora annexed to some of the editions of the translation for the whole works if they are printed it will abridge my request and your trouble to the sending me a printed copy but if there be more such my petition is that you would be so good as to use your interest with mr mcpherson to obtain leave to take a manuscript copy of them and procure it to be done i would choose it in a fair round hand on    fine paper with a good margin bound in parchments as elegantly as possible lettered on the back and marbled or gilt on the edges of the leaves i would not regard expense in doing this i would further beg the favor of you to give me a catalogue of the books written in that language and to send me such of them as may be necessary for learning it these will of course include a grammar and dictionary the cost of these as well as the copy of ossian will be for me on demand answered by mr alexander mccaul sometime of virginia merchant but now of glasgow or by your friend mr ninian minzees of richmond in virginia to whose care the books may be sent you can perhaps tell me whether we may ever hope to see any more of those celtic pieces published manuscript copies of any which are in print it would at any time give me the greatest happiness to receive the glow of one warm thought is to me worth more than money i hear with pleasure from your friend that your path through life is likely to be smoothed by success i wish the business and the pleasures of your situation would admit leisure now and then to scribble a line to one who wishes you every felicity and

albemarle i shall think i cannot better serve them than by putting their papers into your hands if you will be so good as to take them i once mentioned to you the court of albemarle as worthy your attention if you chuse now to go there i would get you to take his papers for that court also they put you in possession of a valuable business the kings attorneys place is vacant there and might be worth your solliciting if you think so you should dispatch an express for commission otherwise you may be prevented write me a line in answer to this and lodge it here within a week as i shall about that time call here to take the law papers and put them into some channel your assistance in these matters will oblige dear fleming your friend and humble servt edmund pendleton john randolph james

general court we find it can no longer    be continued on the same terms the fees allowed by law if regularly paid would barely compensate our incessant labours reimburse our expences and the losses incurred by neglect of our private affairs yet even these rewards confessedly moderate are withheld from us in a great proportion by the unworthy part of our clients some regulation therefore is become absolutely requisite to establish terms more equal between the client and his council to effect this we have come to the following resolution for the invariable observance of which we mutually plight our honour to each other that after the  0th day of october next we will not give an opinion on any case stated to us but on payment of the whole fee nor prosecute or defend any suit or motion unless the tax and one half of the fee be previously advanced excepting those cases only where we choose to act gratis and we hope no person whatever may think of applying to us in any other way to prevent disappointment however in case this should be done we think it proper to give this warning that no such application either verbal or by way of letter will be answered to in the smallest degree we would feel much concern if a thought could be entertained that the worthy part of our clients could disapprove of this measure their conduct has been such as calls for our acknowledgements and might merit exemption from this strictness were such exemption practicable but they will readily perceive this would defeat the purpose and that no distinction of persons can by any means be attempted we hope therefore from  0 their friendship a cheerful concurrence in this plan since the requisition is such only as their punctuallity would of itself prevent edmund pendleton john randolph james

their consideration the dangers    impending over british america from the hostile invasion of a sister colony thought proper that it should be recommended to the several parishes in this colony that they set apart some convenient day for fasting humiliation and prayer devoutly to implore the divine interposition in behalf of an injured and oppressed people and that the minds of his majesty his ministers and parliament might be inspired with wisdom from above to avert from us the dangers which threaten our civil rights and all the evils of civil war we do therefore recommend to the

county  july         at a meeting of the freeholders of the county of albemarle assembled in their collective body at the court house of the said county on the   th of july         resolved that the inhabitants of the several states of british america are subject to the laws which they adopted at their first settlement and to such others as have been since made by their respective legislatures duly constituted and appointed with their own consent that no other legislature whatever can rightly exercise authority over them and that these privileges they hold as the common rights of mankind confirmed by the political constitutions they have respectively assumed and also by several charters of compact from the crown resolved that these their natural and legal rights have in frequent instances been invaded by the parliament of great britain and particularly that they were so by an act lately passed to take away the trade of the inhabitants of the town of boston in the province of massachusetts bay that all such assumptions of unlawful power are dangerous to the right of the british empire in general and should be considered as its common cause and that we will ever be ready to join with our fellowsubjects in every part of the same in executing all those rightful powers which god has given us for the reestablishment and guaranteeing such their constitutional rights when where and by whomsoever invaded it is the opinion of this meeting that the most eligible means of affecting these purposes will be to put an immediate stop to all imports from great britain cotton osnabrigs striped duffil medicines gunpowder lead books and printed papers the necessary tolls and implements for the handicraft arts and manufactures excepted for a limited term and to all    exports thereto after the first day of october which shall be in the year of our lord      and immediately to discontinue all commercial intercourse with every part of the british empire which shall not in like manner break off their commerce with great britain it is the opinion of this meeting that we immediately cease to import all commodities from every part of the world which are subjected by the british parliament to the payment of duties in america it is the opinion of this meeting that these measures should be pursued until a repeal be obtained of the act for blocking up the harbour of boston of the acts prohibiting or restraining internal manufactures in america of the acts imposing on any commodities duties to be paid in america and of the act laying restrictions on the american trade and that on such repeal it will be reasonable to grant to our brethren of great britain such privileges in commerce as may amply compensate their fraternal assistance past and future resolved however that this meeting do submit these their opinions to the convention of deputies from the several counties of this colony and appointed to be held at williamsburg on the first day of august next and also to the general congress of deputies from the several american states when and wheresoever held and that they will concur in these or any other measures which such convention or such congress shall adopt as most expedient for the american good and we do appoint thomas jefferson and john walker our deputies to act for this county    at the said convention and instruct them to conform themselves to these our resolutions and opinions thomas jefferson proposed arms for the united states  a proper device instead of arms for the american states united would be the father presenting the

the following piece was intended to convey to the late meeting of delegates the sentiments of one of their body whose personal attendance was prevented by an accidental illness in it the sources of our present unhappy differences are traced with such faithful accuracy and the opinions entertained by every free american expressed with such a manly firmness that it must be pleasing to the present and may be useful to future ages it will evince to the world the moderation of our late convention who have only touched with tenderness many of the claims insisted on in this pamphlet though every heart acknowledged their justice without the knowledge of the author we have ventured to communicate his sentiments to the public who have certainly a right to know what the best and wisest of their members have thought on a subject in which they are so deeply interested    a summary view      one of the most difficult points to be met by the proposed congress of the colonies was an agreement of a common ground on which to rest their statements of grievances and claims for redress while all the colonies were united in resisting and protesting they nevertheless like the individuals in each colony disagreed on foundations and degrees the various arguments of james otis stephen hopkins john dickinson daniel dulaney and richard bland had each its own supporters and followers and were all almost equally untenable virginia being so prominent in the movement for the congress as well as in colony influence generally her instructions to her attending delegates would carry great if not controlling influence in that body and might supply the field for all future contests under this belief jefferson desired that the strongest position should be taken from the start and so prepared this paper as the instructions for the delegates from virginia to the first congress of it he himself wrote before i left home to attend the convention i prepared what i thought might be given in instruction  0 to the delegates who should be appointed to attend the general congress proposed they were drawn in haste with a number of blanks with some uncertainties and inaccuracies of historical facts which i neglected at the moment knowing they could be readily corrected at the meeting i set out on my journey but was taken sick on the road and was unable to proceed i therefore sent on by express two copies one under cover to patrick henry the other to peyton randolph who i knew would be in the chair of the convention of the former no more was ever heard or known mr henry probably thought it too bold as a first measure as the majority of the members did on the other copy being laid on the table of the convention by peyton randolph as the proposition of a member who was prevented from attendance by sickness on the road tamer sentiments were preferred and i believe wisely preferred the leap i proposed being too long as yet for the mass of our citizens the distance between these and the instructions actually adopted is of some curiosity however as it shews the inequality of pace with which we moved and the prudence required to keep front and rear together my creed had been formed on unsheathing the sword at lexington they printed the paper however and gave it the title of a summary view of the rights of british america in this form it got to london where the opposition took it up shaped it to opposition views and in that form it ran rapidly through several editions see also jeffersons autobiography vol i p       edmund randolph gives a further and somewhat different account of it as follows thomas jefferson who was one of the elected was prevented by indisposition from attending but he forwarded by express for the consideration of its members a series of resolutions i distinctly recollect the applause bestowed on the most of them when they were read to a large company at the house of peyton randolph to whom they were addressed of all the approbation was not equal from the celebrated letters of the pennsylvanian farmer john dickinson we had been instructed to bow to the external taxation of parliament as resulting from our migration and a necessary dependence on the mother country but this composition of mr jefferson shook this conceeded principle although it had been confirmed by a still more celebrated pamphlet of daniel dulaney of maryland and cited by lord chatham as a text book of american rights the young ascended with mr jefferson to the source of those rights the old required time for consideration before they could tread this lofty ground which if it had not been abandoned at least had not been fully occupied throughout america from what cause it happened that the resolutions were not printed by order of the convention does not appear but as they were not adopted several of the authors admirers subscribed for their publication when the time of writing is remembered a range of inquiry not then very frequent and marching far beyond the politics of the day will surely be allowed them—ms history of virginia p       these resolutions were printed in a twentythreepaged pamphlet at williamsburg from a

subject of an address to his majesty from the several states of british america to this pamphlet is prefixed an address to the king severely reflecting on the late measures of government and written with much freedom and boldness but by whom we are not told this preface here alluded to was written by arthur lee and is as follows thomas jefferson king to the king sir there is not a man of thought in the whole nation who does not espouse bad measures from bad principles but is justly alarmed and seriously anxious for the common good affairs of such magnitude now employ the public attention as seem to involve in them the fate of empire the times are big with great events what will be the consequences it is not in human sagacity to foretel but if the same system be pursued which for a long time hath employed the attention of your majestys ministers they ought to tremble for their heads the present contentions with america if not soon happily terminated must end in such scenes of trouble bloodshed and devastation which in contemplation    alone shock us with horror but little time remains for deliberation or choice a blow will lead on to the decisive scene and the tyranny begun this era of your majestys reign is likely to be marked with the most important characters it is impossible for subjects to stand by idle unaffected spectators when they see their sovereign and themselves nearly involved in distresses which for ought he can foresee may end in the ruin of both you sir may lose your sovereignty and honour we our liberties fortunes and lives the charge of presumption upon individuals for speaking freely upon these important things is at once taken off by the evidence of things themselves and the transcendant interest that every man has in them of affairs of state of the artifice cunning address and subtility of courts it is the general lot to be ignorant but of the great principles of government especially of this free state of those laws and proceedings that are either subversive or corroborative of the system many are as able to judge as any minister employed in your majestys service these with the first laws of nature the prerogatives of man in human society with the sacred and immutable laws of justice equity moderation and wisdom men fully understand who were never tutored or well received at court where indeed for the most part men are more likely to lose than gain accurate ideas of these things they are not among the arcana imperii we can judge of them and have a fair undoubted constitutional right as free subjects who claim liberty by birthright and enjoy it by the laws    to apply these principles to the present conduct of your majestys ministers and in justice bound to our country and ourselves and that fidelity we owe sir to you as our sovereign we openly declare that the whole proceedings against our brethren in america who are entitled in common with ourselves to the privileges of men and the liberties franchises and protection of englishmen are in open violation of the natural laws of equity and justice and unparalleled infractions upon the principles and promulgated laws of this free state not to say that every idea of good policy is sacrificed to maintain and inforce the most vicious and dangerous system that ever infatuated despots pursued fruitless were the hopes that these few pages will effect what the sagest counsels the most consummate wisdom and plainest remonstrances of some of the wisest and best men of the present age have not been able to accomplish but if the perusal either by your majesty or your ministers should for a moment suspend the fatal counsels or designs which are now taking or seem systematically planned to overturn american liberty i shall think my labours well rewarded god is my witness that i write not these things to excite sedition or stir up rebellion i should deem my life well disposed of if by the sacrifice your majesty could learn the wisdom of righteous government and your ministers be taught to counsel good things happy should i be to convince your majesty where legal authority ends and tyranny begins and that your dignity alone consists in the happiness of your subjects and    that when virtue and justice forsake your councils error and ruin must inevitably ensue with your majestys ministers we can keep no longer if at any time we pitied their innocent infirmities that pity has long ago been converted into abhorrence from the wickedness of their counsels and the injustice of their deeds by their breaches upon your prerogative sir they have broken down the legal barriers of the constitution and destroyed the distinctions of government they have changed or attempted to change lawful possession into arbitrary dominion and in the mad career they may endeavor to make their sovereign dispense with every thing that entitles him to obedience and by this means convert the first duty of subjects into an opposition which the great and primary law of nature selfdefence makes necessary those cruel inexpedient tyrannical measures which first they adopted respecting america notwithstanding the perilous circumstances into which they have brought both the colonies and our own country they carry violently on as if they could persuade us that perseverance was integrity and open opposition state necessity their system is not only manifestly repugnant to the laws of the state but it runs counter to the whole stream of authority and examples derived from the various histories of the several states of the world from them they ought to have learned that confidence is the first and strongest principle of obedience and which once lost is seldom recovered and that almost all struggles for liberty against violence and oppression have been crowned with success    and without impiety whatever doctrines concerning providence may prevail at court we attribute such success to the interposition of heaven and to heaven the americans now appeal and would to god that any accommodations could soften those rigours which your majestys ministers seemed determined to pursue but it seems that no equivalent but liberty will be deemed a sufficient satisfaction for the affronts which the honest struggles for freedom have given under the pretence of law natural justice and equity fall defeated and the constitution is wounded under the semblance of a temporary cure—your ministers sir are total strangers to those nice temperaments and allays to mitigate the evils and maladies of the state in which much of the wisdom of government consists they strain where they ought to relax and think to accomplish by exertion what they want abilities to effect by lenient measures they do not see these happy mediums so necessary in the adjustments of great affairs by which authority is preserved on the one hand and allegiance secured on the other these impracticable men renounce all expedients but power they have recourse to arms when they should seek only counsel they attempt that by oppression which justice well administered would more effectually accomplish—they talk of enforcing the laws when they are violating the constitution and urge the necessities of state when they themselves are the authors of the very necessities of which they complain they are for doing that in a free state which the most despotic in like circumstances if wise would carefully    avoid what is there sir to countenance so great a hazard of ruining america and distressing ourselves of exciting them to arms and ourselves to the slaughter of our own sons have your ministers sir discovered mines of inexhaustible riches in america which they wish to plunder to discharge our enormous national debt alas they will find no other riches but what a strenuous industry has gained virtue which the love of liberty has inspired and a race of men not degenerate enough to part with freedom without a noble struggle before their charters were violated their laws infringed their trade oppressed one of their chief cities and its inhabitants sent to awe and intimidate them their lives and fortunes were at our disposal can subjects offer can they give more i will be bold to declare to your majesty that before these fatal proceedings no nation in the known history of the world considering the growing strength grandeur and extent of that mighty empire tho dependent could ever boast such confidence and obedience as great britain did in her colonies these are now in danger of being irrecoverably lost not by their defection but our own unaccountable folly quos deus vult perdere eos prius dementat your ministers sir as tyrants ever do justify their oppressions by the resistance they have met with and perhaps have imposed upon their prince by talking of the satisfaction which the honour and dignity of the crown should receive upon their supposed violation satisfy sir the dignity and honour of the crown but let your ministers beware that  0 they do not sacrifice your crown to the vain and impracticable schemes of satisfying its honour and maintaining its dignity i will boldly affirm sir that if the dignity and honour of the crown are to be purchased at the rate your ministers seem to estimate them that the price will be held too dear by every good and virtuous man in the nation and here sir pause—disappoint your ministers and gratify millions of your subjects the americans have not as yet revolted they have not thrown off their allegiance their submission is so habitual that it cannot easily be dispensed with do them but justice and they will esteem it an act of grace they will call that a favour now which hereafter they will claim as their right what they now demand the following pages which with all due submission i offer to your majesty will declare—hitherto they have kept themselves within proper limits and have extended their requests no farther than they were countenanced by the laws and that friendly protection which from our country they had reason to expect but further oppressions sir may probably change their mode of suit allegiance will sometimes relax its submission wisdom itself does not intermeddle in the regulation of extremities and what can moderate the conduct of despair when dangers surround men they are not very nice in the method of salvation and the only means of extricating themselves will appear the right when our friends rise up to oppress us it is pardonable and justifiable to throw ourselves into the arms    even of an enemy for protection i am with all due submission and allegiance your majestys faithful subject tribunus       a summary view etc resolved that it be an instruction to the said deputies when assembled in general congress with the deputies from the other states of british america to propose to the said congress that an humble and dutiful address be presented to his majesty begging leave to lay before him as chief magistrate of the british empire the united complaints of his majestys subjects in america complaints which are excited by many unwarrantable encroachments and usurpations attempted to be made by the legislature of one part of the empire upon those rights which god and the laws have given equally and independently to all to represent to his majesty that these his states have often individually made humble application to his imperial throne to obtain through its intervention some redress of their injured rights to none of which was ever even an answer condescended humbly to hope that this their joint address penned in the language of truth and divested of those expressions of servility which would persuade his majesty that we were asking favours and not rights shall obtain from his majesty a more respectful acceptance and this his majesty will think we have reason to expect when he reflects that he is no more    than the chief officer of the people appointed by the laws and circumscribed with definite powers to assist in working the great machine of government erected for their use and consequently subject   to their superintendance and in order that these our rights as well as the invasions of them may be laid more fully before his majesty to take a view of them from the origin and first settlement of these countries to remind him that our ancestors before their emigration to america were the free inhabitants of the british dominions in europe and possessed a right which nature has given to all men of departing from the country in which chance not choice has placed them of going in quest of new habitations and of there establishing new societies under such laws and regulations as to them shall seem most likely to promote public happiness that their saxon ancestors had under this universal law in like manner left their native wilds and woods in the north of europe had possessed themselves of the island of britain then less charged with inhabitants and had established there that system of laws which has so long been the glory and protection of that country nor was ever any claim of superiority or dependence asserted over them by that mother country from which they had migrated and were such a claim made it is believed that his majestys subjects in great britain have too firm a feeling of the rights derived to them from their ancestors to bow down the sovereignty of their state before such visionary pretensions and it is thought that no circumstance has occurred to distinguish materially the    british from the saxon emigration america was conquered and her settlement made and firmly established at the expense of individuals and not of the british public their own blood was spilt in acquiring lands for their settlements their own fortunes expended in making that settlement effectual for themselves they fought for themselves they conquered and for themselves alone they have right to hold not a shilling  was ever issued from the public treasures of his majesty or his ancestors for their assistance till of very late times after the colonies had become established on a firm and permanent footing that then indeed having become valuable to great britain for her commercial purposes his parliament   was pleased to lend them assistance against the enemy who would fain have drawn to herself the benefits of their commerce to the great aggrandizement of herself and danger of great britain such assistance and in such circumstances they had often before given to portugal and  other allied states with whom they carry on a commercial intercourse yet these states never supposed that by calling in her aid they thereby submitted themselves to her sovereignty had such terms been proposed they would have rejected them with disdain and trusted for better to the moderation of their enemies or to a vigorous exertion of their own force we do not however mean to underrate those aids which to us were doubtless valuable on whatever principles granted but we would shew that they    cannot give a title to that authority which the british parliament would arrogate over us and that they may amply be repaid by our giving to the inhabitants of great britain such exclusive privileges in trade as may be advantageous to them and at the same time not too restrictive to ourselves that settlements having been thus effected in the wilds of america the emigrants thought proper to adopt that system of laws under which they had hitherto lived in the mother country and to continue their union with her by submitting themselves to the same common sovereign who was thereby made the central link connecting the several parts of the empire thus newly multiplied but that not long were they permitted however far they thought themselves removed from the hand of oppression to hold undisturbed the rights thus acquired at the hazard of their lives and loss of their fortunes a family of princes was then on the british throne whose treasonable crimes against their people brought on them afterwards the exertion of those sacred and sovereign rights of punishment reserved in the hands of the people for cases of extreme necessity and judged by the constitution unsafe to be delegated to any other judicature while every day brought forth some new and unjustifiable exertion of power over their subjects on that side the water it was not   to be expected that those here much less able at that time to oppose the designs of despotism should be exempted from injury accordingly that country which had been acquired    by the lives the labours and the fortunes of individual adventurers was by these princes several times parted  out and distributed among the favourites and  followers of their fortunes and by an assumed right to the crown alone were  erected into distinct and independent governments a measure which it is believed his majestys prudence and understanding would prevent him from imitating at this day as no exercise of such power of dividing and dismembering a country has ever occurred in his majestys realm of england though now of very ancient standing nor could it be justified or    acquiesced under there or in any other part of his majestys empire that the exercise of a free trade with all parts of the world possessed by the american colonists as of natural right and which no law of their own had taken away or abridged was next the object of unjust encroachment some of the colonies having thought proper to continue the administration of their government in the name and under the authority of his majesty king charles the first whom notwithstanding his late deposition by the commonwealth of england they continued in the sovereignty of their state the parliament for the commonwealth took the same in high offence and assumed upon themselves the power of prohibiting their trade with all other parts of the world except the island of great britain this arbitrary act however they soon recalled and by   solemn treaty entered into on the   th day of march      between the said commonwealth by their commissioners and the colony of virginia by their house of burgesses it was expressly stipulated by the  th article of the said treaty that they should have free trade as the people of england do enjoy to all places and with all nations according to the laws of that commonwealth but that upon the restoration of his majesty king charles the second their rights of free commerce fell once more a victim to arbitrary power and by several acts  of his reign as well as of some of his successors the trade of the colonies was laid    under such restrictions as shew what hopes they might form from the justice of a british parliament were its uncontrouled power admitted over these states history has informed us that bodies of men as well as individuals are susceptible of the spirit of tyranny a view of these acts of parliament for regulation as it has been affectedly called of the american trade if all other evidence were removed out of the case would undeniably evince the truth of this observation besides the duties they impose on our articles of export and import they prohibit our going to any markets northward of cape finisterre in the kingdom of spain for the sale of commodities which great britain will not take from us and for the purchase of others with which she cannot supply us and that for no other than the arbitrary purposes of purchasing for themselves by a sacrifice of our rights and interests certain privileges in their commerce with an allied state who in confidence that their exclusive trade with america will be continued while the principles and power of the british parliament be the same have indulged themselves in every exorbitance which their avarice could dictate or our necessities extort have raised their commodities called for in america to the double and treble of what they sold for before such exclusive privileges were given them and of what better commodities of the same kind would cost us elsewhere and at the  0 same time give us much less for what we could carry thither than might be had at more convenient ports that these acts prohibit us from carrying in quest of other purchasers the surplus of our tobaccoes  0 remaining after the consumption of great britain is supplied so that we must leave them with the british merchant for whatever he will please to allow us to be by him reshipped to foreign markets where he will reap the benefits of making sale of them for full value that to heighten still the idea of parliamentary justice and to shew with what moderation they are like to exercise power where themselves are to feel no part of its weight we take leave to mention to his majesty certain other acts of british parliament by which they would prohibit us from manufacturing for our own use the articles we raise on our own lands with our own labour by an act  passed in the  th year of the reign of his late majesty king george the second an american subject is forbidden to make a hat for himself of the fur which he has taken perhaps on his own soil an instance of despotism to which no parallel can be produced in the most arbitrary ages of british history by one other act  passed in the   d year of the same reign the iron which we make we are forbidden to manufacture and heavy as that article is and necessary in every branch of husbandry besides commission and insurance we are to pay freight for it to great britain and freight for it back again for the purpose of supporting not men but machines in the island of great britain in the same spirit of equal and impartial legislation is to be viewed the act of parliament  passed in the  th year of the same reign by which american lands are made subject to the demands of british creditors while their own lands were still    continued unanswerable for their debts from which one of these conclusions must necessarily follow either that justice is not the same in america as in britain or else that the british parliament pay less regard to it here than there but that we do not point out to his majesty the injustice of these acts with intent to rest on that principle the cause of their    nullity but to shew that experience confirms the propriety of those political principles which exempt us from the jurisdiction of the british parliament the true ground on which we declare these acts void is that the british parliament has no right to exercise its authority over us that these exercises of usurped power have not been confined to instances alone in which themselves were interested but they have also intermeddled with the regulation of the internal affairs of the colonies the act of the  th of anne for establishing a post office in america seems to have had little connection with british convenience except that of accommodating his majestys ministers and favourites with the sale of a lucrative and easy office that thus we have hastened through the reigns which preceded his majestys during which the violations of our rights were less alarming because repeated at more distant intervals than that rapid and bold succession of injuries which is likely to distinguish the present from all other periods of american story scarcely have our minds been able to emerge from the astonishment into which one stroke of parliamentary thunder had involved us before another more heavy and more alarming is fallen on us single    acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a day but a series of oppressions begun at a distinguished period and pursued unalterably through every change of ministers too plainly prove a deliberate and systematical plan of reducing us to slavery that the act  passed in the  th year of his majestys reign entitled an act for granting certain duties in the british colonies and plantations in america c one other act  passed in the  th year of his reign entitled an act for granting and applying certain stamp duties and other duties in the british colonies and plantations in america c one other act  passed in the  th year of his reign entitled an act for the better securing the depend  ency of his majestys dominions in america upon the crown and parliament of great britain and one other act  passed in the  th year of his reign entitled an act for granting duties on paper tea c form that connected chain of parliamentary usurpation which has already been the subject of frequent applications to his majesty and the houses of lords and commons of great britain and no answers having yet been condescended to any of these we shall not trouble his majesty with a repetition of the matters they contained but that one other act  passed in the same  th year of the  reign having been a peculiar attempt    must ever require peculiar mention it is entitled an act for suspending the legislature of new york one free and independent legislature hereby takes upon itself to suspend the powers of another free and independent as itself this exhibiting a phœnomenon unknown in nature the creator and creature of his own power not only the principles of common sense but the common  feelings of human nature must be surrendered up before his majestys subjects here can be persuaded to believe that they hold their political existence at the will of a british parliament shall these governments be dissolved their property annihilated and their people reduced to a state of nature at the imperious breath of a body of men whom they never saw in whom they never confided and over whom they have no powers of punishment or removal let their crimes against the american public be ever so great can any one reason be assigned why   0000 electors in the island of great britain should give law to four millions in the states of america every individual of whom is equal to every individual of them in virtue in understanding and in bodily strength were this to be admitted instead of being a free people as we have hitherto supposed and mean to continue ourselves we should suddenly be found the slaves not of one but of   0000 tyrants distinguished too from all others by this singular circumstance that they are removed    from the reach of fear the only restraining motive which may hold  the hand of a tyrant    that by an act  to discontinue in such manner and for such time as they are therein mentioned the landing and discharging lading or shipping of goods wares and merchandize at the town and within the harbour of boston in the province of massachusetts bay in north america which was passed at the last session of british parliament a large and populous town whose trade was their sole subsistence was deprived of that trade and involved in utter ruin let us for a while suppose the question of right suspended in order to examine this act on principles of justice an act of parliament had been passed imposing duties on teas to be paid in america against which act the americans had protested as inauthoritative the east india company who till that time had never sent a pound of tea to america on their own account step forth on that occasion the assertors of parliamentary right and send hither many ship loads of that obnoxious commodity the masters of their several vessels however on their arrival to america wisely attended to admonition and returned with their cargoes in the province of new england  alone the remonstrances of the people were disregarded and a compliance after being many days waited for was flatly refused whether in this the master of the vessel was governed by his obstinacy or his instructions let those who know say there are extraordinary situations which require extraordinary interposition an exasperated people who feel that they possess power are not easily restrained    within limits strictly regular a number of them assembled in the town of boston threw the tea into the ocean and dispersed without doing any other act of violence if in this they did wrong they were known and were amenable to the laws of the land against which it could not be objected that they had ever in any instance been obstructed or diverted from their regular course in favour of popular offenders they should therefore not have been distrusted on this occasion    but that ill fated colony had formerly been bold in their enmities against the house of stuart and were now devoted to ruin by that unseen hand which governs the momentous affairs of this great empire on the partial representations of a few worthless ministerial dependants whose constant office it has been to keep that government embroiled and who by their treacheries hope to obtain the dignity of the british knighthood  without calling for the party accused without asking a proof without attempting a distinction between the guilty and the innocent the whole of that ancient and wealthy town is in a moment reduced from opulence to beggary men who had spent their lives in extending the british commerce who had invested in that place the wealth their honest endeavors had merited found themselves and their families thrown at once on the world for subsistence by its charities not the hundredth part of the inhabitants of that town had been concerned in the act complained of many of them were in    great britain and in other parts beyond sea yet all were involved in one indiscriminate ruin by a new executive power unheard of till then that of a british parliament a property of the value of many millions of money was sacrificed to revenge not repay the loss of a few thousands this is administering justice with a heavy hand indeed and when is this tempest to be arrested in its course two wharfs are to be opened again when his majesty shall think proper the residue which lined the extensive shores of the bay of boston are forever interdicted the exercise of commerce this little exception seems to have been thrown in for no other purpose than that of setting a precedent for investing his majesty with legislative powers if the pulse of his people shall beat calmly under this experiment another and another shall be tried till the measure of despotism be filled up it would be an insult on common sense to pretend that this exception was made in order to restore its commerce to that great town the trade which cannot be received at two wharfs alone must of necessity be transferred to some other place to which    it will soon be followed by that of the two wharfs considered in this light it would be insolent and cruel mockery at the annihilation of the town of boston by the act  for the suppression of riots and tumults in the town of boston passed also in the last session of parliament a murder committed there is if the governor pleases to be tried in a court of kings bench in the island of great britain by a jury of    middlesex the witnesses too on receipt of such a sum as the governor shall think it reasonable for them to expend are to enter into recognizance to appear at the trial this is in other words taxing them to the moment of their recognizance and that amount may be whatever a governor pleases for who does his majesty think can be prevailed on to cross the atlantic for the sole purpose of bearing evidence to a fact his expences are to be borne indeed as they shall be estimated by a governor but who are to feed the wife and children whom he leaves behind and who have had no other subsistence but his daily labour those epidemical disorders too so terrible in a foreign climate is the cure of them to be estimated among the articles of expence and their danger to be warded off by the almighty power of parliament and the wretched criminal if he happen to have offended on the american side stripped of his privilege of trial by peers of his vicinage removed from the place where alone full evidence could be obtained without money without council without friends without exculpatory proof is tried before judges predetermined to condemn the cowards who would suffer a countryman to be torn from the bowels of their society in order to be thus offered a sacrifice to parliamentary tyranny would merit that everlasting infamy now fixed on the authors of the act a clause  for a similar purpose had been introduced into an act passed in the twelfth year of his majestys reign entitled an act for the better securing and preserving his majestys dockyards magazines    ships ammunition and stores against which as    meriting the same censures the several colonies have already protested that these are acts of power assumed by a body of men foreign to our constitutions and unacknowledged by our laws against which we do on behalf of the inhabitants of british america enter this our solemn and determined protest and we do earnestly entreat his majesty as yet the only mediatory power between the several states of the british empire to recommend to his parliament of great britain the total revocation of these acts which however nugatory they may yet prove the cause of further discontents and jealousies among us that we next proceed to consider the conduct of his majesty as holding the executive powers of the laws of these states and mark out his deviations from the line of duty by the constitution of great britain as well of the several american states his majesty professes the power of refusing to pass into a law any bill which has already passed the other two branches of legislature his majesty however and his ancestors conscious of the impropriety of opposing their single opinion to the united wisdom of two houses of parliament while their proceedings were unbiassed by interested principles for several ages past have modestly declined the exercise of this power in that part of his empire called great britain but by change of circumstances other principles than those of justice simply obtained an influence on their determinations the addition of new states to the british empire has produced an addition of new    and sometimes opposite interests it is now therefore the great office of his majesty to resume exercise of his negative power and to prevent the passage of laws by any one legislature of the empire which might bear injuriously on the rights and interests of another yet this will not excuse the wanton exercise of this power which we have seen his majesty practise on the laws of the american legislatures for the most trifling reasons and sometimes for no conceivable reason at all his majesty has rejected laws of the most salutary tendency the abolition of do  mestic slavery is the great object of desire in those colonieswhere it was unhappily introduced in their infant state but previous to the enfranchisement of the slaves we have it is necessary to exclude all further importations from africa yet our repeated attempts to effect this by prohibitions and by imposing duties which might amount to a prohibition have been hitherto defeated by his majestys negative thus preferring the immediate advantages of a few african  corsairs to the lasting interests of the american states and to the rights of human nature deeply wounded by this infamous practice nay the single interposition of an interested individual against a law was scarcely ever known to fail of success though in the opposite scale were placed the interests of the whole country that this is so shameful an abuse of a power trusted with his majesty for other purposes as if not reformed would call for some legal restrictions with equal inattention to the necessities of his  0 people here has his majesty permitted our laws to lie neglected in england for years neither confirming them by his assent nor annulling them by his negative so that such of them as have no suspending clause we hold on the most precarious of all tenures his majestys will and such of them as suspend themselves till his majestys assent be obtained we have feared might be called into existence at some future and distant period when the time and change of circumstances shall have rendered them destructive to his people here and to render this aggrievance still more oppressive his majesty by his instructions has laid his governors under such restrictions that they can pass no law of any moment unless it have such suspending clause so that however immediate may be the call for legislative interposition the law cannot be executed till it has twice crossed the atlantic by which time the evil may have spent its whole force but in what terms reconcileable to majesty and at the same time to truth shall we speak of a late instruction to his majestys  governor of the colony of virginia by which he is forbidden to assent to any law for the division of a county unless the new county    will consent to have no representative in assembly that colony has as yet fixed no boundary to the westward their westward counties therefore are of indefinite extent some of them are actually seated many hundred miles from their eastward limits is it possible then that his majesty can    have bestowed a single thought on the situation of those people who in order to obtain justice for injuries however great or small must by the laws of that colony attend their county court at such a distance with all their witnesses monthly till their litigation be determined or does his majesty seriously wish and publish it to the world that his subjects should give up the glorious right of representation with all the benefits derived from that and submit themselves the absolute slaves of his sovereign will or is it rather meant to confine the legislative body to their present numbers that they may be the cheaper bargain whenever they shall become worth a purchase one of the articles of impeachment against trestlain and the other judges of westministerhall in the reign of richard the second for which they suffered death as traitors to their country was that they had advised the king that he might dissolve his parliament at any time and succeeding kings have adopted the opinion of these unjust judges since the establishment  however of  the british constitution at the glorious revolution  on its free and antient principles neither his majesty nor his ancestors have exercised such a power of dissolution in the island of great britain and when his majesty was petitioned by the united voice of his people there to dissolve the present parliament who had become    obnoxious to them his ministers were heard to declare in open parliament that his majesty possessed no such power by the constitution  but how different their language and his practice here to declare as their duty required the known rights of their country to oppose the usurpations of every foreign judicature to disregard the imperious mandates of a minister or governor have been the avowed causes of dissolving houses of representatives in america but if such powers be    really vested in his majesty can he suppose they are there placed to awe the members from such purposes as these when the representative body have lost their confidence of their constituents when they have notoriously made sale of their most valuable rights when they have assumed to themselves powers which the people never put into their hands then indeed their continuing in office becomes dangerous to the state and calls for an exercise of the power of dissolution such being the causes for which the representative body should and should not be dissolved will it not appear strange to an unbiased observer that that of great britain was not dissolved while those of the colonies have repeatedly incurred that sentence    but your majesty or your governors have carried this power beyond every limit known or provided for by the laws after dissolving one house of representatives they have refused to call another so that for a great length of time the legislature provided by the laws has been out of existence from the nature of things every society must at all times possess within itself the sovereign powers of legislation the feelings of human nature revolt against the supposition of a state so situated as that it may not in any emergency provide against dangers which perhaps threatened immediate ruin while those bodies are in existence to whom the people have delegated the powers of legislation they alone possess and may exercise those powers but when they are dissolved by the lopping off one or more of their branches the power reverts to the people who may exercise it to unlimited extent either assembling together in person sending deputies or in any other way they may think proper  we forbear to trace consequences further the dangers are conspicuous with which this practice is replete that we shall at this time take notice of an error in the nature of our land holdings which crept in at a very early period of our settlement the introduction of the feudal tenures into the kingdom of england though ancient is well enough understood to set this matter in a proper light in the earlier ages    of the saxon settlement feudal holdings were  0 certainly altogether unknown and very few if any had been introduced at the time of the norman conquest our saxon ancestors held their lands as they did their personal property in absolute dominion disencumbered with any superior answering nearly to the nature of those possessions which the feudalists term allodial william the norman first introduced that system generally the land which had belonged to those who fell in the battle of hastings and in the subsequent insurrections of his reign formed a considerable proportion of the lands of the whole kingdom these he granted out subject to feudal duties as did he also those of a great number of his new subjects who by persuasions or threats were induced to surrender them for that purpose but still much was left in the hands of his saxon subjects held of no superior and not subject to feudal conditions these therefore by express laws enacted to render uniform the system of military defence were made liable to the same military duties as if they had been feuds and the norman lawyers soon found means to saddle them also with all the other feudal burthens but still they had not been surrendered to the king they were not derived from his grant and therefore they were not holden of him a general principle indeed was introduced that all lands in england were held either mediately or immediately of the crown but this was borrowed from those holdings which were truly feudal and only applied to others for the purposes of illustration feudal holdings were therefore but exceptions out of the    saxon laws of possession under which all lands were held in absolute right these therefore still form the basis or groundwork of the common law to prevail wheresoever the exceptions have taken place america was not conquered by william the norman nor its lands surrendered to him or any of his successors possessions there are undoubtedly of the allodial nature our ancestors however who emigrated hither were farmers  not lawyers the fictitious principle that all lands belong originally to the king they were early persuaded to believe    real and accordingly took grants of their own lands from the crown and while the crown continued to grant for small sums and on reasonable rents there was no inducement to arrest the error and lay it open to the public view but his majesty has lately taken on him to advance the terms of purchase and of holding to the double of what they were by which means the acquisition of lands being rendered difficult the population of our country is likely to be checked it is time therefore for us to lay this matter before his majesty and to declare that he has no right to grant lands of himself from the nature and purpose of civil institutions all the lands within the limits which any particular society has circumscribed around itself are assumed by that society and subject to their allotment only this may be done by themselves assembled collectively or by their legislature to whom they may have delegated sovereign authority and if they are alloted in either of these ways each individual of the society may appropriate to himself    such lands as he finds vacant and occupancy will give him title that in order to force the arbitrary measures before complained of his majesty has from time to time sent among us large bodies of armed forces not made up of the people here nor raised by the authority of our laws did his majesty possess such a right as this it might swallow up all our other rights whenever he should think proper but his majesty has no right to land a single armed man on our shores and those whom he sends here are liable to our laws made for the suppression and punishment of riots and unlawful assemblies or are hostile bodies invading us in defiance of the law when in the course of the late war it became expedient that a body of hanoverian troops should be brought over for the defence of great britain his majestys grandfather our late sovereign did not pretend to introduce them under any authority he possessed such a measure would have given just alarm to his subjects in great britain whose liberties would not be safe if armed men of another country and of another spirit might be brought into the realm at any time without the con  sent of their legislature he therefore applied to parliament who passed an act for that purpose limiting the number to be brought in and the time they were to continue in like manner is his majesty restrained in every part of the empire he possesses indeed the executive power of the laws in every state but they are the laws of the particular state which he is to administer within that state and not those of any one within the limits of another every    state must judge for itself the number of armed men which they may safely trust among them of whom they are to consist and under what restrictions they shall be laid to render these proceedings still more criminal against our laws instead of subjecting the military to the civil powers his majesty has expressly made the civil subordinate to the military but can his majesty thus put down all law under his feet can he erect a power superior to that which erected himself he has done it indeed by force but let him remember that force cannot give right that these are our grievances which we have thus laid before his majesty with that freedom of language and sentiment which becomes a free people claiming their rights as derived from the laws of nature and not as the gift of their chief magistrate let those flatter who fear it is not an american art to give praise which is not due might be well from the venal but would ill beseem those who are asserting the rights of human nature they know and will therefore say that kings are the servants not the proprietors of the people open your breast sire to liberal and expanded thought let not the name of george the third be a blot in the page of history your are surrounded by english counsellors but remember that they are parties you have no minister for american affairs because you have none taken up from among us nor amenable to the laws on which they are to give you advice it behooves you therefore to think and to act for yourself and your people the great principles of right and wrong are    legible to every reader to pursue them requires not the aid of many counsellors the whole art of government consists    in the art of being honest only aim to do your duty and mankind will give you credit where you fail no longer persevere in sacrificing the rights of one part of the empire to the inordinate desires of another but deal out to all equal and impartial right let no act be passed by any one legislature which may infringe on the rights and liberties of another this is the important post in which fortune has placed you holding the balance of a great if a well poised empire this sire is the advice of your great american council on the observance of which may perhaps depend your felicity and future fame and the preservation of that harmony which alone can continue both in great britain and america the reciprocal advantages of their connection it is neither our wish nor our interest to separate from her we are willing on our part to sacrifice everything which reason can ask to the restoration of that tranquillity for which all must wish on their part let them be ready to establish union and  a generous plan let them name their terms but let them be just accept of every commercial preference it is in our power to give for such things as we can raise for their use or they make for ours but let them not think to exclude us from going to other markets to dispose of those commodities which they

own the god who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time the hand of force may destroy but cannot disjoin them this sire is our last our determined resolution and that you will be pleased to interpose with that efficacy which your earnest endeavors may ensure to procure redress of these our great grievances to quiet the minds of your subjects in british america against any apprehensions of future encroachment to establish fraternal love and harmony through the whole empire and that these may continue to the last ages of time is the fervent prayer of all british america  0

ought not to have done thomas jefferson dec        archibald cary benjamin harrison to archibald cary and benjamin harrison j mss dec  th      dear sir —as i mean to be a conscientious observer of the measures generally thought requisite for the preservation of our independent rights so i think myself bound to account to my country for any act of mine which might wear an appearance of contravening them i therefore take the liberty of stating to you the following matter that thro your friendly intervention it may be communicated to the committee of your country you may remember it was about the last of may that the house of burgesses after its dissolution met in the raleigh and formed our first association  against the future use of tea only tho the proceedings of the ministry against the town of boston were then well known to us i believe nobody thought at that time of extending our association further to the total interruption of our commerce with britain or if it was proposed by any which i do not recollect it was condemned by the general sense of the members who formed that association two or three days therefore after this i wrote to cary  co of london for    pr of sash windows to be sent me ready made  glazed with a small parcel of spare glass to mend with this letter went    by a ship which sailed abt the  d of june just before power arrived here  i did not suppose they would send them till power should come in again in the spring of      about the middle of june as nearly as i can recollect a few of the late members were again convened in consequence of fresh advices from boston and then it was suggested a more extensive association might be necessary a convention met for that purpose the first of august and formed a new association of which i received a copy about the   th of the month but as a general congress was appointed to be held within four weeks of that time to reconsider the same matters and it was agreed that our association should be subject to any alterations that they might recommend i did not write to countermand my order thinking i should have sufficient time after the final determinations of the congress should be known to countermand it before power should sail in the spring accordly within a few days after receiving a copy of the general association i wrote to cary  co not to send the sashes glass c which i had ordered  gave my letter to the care of a gentleman mr evans just then going downward who promised to send it out speedily but three or four days after i received a letter from those gentl dated aug    in which they informed me my window frames and glass are ready but that it being necessary to detain them about a month to harden the puttying they were not sent by that but might be expected by the first ship afterwards from this i conclude they may be near arriving at this time in which case they will come under the  st   0th    articles of the association in order therefore that no proceeding of mine might give a handle for traducing our measures i thought it better previously to lay before your committee within whose ward they will probably be landed a full state of the matter by which it might be seen under what expectations i had failed to give an earlier countermand and to shew that as they come under the prohibitions of the continental association which without the spirit of prophecy could not have been foretold when i ordered them so i mean they shall be subject to its condemnation to your committee therefore if landed within their county i submit the disposal of them which shall be obeyed as soon as made known to their and your most humble servt dec        a copy of this sent by mr mazzei to col a cary  another to col b harrison thomas jefferson mar         motion in convention of virginia  v s a mar         ordered that certain paragraphs in the public papers said to have been the votes of the house of representatives of new york be read  the house of convention taking into their consideration that the said province of new york did by their delegates in general congress solemnly accede    to the compact of association there formed for the preservation of american rights that a defection from such their compact would be a perfidy too atrocious to be charged on a sister colony but on the most authentic information and also doubting whether from some radical defect in the constitution of that government the sense of their house of representatives on questions of this nature should be considered as the sense of the people in general come to the following resolution resolved that it be an instruction to the committee of correspondence for this colony that they procure authentic information from the committee of correspondence for the province of new york or otherwise whether their house of representatives by any vote or votes whatsoever have deserted the union with the other american colonies formed in general congress for the preservation of their just rights whether the other colonies are to consider such vote or votes as declaring truly the sense of the people of their province in general and as forming a rule for their future conduct and if they are not so to be considered that then they inform us by their names and other sufficient descriptions of the individuals who may have concurred in such vote or votes and that the said committee lay such their information before the next convention or assembly    thomas jefferson draft of a resolution of the virginia convention  v s a his excellency the governor having by proclamation bearing date the   st day of march  in the present year declared that his majesty hath given orders that all vacant lands within this colony shall be put up in lot to public sale and that the highest bidder for such lots shall be the purchaser thereof and shall hold the same subject to a reservation of onepenny sterling per acre by way of annual quit rent and all mines of gold silver and precious stones which terms are an innovation on the established usage of granting lands within this colony resolved that a committee be appointed to enquire whether    his majesty may of right advance the terms of granting lands in this colony and make report thereof to the next general assembly or convention and that in the mean time it be recommended to all persons whatever to forbear purchasing or accepting grants of lands on the conditions aforementioned and that be appointed to be of the said committee thomas jefferson may        dr william small to dr william small  may        dear sir —within this week we have received the unhappy news of an action of considerable magnitude between the kings troops and our brethren of boston in which it is said five hundred of the former with the earl of percy are slain  that such an action has occurred is undoubted though perhaps the circumstances may not have reached us with truth this accident has cut off our last hope of reconciliation and a phrensy of revenge seems to have seized all ranks of people it is a lamentable circumstance that the only mediatory power acknowledged by both parties instead of leading to a reconciliation of his divided people should pursue the incendiary purpose of still blowing up the flames as we find him constantly doing in every speech and public declaration this may perhaps be intended to intimidate into acquiescence but the effect has been most  00 unfortunately otherwise a little knowledge of human nature and attention to its ordinary workings might have foreseen that the spirits of the people here were in a state in which they were more likely to be provoked than frightened by haughty deportment and to fill up the measure of irritation a proscription of individuals has been substituted in the room of just trial can it be believed that a grateful people will suffer those to be consigned to execution whose sole crime has been the developing and asserting their rights had the parliament possessed the power of reflection they would have avoided a measure as impotent as it was inflammatory when i saw lord chathams bill i entertained high hope that a reconciliation could have been brought about the difference between his terms and those offered by our congress might have been accommodated if entered on by both parties with a disposition to accommodate but the dignity of parliament it seems can brook no opposition to its power strange that a set of men who have made sale of their virtue to the minister should yet talk of retaining dignity but i am getting into politics though i sat down only to ask your acceptance of the wine and express my constant wishes for your happiness  0  thomas jefferson june         dunmore address to governor dunmore from the house of burgesses  monday june       geo iii      my lord —we his majestys dutiful and loyal subjects the burgesses of virginia now met in general assembly have taken into our consideration the joint address of the two houses of parliament his majestys answer and the resolution of the commons which your lordship has been pleased to lay before us wishing nothing so sincerely as the perpetual continuance of that brotherly love which we bear to our fellowsubjects of great britain and still continuing to hope and believe that they do not approve the measures which have so long oppressed their brethren in america we were pleased to receive your lordships notification that a benevolent tender had at length been made by the british house of commons towards bringing to a good end our unhappy disputes with the mother country next to the possession of liberty my lord we should consider such a reconcilliation as the greatest of all human blessings with these dispositions we entered into the consideration of that resolution we examined it minutely we viewed it in every point  0  of light in which we were able to place it and with pain and disappointment we must ultimately declare it only changes the form of oppression without lightening its burden we cannot my lord close with the terms of that resolution for these reasons because the british parliament has no right to intermeddle with the support of civil government in the colonies for us not for them has government been instituted here agreeable to our ideas provision has been made for such officers as we think necessary for the administration of publick affairs and we cannot conceive that any other legislature has a right to prescribe either the number or pecuniary appointments of our offices as a proof that the claim of parliament to interfere in the necessary provisions for the support of civil government is novel and of a late date we take leave to refer to an act of our assembly passed so long since as the thirty second year of the reign of king charles the second intituled an act for raising a publick revenue and for the better support of the government of his majestys colony of virginia this act was brought over by lord culpeper then governour under the great seal of england and was enacted in the name of the kings most excellent majesty by and with the consent of the general assembly because to render perpetual our exemption from an unjust taxation we must saddle ourselves with a perpetual tax adequate to the expectations and subject to the disposal of parliament alone whereas we have a right to give our money as the parliament do theirs without coercion from time to time as  0  publick exigences may require we conceive that we alone are the judges of the condition circumstances and situation of our people as the parliament are of theirs it is not merely the mode of raising but the freedom of granting our money for which we have contended without this we possess no check on the royal prerogative and what must be lamented by dutiful and loyal subjects we should be stripped of the only means as well of recommending this country to the favours of our most gracious sovereign as of strengthening those bands of amity with our fellowsubjects which we would wish to remain indissoluble because on our undertaking to grant money as is proposed the commons only resolve to forbear levying pecuniary taxes on us still leaving unrepealed their several acts passed for the purposes of restraining the trade and altering the form of government of the eastern colonies extending the boundaries and changing the government and religion of quebeck enlarging the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty taking from us the right of trial by jury and transporting us into other countries to be tried for criminal offences standing armies too are still to be kept among us and the other numerous grievances of which ourselves and sister colonies separately and by our representatives in general congress have so often complained are still to continue without redress because at the very time of requiring from us grants of money they are making disposition to invade us with large armaments by sea and land which  0  is a style of asking gifts not reconcilable to our freedom they are also proceeding to a repetition of injury by passing acts for restraining the commerce and fisheries of the provinces of new england and for prohibiting the trade of the other colonies with all parts of the world except the island of great britain ireland and the west indies this seems to bespeak no intention to discontinue the exercise of this usurped power over us in future because on our agreeing to contribute our proportion towards the common defence they do not propose to lay open to us a free trade with all the world whereas to us it appears just that those who bear equally the burdens of government should equally participate of its benefits either be contented with the monopoly of our trade which brings greater loss to us and benefit to them than the amount of our proportional contributions to the common defence or if the latter be preferred relinquish the former and do not propose by holding both to exact from us double contributions yet we would remind government that on former emergencies when called upon as a free people however cramped by this monopoly in our resources of wealth we have liberally contributed to the common defence be assured then that we shall be as generous in future as in past times disclaiming the shackles of proportion when called to our free station in the general system of the empire because the proposition now made to us involves the interests of all the other colonies we are now represented in general congress by members approved  0  by this house where the former union it is hoped will be so strongly cemented that no partial applications can produce the slightest departure from the common cause we consider ourselves as bound in honour as well as interest to share one general fate with our sister colonies and should hold ourselves base deserters of that union to which we have acceded were we to agree on any measures distinct and apart from them there was indeed a plan of accommodation offered in parliament which though not entirely equal to the terms we had a right to ask yet differed but in few points from what the general congress had held out had parliament been disposed sincerely as we are to bring about a reconciliation reasonable men had hoped that by meeting us on this ground something might have been done lord chathams bill on the one part and the terms of congress on the other would have formed a basis for negotiations which a spirit of accommodation on both sides might perhaps have reconciled it came recommended too from one whose successful experience in the art of government should have insured it some attention from those to whom it was intended he had shown to the world that great britain with her colonies united firmly under a just and honest government formed a power which might bid defiance to the most potent enemies with a change of ministers however a total change of measures took place the component parts of the empire have from that moment been falling asunder and a total annihilation of its weight in the  0  political scale of the world seems justly to be apprehended these my lord are our sentiments on this important subject which we offer only as an individual part of the whole empire final determination we leave to the general congress now sitting before whom we shall lay the papers your lordship has communicated to us to their wisdom we commit the improvement of this important advance if it can be wrought into any good we were assured they will do it to them also we refer the discovery of that proper method of representing our wellfounded grievances which your lordship assures us will meet with the attention and regard so justly due to them for ourselves we have exhausted every mode of application which our invention could suggest as proper and promising we have decently remonstrated with parliament they have added new injuries to the old we have wearied our king with applications he has not deigned to answer us we have appealed to the native honour and justice of the british nation their efforts in our favour have been hitherto ineffectual what then remains to be done that we commit our injuries to the evenhanded justice of the being who doth no wrong earnestly beseeching him to illuminate the counsels and prosper the endeavours of those to whom america hath confided her hopes that through their wise direction we may again see reunited the blessings of liberty property and harmony with great britain  0  thomas jefferson june         philadelphia francis eppes to francis eppes  philadelphia june   th      dear sir —you will before this have heard that the war is now heartily entered into without a prospect of accommodation but through the effectual interposition of arms general gage has received considerable reinforcements though not to the whole amount of what was expected there has lately been an action at the outlet of the town of boston  the particulars we have not yet been able to get with certainty the event however was considerable in our favor as to the numbers killed our account says we had between  0 and  0 killed and   0 wounded the enemy has certainly  00 wounded and the same account supposes that number killed but judging from the proportion of wounded and slain on our part they should not have perhaps above two hundred killed this happened on saturday and on monday when the express came away the provincials had begun to make another attack washington set out from here on friday last as generalissimo of all the provincial troops in north america ward and lee were appointed majorgenerals and gates adjutant we are exceedingly anxious till we hear of their arrival at boston as it is evident to every one that the provincial encampment is the most injudicious that can possibly be conceived for the sole purpose of covering two small towns near boston they have encamped so near the line of the ministerial  0  army that the sentries may converse gage too being well fortified is in little danger of an attack from them while their situation is such that he may attack them when he pleases and if he is unsuccessful they cannot pursue him a foot scarcely on account of the ships and floating batteries bearing on the neck of boston if no evil arises from this till general washington arrives we may expect to hear of his withdrawing the provincial troops to a greater distance the congress have directed  0000 men to be raised and hope by a vigorous campaign to dispose our enemies to treaty governor carleton has been spiriting up the canadian indians to fall on our back settlements but this we hope will be prevented governor skeene appointed to take charge of the fortresses on the lakes was intercepted here as we had already taken possession of those fortifications and provided a governor there was no occasion for him to proceed he is now therefore our prisoner my best affections attend mrs eppes and family thomas jefferson july  th      philadelphia francis eppes to francis eppes  philadelphia july  th      dear sir —since my last nothing new has happened our accounts of the battle of charleston have become clear and greatly to our satisfaction  0  contrary to what usually happens the first account were below truth and it is now certain that the regulars have had between   00 and   00 killed and wounded in that engagement and that of these  00 were killed major pitcairn is among the slain at which everybody rejoices as he was the commanding officer at lexington was the first who fired his own piece there and gave the command to fire among those was a doctor warren a man who seems to have been immensely valued at the north the newenglanders are fitting out light vessels of war by which it is hoped we shall not only clear the seas and bays here of everything below the size of a ship of war but that they will visit the coasts of europe and distress the british trade in every part of the world the adventurous genius and intrepidity of those people is amazing they are now intent on burning boston as a hive which gives cover to regulars and none are more bent upon it than the very people who came out of it and whose prosperity lies there this however if done at all it is thought better to defer till the cold season is coming on as it would then lay them under irremediable distress powder seems now to be our only difficulty and towards getting plenty of that nothing is wanting but saltpetre if we can weather out this campaign i hope that we shall be able to have a plenty made for another nothing is requisite but to set about it as every colony has materials but more especially virginia and maryland my compliments most affectionately to mrs eppes mr and mrs skipwith i expect have left you adieu   0 thomas jefferson july        drafts of declaration on taking up arms  july        first draft the large advances strides of late taken by the legislature of great britain towards     establishing in over these colonies their absolute rule and the hardiness of their present attempt to effect by force of arms what by law or right they could never effect renders it necessary for us also to     shift change the ground of opposition and to close with their last appeal from reason to arms and as it behoves those who are called to this great decision to be assured that their cause is approved before supreme reason so is it of great avail that its justice be made known to the world whose prayers cannot be wanting intercessions affections will ever be favorable to a people take part with those encountring oppression our forefathers inhabitants of the island of gr britn

civil societies under with various forms of constitution but possessing all what is inherent in all the full  perfect powers of legislation to continue their connection with the those friends     whom

ascribe in some measure surely ascribe the illustrious character she sustained thro her last european war and its successful event at the close of that war however gr britain having subdued all her foes she took up the unfortunate idea of subduing her friends also her parliament then for the first time asserted a right of unbounded legislation for over the colonies of america by several acts passed in the year of the  th the  th  the  th  the  th years of the reign of his present majesty several duties were imposed for the purpose of raising a evenue on the said colonists the powers of

passed in the reign of     his present majesty within that period space of time they have imposed upon us duties for the purpose of raising a revenue attempted to take from us our money without our consent they have taken away the interdicted all commerce first of of one of our principal trading towns thereby annihilating its property in the hands of the holders  more lately they have cut off our the commercial intercourse with all of several of these of whole colonies with all foreign countries whatsoever they have extended the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty beyond their antient limits thereby depriving us right of trial by jury in cases affecting both life  property  subjecting both to the decision arbitrary decision of a single  dependent judge they have declared that american subjects committing charged with certain pretended offences shall be transported beyond sea fortrial to be tried before the very persons against whose pretended sovereignty offenses supposed to be committed they have attempted fundamentally to alter the form of     government in one of these colonies a form established by acts of its own legislature and further secured to them by charters of compact with  grants from on the part of the crown they have erected a tyranny in a neighbouring province acquired by the joint arms of great britain  america a tyranny dangerous to the very existence of all these colonies but why should we enumerate their injuries in the detail by one act they have suspended the powers of one american legislature  by another they have declared they may legislate for us themselves in all cases whatsoever these two acts alone form a basis broad enough whereon to erect a despotism of unlimited extent when it is considered that the person by whom these

trial the severest characters of antient virtue with what new armour shall a british parliament then encounter the rude assault towards these deadly injuries from the tender plant of liberty which we have brought over  with so much affection we have planted and have fostered on these our own shores we have pursued every lawful measure we have supplicated our king at various times in terms almost disgraceful to freedom we have reasoned we have remonstrated with parliament in the most mild  decent language we have even proceeded to break off our commercial intercourse with them altogether as to

beyond sea to be tried before the very persons against whose pretended sovereignty the offense is supposed to be committed they have attempted fundamentally to alter the form of government in one of these colonies a form established secured by charters on the part of the crown and confirmed by acts of its own legislature and further secured by charters on the part of the crown they have erected in a neighboring province acquired by the joint arms of great britain  america a tyranny dangerous to the very existence of all these colonies but why should we enumerate their injuries in the detail by one act they have suspended the powers of one american legislature  by another have declared they may legislate for us themselves in all cases whatsoever these two acts alone form a basis broad enough whereon to erect a despotism of unlimited extent and what is to secure us against this dreaded evil the persons assuming these powers are not chosen by us are not subject to our controul or influence are exempted by their situation from the operation of these laws and lighten their own burthens in proportion as they increase ours these temptations might put to trial the severest characters of antient virtue with what new armour then shall a british parliament encounter the rude assault towards these deadly injuries from the tender plant of liberty which we have brought over  with so much affection fostered on these our own shores we have pursued every temperate every respectful measure we have supplicated our king at various times in terms almost disgraceful to freedom we have reasoned we have remonstrated with parliament in the most mild  decent language we have even proceeded to break off our commercial intercourse with our fellow subjects as the last peaceful admonition that our attachment to no nation on earth should supplant our attachment to liberty and here we had well hoped was the ultimate step of the controversy but subsequent events have shewn how vain was even this last remain of confidence in the moderation of the british ministry  during the course of the last year their troops in a hostile manner invested the town of boston in the province of massachusetts bay and from that time have held the same beleaguered by sea  land on the   th day of april in the present year they made an unprovoked attack assault on the inhabitants of the said province at the town of lexington murdered eight of them on the spot and wounded many others from thence they proceeded in the all the array of war to the town of concord where they set upon another party of the inhabitants of the same province killing many of them also burning houses  laying waste property until repressed by the arms  the people  suddenly assembled to oppose this cruel aggression hostilities thus commenced on the part of the ministerial army have been since by them pursued without regard to faith or to fame the inhabitants of the town of boston in order to procure their enlargement having entered into treaty with a certain thomas gage general gage their governor principal instigator of these enormities  it was stipulated that the said inhabitants  having first deposited their arms with their own magistrates their arms  military stores should have liberty to depart from out of the said town taking with them their other goods  effects their arms and military stores they accordingly delivered in and claimed the stipulated license of departing with their effects but in open violation of plighted faith  honour in defiance of the sacred obligations of treaty which even savage nations observe their arms and warlike stores deposited with their own magistrates to be preserved as their property were immediately seized by a body of armed men under orders from the said thomas gage general the greater part of the inhabitants were detained in the town and the few permitted to depart were compelled to leave their most valuable effects behind we leave the world to their own its own reflections on this atrocious perfidy that we might no longer doubt the ultimate aim of these ministerial maneuvers the same thomas general gage by proclamation bearing date the   th day of june after reciting the grossest falsehoods and calumnies against the good people of these colonies proceeds to declare them all either by name or description to be rebels  traitors to supersede by his own authority the exercise of the common law of the said province and to proclaim and order instead thereof the use and exercise of the law martial this bloody edict issued he has proceeded to commit further ravages  murders in the same province burning the town of charlestown attacking  killing great numbers of the people residing or assembled therein and is now going on in an avowed course of murder  devastation taking every occasion to destroy the lives  properties of the inhabitants of the said province to oppose his arms we also have taken up arms we should be wanting to ourselves we should be perfidious to posterity we should be unworthy that free ancestry from whom which we derive our descent should we submit with folded arms to military butchery  depredation to gratify the lordly ambition or sate the avarice of a british ministry we do then most solemnly before god and the world declare that regardless of every consequence at the risk of every distress the arms we have been compelled to assume we will wage use with the perseverance exerting to their utmost energies all those powers which our creator hath given us to guard preserve that liberty which he committed to us in sacred deposit  to protect from every hostile hand our  lives  our properties but that this our declaration may not disquiet the minds of our good fellow subjects  in any parts of the empire we do further assure them that we mean not in any wise to affect that union with them in which we have so long  so happily lived and which we wish so much to see again restored that necessity must be hard indeed which may force upon us that desperate measure or induce us to avail ourselves of any aid which their enemies might proffer we did not embody a soldiery to commit aggression on them we did not raise armies for glory or for conquest we did not invade their island carrying death or slavery to its inhabitants we took up arms in defence of our persons and properties under actual violation we took up arms we have taken up arms when that violence shall be removed when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors hostilities shall cease on our part also the moment they withdraw their armies we will disband ours for the atchievement of this happy event we call for  confide in the good offices of our fellow subjects beyond the atlantic of their friendly dispositions we do not cease to hope aware as they must be that they have nothing more to expect from the same common enemy than the humble favour of being last devoured and we devoutly implore assistance of almighty god to conduct us happily thro this great conflict to dispose the minds of his majesty his ministers  parliament to reasonable terms reconciliation with us on reasonable terms  to deliver us from the evils of a civil war  if it might not be proper to take notice of ld chathams plan and its being editor illegible word mentioning his great abilities  if it might not be proper to take notice how many great men in parlt and how many considerable cities and towns in england have acknowledged the justice of our cause  ld norths proposals  thomas jefferson july         draft of report on lord norths motion  j mss july         the congress proceeding to take into their consideration a resolution of the house of commons of     gr br referred to them by the several assemblies of new jersey pnnsylva  virga which resoln is in these words that it is the opinion c are of opinion that the colonies of america possess an the exclusive right privilege of giving  granting their own money that this involves the right of deliberating whether they will give any sums make any gift for what purposes they will give them it shall be made and what shall be its the amount of the gift and that it is a high breach of this privilege for any body of men extraneous to their constitutions to prescribe the purposes for which money shall be levied on them  to take to themselves the authority of judging what shall be a sufficient levy of their conditions circumstances  and situation  of determining the sufficiency or insufficiency of any the levy proposed amount of the contribution to be levied that as they possess a right of appropriating their gifts so are they entitled at all times to inquire into its their application to see that it they be not distributed wasted among the venal  corrupt to sap for the purpose of sapping undermining their the civil rights of the givers of overbearing them by with military force power by diverting them nor yet applied be diverted to the support of standing armies for the purpose of overbearing these states by military     inconsistent with domestic quiet their freedom  subversive of their our quiet to propose therefore as this resolution does that the monies given by the colonies shall be subject to the disposal of parliament alone is to propose that they shall surrender give relinquish this right of enquiry and to put it in the power of others to render their gifts ruinous in proportion as they are liberal that this privilege of giving or withholding our monies is an important barrier against in the undue exertion of prerogative which if left altogether without controul might may be exercised to our great oppression  that is also  all history shows it how efficacious its intercession for redress of grievances  reestablishment of rights and how improvident would be the surrender of so powerful a mediator we are further of opinion that the proposition contained in this resolution is uncandid unequal unreasonable  insidious uncandid unequal unreasonable because if we declare we accede to it we declare in absolute terms without reservation we will purchase the favour of parliament not without knowg not at the same time  leave the price of that purchase to be fixed by the sellers alone at what price they will please to estimate their favour it is insidious because a colony on refusal of any a proffered sum any individual colonies having bid  bidden again till it they finds the height of parliamentary avidity of the seller unattainable by all its their powers are then to return into opposition single  unsupported     divided from its their sister colonies having in the meantime been taken whom the minister shall will have previously imparted fully detached from the union by acceptance a grant of easier terms or deluded into inactivity by keeping up into a definite answer and by delayg of the definitive answer or by an artful procrastination of a definitive answer that the suspension of the exercise of their pretended power to tax levy taxes of taxation being expressly made commensurate with the duration continuing of our gifts in order these must be perpetual to make that so and experience has invariably proven that to render a governing power perpetually independent it is not the best method of preserving the friendship  good offices of any part of government to render it independent by vesting it with perpetual revenues and whereas no experience has shewn that a gift of perpetual revenues secures a perpetual return of duty or of good kind dispositions on the contrary the parliament itself with a wisdom we mean worthy to imitation cautiously wisely attentive to this circumstance observation are in the established practice of granting their own money but from year to year only we are of the opinion that even fair terms could hardly be accepted by us tho desirous  determined to consider in the most dispassionate light view every advance towards reconciliation made by the british parlmt let our brethren of britain reflect what could have     been the sacrifice to men of free spirits had il legible even fair terms been proffered by freemen when attended as these were with the most irritating circumstances of insult  defiance with circumstances so insultive circumstances a proposition to give our money when accompanied with large fleets  armies addressed to our fears rather than to our freedom let britons our brethren of britain reflect with what patience they would they have received articles of treaty from any power on earth when sent by such messengers plenipotentiaries borne by on the point of the bayonet by the hands of military plenipotentiaries on the point of a bayonet we think that the attempt alike unreasonable  unnecessary  unwarrantable to raise upon us by force or by threats our proportional contributions to the common defense when all know and themselves acknowledged we have ever freely  fully given those contributionsed whenever called upon to contribute in the character freemen should be is one among a plain proof among many others that not the obtaining these but the rendering to their absolute dominion was not the ultimate end of parliamentary object of parliament we are of opinion it is not just yt the colonies should make any be required to oblige themselves stipulate to other contributions while great britain possesses a monopoly of their trade this is of does of itself lay them under a heavy contribution levied on them to demand therefore another an additional contribution by way in the form of a tax   0 is to demand the double of their equal proportion we conceive no reason if we are to contribute proportionally equally with the other parts of the empire let us equally with them enjoy like them equal rights of free commerce with the whole world but while the restrictions on our trade shut up to us the resources of wealth we cannot bear it is it unjust we should be expected to bear all other burthens equally with those to whom under no restriction have every resource is open we conceive that the brit parl has no right to intermeddle with our provisions for the support of civil governmt or administration of justice that the provisions has been made in such manner as to we have already we have made are such as please ourselves they answer the substantial purposes governmt  of justice  other purposes than these should not be answered we do not mean to burthen that our people shall be burthened with heavy  oppressive taxes to provide sinecures for the drones of creation ministerial partisans the idle or wicked under color of providing for a civil list but while parliament pursue their unmolested their plan of civil govnt within their own jurisdiction we hope also to pursue ours also without molestation we are of opinion the proposition is altogether unsatisfactory because the parliament it imports only a suspension not a renunciation of the right to tax us because too it is does not proposed to repeal the several acts of parl passed for the purposes     of restraining the trade and altering the form of government of the eastern colonies extending the boundaries  changing the government  religion of quebec enlarging the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty  vice admiralty taking from us the rights of trial by jury of the vicinage in cases affecting both life and property exempting the murderers of colonists from legal trial transporting us into other countries to be tried for criminal offenses exempting by mocktrial the murderers of colonists from punishment and for quartering soldiers upon us in times of profound peace nor do they renounce the power of suspending our own legislatures  of legislating for us themselves in all cases whatsoever so far indeed from repealing the injurious acts of parl before mentioned they pass others at the same time equally injurious on the contrary to show they mean not to dis continue discontinuance of injuries injury at the very time of making this proposition they are passing acts at the very time of making holding out this proposition for restraining the commerce  fisheries of the province of new england  for interdicting in general the trade of the other colonies with all foreign nations this proof is proves unequivocally of what we may expect in the future they mean not discontinuance of to relinquish this usurpation the exercise of indiscriminate legislation over us upon the whole this proposition seems to have been held up to the world to deceive them it into a belief that the     colonies are unreasonable there was no matter c  but and more particularly to lull into fatal security our well affected fellow subjects on that other side the water into a fatal security till time should be given for the operation of those arms which a british minister pronounced would instantaneously reduce the cowardly sons of america to unreserved submission but when the world reflects how inadequate to justice are the vaunted terms offered when it attends to the rapid  bold succession of injuries which for the space during a course of    years have been aimed at these colonies by a wicked administration when it reviews the pacific  respectful applications complaints expostulations which during that whole time have been made the sole arms we oppose to their usurpations them when it considers observes that our complaints were either not heard at all or were answered with new  accumulated injuries when it considers recollects that the minister himself declared from the beginning on an former early occasion he would never cease blank space in copy      till america was at his feet  that an avowed partisan of ministry has more lately denounced against america the dreadful sentence delenda est carthago that this was done in the presence of a british senate  being unreproved by them we must considered be taken to be as approved their own sentiment when it considers the great armaments by sea  land with which they have invaded us by sea  land  the circumstances of cruelty with which these have commenced  prosecuted hostilities when these things we say are laid together  attentively considered can the world be deceived by the artifices of a ministry into an opinion that we are unreasonable or can it hesitate to believe with us that nothing but our own exertions can may defeat the ministerial sentence of death or submission thomas jefferson august         monticello john randolph to john randolph  monticello august         dear sir —i am sorry the situation of our country should render it not eligible to you to remain longer in it i hope the returning wisdom of great britain will ere long put an end to this unnatural contest there may be people to whose tempers and dispositions contention is pleasing and who therefore wish a continuance of confusion     but to me it is of all states but one the most horrid my first wish is a restoration of our just rights my second a return of the happy period when consistently with duty i may withdraw myself totally from the public stage and pass the rest of my days in domestic ease and tranquillity banishing every desire of ever hearing what passes in the world perhaps for the latter adds considerably to the warmth of the former wish looking with fondness towards a reconciliation with great britain i cannot help hoping you may be able to contribute towards expediting this good work i think it must be evident to yourself that the ministry have been deceived by their officers on this side of the water who for what purpose i cannot tell have constantly represented the american opposition as that of a small fraction in which the body of the people took little part this you can inform them of your own knowledge is untrue they have taken it into their heads too that we are cowards and shall surrender at discretion to an armed force the past and future operations of the war must confirm or undeceive them on that head i wish they were thoroughly and minutely acquainted with every circumstance relative to america as it exists in truth i am persuaded this would go far towards disposing them to reconciliation even those in parliament who are called friends to america seem to know nothing of our real determinations i observe they pronounced in the last parliament that the congress     of      did not mean to insist rigorously on the terms they held out but kept something in reserve to give up and in fact that they would give up everything but the article of taxation now the truth is far from this as i can affirm and put my honor to the assertion their continuance in this error may perhaps produce very ill consequences the congress stated the lowest terms they thought possible to be accepted in order to convince the world they were not unreasonable they gave up the monopoly and regulation of trade and all acts of parliament prior to      leaving to british generosity to render these at some future time as easy to america as the interests of britain would admit but this was before blood was spilt i cannot affirm but have reason to think these terms would not now be accepted i wish no false sense of honor no ignorance of our real intentions no vain hope that partial concessions of right will be accepted may induce the ministry to trifle with accommodation till it shall be out of their power ever to accommodate if indeed great britain disjointed from her colonies be a match for the most potent nations of europe with the colonies thrown into their scale they may go on securely but if they are not assured of this it would be certainly unwise by trying the event of another campaign to risk our accepting a foreign aid which perhaps may not be attainable but on condition of everlasting avulsion from great britain this would be thought a hard condition to those who still wish for reunion     with their parent country i am sincerely one of those and would rather be in dependence on great britain properly limited than on any other nation on earth or than on no nation but i am one of those too who rather than submit to the rights of legislating for us assumed by the british parliament and which late experience has shown they will so cruelly exercise would lend my hand to sink the whole island in the ocean if undeceiving the minister as to matters of fact may change his disposition it will perhaps be in your power by assisting to do this to render service to the whole empire at the most critical time certainly that it has ever seen whether britain shall continue the head of the greatest empire on earth or shall return to her original station in the political scale of europe depends perhaps on the resolutions of the succeeding winter god send they may be wise and salutary for us all i shall be glad to hear from you as often as you may be disposed to think of things here you may be at liberty i expect to communicate some things consistently with your honor and the duties you will owe to a protecting nation such a communication among individuals may be mutually beneficial to the contending parties on this or any future occasion if i affirm to you any facts your knowledge of me will enable you to decide on their credibility if i hazard opinions on the dispositions of men or other speculative points you can only know they are my opinions my best wishes for your felicity attend you wherever you     go and believe me to be assuredly your friend and servant thomas jefferson oct  0      philadelphia francis eppes to francis eppes  philadelphia oct  0th      dear sir —i wrote to patty mrs jefferson on my arrival here and there being nothing new in the political way i enclosed her letter under a blank cover to you since that we have received from england news of much importance which coming through many channels we believe may be confidently relied on both the ministerial and provincial accounts of the battle of bunkers hill had got to england the ministry were determined to push the war with vigor a measure in which they were fixed by the defeat of the spaniards by the moors ninety brass cannon were embarked from the tower and may be hourly expected either at n york or boston two thousand troops were to sail from ireland about the   th sept these we have reason to believe are destined for n york commodore shuldam was to sail about the same time with a great number of frigates and small vessels of war to be distributed among the middle colonies he comes at the express and earnest intercessions of ld dunmore and the plan is to lay waste all the plantations on our river sides of this we give immediate notice to our committee of safety by an express whom we dispatched last friday that if any defence could be     provided on the rivers by fortifications or small vessels it might be done immediately in the spring  0000 men more are to come over they are to be procured by taking away twothirds of the garrison at gibraltar who are to be replaced by some hessians by  000 highlanders and  000 roman catholics whom they propose to raise in ireland instead of roman catholics however some of our accounts say foreigners are to be sent their plan is this they are to take possession of new york and albany keeping up a communication between them by means of their vessels between albany and st johns they propose also to keep open the communication and again between st johns and quebec and boston by this means they expect gage tryon and carleton may distress us on every side acting in concert with one another by means of hudsons river they expect to cut off all correspondence between the northern and southern rivers gage was appointed governorgeneral of all america but sir jeffrey amherst consented afterwards to come over so that gage is to be recalled but it is believed amherst will not come till the spring in the meantime howe will have the command the coöperation of the canadians is taken for granted in all the ministerial schemes we hope therefore they will be dislocated by the events in that quarter for an account of these i must refer you to patty my warmest affections attend mrs eppes adieu     thomas jefferson oct         philadelphia francis eppes to francis eppes  philadelphia oct         dear sir —since my last we have nothing new from england or from the camps at either cambridge or st johns our eyes are turned to the latter place with no little anxiety the weather having been uncommonly bad for troops in that quarter exposed to the inclemencies of the sky without any protection carleton is retired to quebec and though it does not appear he has any intimation of arnolds expedition yet we hear he has embodied   00 men to be on his guard a small vessel was the other day cast away on the jersey shore she was one of the transports which had some time ago brought over troops to boston on board of which were a captain with his subordinate officers and marines amounting to    in all and also a duncan campbell who was going to recruit men at new york for general gage he having some time before undertaken the same business in the same place and actually carried off  0 men the marines and their officers were all taken immediately except their captain and the recruiting gentleman these pushed off in a little boat and coasted it to long island where they got on board a sloop which was to have sailed in an hour when the party sent after them came upon them they were brought to this city this morning the marines having been here some time our good old speaker died the night before last for the particulars of that melancholy event i must   0 refer you to patty my affections attend mrs eppes adieu thomas jefferson oct         philadelphia john page to john page  philadelphia oct         dear page —we have nothing new from england or the camp before boston by a private letter this day to a gentleman of congress from general montgomery we learn that our forces before st johns are  000 in number besides  00 canadians the latter of whom have repelled with great intrepidity three different attacks from the fort we apprehend it will not hold out much longer as monsr st luc de la corne and several other principal inhabitants of montreal who have been our great enemies have offered to make terms this st luc is a great seigneur amongst the canadians and almost absolute with the indians he has been our most bitter enemy he is acknowledged to be the greatest of all scoundrels to be assured of this i need only to mention to you that he is the ruffian who when during the late war fort william henry was surrendered to the french  indians on condition of saving the lives of the garrison had every soul murdered in cold blood the check which the canadians received at first is now wearing off they were made to believe we had an army of   000 men going there but when they saw montgomery with but   00 they were thunderstruck at the situation they had brought themselves into however when they saw even this     small armament march boldly to invest st johns  put a good face on the matter they revived  the recruits since have contributed to inspirit them more i have set apart nearly one day in every week since i came here to write letters notwithstanding this i never had received the scrip of a pen from any mortal breathing i should have excepted two lines from mr pendleton to desire me to buy him    lb of wire from which i concluded he was alive i speak not this for you from whom i would not wish to receive a letter till i know you can write one without injury to your health but in future as i must be satisfied with information from my colleagues that my county still exists so i am determined to be satisfied also with their epistolary communications of what passes within our knowledge adieu dear page delenda est norfolk  thomas jefferson nov        philadelphia franis eppes to francis eppes  philadelphia nov        dear sir —we have no late intelligence here except of the surrender of chambly with  0 prisoners of war  ½ tons of powder   0 stands of arms and some other small matters the acquisition of this powder we hope has before this made us masters of st johns on which montreal and the upper parts of st lawrence will of course be ours the fate of arnolds expedition we know not as yet we have     had some disagreeable accounts of internal commotions in south carolina i have never received the script of a pen from any mortal in virginia since i left it nor been able by any inquiries i could make to hear of my family i had hoped that when mrs byrd came i could have heard something of them but she could tell me nothing about them the suspense under which i am is too terrible to be endured if anything has happened for gods sake let me know it my best affections to mrs eppes adieu thomas jefferson nov         philadelphia franis eppes to francis eppes  philadelphia nov   st      dear sir —after sealing my last letter to you we received an account of the capture of st johns which i wrote on the letter what i then gave you was true account of the matter we consider this as having determined the fate of canada a committee of congress is gone to improve circumstances so as to bring the canadians into our union we have accounts of arnold as late as october    all well and in fine spirits we cannot help hoping him into possession of quebec as we know carleton to be absent in the neighborhood of montreal our armed vessels to the northward have taken some of the ships coming with provisions from ireland to boston by the intercepted letters we have a confirmation that they will have an army of four or five and twenty thousands there by the spring but they     will be rawteagues   000 are lately arrived there i have written to patty a proposition to keep yourselves at a distance from the alarms of ld dunmore to her therefore for want of time i must refer to you and shall hope to meet you as proposed i am dear sir with my best affections to mrs eppes your friend and servant thomas jefferson november         philadelphia john randolph to john randolph  philadelphia november         dear sir —i am to give you the melancholy intelligence of the death of our most worthy speaker which happened here on the   d of the last month he was struck with an apoplexy and expired within five hours i have it in my power to acquaint you that the success of our arms has corresponded with the justice of our cause chambly and st johns were taken some weeks ago and in them the whole regular army in canada except about forty or fifty men this day certain intelligence has reached us that our general montgomery is received into montreal and we expect every hour to be informed that quebec has opened its arms to colonel arnold who with eleven hundred men was sent from boston up the kennebec and down the chaudière river to that place he expected to be there early this month montreal acceded to us on the   th and carlton set out with     the shattered remains of his little army for quebec where we hope he will be taken up by arnold in a short time we have reason to hope the delegates of canada will join us in congress and complete the american union as far as we wish to have it completed we hear that one of the british transports has arrived at boston the rest are beating off the coast in very bad weather you will have heard before this reaches you that lord dunmore has commenced hostilities in virginia that people bore with everything till he attempted to burn the town of hampton they opposed and repelled him with considerable loss on his side and none on ours it has raised our countrymen into a perfect phrensy it is an immense misfortune to the whole empire to have a king of such a disposition at such a time we are told and everything proves it true that he is the bitterest enemy we have his minister is able and that satisfies me that ignorance or wickedness somewhere controls him in an earlier part of this contest our petitions told him that from our king there was but one appeal the admonition was despised and that appeal forced on us to undo his empire he has but one truth more to learn that after colonies have drawn the sword there is but one step more they can take that step is now pressed upon us by the measures adopted as if they were afraid we would not take it believe me dear sir there is not in the british empire a man who more cordially loves a union with great britain than i do but by the god that made me i will cease to exist before i yield to a connection on such terms as the     british parliament propose and in this i think i speak the sentiments of america we want neither inducement nor power to declare and assert a separation it is will alone which is wanting and that is growing apace under the fostering hand of our king one bloody campaign will probably decide everlastingly our future course and i am sorry to find a bloody campaign is decided on if our winds and waters should not combine to rescue their shores from slavery and general howes reinforcements should arrive in safety we have hopes he will be inspirited to come out of boston and take another drubbing and we must drub him soundly before the sceptred tyrant will know we

declaration or a letter to howe on allens case when necessity compelled us to take up arms against great britain in defence of our just rights we thought it a circumstance of some comfort that our enemy was brave and civilized it is the happiness of modern times that the evils of necessary war are softened by the refinement of manners  sentiment and that an enemy is an object of vengeance in     arms  in the field only it is with pain we hear that mr allen and eleven others taken with him while fighting bravely in their countrys cause are sent to britain in irons to be punished for pretended treason treasons too created by one of those very laws whose obligation we deny and mean to contest by the sword this question is will not to be decided by reeking vengeance on a few wretched helpless

corresponding miseries to those which shall be inflicted on mr allen his life shall answer for that life of mr allen  the lives of as many others for those sent with him of the brave men captivated

those engaged in support of our the cause of their country to assure them that if any unlucky circumstance baffling the efforts of their bravery shall put them in the power of their enemies their

philadelphia may         dear nelson —i arrived here last tuesday after being detained hence six weeks longer than i intended by a malady of which gilmer can inform you i have nothing new to inform you of as the last post carried you an account of the naval engagement in delaware i inclose a vote of yesterday     on the subject of government as the ensuing campaign is likely to require greater exertion than our unorganized powers may at present effect should our convention propose to establish now a form of government perhaps it might be agreeable to recall for a short time their delegates it is a work of the most interesting nature and such as every individual would wish to have his voice in in truth it is the whole object of the present controversy for should a bad government be instituted for us in future it had been as well to have accepted at first the bad one offered to us from beyond the water without the risk  expence of contest but this i mention to you in confidence as in our situation a hint to any other is too delicate however anxiously interesting the subject is to our feelings in future you shall hear from me weekly while you stay and i shall be glad to receive conventional as well as publick intelligence from you p s—in the other colonies who have instituted government they recalled their delegates leaving only one or two to give information to congress of matters which might relate to their country particularly and giving them a vote during the interval of absence i am at present in our old lodgings tho i think as the excessive heats of the city are coming on fast to endeavor to get lodgings in the skirts of the town where i may have the benefit of a freely circulating air tell page  mcclurgh that i received their letters this morning and shall devote myself to their contents i am here in the same uneasy anxious     state in which i was the last fall without mrs jefferson who could not come with me i wish much to see you here yet hope you will contrive to bring on as early as you can in convention the great questions of the session i suppose they will tell us what to say on the subject of independence  but hope respect will be expressed to the right of opinion in other colonies who may happen to differ from them when at home i took great pains to enquire into the sentiments of the people on that head in the upper counties i

this government hath endeavored to pervert the same into a detestable and insupportable tyranny by putting his negative on laws the most wholesome  necessary for ye public good by denying to his governors permission to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operations for his assent and when so suspended neglecting to attend to them for many years by refusing to pass certain other laws unless the person to be benefited by them would relinquish the inestimable right of representation in the legislature by dissolving legislative assemblies repeatedly and continually for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people when dissolved by refusing to call others for a long space of time thereby leaving the political system without any legislative head by endeavoring to prevent the population of our country  for that purpose obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners  raising the condition lacking appropriations of lands by keeping among us in times of peace standing armies and ships of war lackinging to render the military independent of  superior to the civil power by combining with others to subject us to a foreign jurisdiction giving his assent to their pretended acts of legislation for quartering large bodies of troops among us for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world for imposing taxes on us without our consent for depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences and for suspending our own legislatures  declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever by plundering our seas ravaging our coasts burning our towns and destroying the lives of our people by inciting insurrections of our fellow subjects with the allurements of forfeiture  confiscation by prompting our negroes to rise in arms among us those very negroes whom he hath from time to time by an inhuman use of his negative he hath refused permission to exclude by law by endeavoring to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes  conditions of existence by transporting at this time a large army of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death desolation  tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty  perfidy so unworthy the head of a civilized nation by answering our repeated petitions for redress with a repetition of injuries and finally by abandoning the helm of government and declaring us out of his allegiance  protection by which several acts of misrule the said george guelf has forfeited the kingly office and has rendered it necessary for the preservation of the people that he should be immediately deposed from the same and divested of all its privileges powers  prerogatives and forasmuch as the public liberty may be more certainly secured by abolishing an office which all experience hath shewn to be inveterately inimical thereto or which and it will thereupon become further necessary to reestablish such ancient principles as are friendly

       the committee to whom were recommitted the cartel between brigadier general arnold  captain forster for the exchange of prisoners  the several papers relating thereto have had the same under     their consideration and agreed to the following report your committee having proceeded to make enquiry into the facts relating to the agreement entered into at st annes between brigadier general arnold  capt forster find a part of them well authenticated and others not yet being apprehensive that silence on the part of congress may be construed by some into a ratification of the said agreement they have thought it best to state the same as they appear at present with such resolutions as they will justify if found true reserving final decision till the whole truth shall be accurately enquired into  transmitted to congress your committee on the best information they have been able to obtain find that on the   th day of may last a party of the enemy consisting as is said of about  00 men under the command of capt forster attacked a post at the cedars held by a garrison of   0 continental forces then under the command of major butterfield that the said post was secured by a stockade of wood to cover the garrison from the enemys musquetry that there were mounted therein two field pieces  that the enemy had no cannon that the said garrison had ammunition  provisions sufficient to have lasted them ten days that they had reason to expect immediate reinforcements in a few days  which on a requisition from themselves was actually on its way from montreal and moreover were so near the main body of the army     that they could not doubt being joined by detachments from thence sufficient to oblige the enemy to retire that the enemy for two days kept up only a scattering fire by which not a single man of the garrison was killed or wounded  that on the third day the garrison surrendered themselves prisoners of war having capitulated for the preservation of their own baggage from plunder  that their persons should not be deliverd into the hands of the savages  that the enemy broke the capitulation utterly  immediately on their part plundering the garrison of their baggage  stripping the cloathes from their backs  delivering the prisoners into the hands of the savages  that they then proceeded against the reinforcement which was on its way consisting of about   0 men under the command of major sherburne that major sherburne  his party engaged  fought them with bravery but being at length surrounded by numbers greatly superior and informed that the fort and garrison were already in the hands of the enemy they were obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war also but whether on capitulation or not your committee are not informed that after they had put themselves into the hands of the enemy the said enemy murdered two of them butchering the one with tomahawks  drowning the other and left divers others exposed on an island naked and perishing with cold  famine that by this time brigadier general arnold who     had been detached by major general thomas to relieve the fort at the cedars approached  was making dispositions to attack the enemy that capt forster thereupon notified  general arnold that if he attacked him the prisoners then  00 in number would every man of them be put to death  proposing at the same time an exchange of torn out arnold was extremely averse to entering on any agreement of that kind  was at length induced to do it by no other motive than that of saving the prisoners from cruel  inhuman death threatened in such terms as left no doubt it was to be perpetrated that agreement was thereupon entered into between brigadr genl arnold  capt forster bearing date at st annes on the   th day of may whereby the s̃d forster stipulated that he would deliver up all the said prisoners except such as were  canadians to genl arnold who agreed on the other part that so many of equal rank  condition should be returned to the enemy of those taken by our arms on former occasions that the prisoners so stipulated to be given up to the enemy were not in the possession of genl arnold nor under his direction but were at that time distributed through various parts of the continent under the orders of this house that capt forster in violation of this agreement also detained a considerable number of the prisoners he had thus stipulated to deliver  sent them into the indian countries for purposes unknown     whereupon your committee have come to the following resolutions agreed resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that plundering the baggage of the garrison at the cedars stripping them of their clothes  deliverg the prisonr into ye hands of the savages  was a breach of the capitulation on the part of the enemy for which satisfaction ought to be demanded agreed resolved that the murder of two of the prisoners of war was a gross and barbarous violation of the laws of nature  nations for which satisfaction should be made by the enemy by delivering into our hands either captain forster or the individuals concerned in committing the murder agreed resolved that the agreement entered into at st annes was a mere sponsion on the part of brigadr genl arnold he not being invested with the powers for the absolute disposal of the continental prisoners in general and that therefore it is subject to be ratified or annulled at the discretion of this house the sole representative of the united colonies  resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that major sherburne  his party having fought as men should do so much of the said sponsion as relates to their exchange should be ratified  confirmed by this house  that an equal number of captives from the enemy of the same rank  condition     should be restored to them as stipulated by the said sponsion resolved that torn out opinion of this com torn out the said sponsion as relates to the exchange of major butterfield  the garrison surrendering with him ought not to be ratified because we should redeem none but those who will fight and because too the said sponsion excepted the canadian prisoners  we will in no case admit a distinction of countries among men fighting in the same cause resolved therefore that the said major butterfield  garrison should still be considered as prisoners of war appertaining to the enemy but as by the actual murder of two of the prisoners  the threats at st annes to put the others to death the enemy are found capable of destroying their captives the s̃d prisoners ought not to be put into their hands but should be permitted to remain in their own country that in the meantime they shall not bear arms nor otherwise act against the enemy but are bound to demean themselves in all things in the manner of prisoners of war enlarged on their parole  to hold themselves subject to be recalled by the enemy whenever proper security shall have been given that their lives shall be safe resolved that previous to the delivery of the prisoners to be returned in lieu of majr sherburne  those captivated with him satisfaction be required from the enemy for the murder of the two prisoners by delivering into our hands capt forster or the individuals concerned in perpetrating that horrid act     and likewise restitution for the plunder at the cedars taken contrary to the faith of the capitulation and that till such satisfaction  restitution be made the said prisoners be not delivered resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that if the enemy shall put to death torture or otherwise ill treat any of the hostages in their hands or of the canadian or other prisoners captivated by them in the service of the united colonies recourse must be had to retaliation as the sole means of stopping the progress of human butchery  that for that purpose punishments of the same kind  degree be inflicted on an equal number of their subjects taken by us till they shall be taught due respect to the violated rights of nations resolved that it is the opinion of this committee that a copy of this report be transmitted to the commander in chief of the continental forces in canada to be by him sent to the british commander there and that he moreover make further  diligent torn out into the facts therein stated  such others as may torn out same subject  rel torn out same duly authenticated torn out possible despatch torn out for their final decision  that in the meantime the prisoners delivered up by the enemy abstain from bearing arms or otherwise acting against them    0 thomas jefferson june         report on canadian affairs  c c june         the committee to whom the report from the com̃mee of the whole house

philadelphia july        dear fleming —yours of   d june came to hand this morning and gratified me much as this with your former contains interesting intelligence our affairs in canada go still retrograde but i hope they are now nearly at their worst the fatal sources of these misfortunes have been want of hard money with which to procure provisions the ravages of the small pox with which one half of our army is still down and an unlucky choice of some officers by our last letters genl sullivan was retired as far as isle au noix with his dispirited army and burgoyne pursuing him with one of double or treble his numbers it gives much concern that he had determined to make a stand there as it exposes to great danger of losing him and his army and it was the universal sense of his officers that he ought to retire gen schuyler has sent him positive orders to retire to crown point but whether they will reach him in time enough to withdraw him from danger is questionable here it seems to be the opinion of all the general officers that an effectual stand may be made and the enemy not only prevented access into new york but by preserving a superiority on the lakes we may renew our attacks on them to advantage as soon as our army is recovered from the small pox and recruited but recruits tho long ordered are very difficult to be procured on account of that dreadful disorder     the conspiracy at new york is not yet thoroughly developed nor has any thing transpired the whole being kept secret till the whole is got through one fact is known of necessity that one of the generals lifeguards being thoroughly convicted was to be shot last saturday general howe with some ships we know not how many is arrived at the hook and as is said has landed some horse on the jersey shore the famous major rogers is in custody on violent suspicion of being concerned in the conspiracy i am glad to hear of the highlanders carried into virginia it does not appear certainly how many of these people we have but i imagine at least six or eight hundred each effort should be made to keep up the spirits of the people the succeeding three months which in the universal opinion will be the only ones in which our trial can be severe i wish you had depended on yourself rather than others for giving me an account of the late nomination of delegates i have no other state of it but the number of votes for each person the omission of harrison and braxton and my being next to the lag give me some alarm it is a painful situation to be  00 miles from ones country and thereby opened to secret assassination without a possibility of selfdefence i am willing to hope nothing of this kind has been done in my case but yet i cannot be easy if any doubts has arisen as to me my country will have my political creed in the form of a declaration c which i was lately directed to draw this will give decisive proof that my own sentiment concurred with the vote they instructed     me to give had the post been to go a day later we might have been at liberty to communicate this whole matter july   i have kept open my letter till this morning but nothing more new adieu john adams thomas jefferson july        declaration of independence  july        first draft a declaration by the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled  00 when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for a people to advance from that subordination in which they have hitherto remained and to assume among the powers of the earth the equal and independent station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impell them to the change we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal and independent that from that equal creation they derive rights none   0  inherent and unalienable among which are the preservation of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these ends governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government shall become destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not change for light and  0  transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations begun at a distinguishd period and pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute power it it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to expunge their former none   0  systems of government the history of his present majesty is a history of unremitting injuries and usurpations among which no one fact stands single or solitary to contradict the uniform tenor of the rest all of which have in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world for the truth of which we pledge a faith as yet unsullied by falsehood he has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in  0  their operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has neglected utterly to attend to them he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly and continually  0  for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people he has refused for a long space of time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within— he has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and raising the  0  conditions of new appropriations of lands he has suffered the administration of justice totally to cease in some of these colonies refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers he has made our judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and amount of their salaries he has created a multitude of new offices by a selfassumed power and sent hither swarms of officers to harrass our people and eat out their substance he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies and ships of war he has affected  0  to render the military independent of and superiour to the civil power he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their pretended acts of legislation for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us for protecting them by a mock tryal from punishment for any murders they should commit on the inhabitants of these states for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world for imposing taxes on us without our consent for depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses  0  for taking away our charters and altering fundamentally the forms of our government for suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever he has abdicated government here withdrawing his governors and none   0  declaring us out of his allegiance and protection he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized nation he has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and   0 conditions of existence he has incited treasonable insurrections of our fellow citizens with the allurement of forfeiture and confiscation of our property he has waged cruel war against human nature itself violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him captivating and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in     their transportation thither this piratical warfare the opprobrium of infidel powers is the warfare of the christian king of great britain he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain an execrable commerce determined to keep open a markett where men should be bought and sold and that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us and to purchase their liberty of which he has deprived them by murdering the people upon whom he also obtruded them thus paying off former     crimes committed against the liberties of one people with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered by repeated injury a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a people who mean to be free—future ages will scarce believe that the hardiness of one man adventured within the short compass of twelve years only on so many acts of tyranny without a mask over a people fostered and fixed in the principles of liberty none      nor have we been wanting in attentions to our british brethren we have warned them from time to time of attempts of their legislature to extend a jurisdiction over these our states we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here no one of which could warrant so strange a pretension that these were effected at the expense of our own blood and treasure unassisted by the wealth or the strength of great britain that in constituting indeed our several forms of government we had adopted one common king thereby laying a foundation for perpetual league and amity with them but     that submission to their parliament was no part of our constitution nor ever in idea if history may be credited and we appealed to their nature justice and magnanimity as well as to the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which were likely to interrupt our correspondence and connection they too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity and when occasions have been given them by the regular course of their laws of removing from their councils the disturbers of our harmony they have by their free election reestablished them in power at this very time too they are permitting their chief     magistrate to send over not only soldiers of our common blood but scotch and foreign mercenaries to invade and deluge us in blood these facts have given the last stab to agonizing affection and manly spirit bids us to renounce forever these unfeeling brethren we must endeavour to forget our former love for them and to hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends we might have been a free and a great people together but a communication of grandeur and of freedom it seems is below their dignity be it so since they will have it the road to happiness and to glory is open to us too we will climb it     apart from them and acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our eternal separation we therefore the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled do in the name and by the authority of the good people of these states reject and renounce all allegiance and subjection to the kings of great britain and all others who may hereafter claim by through or under them we utterly dissolve and break off all political connection which may have heretofore subsisted between us and the people or parliament of great britain and finally we do assert and declare these colonies to be free and independent     states and that as free and independent states they shall hereafter have power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do and for the support of this declaration we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honour reported draft a declaration by the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers

and usurpations begun at a distinguished period and pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to expunge their former

rest but all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world for the truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied by falsehood he has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly and continually for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the right of the people he has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within he has endeavored to prevent the population of these states for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands he has suffered the administration of justice totally to cease in some of these states refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers he has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries he has erected a multitude of new offices by a self assumed power and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies and ships of war without the consent of our legislatures he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitutions and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world for imposing taxes on us without our consent for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighboring province establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies for taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and fundamentally the forms of our governments for suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever he has abdicated government here withdrawing his governors and declaring us out of his allegiance and protection he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized nation he has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions of existence he has incited treasonable insurrections of our fellowcitizens with the allurements of forfeiture and confiscation of our property he has constrained others taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends and brethren or to fall themselves by their hands he has waged cruel war against human nature itself violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of distant people who never offended him captivating and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither this piratical warfare the opprobrium of infidel powers is the warfare of the christian king of great britain determined to keep open a market where men should be bought and sold he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce and that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished dye he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them by murdering the people upon whom he also obtruded them thus paying off former crime committed against the liberties of one people with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injuries a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a people who mean to be free future ages will scarce believe that the hardiness of one man adventured within the short compass of twelve years only to build a foundation so broad and undisguised for tyranny over a people fostered and fixed in the principles of freedom nor have we been wanting in attentions to our british brethren we have warned them from time to time to attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over these our states we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here no one of which could warrant so strange a pretension that these were effected at the expence of our own blood and treasure unassisted by the wealth or strength of great britain that in constituting indeed our several forms of government we had adopted a common king thereby laying a foundation for perpetual league and amity with them but that submission to their parliament was no part of our constitution nor ever in idea if history be credited and we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity as well as to the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which were likely to interrupt our connection and correspondence they too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity and when occasions have been given them by the regular course of their laws of removing from their councils the disturbers of our harmony they have by their free elections reestablished them in power at this very time they are permitting their chief magistrate to send over not only soldiers of our own blood but scotch and other foreign mercenaries to invade and destroy us these facts have given the last stab to agonizing affections and manly spirit bids us to renounce forever these unfeeling brethren we must endeavor to forget our former love for them to hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends we might have been a free and a great people together but a communication of grandeur and of freedom it seems is below their dignity be it so since they will have it the road to happiness and to glory is open to us too we will climb it apart from them and acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our eternal separation we therefore the representatives of the united states in general congress assembled in the name and by authority of the good people of these states reject and renounce all allegiance and subjection to the kings of great britain and all others who may hereafter claim by through or under them we utterly dissolve all political connection which may heretofore have subsisted between us and the people or parliament of great britain and finally we do assert and declare these colonies to be free and independant and that as free and independant states they have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do

had not heard from her at all for two posts before and no letter from herself now i wish it were in my power to return by way of the forest as you think it will be impracticable for mrs eppes to travel to the mountains however it will be late in august before i can get home and our convention will call me down early in october till that time therefore i must defer the hope of seeing mrs eppes and yourself admiral howe is himself arrived at new york and two or three vessels supposed to be of his fleet were coming in the whole is expected daily washingtons numbers are greatly increased but we do not know them exactly i imagine he must have from  0 to   000 by this time the enemy the other day ordered two of their menofwar to hoist anchor and push by our batteries up the hudson river both wind and tide were very fair they passed all the batteries with ease and as far as is known without receiving material damage though there was an incessant fire kept up on them this experiment of theirs i suppose is a prelude to the passage of their whole fleet and seems to indicate an     intention of landing above new york i imagine general washington finding he cannot prevent their going up the river will prepare to amuse them whenever they shall go our army from canada is now at crown point but still one half down with the smallpox you ask about arnolds behavior at the cedars it was this the scoundrel major butterfield having surrendered three hundred and ninety men in a fort with twenty or thirty days provision and ammunition enough to about forty regulars one hundred canadians and five hundred indians before he had lost a single man—and maj sherburne who was coming to the relief of the fort with one hundred men having after bravely engaging the enemy an hour and forty minutes killing twenty of them and losing twelve of his own been surrounded by them and taken prisoners also —gen arnold appeared on the opposite side of the river and prepared to attack them his numbers i know not but believe they were about equal to the enemy capt foster commander of the kings troops sent over a flag to him proposing an exchange of prisoners for as many of the kings in our possession and moreover informed arnold that if he should attack the indians would put every man of the prisoners to death arnold refused called a council of war and it being now in the night it was determined to attack next morning a second flag came over he again refused though in an excruciating situation as he saw the enemy were in earnest about killing the prisoners his men too began to be importunate for the recovery of their fellowsoldiers a third     flag came the men grew more clamorous and arnold now almost raving with rage and compassion was obliged to consent to the exchange and six days suspension of hostilities foster declaring he had not boats to deliver them in less time however he did deliver them so much sooner as that before the six days were expired himself and party had fled out of all reach arnold then retired to montreal you have long before this heard of gen thompsons defeat the truth of that matter has never appeared till lately you will see it in the public papers no men on earth ever behaved better than ours did the enemy behaved dastardly col allen who was in the engagement assured me this day that such was the situation of our men half way up to the thighs in mud for several hours that five hundred men of spirit must have taken the whole yet the enemy were repulsed several times and our people had time to extricate themselves and come off it is believed the enemy suffered considerably the above account of arnolds affair you may rely on as i was one of a committee appointed to inquire into the whole of that matter and have it from those who were in the whole transaction and were taken prisoners my sincere affections to mrs eppes and adieu     thomas jefferson july         philada to the pennsylvania convention  j mss philada july         sir —the honble the convention of virga attending to the inconveniencies which may arise from an unsettled jurisdn in the neighborhood of fort pitt have instructed us to propose to your honorable house to agree on some temporary boundary which may serve for preservation of the peace in that territory until an amicable and final determination may be had before arbiters mutually chosen such temporary settlement will from its nature do predjudice to neither party when at any future day a complete informn of facts shall enable them to submit the doubt to a just  final decision we can assure you that the colony of virga does not entertain a wish that one inch should be added to theirs from the territory of a sister colony  we have a perfect confidence that the same just sentiments prevails in your house parties thus disposed can scarcely meet with difficulty in adjusting either a temporary or a final settlement the decision whatever it be will not annihilate the lands they will remain to be occupied by americans  whether these be counted in the numbers of this or that of the united states will be thought a matter of little moment we shall be ready to confer on this subject with any gentleman you may please to     appoint for that purpose  am sir with every sentiment of respect thomas jefferson july      notes on virginiapennsylvania boundary j mss july      if the monongahela is the line it will throw  00 virginia families into pennsylva most of these live below the yohiogany  monongahela not one third of that number of pennsylvanians would be thrown on the virginia side if the laurel hill is the boundary it will place on the virginia side all the virginia settlers  about  00 families of pennsylvania settlers a middle line is thought to be just braddocks old road crosses the yohiogany in the allegany mountain then turns along by the head of the redstone on the west side of the yohiogany  crosses the laurel hill about   miles from stewarts or harts crossing then crosses the river at stewarts crossing jacobs creek   m above mouth swiglie    m above mouth then goes down to the monongahela about   m below the mouth of yohiogany then recrosses it within a mile  there stopped a line then run from the mouth of the turtle cr to the mouth of the first creek that empties into the allegany above croghans this would give tolerable satisfaction to virginia would throw about   0 pennsylvas into virga  about  0 or  0 virginians into pennsylvana the   0 pennsylvs live in such manner dispersed on the     yohiogany and monongahela that no line will throw them into pennsylva if braddocks road cannot be established the laurel hill  yohiogany might do without great uneasiness  so from the mouth of the turtle as before thomas jefferson july         phila patrick henry to the governor of virginia  patrick henry j mss phila july         we were informed a few weeks ago that  000 lb of lead imported by our colony were landed at fredsbgh as it appeared very unlikely it should be wanting in virga and the flying camp forming in the jerseys in the face of a powerful enemy are likely to be in distress for this article we thought we should be wanting to the public cause which includes that of our own country had we hesitated to desire it to be brought here had the wants of the camp admitted the delay of an application to you we should most certainly have waited an order from you but their distress is instantaneous even this supply is insufficient the army in canada  the army in n york will want much lead  there seems to be no certain source of supply unless the mine in virga can be rendered such we are therefore by direction of congress to beg further you will be pleased to send them what lead can be spared from wmburgh and moreover order    or  0 tons to be brought here immediately from the mine     we take the liberty of recommending the lead mines to you as an object of vast importance we think it impossible they can be worked to too great an extent considered as perhaps the sole means of supporting the american cause they are inestimable as an article of commerce to our colony too they will be valuable  even the waggonage if done either by the colony or individuals belonging to it will carry to it no trifling sum of money we enclose you a resoln of congress of the subjects of forts  garrisons on the ohio several vacancies having happened in our battalions we are unable to have them filled for want of a list of the officers stating their seniority we must beg the favor of you to furnish us with one we received from colo r h lee a resolution of convention recommending us to endeavor that the promotions of the officers be according to seniority without regard to regiments or companies in one instance indeed the congress reserved to themselves a right of departing from seniority that is where a person either out of the line of command or in an inferior part of it has displayed eminent talents most of the the general officers have been promoted in this way without this reservation the whole continent must have been supplied with general officers from the eastern colonies where a large army was formed  officered before any other colony had occasion to raise troops at all  a number of experienced able  valuable officers must have been lost to the public merely from the locality of their situation the resolution of our convention on the subject of     salt we shall lay before congress the convention of pennsylva did not proceed to business yesterday for want of a quorum as soon as they do we shall lay before them the proposition from our convention on the differences at fort pitt  communicate to you the result we are your excys thomas jefferson july         philadelphia col fielding lewis to col fielding lewis j mss philadelphia july         we were informed a few weeks ago that  000 lb of lead imported on acct of our colony were landed at fredsbgh there appears scarcely a possibility it should be wanting in virga more especially when we consider the supplies which may be expected from the mines of that colony the flying camp now forming in the jerseys  which will be immediately in the face of a powerful enemy is likely to be in great want of that article did their wants admit of delay of an application to the governor we should have applied to him  have not a doubt he would order it hither but circumstances are too pressing  we are assured we should incur the censures of our country were we to permit the public cause to suffer essentially while the means of preventing it tho not under our immediate charge are within our reach we therefore take the liberty of desiring you to stop so many of the powder waggons now on their way to wmsburgh as may be necessary  return them immediately with this lead  whatever more you can collect sending the powder on by other     waggons but should the lead have been sent to wmsburgh the waggons may then proceed on their journey  the govr to whom we have written will take care of the matter  thomas jefferson july  0      philadelphia john page to john page  philadelphia july  0      dear page —on the receipt of your letter we enquired into the probability of getting your seal done here we find a drawer and an engraver here both of whom we have reason to believe are excellent in their way they did great seals for jamaica and barbadoes both of which are said to have been well done and a seal for the philosophical society here which we are told is excellent but they are expensive and will require two months to complete it the drawing the figures for the engraver will cost about  0 dollars and the engraving will be still more nevertheless as it would be long before we could consult you and receive an answer as we think you have no such hands and the expence is never to be incurred a second time we shall order it to be done i like the device of the first side of the seal much the second i think is too much crowded nor is the design so striking but for gods sake what is the deus nobis haec otia facit it puzzles every body here if my country really enjoys that otium it is singular as every other colony seems to be hard   0 struggling i think it was agreed on before dunmores flight from gwyns island so that it can hardly be referred to the temporary holiday that has given you this device is too ænigmatical since it puzzles now it will be absolutely insoluble fifty years hence i would not advise that the french gentleman should come here we have so many of that country and have been so much imposed on that the congress begins to be sore on that head besides there is no prospect of raising horse this way but if you approve of the chevalier de st aubin why not appoint him yourselves as your troops of horse are colonial not continental the  th battalion will no doubt be taken into continental pay from the date you mention so also will be the two written for lately to come to the jersies the  th should have been moved in congress long eer now but the muster roll sent us by mr yates was so miserably defective that it would not have been received and would have exposed him we therefore desired him to send one more full still giving it the same date and i enclosed him a proper form if he is diligent we may receive it by next post the answer to your public letter we have addressed to the governor there is nothing new here washingtons and mercers camps recruit with amazing slowness had they been reinforced more readily something might have been attempted on staten island the enemy there are not more than   or  0000 strong ld howe has recd none of his fleet unless some highlanders     about   or  0 vessels were of it our army at tyonderoga is getting out of the small pox we have about   0 carpenters i suppose got there by now i hope they will outbuild the enemy so as to keep our force on the lake superior to theirs there is a mystery in the dereliction of crownpoint the general officers were unanimous in preferring tyonderoga and the field officers against it the latter have assigned reasons in their remonstrance which appear unanswerable yet every one acquainted with the ground pronounce the measure right without answering these reasons having declined serving here the next year i shall be with you at the first session of our assembly i purpose to leave this place the   th of august having so advised mrs jefferson by last post and every letter brings me such an account of the state of her health that it is with great pain i can stay here till then but braxton purposing to leave us the day after tomorrow the colony would be unrepresented were i to go before the   th i hope to see col lee and mr wythe here tho the stay of the latter will i hope be short as he must not be spared from the important department of the law adieu adieu thomas jefferson july         philadelphia francis eppes to francis eppes  philadelphia july         dear sir —we have nothing new here now but from the southward the successes there i hope     will prove valuable here by giving new spirit to our people the ill successes in canada had depressed the minds of many when we shall hear the last of them i know not everybody had supposed crown point would be a certain stand for them but they have retreated from that to ticonderoga against everything which in my eye wears the shape of reason when i wrote you last we were deceived in general washingtons numbers by a return which came to hand a day or two after he then had but   000 effective men his reinforcements have come in pretty well since the flying camp in the jerseys under general mercer begins to form but not as fast as exigencies require the congress have therefore been obliged to send for two of our battalions from virginia i hope that country is perfectly safe now and if it is it seems hardly right that she should not contribute a man to an army of  0000 and an army too on which was to depend the decision of all our rights lord howes fleet has not yet arrived the first division sailed five days before he did but report says it was scattered by a storm this seems probable as lord howe had a long passage the other two divisions were not sailed when he came away i do not expect his army will be here and fit for action till the middle or last of august in the meantime if mercers camp could be formed with the expedition it merits it might be possible to attack the present force from the jersey side of staten island and get rid of that beforehand the militia go in freely considering they leave their harvest to rot in the field     i have received no letter this week which lays me under great anxiety i shall leave this place about the   th of next month give my love to mrs eppes and tell her that when both you and patty fail to write me i think i shall not be unreasonable in insisting she shall thomas jefferson aug        philadelphia john page to john page  philadelphia aug        dear page —i am sorry to hear that the indians have commenced war but greatly pleased you have been so decisive on that head nothing will reduce those wretches so soon as pushing the war into the heart of their country but i would not stop there i would never cease pursuing them while one of them remained on this side the mississippi so unprovoked an attack  so treacherous a one should never be forgiven while one of them remains near enough to do us injury the congress having had reason to suspect the six nations intended war instructed their commissioners to declare to them peremptorily that if they chose to go to war with us they should be at liberty to remove their families out of our settlements but to remember that they should not only never more return to their dwellings on any terms but that we would never cease pursuing them with war while one remained on the face of the earth  moreover to avoid equivocation to let them know they must recall their young men from     canada or we should consider them as acting against us nationally this decisive declaration produced an equally decisive act on their part they have recalled their young men  are stirring themselves with anxiety to keep their people quiet so that the storm we apprehended to be brewing there it is hoped is blown over colo lee being unable to attend here till the  0th inst i am under the painful necessity of putting off my departure notwithstanding the unfavorable situation of mrs jeffersons health we have had hopes till today of receiving an authentication of the next years delegation but are disappointed i know not who should have sent it the governor or president of convention but certainly somebody should have done it what will be the consequence i know not we cannot be admitted to take our seat on any precedent or the spirit of any precedent yet set according to the standing rules not only an authentic copy will be required but it must be entered in the journals verbatim that it may there appear we have right to sit this seems the more necessary as the quorum is then to be reduced some of the newspapers indeed mention that on such a day such  such gentlemen were appointed to serve for the next year but could newspaper evidence be received they could not furnish the form of the appointment not yet that quorum is to be admitted ld howe is recruiting fast forty odd ships arrived the other day  others at other times it is questionable whether our recruits come in so speedily as his several valuable west indian men have     been taken  brought in lately  the spirit of privateering is gaining ground fast no news from ticonderoga i enclose you to amuse your curiosity the form of the prayer substituted in the room of the prayer for the king by mr duché chaplain to the congress i think by making it so general as to take in conventions assemblies c it might be used instead of that for the parliament adieu thomas jefferson aug        philadelphia francis eppes to francis eppes  philadelphia aug  th      dear sir —as col harrison was about to have some things packed i set out upon the execution of your glass commission and was surprised to find that the whole glass stores of the city could not make out anything like what you desired i therefore did what i thought would be best imagining you wanted the number you mentioned at any event and that not being able to get them of that form you would take them of any other i therefore got   pint cans  0s   quart do  s and six halfpint tumblers  s all of double flint so that there still remains in my hands £    s pennsylva currcy your teckle is not yet come it seems the man who had promised to sell it to the gentleman i employed to get it now raises some difficulties either to get off others which he calls the set or to enhance the price however the gentleman still expects it and i am after him every day for it our galleys at     new york have had a smart engagement with the menofwar which went up the river it is believed the enemy suffered a good deal the galleys are much injured though we lost but two men the commander writes us word he retired that he might go and give them another drubbing which in plain english meant i suppose that he was obliged to retire gen washington commends the behavior of the men much they lay pretty close to the enemy and two of the galleys were exposed to the broadside of their ships almost the whole time the damage done them proves they were in a warm situation madison of the college and one johnson of augusta were coming passengers in the new york packet they were attacked by one of our armed vessels and nothing but the intervention of night prevented the packet being taken she is arrived at new york and they permitted to come in a letter by them we have intelligence that the french ministry is changed the pacific men turned out and those who are for war with the duke de choiseul at their head are taken in we have also the kings speech on the prorogation of parliament declaring he will see it out with us to the bitter end the south carolina army with clinton sr arrived at staten island last week one of their transports with   companies of highlanders having first fallen into general lees hands they now make lord howe   000 strong with this force he is preparing to attack he is embarking his cannon has launched   galleys and formed his menofwar into line of battle from these circumstances it is believed     the attack of new york will be within three or four days they expect with the utmost confidence to carry it and they consider our army but as a rude undisciplined rabble i hope they will find it a bunkers hill rabble notwithstanding these appearances of attack there are some who believe and with appearance of reason that these measures are taken by the enemy to secure themselves and not to attack us a little time will shew general arnold a fine sailor has undertaken to command our fleet on the lakes the enemy are fortifying oswego and i believe our army there when recovered from their sickness will find they have lost a good campaign though they have had no battle of moment my love to mrs eppes i hope my letter by last post got there time enough to stay patty with her a while longer adieu thomas jefferson aug         philadelphia edmund pendleton to —   philadelphia aug         dear sir —yours of aug   came to hand yesterday having had no moment to spare since i am obliged to set down to answer it at a committee table while the committee is collecting my thoughts therefore on the subject you propose will be merely extempore the opinion that our lands     were allodial possessions is one which i have very long held and had in my eye during a pretty considerable part of my law reading which i found always strengthened it it was mentioned in a very hasty production intended to have been put under a course of severe correction but produced afterwards to the world in a way with which you are acquainted this opinion i have thought  still think to prove if ever i should have time to look into books again but this is only meant with respect to the english law as transplanted here how far our acts of assembly or acceptance of grants may have converted lands which were allodial into feuds i have never considered this matter is now become a mere speculative point  we have it in our power to make it what it ought to be for the public good it may be considered in the two points of view  st as bringing a revenue into the public treasury  d as a tenure i have only time to suggest hints on each of these heads   is it consistent with good policy or free government to establish a perpetual revenue is it not against the practice of our wise british ancestors have not the instances in which we have departed from this in virginia been constantly condemned by the universal voice of our country is it safe to make the governing power when once seated in office independent of its revenue should we not have in contemplation  prepare for an event however deprecated which may happen in the possibility of things i mean a reacknowledgment of the british tyrant as our king  previously strip him of every prejudicial possession     remember how universally the people run into the idea of recalling charles the  d after living many years under a republican government—as to the second was not the separation of the property from the perpetual use of lands a mere fiction is not its history well known  the purposes for which it was introduced to wit the establishment of a military system of defence was it not afterwards made an engine of immense oppression is it wanting with us for the purpose of military defence may not its other legal effects such of them at least as are valuable be performed in other more simple ways has it not been the practice of all other nations to hold their lands as their personal estate in absolute dominion are we not the better for what we have hitherto abolished of the feudal system has not every restitution of the antient saxon laws had happy effects is it not better now that we return at once into that happy system of our ancestors the wisest  most perfect ever yet devised by the wit of man as it stood before the  th century the idea of congress selling out unlocated lands has been sometimes dropped but we have always met the hint with such determined opposition that i believe it will never be proposed—i am against selling the lands at all the people who will migrate to the westward whether they form part of the old or of a new colony will be subject to their proportion of the continental debt then unpaid they ought not to be subject to more they will be a people little able to pay taxes there is no equity in fixing upon them   0 the whole burthen of this war or any other proportion than we bear ourselves by selling the lands to them you will disgust them and cause an avulsion of them from the common union they will settle the lands in spite of everybody—i am at the same time clear that they should be appropriated in small quantities it is said that wealthy foreigners will come in great numbers  they ought to pay for the liberty we shall have provided for them true but make them pay in settlers a foreigner who brings a settler for every  00 or  00 acres of land to be granted him pays a better price than if he had put into the public treasury   or  £ that settler will be worth to the public  0 times as much every year as on our old plan he would have paid in one paiment i have thrown these loose thoughts together only in obedience to your letter there is not an atom of them which would not have occurred to you on a moments contemplation of the subject charge yourself therefore with the trouble of reading two pages of such undigested stuff by saturdays post the general wrote us that ld howe had got i think  00 flat bottomed boats alongside   0 of them were then loaded with men by which it was concluded he was preparing to attack yet this is tuesday  we hear nothing further the general has by this last return   000 some odd men of whom near  000 are sick  near  000 at out posts in long island c so you may say he has but  0000 effective men to defend the works of new york his works however are good  his men in spirits which i hope will be equal to an addition of many     thousands he had called for  000 men from the flying camp which were then embarking to him  would certainly be with him in time even if the attack was immediate the enemy have since clinton  his army joined them   000 men of whom not many are sick every influence of congress has been exerted in vain to double the generals force it was impossible to prevail on the people to leave their harvest that is now in  great numbers are in motion but they have no chance to be there in time should however any disaster befall us at new york they will form a great army on the spot to stop the progress of the enemy i think there cannot be less than   or  000 men in this city  between it  the flying camp our council complain of our calling away two of the virginia battalions but is this reasonable they have no british enemy  if human reason is of any use to conjecture future events they will not have one their indian enemy is not to be opposed by their regular battalions other colonies of not more than half their military strength have  0 battalions in the field think of these things  endeavor to reconcile them not only to this but to yield greater assistance to the common cause if wanted i wish every battalion we have was now in new york—we yesterday received dispatches from the commissioners at fort pitt i have not read them but a gentleman who has tells me they are favorable the shawanese  delewares are disposed to peace i believe it for this reason we had by different advices information from the shawanese that they should strike us that this was against their will but     that they must do what the senecas bid them at that time we knew the senecas meditated war we directed a declaration to be made to the six nations in general that if they did not take the most decisive measures for the preservation of neutrality we would never cease waging war with them while one was to be found on the face of the earth they immediately changed their conduct and i doubt not have given corresponding information to the shawanese and delewares i hope the cherokees will now be driven beyond the missisipi  that this in future will be declared to the indians the invariable consequence of their beginning a war our contest with britain is too serious and too great to permit any possibility of avocation from the indians this then is the season for driving them off  our southern colonies are happily rid of every other enemy  may exert their whole force in that quarter i hope to leave this place sometime this month i am dear sir your affectionate friend p s mr madison of the college  mr johnson of fredsbgh are arrived in new york they say nothing material had happened in england the french ministry was changed thomas jefferson aug  0      philadelphia john page to john page  philadelphia aug  0      dear page —we have been in hourly expectation of the great decision at new york but it has not yet     happened about three nights ago an attempt was made to burn the two ships which had gone up the river one of the two firerafts prepared for that purpose grappled the phenix ten minutes but was cleared away at last a tender however was burnt the two ships came down on sunday evening and passed all our batteries again with impunity ld dunmore is at staten isld his sick he sent to halifx his effective men he carried to staten isld  the blacks he shipped off to the west indies two gentlemen who had been taken prisoners by the enemy have made their escape they say they are now  0000  that another division of  000 foreigners is still expected they think ld howe will not attack these  0 days but that he does not wait for his last division being confident of victory without one of these informants was captain of a continental vessel going for ammunition the mate  crew rose  took the vessel they fell in with the division of the hessians which came with the hessian general  were brought to the general learning from the dethroned captain what had happened immediately threw the piratical mate into irons  had the captain to dine with him every day till they got to halifx where he delivered him vessel c over to the english—a gentleman who lived some time in this city but since last winter has become a resident of st eustatia writes that by a dutch ship from amsterdam they have advice that the states of holland had refused to renew the prohibition on the exportation of powder to the colonies or to cede to the english the scotch brigade in their service or to     furnish them with some men of war asked of them by the british court this refusal so piqued the ministry that they had been enduced to take several dutch ships amongst which he said were two which sailed from that island  were carried to london another to st kitts in consequence of this the dutch have armed  0 ships of war  ordered  0 more to be built  are raising  0000 land forces the french governor in chief of their w indies has not only refused to permit a capt of a man of war to make prize of our vessels in their ports but forbidden them to come within gun shot of the ports the enemys men of war being withdrawn from our whole coast to nyork gives us now fine opportunities of getting in powder we see the effect here already two canadians who had been captains in our canadian regiment  who general gates writes us are known in the army to be worthy of good credit made their escape from st johns  came over to our army from tyconderoga  give the following intelligence the enemy did not fortify any place we abandoned they had  000 men at isle aux noix under genl fraser  000 at st johns under carleton  some at montreal   0 only had been left at quebec it was reported that  000 english troops which were to have been a part of that army had perished at sea which gave great uneasiness the fleet brot over timber c for  0 boats which they attempted to transport by land from the mouth of sorel to st johns but could not for want of carriages which had been destroyed carleton therefore employed canadians to build batteaux at st     johns he has rendered himself very odious to the canadians by levying contributions on them in general  confiscating the estates of all those who followlowed our army or who abscond great numbers of the germans desert daily  are anxiously concealed by the inhabitants  0 brunswickers disappeared in one day their officers are so much afraid of bushfighting  ambushes that they will not head any parties to pursue the runaways the men have the same fears which prevents them from deserting in so great numbers as is supposed they will when once our fleet shall appear cruising on the lake to receive  protect them between the   d    th july carlet on  the other generals abandoned all their posts on this side sorel except st johns with as great precipitation as our poor sick army had done carrying with them their artillery  provisions this was occasioned by the arrival and mysterious manœuvres of a fleet at quebec supposed french hoisting different colours  firing at tenders sent from the town to enquire who they were  00 men were left at isle aux noix to send them intelligence of our operations who they say will go down the river if we return into canada for this event the canadians are offering up prayers at the shrines of all their saints carleton some time ago hearing that we were returning with a considerable reinforcement was so terrified that he would have retired immediately had not some of his spies come in  informed him of the deplorable situation to which the small pox had reduced our army—they are recovering health and spirits genl gates writes that he had accounts of the roads being     crowded with militia coming

 00 fine ship carpenters mostly sent from here at work i hope a fleet will soon be exhibited on that lake such as it never bore the indians have absolutely refused carleton in canada  butler at niagara to have any thing to do in this quarrel  applaud in the highest terms our wisdom  candour for not requiring them to meddle some of the most sensible speeches i ever saw of theirs are on this head not to be spoken to us but behind our backs in the councils of our enemies from very good intelligence the indians of the middle department will be quiet that treaty is put off till october were it not that it interferes with our assembly i would go to it as i think something important     might be done there which could not be so well planned as by going to the spot  seeing its geography we have great fear that the sending an agent from virginia to enlist indians will have ill consequences it breaks in upon the plan pursued here  destroys that uniformity  consistency of counsels which the indians have noticed  approved in their speeches besides they are a useless expensive ungovernable ally—i forgot to observe that a captain mesnard of canada had come to genl gates after the two

claim to taxation over these colonies which the sd ld drummond suggests the colonies were disposed not many months ago to have made the basis of a reconciliation with gr britain were the unauthorized officious  groundless suggestions of a person who seems totally unacquainted with either reasonings or the facts which have attended this great controversy since from its first origin to this day

decline a service so honorable  at the same time so important to the american cause the necessity under which i labor  the conflict i have undergone for three days during which i could not determine to dismiss your messenger will i hope plead my pardon with congress and i am sure there are too many of that body to whom they may with better hopes confide this charge to leave them under a moments

explaining to us matters in worship  morality but being written occasionally it will readily be seen that their explanations are adpated to the notions  customs of the people they were written to but

teacher ϰηρυξ ϰαι αποστολοϛ ϰαι διδασϰαλοϛ here he designates himself by several synonims as he had before done timothy does this prove that every synonim authorizes a different order of ecclesiastics     do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry ἐργον ποιησον εὐαγγελιστου την διαϰονιαν σου πληροφορεισον timothy then is called επισϰοποϛ διαϰονοϛ ευαγγελιστοϛ ανϑρωποϛ ϑεου     he

riot or unruly for a bishop must be blameless as the steward of god c here then it appears that as the elders appointed the bishops so the bishops appointed the elders i e they are synonims again when telling titus to appoint elders in every city he tells him what kind of men they must be for said he a bishop must be c so that in the same sentence he calls elders bishops   0 a man that is an

the name of the lord another plea for episcopal government in religion in england is its similarity to the political governmt by a king no bishop no king this then with us is a plea for government by a presbytery which resembles republican government the clergy have ever seen this the bishops were alwais mere tools of the crown the presbyterian spirit is known to be so congenial with friendly liberty that the patriots after the restoration finding that the humour of people was running too strongly to exalt the prerogative of the crown promoted the dissenting interest as a check a and

life eternal how can that be the church of christ which excludes such persons from its communion as he will one day receive into the kingdom of heaven the arms of a religious society or church are exhortations admonitions  advice  ultimately expulsion or excommunication this last is the utmost limit of power how far does the duty of toleration extend         no church is bound by the duty of toleration to retain within her bosom obstinate offenders against her laws     we have no right to prejudice another in his civil enjoiments because he is of another church if any man err from the right way it is his own misfortune no injury to thee nor therefore art thou to punish him in the things of this life because thou supposeth he will be miserable in that which is to come—on the contrary accdg to the spirit of the gospel charity bounty liberality is due to him each church being free no one can have jurisdn over another one not even when the civil magistrate joins it it neither acquires the right of the sword by the magistrates coming to it nor does it lose the rights of instruction or excommunicn by his going from it it cannot by the accession of any new member acquire jurisdn over those who do not accede he brings only himself having no power to bring others suppose for instance two churches one of arminians another of calvinists in constantinople has either any right over the other will it be said the orthodox one has every church is to itself orthodox to others erroneous or heretical no man complains of his neighbor for ill management of his affairs for an error in sowing his land or marrying his daughter for consuming his substance in taverns pulling down building c in all these he has his liberty but if he do not frequent the church or there conform to ceremonies there is an immediate uproar     the care of every mans soul belongs to himself but what if he neglect the care of it well what if he neglect the care of his health or estate which more nearly relate to the state will the magistrate make a law that he shall not be poor or sick laws provide against injury from others but not from ourselves god himself will not save men against their wills if i be marching on with my utmost vigour in that way which according to the sacred geography leads to jerusalem straight why am i beaten  ill used by others because my hair is not of the right cut because i have not been dresst right bec i eat flesh on the road bec i avoid certain byways which seem to lead into briars bec among several paths i take that which seems shortest  cleanest bec i avoid travellers less grave  keep company with others who are more sour  austere or bec i follow a guide crowned with a mitre  cloathed in white yet these are the frivolous things which keep xns at war if the magistrate command me to bring my commodity to a publick store house i bring it because he can indemnify me if he erred  i thereby lose it but what indemnification can he give one for the kdom of heaven i cannot give up my guidance to the magistrates bec he knows no more of the way to heaven than i do  is less concerned to direct me right than i am to go right if the

because of tendency why not then level persecution at the crimes you fear will be introduced burn or hang the adulterer cheat c or exclude them from offices strange should be so zealous against things which tend to produce immorality  yet so indulgent to the immorality when produced these moral vices all men acknowledge to be diametrically against x  obstructive of salvation of souls but the fantastical points for which we generally persecute are often very questionable as we may be assured by the very different conclusions of people our savior chose not to propagate his religion by temporal punmts or civil incapacitation if he had it was in his almighty power but he chose to extend it by its influence on reason there by shewing to others how they should proceed the commonwealth is a society of men constituted for protecting their civil interests civil interests are life health indolency of body liberty and property that the magistrates jurisdn extends only to civil rights appears from these considns       the magistrate has no power but wt ye people gave the people hve nt givn hm the care of souls bec ye cd not ye cd not because no man hs right to abandon ye care of his salvation to another no man has power to let another prescribe his faith faith is not faith witht believing no man can conform his faith to the dictates of another the life  essence of religion consists in the internal persuasion or belief of the mind external forms of worship when against our belief are hypocrisy  impiety rom       he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin   if it be said the magistrate may make use of arguments  so draw the heterodox to truth i answer every man has a commission to admonish exhort convince another of error    a church is a voluntary society of men joining themselves together of their own accord in order to the public worshipping of god in such a manner as they judge acceptable to him  effectual to the salvation of their souls it is voluntary bec no man is by nature bound to any church the hope of salvation is the cause of his entering into it if he find anything wrong in it he should be as free to go out as he was to come in    what is the power of that church as it is a society it must have some laws for its regulation time  place of meeting admitting  excluding members c must be regulatn but as it was a spontaneous joining of members it follows that its laws     extend to its own members only not to those of any other voluntary society for then by the same rule some other voluntary society might usurp power over them christ has said wheresoever   or   are gatherd togeth in his name he will be in the midst of them this is his definition of a society he does not make it essential that a bishop or presbyter govern them without them it suffices for the salvation of souls compulsion in religion is distinguished peculiarly from compulsion in every other thing i may grow rich by art i am compelled to follow i may recover health by medicines i am compelled to take agt my own judgment but i cannot be saved by a worship i disbelieve  abhor whatsoever is lawful in the commonwealth or permitted to the subject in the ordinary way cannot be forbidden to him for religious uses  whatsoever is prejudicial to the commonwealth in their ordinary uses  therefore prohibited by the laws ought not to be permitted to churches in their sacred rites for instance it is unlawful in the ordinary course of things or in a private house to murder a child it should not be permitted any sect then to sacrifice children it is ordinarily lawful or temporarily lawful to kill calves or lambs they may therefore be religiously sacrificed but if the good of the state required a temporary suspension of killing lambs as during a siege sacrifices of them may then be rightfully suspended also this is the true extent of toleration truth will do well enough if left to shift for herself     she seldom has received much aid from the power of great men to whom she is rarely known  seldom welcome she has no need of force to procure entrance into the minds of men error indeed has often prevailed by the assistance of power or force truth is the proper  sufficient antagonist to error if anything pass in a religious meeting seditiously and contrary to the public peace let it be punished in the same manner  no otherwise than as if it had happened in a fair or market these meetings ought not to be sanctuaries for faction  flagitiousness locke denies toleration to those who entertain opns contrary to those moral rules necessary for the preservation of society as for instance that faith is not to be kept with those of another persuasion that kings excommunicated forfeit their crowns that dominion is founded in grace or that obedience is due to some foreign prince or who will not own  teach the duty of tolerating all men in matters of religion or who deny the existence of a god it was a great thing to go so far—as he himself sais of the parl who framed the act of tolern but where he stopped short we may go on  he sais neither pagan nor mahomedan nor jew ought to be excluded from the civil rights of the commonwealth because of his religion shall we suffer a pagan to deal with us and not suffer him to pray to     his god why have xns been distinguished above all people who have ever lived for persecutions is it because it is the genius of their religion no its genius is the reverse it is the refusing toleration to those of a different opn which has produced all the bustles and wars on account of religion it was the misfortune of mankind that during the darker centuries the xn priests following their ambition and avarice combining with the magistrate to divide the spoils of the people could establish the notion that schismatics might be ousted of their possessions  destroyed this notion we have not yet cleared ourselves from in this

sd inhabitants require that such seat of government should be as nearly central to all as may be having regard only to navigation the benefits of which are necessary for promoting the growth of a town sufficient for the accommodation of those who resort thereto and able to aid the operations of government and it has been also found inconvenient in the course of the present war where seats of government have been so situated as to be exposed to the insults  injuries of the public enemy which dangers may be avoided and equal justice done to all the citizens of this commonwealth by removing

thomas jefferson    may      williamsburgh john adams to john adams  williamsburgh    may      matters in our part of the continent are too much in quiet to send you news from hence our battalions for the continental service were some time ago so far filled as rendered the recommendation of a draught from the militia hardly requisite and the more so as in this country it ever was the most unpopular  0  and impracticable thing that could be attempted our people even under the monarchical government had learnt to consider it as the last of all oppressions i learn from our delegates that the confederation is again on the carpet a great and a necessary work but i fear almost desperate the point of representation is what most alarms me as i fear the great and small colonies are bitterly determined not to cede will you be so good as to collect the proposition i formerly made you in private and try if you can work it into some good to save our union it was that any proposition might be negatived by the representatives of a majority of the people of america or of a majority of the colonies of america the former secures the larger the latter the smaller colonies i have mentioned it to many here the good whigs i think will so far cede their opinions for the sake of the union and others we care little for the journals of congress not being printed earlier gives more uneasiness than i would wish ever to see produced by any act of that body from whom alone i know our salvation can proceed in our assembly even the best affected think it an indignity to freemen to be voted away life and fortune in the dark our house have lately written for a manuscript copy of your journals not meaning to desire a communication of any thing ordered to be kept secret i wish the regulation of the postoffice adopted by congress last september could be put in practice it was for the travel night and day and to go their several stages three times a week the speedy and frequent communication of intelligence is really of  0  great consequence so many falsehoods have been propagated that nothing now is believed unless coming from congress or camp our people merely for want of intelligence which they may rely on are become lethargic and insensible of the state they are in had you ever a leisure moment i should ask a letter from you sometimes directed to the care of mr dick fredericksburgh but having nothing to give in return it would be a tax on your charity as well as your time the esteem i have for you privately as well as for your public importance will always render assurances of your health and happiness agreeable i am dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson august         virginia benjamin franklin to benjamin franklin  virginia august         honorable sir —i forbear to write you news as the time of mr shorts departure being uncertain it might be old before you receive it and he can in person possess you of all we have with respect to the state of virginia in particular the people seem to have laid aside the monarchical and taken up the republican government with as much ease as would have attended their throwing off an old and putting on a new suit of clothes not a single throe has attended this important transformation a halfdozen aristocratical gentlemen agonizing under the loss of preeminence have sometimes ventured their sarcasms on our political metamorphosis they have been thought fitter objects of pity than of  0  punishment we are at present in the complete and quiet exercise of wellorganized government save only that our courts of justice do not open till the fall i think nothing can bring the security of our continent and its cause into danger if we can support the credit of our paper to do that i apprehend one of two steps must be taken either to procure free trade by alliance with some naval power able to protect it or if we find there is no prospect of that to shut our ports totally to all the world and turn our colonies into manufactories the former would be most eligible because most conformable to the habits and wishes of our people were the british court to return to their senses in time to seize the little advantage which still remains within their reach from this quarter i judge that on acknowledging our absolute independence and sovereignty a commercial treaty beneficial to them and perhaps even a league of mutual offence and defence might not seeing the expense or consequences of such a measure be approved by our people if nothing in the mean time done on your part should prevent it but they will continue to grasp at their desperate sovereignty till every benefit short of that is forever out of their reach i wish my domestic situation had rendered it possible for me to join you in the very honorable charge confided to you residence in a polite court society of literati of the first order a just cause and an approving god will add length to a life for which all men pray and none more than your most obedient and humble servant  0  thomas jefferson aug         virga john adams to john adams albemarle in virga aug         dear sir —your favor of may    came safely to hand i wish it were in my power to suggest any remedy for the evil you complain of tho did any occur i should propose it to you with great diffidence after knowing you had thought on the subject yourself there is indeed a fact which may not have come to your knolege out of which perhaps some little good may be drawn the borrowing money in europe or obtaining credit there for necessaries has already probably been essayed  it is supposed with some degree of success but i expect your applications have as yet been only to france holland or such other states as are of principal note there is however a small power well disposed to our cause  as i am informed possessed of abilities to assist us in this way i speak of the grand duke of tuscany the little states of italy you know have had long peace  shew no disposition to interrupt that peace shortly the grand duke being somewhat avaricious in his nature has availed himself of the opportunity of collecting  hoarding what money he has been able to gather i am informed from good authority an officer who was concerned in the business of his treasury  that about three years ago he had ten millions of crowns lying dead in his coffers of this it is thought possible as much might be borrowed as would amount to a million of pounds lawful money at any rate  0  the attempt might be worth making perhaps an application from dr franklin who has some acquaintance in that court might be sufficient or as it might be prudent to sound well before the application in order to prevent the discredit of a rebuff perhaps congress would think it worth while to send a special agent there to negotiate the matter i think we have a gentleman here who would do it with dexterity  fidelity he is a native of that duchy well connected there conversant in courts of great understanding  equal zeal in our cause he came over not long since to introduce the cultivation of vines olives c among us should you think the matter worth a further thought either of the cols lees to whom he is known can acquaint you more fully of his character if the money can be obtained in specie it may be applied to reduce the quantity of circulating paper  be so managed as to help the credit of that which will remain in circulation if credit alone can be obtained for the manufactures of the country it will still help to clothe our armies or to increase at market the necessaries our people want what upon earth can howe mean by the manœuvre he is now practicing there seems to me no object in this country which can be either of utility or reputation to his cause i hope it will prove of a piece with all the other follies they have committed the forming a junction with the northern army up the hudsons river or taking possession of philadelphia might have been a feather in his cap  given them a little reputation in europe   0 the former as being the design with which they came the latter as being a place of the first reputation abroad  the residence of congress here he may destroy the little hamlet of wmsbgh steal a few slaves  lose half his army among the fens  marshes of our lower country or by the heat of the climate i am dear sir yours c dec        thomas jefferson first report of conference committee  thursday dec        mr jefferson reported from the committee appointed to draw up what is proper to be offered at the conference proposed with the senate on the subject matter of their amendments to the resolution of this house for paying to thomas johnson the sum of   £  s  d that the committee had accordingly drawn up what they think would be proper to be offered at the said conference which they had directed him to report to the said house he read the report in his place and afterwards delivered it in at the clerks table where the same was read and is as followeth viz the house of delegates has desired this conference in order to preserve that harmony and friendly correspondence with the senate which is necessary for the discharge of their joint duties of legislation and to prevent both now and in future the delay of public business and injury which may accrue to     individuals should the two houses differ in opinion as to the distinct office of each though during the course of the last two and also of the present session of assembly they have acquiesced under some amendments made by the senate to votes for allowing public claims and demands yet they are of opinion that an adherence to fundamental principles is the most likely way to save both time and disagreement and a departure from them may at some time or other be drawn into precedent for dangerous innovations and that therefore it is better for both houses and for those by whom they are entrusted to correct the error while new and before it becomes inveterate by habit and custom the constitution having declared that money bills shall in no instance be altered by the senate but wholly approved or rejected the delegates are of opinion the senate had no authority to amend their late vote for allowing to thomas johnson the sum of fifteen pounds five shillings and six pence and should the term money bills in the constitution not immediately convey the precise idea which the framers of that act intended to express it is supposed that its explanation should be sought for in the institutions of that people among whom alone a distinction between money bills and other acts of legislation is supposed to have been made and from whom we and others emigrating from them have indisputably copied it by the law and usage of their parliament then all those are understood to be money bills which     raise money in any way or which dispose of it and which regulate those circumstances of matter method and time which attend as of consequence on the right of giving and disposing again the law and customs of their parliament which include the usage as to money bills are a part of the law of their land our ancestors adopted their system of law in the general making from time to time such alterations as local diversities required but that part of their law which relates to the matter now in question was never altered by our legislature in any period of its history but on the contrary the two houses of assembly both under our regal and republican governments have ever done business on the constant admission that the law of parliament was their law when the delegates therefore vote that fifteen pounds five shillings and six pence whether raised or to be raised on the people shall be disposed of in payment to thomas johnson for losses sustained by him on the public behalf this is a vote for the disposal of money which the senate are at liberty to approve or reject in the whole but cannot amend by altering the sum the delegates therefore hope that the senate will concur with them in a strict and mutual observance of those laws by which both houses are bound and they are well assured that this subject being properly stated to the senate they will forbear in future to exercise a practice which seems not authorised but if there should be found any difference of opinion on this point the delegates will be ready to join in any regular proposition for defining     with precision the subject of their difference so as to prevent all doubts and delays in future jan        thomas jefferson second report of conference committee friday jan        mr jefferson reported from the committee appointed to prepare reasons to be offered to the senate at the conference to be desired of them on the subject of the last conference that the committee had accordingly prepared what they thought would be proper to be offered at the said conference and he read the same in his place and afterwards delivered it in at the clerks table where the same was read and is as followeth viz reasons to be offered at the conference to be desired of the senate in answer to their reasons delivered at the last conference the house of delegates not being satisfied with the reasons urged by the senate in support of their amendments to the resolution for allowing thomas johnson the sum of   £  s  d have desired this second conference to shew the insufficiency of the said reasons and to propose that some expedient may be adopted by the two houses for reconciling their difference of opinion the resemblance between the constituent parts of our legislature and that of great britain is supposed by the senate so faint that no ground remains for those jealousies which have prompted the commons of great britain against their house of     lords this might have been and doubtless was urged at the time our constitution was formed as a reason why the senate and delegates should have equal powers of money bills but the argument having been overruled and the powers of the senate as to this point being fixed by the constitution on the same restricted footing with those of the lords in the british legislature it is conceived not to be the proper question of this day whether the resemblance between them in general be faint or strong well or illgrounded but whether the constitution has not made them to resemble in this point had those who framed the constitution as soon as they had completed that work been asked man by man what a money bill was it is supposed that man by man they would have referred for answer to the well known laws and usages of parliament or would have formed their answer on the parliamentary idea of that term its import at this day must be the same as it was then and it would be unreasonable now to send us to seek its definition in the subsequent proceedings of that body as it would have been for them at that day to have referred us to such proceedings before they had come into existence the meaning of the term must be supposed complete at the time they use it and to be sought for in those resources only which existed at the time constructions which do not result from the words of the legislator but lie hidden in his breast till called forth ex post facto by subsequent occasions are dangerous and not to be justified by ordinary emergencies     nor do we by this set up the parliament of england as the expositor of our constitution but the law of parliament as it existed and was evidenced by usage at the time the term in question was inserted in our instrument of government a law coeval with the common law itself and no more liable as adopted by us to subsequent change from that body than their common or statute law which we have in like manner adopted to suppose this branch of law not existing in our code would shake the foundation of our whole legal system since every legislative proposition which has been passed or rejected since the first establishment of a legislature in this country has been determined to be law or not law by the forms of parliamentary proceeding with as little justice may it be said that this is referring for the definition of a term to multiplied disputes which have for ages agitated the parliament of england and which no time will decide that it is proving what is clear by what is very obscure and unsettling what is fixed since we conceive that researches into parliamentary history will decisively shew that their practice in this matter has been clear fixed and ancient and that for ages past it has produced no agitation unless we call by that name some groundless assertions of the lords in the course of the last century yet these assertions they departed from in practice at the very time they advanced them and at all times after they stand contradicted by the declarations of the commons and the constant usage of both houses which agreeing together are supposed to     form the strongest evidence what the law of parliament is on this point to prove this right as uniformly claimed and exercised by the commons and assented to in practice by the lords the delegates will subjoin some proceedings of parliament in addition to the passage cited by the senate that a bill for raising money by way of taxes is a money bill is admitted by the senate and need not therefore be proved that bills for raising money by rates and impositions on merchandise are also considered as money bills will appear on recurring to the parliamentary proceedings of      in which it is affirmed that there is a fundamental right in the house of commons alone in bills of rates and impositions on merchandise as to the matter the measure and the time and also by their declaration of      that the commons have always taken it for their undoubted privilege of which they have been tender and jealous that in all aids given to the king by the commons the rate or tax ought not to be any way altered by the lords which is supposed to be the passage cited by the senate as of the year      that bills for applying forfeitures in aid of the public revenue are not amendable by the lords appears by the proceedings of   00 on the bill for applying irish forfeitures to the use of the public to which the lords were not permitted to make any amendments the right of levying money in whatever way being thus exercised by the commons as their exclusive     office it follows as a necessary consequence that they may also exclusively direct its application cujus est dare ejus est disponere is an elementary principle both of law and of reason that he who gives may direct the application of the gift or in other words may dispose of it that if he may give absolutely he may also carve out the conditions limitations purposes and measure of the gift seems as evidently true as that the greater power contains the lesser parliamentary usage has accordingly approved this reasoning in july      the commons resolved that it is their undoubted and sole right to direct limit and appoint in all aids and supplies granted to the king the ends purposes considerations limitations and qualifications of such grants which ought not to be changed by the house of lords in december of the same year the commons having directed the payment of money and the lords proposed an amendment thereto the former declared that their lordships never before changed any such disposition made on a supply granted by the commons in   0  the lords having amended a bill for stating and examining the public accounts by inserting a clause for allowing a particular debt the commons disagreed to the amendment and declared for a reason that the disposition as well as granting of money by act of parliament hath ever been in the house of commons and that the amendment relating to the disposal of money does     entrench upon that right and to a bill of the same nature the year following the lords having proposed an amendment and declared that their right in granting limiting and disposing public aids being the main hinge of the controversy they thought it of the highest concern that it should be cleared and settled they then go on to prove the usage by precedents and declarations and from these conclude that the limitation disposition and manner of account belong only to them in reply the lords said they declined all arguments concerning the rights of the commons in granting limiting and disposing public aids and therefore forbore to answer any arguments of that kind but proceeded to insist that the business then depending was of quite another nature and at some subsequent conferences between the two houses during the same session it was repeatedly declared that the lords could not supply any deficiency or apply any surplusage of the public money and in case any should be found and this declaration does not appear to have been contradicted by the lords either then or at any time after the precedents are supposed to prove not only that the disposal or application of public money is equally with the raising of it the exclusive office of the commons but also that it makes no difference whether it be of money then actually in the treasury or yet to be raised on the people nor whether the raising and disposing be in the same or in separate bills     though the precedents referred to by the senate in the proceedings of the council and house of burgesses in the years           and      the first of which however we suppose to be mistaken for      might perhaps be well accounted for from their particular nature from the history of the times or from other causes and though the delegates might produce from the same records proofs much more decisive in their favor yet they decline resting the matter on that bottom because they are of opinion that the present determination ought not to be influenced by the practice of those who have themselves only copied from the same original their practice and our opinions must be proved by the same common rule—the law and practice of parliament their acknowledgment of the rule proves their submission to it and that their practice should be tried by the law and not the law by their practice how dangerous it is to appeal to other authorities from the parliamentary records the true text of decision will appear also by examining the whole passage of which a part only was cited from the commentaries of judge blackstone a writer celebrated indeed but whether most for his attachment to the prerogatives of the crown or to the rights of the people would be worthy of consideration where the question is on one of those rights which have been of the greatest value to the people—the right of giving and disposing of their own money that writer after the definition cited from his book by the senate goes on to quote a passage   0 from judge hales treatise on the jurisdiction of parliament which is to be found more at large in brokes abridgement under the title parliament pl   there it appears to be a saying of kerbie a clerk of the parliament who lays down in express terms or by direct implication these following positions as of the law of parliament—  st that the lords may amend a bill for granting aids  nd that if the amendment be by shortening the duration of the grant they need not return the bill to the commons for their concurrence  rd that the king may alter a bill broke indeed adds a quere to the case but that judge blackstone disapproved of it cannot be inferred from his words it is therefore submitted to the consideration of the senate whether they would set up as an arbiter of parliamentary law a writer who can cite or refer to such positions whether condemning them in decisive and unequivocal terms for that part of his book too which the senate quote and rely on he cites no authority whatever are we then to take it upon his affirmation when contradicted by the uniform current of parliamentary usage but waiving further examination of the legality of his opinion it suffices to observe as a full answer to it that the judges of the common law can take no cognizance of the law of parliament it can never come judicially in question before them their sayings or opinions on the subject must be ever extrajudicial and they have accordingly always disclaimed a right to give judgment on them     definitions therefore of parliamentary law by any other court by a member of court or by a private individual must be rejected as inauthoritative in a parliamentary disquisition for these reasons the delegates still think that the senate have no authority to amend the vote in question but open to conviction if it can be shown they are wrong and actuated by a strong desire to promote the public service as well as to preserve the constitution entire they propose to the senate if they should still adhere to their former opinions that a select committee may be appointed by each house to meet together in full conference and endeavor to define the office of the two houses in bills clauses and votes relating to money and that such definition if approved by both houses may be confirmed by act of assembly thomas jefferson jan         draft of a bill giving certain powers to the executive  v s a jan         whereas the present war between america  great britain was undertaken for defence of the common rights of the american states  it is therefore just that each of them when in danger should be aided by the joint exertions of all and as on any invasion of this commonwealth in particular we     should hope for  expect necessary aids of militia from our neighboring sister states so it is incumbent on us to yield the same assistance to them under the like circumstances  the laws heretofore empowering the governor  council to send aids of militia to such states will expire at the end of this present session of assembly be it therefore enacted by the general assembly that on the invasion of any adjacent or neighboring state  application from congress or from the legislative or executive powers of such state for aids of militia it shall be lawful for the governor with the advice of the council of state to order to their assistance such corps of the militia from any of the counties of this commonwealth as the exigence of the case may require or admit having regard in such orders to the convenience  vicinity of such counties to the place invaded their internal security  the imminence of the danger and moreover to appoint such general field  staff officers as may be requisite to command attend  provide for the same to have them furnished with necessaries for travelling  camp uses  such arms ammunition and accoutrements as may be called for if the same can be

reimbursed to the commonwealth such militia while on duty shall be subject to the continental rules  articles of discipline  government save only that all courtsmartial whether general or regimental

to be holden at such place as the legislature shall direct  no place hath as yet been appointed for that purpose be it therefore enacted by the general assembly that for the term of one year after the end of this present session of assembly  from thence to the end of the session next ensuing the said courts shall be holden in the capitol in the city of williamsburgh and be it further enacted that it shall be lawful for the said high court of chancery to appoint from time to time their own serjeant at arms who shall be attendant on the sd court to perform the duties of his office for which he

resolution passed on the   d day of april last past reciting that persuasion  influence the example of the deluded or wicked the fear of danger or the calamities of war may have induced some of the subjects of these states to join aid or abet the british forces in america and who tho now desirous of returning to their country may be deterred by the fear of punishment and that the people of these states are ever more ready to reclaim than to abandon to mitigate than to increase the horrors of war to pardon than to punish offenders did recommend to the legislatures of the several states to pass laws or to the executive authority of each state if invested with sufficient power to issue proclamations offering pardon with such exceptions and under such limitations and restrictions as they shall think expedient to such of their inhabitants or subjects as have levied war against any of these states or adhered to aided or abetted the enemy and shall surrender themselves to any civil or military officer of any of these states  shall return to the state to which they may belong before the  0th day of june next and did further recommend to the good      faithful citizens of these states to receive such returning penitents with compassion and mercy  to forgive  bury in oblivion their past failings and transgressions be it therefore enacted by the general assembly that full and free pardon is hereby granted to all such persons without any exception who shall surrender themselves as aforesaid and shall take the oath of fidelity to this commonwealth within one month after their return thereto thomas jefferson may         a bill for the speedy recovery of debts due the united states  v s a may         whereas divers persons receiving money of the united states of america for publick uses apply it to different purposes and when called on refuse or neglect to repay the same others enter into contracts for supplying the army  navy of the united states with provision and

intitled an act to establish a mode for the speedy and summary recovery of such sums of money as are or may become     due  for enforcing all contracts entered into with government and it is expedient that the same speedy remedy be given in like cases respecting the united states be it therefore enacted by the general assembly that where in any case a remedy is by the sd act given to this commonwealth or any of its agents or contractors in a like case the same remedy shall be given to the united states their agents  contractors and where by the sd act such proceedings are directed to be instituted by the treasurer in the name of the governor for the time being in a like case respecting the united states the proceedings shall be instituted by their deputy paymaster general within

raising volunteers to join the grand army        0    and as it will be necessary to make a further emission of treasury notes and to provide for the redemption thereof be it enacted by the general assembly that it shall be lawful for the treasurer to issue treasury notes in dollars or parts of a dollar for any sum which may be requisite for the purposes aforesaid in addition to the sums issuable by former acts of assembly so as the sd sum to be issued by authority of this act do not exceed hundred thousand dollars and he shall cause the sd to be engraved  printed in such manner  on such paper as he shall judge most likely to secure the same from being counterfeited and shall appoint proper persons to overlook the press  to number and sign the notes upon the best terms on which he can procure them and whereas there is reason to believe that the taxes imposed by an act passed at the last session of general assembly for raising a supply of money for publick exigencies will be more than sufficient to answer the purposes expressed in the sd act be it further enacted that after the taxes which shall be levied by authority of the sd act shall have effected the purposes to which they are appropriated by the sd act so much of what shall remain as shall be sufficient for the redemption of the notes to be issued by authority of this present act shall be applied to that purpose and if so much as shall be sufficient shall not remain further provision shall be made by law for making good the deficiency and redeeming the whole before the first day of december which

thomas jefferson may         a bill to amend an act intitled an act for raising a supply of money for public exigencies  may         whereas by an act of the last session of the general assembly entitled an act for raising a supply of money for public exigencies it was enacted that a tax or rate of ten shillings for every hundred pounds value should be paid among other things upon all slaves by the owner or proprietor and that the value of such slaves should be estimated by assessors     to be appointed in every hundred and it hath been already seen that such valuation will be very unequal slaves of the same value being estimated at three or four times more in some places than in others insomuch that the sd tax on this particular is like to be very heavy on some citizens of this commonwealth and light on others which is unequal and unjust and it is believed that if one certain rate by the head be fixed on all slaves bearing the same proportion to their average value as the said pound rate bore to their respective values it will be more equal in the whole it being supposed that in most parcels of slaves there will be nearly the same proportion of valuable  of indifferent be it therefore enacted by the general assembly that as well for the present as the remaining years of the term during which the sd act is to continue in force a tax of fifteen shillings by the head shall be paid on all slaves of whatever age or sex in lieu of the sd rate of ten shillings in every hundred pounds value and in like manner the double of the sd tax by those who by the sd act were to pay a double rate and when the assessors shall have noted therein the number of slaves for which they shall have assessed a pound rate on the proprietor the commissioners shall extend against such proprietor the tax aforesd in lieu of the pound rate on the sd slaves extended by the assessors and where they shall not have so noted the number of slaves they shall be required by the sd commissioners forthwith to do it and if any person shall have paid such pound rate before notice of this act if the same were greater   0 than the tax hereby imposed he may require the sheriff to refund the difference or overplus and on failure may recover the same before any justice if the sum be under twentyfive shillings and if it amount to that sum then on motion before any court giving such sheriff ten days notice thereof and if the pound rate so paid were less than the tax hereby imposed then the sheriff shall collect the difference or deficiency in like manner as by the sd act he was authorized to collect the sd pound rate and doubts having arisen where slaves are hired whether the sd pound rate should be paid by the owner or hirer and as a like doubt may arise as to the tax hereby imposed it is declared that the sd tax is paiable by the owner unless otherwise settled by contract between the parties thomas jefferson may         draft of bill of attainder against josiah philips  v s a may         whereas a certain josiah philips labourer of the parish of lynhaven and county of princess anne     together with divers other inhabitants of the counties of princess anne  norfolk and citizens of this commonwealth contrary to their fidelity associating and confederating together have levied war against this commonwealth within the same committing     murders burning houses wasting farms and still continue to exercise the same enormities on the good people of this commonwealth and whereas the delays which would attend the proceeding to outlaw the said     offenders according to the usual forms and procedures of the courts of law would leave the said good people for a long time exposed to murder  devastation be it therefore enacted by the general assembly that if the said josiah philips his associates and confederates     shall not on or before the day of june in this present year render themselves to the governor or to some member of the privy council judge of the general court justice of the peace or commissioned officer of the regular troops navy or militia     of this commonwealth in order to their trials for the treasons murders  other felonies by them committed that then such of them the said josiah philips his associates and confederates as shall not so render him or themselves shall stand and be convicted and attainted of high treason and shall suffer     the pains of death and incur all forfeitures penalties  disabilities prescribed by the law against those convicted  attainted of hightreason and that execution of this sentence of attainder shall be done by order of the general court to be entered so soon as may be conveniently after notice that any of the said offenders are in custody of the keeper of the public gaol and if any person committed to the custody of the keeper of the public gaol as an associate or confederate of the sd josiah philips shall alledge that he hath not been of his associates or confederates at any time after the day of in the year of our lord at which time the sd murders  devastations were begun a petty jury shall be summoned  charged according to the forms of the law to try in presence of the said court the fact so alledged and if it be found against the defendant execution of this act shall be done as before directed and that the good people of this commonwealth may not in the meantime be subject to the unrestrained hostilities of the said insurgents be it further enacted that from and after the passing of this act it shall be lawful for any person with or without orders to pursue and slay the said josiah philips and any others who have been his associates or confederates at any time after the sd day of aforesaid and shall not have previously rendered him or themselves to any of the officers civil or military before described or otherwise to take and deliver them to justice to be dealt with according to law provided that the person so slain be in arms at the time or endeavoring to escape being taken     thomas jefferson june        williamsburg richard henry lee to richard henry lee  williamsburg june        dear sir —i am now to acknowledge the receipt of two of your favors during the session of assembly but there being little to communicate to you and that being a busy time with me has prevented my doing it sooner the assembly rose on monday last their only act which can shortly aid our army was one for raising a regiment of horse which i think will be raised as fast as it can be accoutred another act they passed will also produce aid to our army i hope but it will be some delay first it was for giving great encouragement to soldiers and appointing recruiting officers all over the country to attend all publick places by a third act they foolishly repeated the experiment of raising volunteers the first attempt was pardonable because its illsuccess could not be foreseen the second is worse than ridiculous because it may deceive our friends i am satisfied there will not be a company raised i wish congress would commute a good part of the infantry required from us for an equivalent force in horse this service opens us a new fund of young men who have not yet stepped forth i mean those whose indolence or education has unfitted them for foot service this may be worth your thinking of we passed the bill of pardon recommended by congress but the senate rejected it your letter about enlarging your powers over the confederation was not proceeded on because the nature of the enlargement was not chalked out     by you so intelligibly as enabled the house to do anything unless they had given a carteblanche indeed i believe that had the alterations proposed been specified unless they had been mere form indeed it might have been difficult to obtain their consent a frenchman arrived here a week ago with a vast cargo of woolens made and unmade stockings shoes c fit for the army fifty thousand weight of powder and other articles the master had once sold the whole cargo to the governor and council for  s  p the livre first cost but on suggestions from some of our forestallers and those from maryland he flew off our bay is clear of the enemy nothing new here i set out for albemarle within a day or two mr harvie will be with you in about three weeks my complements to your brethren of the delegation and am dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson june        virginia to — j mss williamsburg in virginia june        sir —your letter of sep         from paris comes safe to hand we have not however had the pleasure of seeing mr de cenis the bearer of it in this country as he joined the army in pennsylvania as soon as he arrived i should have taken particular pleasure in serving him on your recommendation from the kind anxiety expressed in your letter as well as from other sources of information we discover that our enemies have filled europe with     thrasonic accounts of victories they had never won and conquests they were fated never to make while these accounts alarmed our friends in europe they afforded us diversion we have long been out of all fear for the event of the war i enclose you a list of the killed wounded and captives of the enemy from the commencement of hostilities at lexington in april      until november      since which there has been no event of any consequence this is the best history of the war which can be brought within the compass of a letter i believe the account to be near the truth tho it is difficult to get at the numbers lost by an enemy with absolute precision many of the articles have been communicated to us from england as taken from the official returns made by their general i wish it were in my power to send you as just an account of our loss but this cannot be done without an application to the war office which being in another county is at this time out of my reach i think that upon the whole it has been about one half the number lost by them in some instances more but in others less this difference is ascribed to our superiority in taking aim when we fire every soldier in our army having been intimate with his gun from his infancy if there could have been a doubt before as to the event of the war it is now totally removed by the interposition of france  the generous alliance she has entered into with us tho much of my time is employed in the councils of america i have yet a little leisure to indulge my fondness for philosophical studies i could wish to   0 correspond with you on subjects of that kind it might not be unacceptable to you to be informed for instance of the true power of our climate as discoverable from the thermometer from the force  direction of the winds the quantity of rain the plants which grow without shelter in winter c on the other hand we should be much pleased with cotemporary observations on the same particulars in your country which will give us a comparative view of the two climates farenheits thermometer is the only one in use with us i make my daily observations as early as possible in the morning  again about   oclock in the afternoon these generally showing the maxima of cold  heat in the course of    hours i wish i could gratify your botanical taste but i am acquainted with nothing more than the first principles of that science yet myself  my friends may furnish you with any botanical subjects which this country affords and are not to be had with you and i shall take pleasure in procuring them when pointed out by you the greatest difficulty will be the means of conveyance during the continuance of the war if there is a gratification which i envy any people in this world it is to your country its music this is the favorite passion of my soul  fortune has cast my lot in a country where it is in a state of deplorable barbarism from the line of life in which we conjecture you to be i have for some time lost the hope of seeing you here should the event prove so i shall ask your assistance in procuring a substitute who may be a proficient in singing      on the harpsichord i should be contented to receive such an one two or three years hence when it is hoped he may come more safely and find here a greater plenty of those useful things which commerce alone can furnish the bounds of an american fortune will not admit the indulgence of a domestic band of musicians yet i have thought that a passion for music might be reconciled with that economy which we are obliged to observe i retain for instance among my domestic servants a gardener ortolans a weaver tessitore di lino e lin a cabinet maker stipeltaio and a stone cutter scalpellino laborante in piano to which i would add a vigneron in a country where like yours music is cultivated and practised by every class of men i suppose there might be found persons of those trades who could perform on the french horn clarinet or hautboy  bassoon so that one might have a band of two french horns two clarinets  hautboys  a bassoon without enlarging their domestic expenses a certainty of employment for a half dozen years and at the end of that time to find them if they choose a conveyance to their own country might induce them to come here on reasonable wages without meaning to give you trouble perhaps it might be practicable for you in your ordinary intercourse with your people to find out such men disposed to come to america sobriety and good nature would be desirable parts of their characters if you think such a plan practicable and will be so kind as to inform me what will be necessary to be done on my part i will take care     that it shall be done the necessary expenses when informed of them i can remit before they are wanting to any port in france with which country alone we have safe correspondence i am sir with much esteem your humble servant edmund pendleton june      resolutions concerning peace with england  j mss june       resolved unanimously that a proposition from the enemy to all or any of these united states for peace or truce separate from their allies is insidious and inadmissable resolved unanimously that a proposition from the enemy for treating with any assembly or body of men in america other than the congress of these united states is insidious and inadmissable resolved unanimously that this assembly will not listen to any proposition nor suffer any negotiation inconsistent with their national faith and federal union resolved unanimously that this assembly will exert the utmost power of the state to carry on the war with vigour and effect until peace shall be obtained in a manner consistent with our national faith and federal union     thomas jefferson june        williamsburgh samuel henley to rev samuel henley  williamsburgh june        reverend sir —mr madison i believe informed you by letter written some time ago that one of your boxes of books left in his care burst open in removing it from the college to the presidents house for greater security this accident discovered them to be in a state of ruin they had contracted a dampness  stuck together in large blocks insomuch that they could not sometimes be separated without tearing the cover i happened to be in town  was of opinion with mr madison that it was necessary to overhaul them and give them air indeed we both thought—i think it would be for your interest to have them sold as books are now in considerable demand here and packed as they are in boxes they must sustain injury there are many of them which i would be glad to take myself at their stirling cost and would remit you the money by the way of france that cost might be fixed either by note from yourself informing me what they cost you or by the estimate of anybody here in whom you trust upon a presumption that you could not but approve of the proposal to have them disposed of  the money remitted for the reasons before given  others which you may apprehend but would be improper for me to explain i have taken the liberty of laying apart many of them for myself leaving with mr madison a catalogue of them and ready to return them to him if     you shall direct it i shall be glad of your answer as soon as possible and will gladly serve you in the care of any interest you may have left here the reasons are obvious which restrain this letter to matters of business as soon as the obstacles to friendly correspondence are removed i shall be glad at all times to hear from you i am reverend sir your friend  servant thomas jefferson july         virginia david rittenhouse to david rittenhouse  monticello in albemarle virginia july         dear sir —i sincerely congratulate you on the recovery of philadelphia and wish it may be found uninjured by the enemy—how far the interests of literature may have suffered by the injury or removal of the orrery as it is miscalled the publick libraries your papers  implements are doubts which still excite anxiety we were much disappointed in virginia generally on the day of the great eclipse which proved to be cloudy in williamsburgh where it was total i understand only the beginning was seen at this place which is in lat   ° ′ and longitude west from williamsburgh about  °  ′ as is conjectured eleven digits only were supposed to be covered as it was not seen at all till the moon had advanced nearly one third over the suns disc afterwards it was seen at intervals     through the whole the egress particularly was visible it proved however of little use to me for want of a time piece that could be depended on which circumstance together with the subsequent restoration of philadelphia to you has induced me to trouble you with this letter to remind you of your kind promise of making me an accurate clock which being intended for astronomical purposes only i would have divested of all apparatus for striking or for any other purpose which by increasing its complication might disturb its accuracy a companion to it for keeping seconds and which might be moved easily would greatly add to its value the theodolite for which i spoke to you also i can now dispense with having since purchased a most excellent one writing to a philosopher i may hope to be pardoned for intruding some thoughts of my own tho they relate to him personally your time for two years past has i believe been principally employed in the civil government of your country tho i have been aware of the authority our cause would acquire with the world from its being known that yourself  doctr franklin were zealous friends to it and am myself duly impressed with a sense of the arduousness of government and the obligation those are under who are able to conduct it yet i am also satisfied there is an order of geniusses above that obligation  therefore exempted from it nobody can conceive that nature ever intended to throw away a newton upon the occupations of a crown it would have been a prodigality for which even the conduct     of providence might have been arraigned had he been by birth annexed to what was so far below him cooperating with nature in her ordinary economy we should dispose of and employ the geniusses of men according to their several orders and degrees i doubt not there are in your country many persons equal to the task of conducting government but you should consider that the world has but one ryttenhouse  that it never had one before the amazing mechanical representation of the solar system which you conceived  executed has never been surpassed by any but the work of which it is a copy are those powers then which being intended for the erudition of the world are like air and light the worlds common property to be taken from their proper pursuit to do the commonplace drudgery of governing a single state a work which may be executed by men of an ordinary stature such as are always  everywhere to be found without having ascended mount sinai for inspiration i can pronounce that the precept in the decalogue of the vulgar that they shall not make to themselves the likeness of anything that is in the heavens above is reversed for you and that you will fulfill the highest purposes of your creation by employing yourself in the perpetual breach of that inhibition for my own country in particular you must remember something like a promise that it should be adorned with one of them the taking of your city by the enemy has hitherto prevented the proposition from being made  approved by our legislature the zeal of a true whig in science must     excuse the hazarding these free thoughts which flow from a desire of promoting the diffusion of knowledge  of your fame and from one who can assure you truly that he is with much sincerity  esteem your most obedt  most humble servt p s if you can spare as much time as to give me notice of the receipt of this  what hope i may form of my clocks it will oblige me if sent to fredericksburgh it will come safe to hand thomas jefferson dec         a bill for giving the members of the assembly an adequate allowance  v s a dec         whereas it is just that members of general assembly delegated by the people to transact for them the legislative business should while attending that business have their reasonable sustenance defrayed dedicating to the public service their time and labors freely  without account and it is also expedient that the public councils should not be deprived of the aid of good  able men who might be deterred from entering into them by the insufficiency of their private fortunes to be the extraordinary expences they must necessarily incur and it being inconsistent with the principles of civil liberty  contrary to the natural rights of the     other members of the society that any body of men therein should have authority to enlarge their own powers prerogatives or emoluments without restraint the sd general assembly cannot at their own will increase the allowance which their members are to draw from the public treasury for their expences while in assembly but to enable them so to do an application to the body of the people has become necessary and such application having been accordingly made to the freeholders of the several counties  they having thereupon consented that the sd allowance shall be enlarged and authorised  instructed their members to enlarge the same for themselves  the members of all future assemblies to pounds of nett tobacco by the day for attendance on assembly  to lbs of like tobacco for every mile they must necessarily travel going to or from the same together with their ferriages to be paid in money out of the public treasury at such rate as shall be estimated by the court of appeals at their session next before the meeting of every session of assembly governing themselves in the said estimate by the worth of the sd tobacco  the competence of the same to defray the necessary expences of travelling  attendance be it therefore enacted by the general assembly by express authority  instruction from the body of the people that the allowance to the several members of the present  of all future assemblies shall be of pounds of tobacco by the day for attendance on the sd assemblies lbs of the like     tobacco for every mile they must necessarily travel going to or from the same together with their ferriages to be paid to them in money out of the public treasury at such rate as shall be estimated by the court of appeals at their session next before the meeting of each respective session of assembly governing themselves in the said estimate by the worth of the sd tobacco  the competence of the same to defray the necessary expences of travelling  attendance thomas jefferson march        forest george wythe to george wythe j mss forest march        dear sir —since i left you i have reflected on the bill regulating the practising of attornies  of our omitting to continue the practitioners at the county  general courts separate i think the bar of the general court a proper  an excellent nursery for future judges if it be so regulated as that science may be encouraged  may live there but this can never be if an inundation of insects is permitted to come from the county courts  consume the harvest these people traversing the counties seeing the clients frequently at their own courts or perhaps at their own houses must of necessity pick up all the business the convenience of frequently seeing their counsel without going from home cannot be withstood by the country people men of science then if there were to be any would only be employed as auxiliary counsel in difficult cases but can they live by that certainly not the present   0 members of that kind therefore must turn marauders in the county courts  in future none will have leisure to acquire science i should therefore be for excluding the county court attorneys or rather for taking the general court lawyers from the incessant drudgery of the county courts  confining them to their studies that they may qualify themselves as well to support their clients as to become worthy successors to the bench i hope to see the time when the election of judges of the supreme courts shall be restrained to the bars of the general court  high court of chancery for when i speak of the former above i mean to include the latter i should even in our present bills have no objections to inserting such a restriction to take place seven or fourteen years hene adieu thomas jefferson march         albemarle patrick henry to the governor of virginia patrick henry j mss albemarle march         sir —a report prevailing here that in consequence of some powers from congress the governor and council have it in contemplation to remove the convention troops either wholly or in part from their present situation i take the liberty of troubling you with some observations on that subject the reputation and interest of our country in general may be affected by such a measure it would therefore hardly be deemed an indecent liberty in the most private citizen to offer his thoughts to the consideration of the executive the locality of my     situation particularly in the neighborhood of the present barracks and the public relation in which i stand to the people among whom they are situated together with a confidence which a personal knowledge of the members of the executive gives me that they will be glad of information from any quarter on a subject interesting to the public induce me to hope that they will acquit me of impropriety in the present representation by an article in the convention of saratoga it is stipulated on the part of the united states that the officers shall not be separated from their men i suppose the term officers includes general as well as regimental officers as there are general officers who command all the troops no part of them can be separated from these officers without a violation of the article they cannot of course be separated from one another unless the same general officer could be in different places at the same time it is true the article adds the words as far as circumstances will admit this was a necessary qualification because in no place in america i suppose could there have been found quarters for both officers and men together those for the officers to be according to their rank so far then as the circumstances of the place where they should be quartered should render a separation necessary in order to procure quarters for the officers according to their rank the article admits that separation and these are the circumstances which must have been under the contemplation of the parties both of whom and all the world beside who are ultimate judges in the case     would still understand that they were to be as near in the environs of the camp as convenient quarters could be procured and not that the qualification of the article destroyed the article itself and laid it wholly at our discretion congress indeed have admitted of this separation but are they so far lords of right and wrong as that our consciences may be quiet with their dispensation or is the case amended by saying they leave it optional in the governor and council to separate the troops or not at the same time that it exculpates not them it is drawing the governor and council into a participation in the breach of faith if indeed it is only proposed that a separation of the troops shall be referred to the consent of their officers that is a very different matter having carefully avoided conversation with them on public subjects i cannot say of my own knowledge how they would relish such a proposition i have heard from others that they will choose to undergo anything together rather than to be separated and that they will remonstrate against it in the strongest terms the executive therefore if voluntary agents in this measure must be drawn into a paper war with them the more disagreeable as it seems that faith and reason will be on the other side as an american i cannot help feeling a thorough mortification that our congress should have permitted an infraction of our public honor as a citizen of virginia i cannot help hoping and confiding that our supreme executive whose acts will be considered as the acts of the commonwealth estimate that honor too highly to     make its infraction their own act i may be permitted to hope then that if any removal takes place it will be a general one and as it is said to be left to the governor and council to determine on this i am satisfied that suppressing every other consideration and weighing the matter dispassionately they will determine upon this sole question is it for the benefit of those for whom they act that the convention troops should be removed from among them under the head of interest these circumstances viz the expense of building barracks said to have been £  000 and of removing the troops backwards and forwards amounting to i know not how much are not to be permitted merely because they are continental expenses for we are a part of the continent we must pay a shilling of every dollar wasted but the sums of money which by these troops or on their account are brought into and expended in this state are a great and local advantage this can require no proof if at the conclusion of the war for instance our share of the continental debt should be twenty millions of dollars or say that we are called on to furnish an annual quota of two millions four hundred thousand dollars to congress to be raised by tax it is obvious that we should raise these given sums with greater or less ease in proportion to the greater or less quantity of money found in circulation among us i expect that our circulating money is increased by the presence of these troops at the rate of  0000 a week at the least i have heard indeed that an objection arises to their being kept within this state     from the information of the commissary that they cannot be subsisted here in attending to the information of that officer it should be borne in mind that the county of king william and its vicinities are one thing the territory of virginia another if the troops could be fed upon long letters i believe the gentleman at the head of that department in this country would be the best commissary upon earth but till i see him determined to act not to write to sacrifice his domestic ease to the duties of his appointment and apply to the resources of this country wheresoever they are to be had i must entertain a different opinion of him i am mistaken if for the animal subsistence of the troops hitherto we are not principally indebted to the genius and exertions of hawkins during the very short time he lived after his appointment to that department by your board his eye immediately pervaded the whole state it was reduced at once to a regular machine to a system and the whole put into movement and animation by the fiat of a comprehensive mind if the commonwealth of virginia cannot furnish these troops with bread i would ask of the commissariat which of the thirteen is now become the grain colony if we are in danger of famine from the addition of four thousand mouths what is become of that surplus of bread the exportation of which used to feed the west indies and eastern states and fill the colony with hard money when i urge the sufficiency of this state however to subsist these troops i beg to be understood as having in contemplation the quantity of provisions necessary     for their real use and not as calculating what is to be lost by the wanton waste mismanagement and carelessness of those employed about it if magazines of beef and pork are suffered to rot by slovenly butchering or for want of timely provision and sale if quantities of flour are exposed by the commissaries entrusted with the keeping it to pillage and destruction and if when laid up in the continental stores it is still to be embezzled and sold the land of egypt itself would be insufficient for their supply and their removal would be necessary not to a more plentiful country but to more able and honest commissaries perhaps the magnitude of this question and its relation to the whole state may render it worth while to await the opinion of the national council which is now to meet within a few weeks there is no danger of distress in the meantime as the commissaries affirm they have a great sufficiency of provisions for some time to come should the measure of removing them into another state be adopted and carried into execution before the meeting of assembly no disapprobation of theirs will bring them back because they will then be in the power of others who will hardly give them up want of information as to what may be the precise measure proposed by the governor and council obliges me to shift my ground and take up the subject in every possible form perhaps they have not thought to remove the troops out of this state altogether but to some other part of it here the objections arising from the expenses of removal and of building new barracks recur as to animal food     it may be driven to one part of the country as easily as to another that circumstance therefore may be thrown out of the question as to bread i suppose they will require about forty or fortyfive thousand bushels of grain a year the place to which it is to be brought to them is about the centre of the state besides that the country round about is fertile all the grain made in the counties adjacent to any kind of navigation may be brought by water to within twelve miles of the spot for these twelve miles wagons must be employed i suppose half a dozen will be a plenty perhaps this part of the expense might have been saved had the barracks been built on the water but it is not sufficient to justify their being abandoned now they are built wagonage indeed seems to the commissariat an article not worth economizing the most wanton and studied circuity of transportation has been practised to mention only one act they have bought quantities of flour for these troops in cumberland have ordered it to be wagoned down to manchester and wagoned thence up to the barracks this fact happened to fall within my own knowledge i doubt not there are many more such in order either to produce their total removal or to run up the expenses of the present situation and satisfy congress that the nearer they are brought to the commissarys own bed the cheaper they will be subsisted the grain made in the western counties may be brought partly in wagons as conveniently to this as to any other place perhaps more so on account of its vicinity to one of the best passes through the blue ridge and     partly by water as it is near to james river to the navigation of which ten counties are adjacent above the falls when i said that the grain might be brought hither from all the counties of the state adjacent to navigation i did not mean to say it would be proper to bring it from all on the contrary i think the commissary should be instructed after the next harvest not to send one bushel of grain to the barracks from below the falls of the rivers or from the northern counties the counties on tide water are accessible to the calls for our own army their supplies ought therefore to be husbanded for them the counties in the northwestern parts of the state are not only within reach for our own grand army but peculiarly necessary for the support of macintoshs army or for the support of any other northwestern expedition which the uncertain conduct of the indians should render necessary insomuch that if the supplies of that quarter should be misapplied to any other purpose it would destroy in embryo every exertion either for particular or general safety there the counties above tide water in the middle and southern and western parts of the country are not accessible to calls for either of those purposes but at such an expense of transportation as the article would not bear here then is a great field whose supplies of bread cannot be carried to our army or rather which will raise no supplies of bread because there is nobody to eat them was it not then wise in congress to remove to that field four thousand idle mouths who must otherwise have interfered with the pasture of our     own troops and if they are removed to any other part of the country will it not defeat this wise purpose the mills on the waters of james river above the falls open to canoe navigation are very many some of them are of great note as manufacturers the barracks are surrounded by mills there are five or six round about charlottesville any two or three of the whole might in the course of the winter manufacture flour sufficient for the year to say the worst then of this situation it is but twelve miles wrong the safe custody of these troops is another circumstance worthy consideration equally removed from the access of an eastern or western enemy central to the whole state so that should they attempt an irruption in any direction they must pass through a great extent of hostile country in a neighborhood thickly inhabited by a robust and hardy people zealous in the american cause acquainted with the use of arms and the defiles and passes by which they must issue it would seem that in this point of view no place could have been better chosen their health is also of importance i would not endeavor to show that their lives are valuable to us because it would suppose a possibility that humanity was kicked out of doors in america and interest only attended to the barracks occupy the top and brow of a very high hill you have been untruly told they were in a bottom they are free from bog have four springs which seem to be plentiful one within twenty yards of the piquet two within fifty yards and another within two hundred and     fifty and they propose to sink wells within the piquet of four thousand people it should be expected according to the ordinary calcalutions that one should die every day yet in the space of near three months there have been but four deaths among them two infants under three weeks old and two others by apoplexy the officers tell me the troops were never before so healthy since they were embodied but is an enemy so execrable that though in captivity his wishes and comforts are to be disregarded and even crossed i think not it is for the benefit of mankind to mitigate the horrors of war as much as possible the practice therefore of modern nations of treating captive enemies with politeness and generosity is not only delightful in contemplation but really interesting to all the world friends foes and neutrals let us apply this the officers after considerable hardships have all procured quarters comfortable and satisfactory to them in order to do this they were obliged in many instances to hire houses for a year certain and at such exorbitant rents as were sufficient to tempt independent owners to go out of them and shift as they could these houses in most cases were much out of repair they have repaired them at a considerable expense one of the general officers has taken a place for two years advanced the rent for the whole time and been obliged moreover to erect additional buildings for the accommodation of part of his family for which there was not room in the house rented independent of the brick work for   0 the carpentry of these additional buildings i know he is to pay fifteen hundred dollars the same gentleman to my knowledge has paid to one person three thousand six hundred and seventy dollars for different articles to fix himself commodiously they have generally laid in their stocks of grain and other provisions for it is well known that officers do not live on their rations they have purchased cows sheep c set in to farming prepared their gardens and have a prospect of comfort and quiet before them to turn to the soldiers the environs of the barracks are delightful the ground cleared laid off in hundreds of gardens each enclosed in its separate paling these well prepared and exhibiting a fine appearance general riedezel alone laid out upwards of two hundred pounds in garden seeds for the german troops only judge what an extent of ground these seeds would cover there is little doubt that their own gardens will furnish them a great abundance of vegetables through the year their poultry pigeons and other preparations of that kind present to the mind the idea of a company of farmers rather than a camp of soldiers in addition to the barracks built for them by the public and now very comfortable they have built great numbers for themselves in such messes as fancied each other and the whole corps both officers and men seem now happy and satisfied with their situation having thus found the art of rendering captivity itself comfortable and carried it into execution at their own great expense and labor their spirits sustained by the prospect of gratifications rising     before their eyes does not every sentiment of humanity revolt against the proposition of stripping them of all this and removing them into new situations where from the advanced season of the year no preparations can be made for carrying themselves comfortably through the heats of summer and when it is known that the necessary advances for the conveniences already provided have exhausted their funds and left them unable to make the like exertions anew again review this matter as it may regard appearances a body of troops after staying a twelvemonth at boston are ordered to take a march of seven hundred miles to virginia where it is said they may be plentifully subsisted as soon as they are there they are ordered on some other march because in virginia it is said they cannot be subsisted indifferent nations will charge this either to ignorance or to whim and caprice the parties interested to cruelty they now view the proposition in that light and it is said there is a general and firm persuasion among them that they were marched from boston with no other purpose than to harass and destroy them with eternal marches perseverance in object though not by the most direct way is often more laudable than perpetual changes as often as the object shifts light a character of steadiness in our councils is worth more than the subsistence of four thousand people there could not have been a more unlucky concurrence of circumstances than when these troops first came the barracks were unfinished for want of laborers the spell of weather the worst ever     known within the memory of man no stores of bread laid in the roads by the weather and number of wagons soon rendered impassable not only the troops themselves were greatly disappointed but the people in the neighborhood were alarmed at the consequences which a total failure of provisions might produce in this worst state of things their situation was seen by many and disseminated through the country so as to occasion a general dissatisfaction which even seized the minds of reasonable men who if not affected by the contagion must have foreseen that the prospect must brighten and that great advantages to the people must necessarily arise it has accordingly so happened the planters being more generally sellers than buyers have felt the benefit of their presence in the most vital part about them their purses and are now sensible of its source i have too good an opinion of their love of order to believe that a removal of these troops would produce any irregular proofs of their disapprobation but i am well assured it would be extremely odious to them to conclude the separation of these troops would be a breach of public faith therefore i suppose it is impossible if they are removed to another state it is the fault of the commissaries if they are removed to any other part of the state it is the fault of the commissaries and in both cases the public interest and public security suffer the comfortable and plentiful subsistence of our own army is lessened the health of the troops neglected their wishes crossed and their comforts torn from them     the character of whim and caprice or what is worse of cruelty fixed on us as a nation and to crown the whole our own people disgusted with such a proceeding i have thus taken the liberty of representing to you the facts and the reasons which seem to militate against the separation or removal of these troops i am sensible however that the same subject may appear to different persons in very different lights what i have urged as reasons may to sounder minds be apparent fallacies i hope they will appear at least so plausible as to excuse the interposition of your excellencys most obedient and most humble servant thomas jefferson april         monticello richard henry lee to richard henry lee  monticello april         dear sir —among the convention prisoners in this neighborhood is a baron de geismar of the germans brigade major to genl gall whose situation i would wish to make you acquainted with he is the only son of a german nobleman and has i believe an only sister his father now  0 years of age if living and excessively anxious to see him before his death his patrimonial expectations in danger of being transferred to others in the weak state of his father or perhaps plundered in the case of his death the footing on which he stands with     his prince such as might give him reason to hope for protection were he on the spot but everything of that kind certain of passing by him as long as he is absent under the circumstances captivity is peculiarly injurious to him  he petitions congress to exchange him if possible or otherwise permit him to return home on any parole they will describe i am satisfied he will carry with him no disposition to injure us and his personal merit with which i am become intimately acquainted entitles him to every indulgence consistent with the indispensable rules of congress i take the liberty of recommending his request to your sollicitations as from a knowledge of the man i am become interested in his happiness whatever you can do for him will be considered as a peculiar obligation on dr sir your friend  servt thomas jefferson april         monticello gabriel jones to gabriel jones  monticello april         dear sir —by mrs harvey i inclose to you the principle and interest of the money you were so     kind as to lend me some years ago it furnishes me also with an occasion of acknowledging with this the many other obligations under which you have laid me of which i shall always be proud to shew a due sense whenever opportunities shall offer i am dear sir with much esteem your friend and servant thomas jefferson may         a bill concerning escheats and forfeitures from british subjects  v s a may         whereas during the connection which subsisted between the now united states of america and the other parts of the british empire  their subjection to one common prince the inhabitants of either part had all the rights of natural born subjects in the     other  so might lawfully take  hold real property and transmit the same by descent to their heirs in fee simple which could not be done by mere aliens and the inhabitants on each part had accordingly acquired real property in the other and in like manner had acquired personal property which by their common laws might be possessed by any other than an alien enemy  transmitted to executors  administrators but when by the tyrannies of that prince  the open hostilities committed by his armies  subjects inhabitants of the other parts of his dominions on the good people of the sd united states they are obliged to wage war in defense of their rights  finally to separate themselves from the rest of the british empire to renounce all subjection to their common prince and to become sovereign  independent states the sd inhabitants of the other parts of the british empire become aliens  enemies to the sd states  as such incapable of holding the property real or personal so acquired therein  so much thereof as was within this commonwealth became by the laws vested in the commonwealth nevertheless the general assembly tho provoked by the example of their enemies to a departure from that generosity which so honourably distinguishes the civilized nations of the present age yet desirous to conduct themselves with moderation  temper by an act passed at their session in the year      took measures for preventing what had been the property of british subjects within this commonwealth from waste  destruction by putting the same     into the hands  under the management of commissioners appointed for that purpose that so it might be in their power if reasonable at a future day to restore to the former proprietors the full value thereof and whereas it is found that the sd property is liable to be lost wasted  impaired without greater attention in the officers of government than is consistent with the discharge of their public duties and that from the advanced price at which the same would now sell it may be most for the benefit of the former owners if the same should be restored to them hereafter or to the public if not so restored that the sale thereof should take place at this time  the proceeds be lodged in the public treasury be it therefore enacted by the general assembly that so much of the act before mentioned as may be supposed to have suspended the operation of the law of escheats  forfeitures shall be hereby repealed  that all the property real  personal within this commonwealth belonging at this time to any british subject or which did belong to any british subject at the time such escheat or forfeiture may have taken place shall be deemed to be vested in the commonwealth the sd real estate by way of escheat  the said personal estate by forfeiture the governor with the advice of council so far as their information will enable them  the commissioners of the tax within their several counties aided by their assessors shall forthwith institute proper proceedings of escheat  forfeiture for all such     property real  personal in which they shall be advised and assisted by the several attornies for the commonwealth where any office in the cases before mentioned shall be found for the commonwealth  returned to the general court it shall remain there but one month for the claim of any pretending right to the estate and if within that time no such claim be made or being made if it be found  discussed for the commonwealth the title of the owner to such estate real or personal shall be forever barred but may be afterwards asserted as to the money proceeding from the sale thereof with equal force  advantage as might have been to the thing itself and such further proceedings shall be had for making sale of the lands so found in parcels not greater than  00 acres to be described by the commissioners hereafter mentioned and measured  marked by metes  bounds by a surveyor where they shall think necessary and of the other property as in the cases of escheat  forfeiture save only that the governor with advice of council for every such sale shall appoint two commissioners to superintend  control the proceedings of the sd escheators which commissioners shall be sworn to use their best endeavors to have the estate to which their trust extends sold to the best advantage the sd sales shall be for ready money to be paid to the escheator who shall retain thereof five per centum for his trouble his certificate of such paiment in the case of lands and of the person purchasing to the register of the land office shall entitle the purchaser to a     grant of the sd lands if the sd escheator shall fail to pay the sd money into the hands of the treasurer within a reasonable time after any such sale which reasonable time shall be accounted one day for every  0 miles such sale was distant from the public treasury and days of grace in addition thereto he shall pay interest thereon from the time of the sd sale at the rate of  0 per centum per annum  moreover it shall be lawful for the auditors on the last day but one of any general court or at any court to be held for the county wherein such property was sold after the expiration of the time allowed for paiment to obtain judgment on motion against such escheator his heirs executors  administrators for the principal sum and such interest together with costs and for the information of the auditors the commissioners of the sale shall immediately on such sale certify to whom  for how much such sale was made  transmit such certificate by some safe  early conveyance to the auditors which certificate shall be legal evidence against such escheator the auditors shall allow the commissioners so appointed the expences of the surveys by them directed  made  other their reasonable expenses and such compensation for their trouble as to them shall seem proper where the commissioners shall be of opinion that it will be more to the interest of the owner or public that possession of such property real or personal should be retained for finishing  removing a crop or other purpose it shall be lawful for them to stay the possession as it is now until the day of next giving   0 notice of such their intentions at the time of sale and for preventing doubt who shall be deemed british subjects within the meaning of this act it is hereby declared  enacted that   all persons subjects of his britannic majesty who on the day of april in the year      when hostilities were commenced at lexington between the united states of america  the other parts of the british empire were resident or following their vocations in any part of the world other than the sd united states and have not since either entered into public employment of the sd states or joined the same and by overt act adhered to them and   all such subjects inhabitants of any of the sd united states as were out of the sd states on the same day  have since by overt act adhered to the enemies of the sd states and   all inhabitants of the sd states who after the sd day and before the commencement of the act of the general assembly intituled an act declaring what shall be treason departed from the sd states  joined the subjects of his britannic majesty of their own free will or who by any county court within this commonwealth were declared to be british subjects within the meaning  operation of the resolution of the general assembly of and the governors proclamation founded thereon shall be deemed british subjects within the intention of this act but this act shall not extend to debts due to british subjects  paiable into the loan office according to the act of general assembly for sequestering     british property nor take effect on the property of such british subjects as are infants femes covertes or insane mind who within one year after their disability removed and hostilities suspended between his britannic majesty and the united states shall become citizens of any of the sd states nor on any lots of land within the town of richmond as the limits of sd town now are or shall be at the time of the inquest found which by the directors of the public buildings shall be included within the squares appropriated for such buildings further than that an office shall be found as to such lots of land and the estimated value thereof be disposed of hereafter as the price would have been by this act had they been exposed to public sale nor on any other such lots within the same town as shall by the sd directors be declared proper for the public use until buildings be erected on the squares before mentioned  so long as they shall be applied to such public use speech to general assembly  wednesday june        gentlemen —the honor which the general assembly have been pleased to confer on me by calling me to the high office of governor of this commonwealth demands my most grateful acknowledgments which i desire through you gentlemen to tender to them with the utmost respect in a virtuous     and free state no rewards can be so pleasing to sensible minds as those which include the approbation of our fellowcitizens my great pain is lest my poor endeavors should fall short of the kind expectations of my country so far as impartiality assiduous attention and sincere affection to the great american cause shall enable me to fulfil the duties of my appointment so far i may with confidence undertake for all beyond i must rely on the wise counsels of the general assembly and of those whom they have appointed for my aid in those duties to you gentlemen i return my particular thanks for the polite terms in which you have been pleased to notify the will of the general assembly thomas jefferson june      john page to john page  j mss june      dear page —i received your letter  by mr jamieson it had given me much pain that the zeal of our respective friends should ever have placed you and me in the situation of competitors i was comforted however with the reflection that it was their competition not ours and that the difference of the numbers which decided between us was too insignificant to give you a pain or me a     pleasure had our dispositions towards each other been such as to admit those sensations i know you too well to need an apology for anything you do and hope you will forever be assured of this and as to the constructions of the world they would only have added one to the many sins for which they are to go to the devil as this is the first i hope it will be the last instance of ceremony between us a desire to see my family which is in charles city carries me thither tomorrow and i shall not return till monday mrs jefferson i believe will not come shortly to town when she does however she has too much value for mrs page not to consider her acquaintance as a principal among those circumstances which are to reconcile her to her situation a knowledge of her sentiments on this subject renders it safe in undertaking that she shall do her part in cultivating a friendly intercourse be pleased to present my compliments to mrs page and add this to the assurances i have ever given you that i am dear page your affectionate friend thomas jefferson june        williamsburgh william fleming to william fleming  williamsburgh june        dear fleming —i received your letter and have now to thank you for it some resolutions of congress came to hand yesterday desiring an authentic state to be sent them of the cruelties said to have     been committed by the enemy during their late invasion the council had already taken measures to obtain such a state tho so near the scene where these barbarities are said to have been committed i am not able yet to decide within myself whether they were such or not the testimony on both sides is such as if heard separately could not admit a moments suspension of our faith we have lately been extremely disturbed to find a pretty general opinion prevailing that peace and the independence of the thirteen states are now within our power and that congress have hesitations on the subject and delay entering on the consideration it has even been said that their conduct on this head has been so dissatisfactory to the french minister that he thinks of returning to his own country ostensibly for better health but in truth through disgust such an event would be deplored here as the most dreadful calamity it is in contemplation of some gentlemen who conferred on the subject to propose the reestablishment of our committees of correspondence others thought this too slow for the emergency and that plenipotentiary deputies should be sent to satisfy the mind of the french minister and to set on foot proper measures for procuring the genuine sense of the several states the whole however subsided on a supposition that the information might not be true and that our delegates in congress would think no obligations of secrecy under which they may have been laid sufficient to restrain them from informing their constituents of any proceedings which may involve the fate     of their freedom and independence it would surely be better to carry on a ten years war some time hence than to continue the present an unnecessary moment our land office i think will be opened the sale of british property take place and our tax bill put on a better footing these measures i hope will put our finances into a better way and enable us to cooperate with our sister states in reducing the enormous sums of money in circulation every other remedy is nonsensical quackery the house of delegates have passed a bill for removing the seat of government to richmond it hesitates with the senate we have established a board of war and a board of trade i hear from your quarter that genl sullivan is marching with a large army against the indians if he succeeds it will be the first instance of a great army doing anything against indians and his laurels will be greater we have ever found that chosen corps of men fit for the service of the woods going against them with rapidity and by surprize have been most successful i believe that our colo clarke if we could properly reinforce him would be more likely to succeed against those within his reach than genl macintoshs regular method of proceeding i shall hope to hear from you often i put no name to this letter because letters have miscarried and if it goes safely you know the hand     thomas jefferson june  th      williamsburg theodorick bland jr to theodorick bland jr  williamsburg june  th      sir —your letter to governor henry of the  st instant came to hand yesterday and i immediately laid it before the council it gave them pain to hesitate on any request from general phillips whose polite conduct has disposed them to every indulgence consistent with the duties of their appointment the indiscriminate murder of men women and children with the horrid circumstances of barbarity practised by the indian savages was the particular task of governor hamiltons employment and if anything could have aggravated the acceptance of such an office and have made him personally answerable in a high degree it was that eager spirit with which he is said to have executed it and which if the representations before the council are to be credited seems to have shown that his own feelings and disposition were in unison with his employment the truth of these representations will be the subject of their inquiry shortly and the treatment of governor hamilton will be mild or otherwise as his conduct shall appear to merit upon a more intimate examination we trust it must furnish a contemplation highly pleasing to the generous soldier to see honorable bravery respected even by those against whom it happens to be enlisted and discriminated from the cruel and cowardly warfare of the savage whose object in war is to extinguish human nature     by a letter dated may   th you were desired to discharge the militia under your command as soon as you judged it proper lest that letter should have miscarried i now enclose you a copy colonel finnie informs me he has written to you to apply for clothes at winchester for the use of your regiment of guards and of the horse now with you he yesterday showed me a letter from the continental board of war giving the same directions he says also that he had lately written to you on the subject of the articles desired for your particular use and that he is not enabled to procure them more fully as to putting the horse now with you on the same payroll with the regiment of guards the council are of opinion that either your own powers are competent to it or at least that it may be done in concert with the continental paymaster the regiment of guards is recognized as continental the duty they are jointly engaged in is continental they therefore wish that this matter should go into the continental line altogether rather than be controlled by their interference where it is not absolutely necessary i am your most obedient servant c thomas jefferson june         williamsburg richard henry lee to richard henry lee  williamsburg june         dear sir —i received your letter and kind congratulations for which i return you my thanks in     a virtuous government and more especially in times like these public offices are what they should be burthens to those appointed to them which it would be wrong to decline though foreseen to bring with them intense labour and great private loss i am also still to thank you for a former favour enclosing a song and receipt we have little new here colonel clarkes expedition against st vincents you know of his prisoners are arrived at chesterfield and three of them brought to this place to be severely dealt with the enclosed paper will explain that matter we have  00 men under colonel bowman in the shawnee county of whom we hope to receive good accounts the destruction of the villages of the cherokees at chuchamogga and taking their goods c has brought them to sue for peace but the happiest stroke was the burning twentythousand bushels of corn collected there for the use of the expeditions which were to have been adopted at the great council governor hamilton had called at the mouth of the tanissee as mentioned in the within paper it is a cruel thought that when we feel ourselves standing on the firmest ground in every respect the cursed art of our secret enemies combining with other causes should effect by depreciating our money what the open arms of a powerful enemy could not what is to be done taxation is become of no account for it is foreseen that notwithstanding its increased amount there will still be a greater deficiency than ever i own i see no assured hope but in peace or a plentiful loan of hard money     i shall be obliged by your letters when convenient to you to write i never was a punctual correspondent to any person as i must own to my shame perhaps my present office will put it more out of my power however as it may sometimes furnish me with matter which may induce me to hope my letters may be worth sending i may venture to say you shall hear from me whenever i can get over the twofold difficulty of many letters of absolute necessity to write and an innate aversion to that kind of business thomas jefferson june         williamsburgh theodorick bland jr to theodorick bland jr  williamsburgh june   th      sir —yours of the   th instant came to hand this day    with respect to col finnie as a continental officer we decline meddling with his conduct being yourself in the continental service we take it for granted that if he fails in his duty you will put him under a proper train of enquiry his assurances to us are fair one thing only i am to inform you that however true it may be that he is without money it is no just excuse for failing to do anything for the public service because that was never permitted by the executive here to be on sufferance for want of money he never applied in vain and we still are as we ever have been ready to lend him as a continental officer any monies which the due discharge of his office may call for    and politeness at the least hardly permits   0 them to suppose the duties of the post can be as well discharged by any other as by yourself but your health for that very reason is the more to be taken care of you will please to permit capt bertling and lieutenant campbell to pass by land to the lower ferry of the chickahominy where the flag lies and finally settle the business on which he came according to the rules usual in their service i enclose you the reasons which have induced the council to act with such rigor with governor hamilton and the others there it is impossible for any generous man to disapprove his sentence i am sir with much respect your most obedient and most humble servant c     report of the revisors         report of the revisors      in      as jefferson states in his autobiography i    he introduced a bill in the general assembly creating a committee to revise and codify the laws of the state the committee consisting of jefferson pendleton wythe george mason and thomas l lee met at fredericksburg jan         and outlined a plan partly printed in rowlands life of mason i     settling certain details and apportioning the work among the revisors both mason and lee resigned before the code was fairly commenced but the remaining three worked on the revisal for over two years finally meeting again at williamsburg in feb      where jefferson states autobiography they examined critically our several parts sentence by sentence scrutinizing and amending until we had agreed on the whole we then returned home and had fair copies made of our several parts a letter of pendleton however gives a different version of this pendleton to jefferson may         i immediately wrote to our friend w to be informed if anything had happend or passed between you  him which made it necessary for me to     attend further to the work of revisal contrary to what had been agreed to between us that you should settle our diversity of opinions upon the bills he had prepared as well as mine which he chose to consider by himself  point out for your examination any alterations he judged proper  then they were to be fairly transcribed as well as yours which we had before gone through  reported i let him know that i was ready to attend him at any time if such occurrences had made it necessary he answered that no alteration was made in that plan  i was satisfied finally they reported the results of their work to the assembly in the following letter thomas jefferson g wythe june         williamsburg williamsburg june         sir —the committee appointed in pursuance of an act of general assembly passed in      intituled an act for the revision of the laws have according to the requisitions of the said act gone through that work and prepared     bills the titles of which are stated in the enclosed catalogue some of these bills have been presented to the house of delegates in the course of the present session two or three of them delivered to members of that house at their request to be presented the rest are in the two bundles which accompany this these we take the liberty through you of presenting to the general assembly in the course of this work we were unfortunately deprived of the assistance and abilities of our associates     appointed by the general assembly of the one by death of the other by resignation as the plan of the work had been settled and agreeable to that plan it was in a considerable degree carried into execution before that loss we did not exercise the powers given us by the act of filling up the places by new appointment being desirous that the plan agreed on by members who were specially appointed by the assembly might not be liable to alteration from others who might not equally possess their confidence it has therefore been executed by the three remaining members one of whom being prevented from putting his signature hereto by the great distance of his residence from this city has by letter authorized us to declare his concurrence in the report we have the honor to be with the utmost respect sir your most obedient and most humble servants t jefferson g wythe for some reason the assembly neglected the report of the revisors for some years but finally in      madison succeeded in getting  00 copies of it printed and at the sessions of      and      fiftysix out of the one hundred and twentysix bills which constituted the collection were after amendment made laws see hening xii the part assigned to jefferson in this work was to undertake the first part the first period in the division of the statutes to end with   th h  th with the law of descents     after consideration the editor has concluded to print only the most notable of the bills jefferson drafted for this revisal as many are of a merely formal and routine character and he himself wrote of the collection to hogendorp oct         if you had formed any considerable expectations from our revised code of laws you will be much disappointed it contains not more than three or four laws which could strike the attention of a foreigner had it been a digest of all our laws it would not have been comprehensible or instructive but to a native but it is still less so as it digests only the british statutes  our own acts of assembly which are but a supplementary part of our law the great basis of it is anterior to the date of the magna charta which is the oldest statute extant the only merit of this work is that it may remove from our book shelves about twenty folio volumes of our statutes retaining all the parts of them which either their own merit or

dissolute men resigning themselves to the dominion of inordinate passions commit violations on the lives liberties and property of others     and the secure enjoyment of these having principally induced men to enter into society government would be defective in its principal purpose were it not to restrain such criminal acts by inflicting due punishments on those who perpetrate them but it appears at the same time equally deducible from the purposes of society that a member thereof committing an inferior injury does not wholly forfeit the protection of his fellow citizens but after suffering a punishment in proportion to his offence is entitled to their protection from all greater pain so that it becomes a duty in the legislature to arrange in a proper scale the crimes which it may be necessary for them to repress and to adjust there a corresponding gradation of punishments and whereas the reformation of offenders though an object worthy the attention of the laws is not effected at all by capital punishments which exterminate instead of reforming and should be the last melancholy resource against those whose existence is become inconsistent with the safety of their fellow citizens which also weaken the state by cutting off so many     who if reformed might be restored sound members to society who even under a course of correction might be rendered useful in various labours for the public and would be living and longcontinued spectacles to deter others from committing the like offences and forasmuch as the experience of all ages and countries hath shewn that cruel and sanguinary laws defeat their own purpose by engaging the benevolence of mankind to withhold prosecutions to smother testimony or to listen to it with bias and by producing in many instances a total dispensation and impunity under the names of pardon and privilege of clergy when if the punishment were only proportioned to the injury men would feel it their inclination as well as their duty to see the laws observed and the power of dispensation so dangerous and mischievous which produces crimes by holding up a hope of impunity might totally be abolished so that men while contemplating to perpetrate a crime would see their punishment ensuing as necessarily as effects follow their causes  for rendering crimes and punishments therefore more proportionate to each other

guilty of manslaughter or of murder by transferring such their unlawful intention to an act much more penal than they could have in probable contemplation no such case shall hereafter be deemed manslaughter unless manslaughter was intended nor murder unless murder was intended sect xii in other cases of homicide the law will not add to the miseries of the party by punishments or forfeitures

certain forms of government are better calculated than others to protect individuals in the free exercise of their natural rights and are at the same time themselves better guarded against degeneracy yet experience hath shewn that even under the best forms those entrusted with power have in time and by slow operations perverted it into tyranny and it is believed that the most effectual means of preventing this would be to illuminate as far as practicable the minds of the people at large and more especially to give them knowledge of those facts which history exhibiteth that possessed thereby of     the experience of other ages and countries they may be enabled to know ambition under all its shapes and prompt to exert their natural powers to defeat its purposes and whereas it is generally true that that people will be happiest whose laws are best and are best administered and that laws will be wisely formed and honestly administered in proportion as those who form and administer them are wise and honest whence it becomes expedient for promoting the publick happiness that those persons whom nature hath endowed with genius and virtue should be rendered by liberal education worthy to receive and able to guard the sacred deposit of the rights and liberties of their fellow citizens and that they should be called to that charge without regard to wealth birth or other accidental condition or circumstance but the indigence of the greater number disabling them from so educating at their own expence those of their children whom nature hath fitly formed and disposed to become useful instruments for the public it is better that such should be sought for and educated at the common expense of all than that the happiness of all should be confined to the weak or wicked sect ii be it therefore enacted by the general assembly that in every county within this commonwealth there shall be chosen annually by the electors qualified to vote for delegates three of the most honest and able men of their county to be called the alderman of the county and that the election of the said aldermen shall be held at the same time and place before the same persons and notified and     conducted in the same manner as by law is directed for the annual election of delegates for the county sect iii the person before whom such election is holden shall certify to the court of the said

queen mary of england to the crown whereof the people here at that time acknowledged themselves as a colony to be subject by their charter bearing date the seventh day of february in the fourth year of their reign gave license in due form to francis nicholson esquire lieutenant governor of the colony and seventeen other trustees particularly named to found a place of universal study or perpetual college in such part of the country as the general assembly should think fit consisting of a president six professors and an hundred scholars more or less enabled the trustees and their survivors to take and hold lands tenements and hereditaments to the yearly value of two thousand pounds with intention and in confidence that after application of the profits thereof with such donations as by themselves and others might be made for that purpose to the erecting founding and adorning the college they should transfer the same to the president and professors appointed james blair clerk the first president and empowered the trustees and their successors to elect the succeeding president and the professors willed the college after it should be founded to be called the college of william and mary in virginia and incorporated the president and masters enabling them and their successors to take and hold lands tenements hereditaments goods and chattels     to the yearly value of two thousand pounds of lawful money of england appointed the trustees and their successors to be elected in the manner therein prescribed so as not to be less than eighteen visiters of the college with

president and professors in like manner as before directed part of the then royal revenue arising from the duty on tobacco exported and also granted to the said trustees the office of surveyor general of virginia with intention and in confidence that they and their successors or the longest livers of them should receive the profits thereof until the foundation of the college and when that should be affected account for and pay the same or the surplus above what should have been expended in that work to the president and professors and that thereafter the said office should be held by the said president and professors and the said king and queen by their said charter granted to the said trustees ten thousand acres of land on the south side of the blackwater swamp and also other ten     thousand acres of land in pamunkey neck between the forks or branches of the york river with this intention and in confidence that the said trustees or the longest livers of them should transfer the said twenty thousand acres of land after the foundation of the college to the president and professors as by the said charter among other things relation being thereupon had may more fully appear and whereas voluntary contributions towards forwarding this beneficial scheme the sum whereof exceeded two thousand pounds sterling was received by the said trustees with one thousand pounds sterling out of the money arising from the quitrents granted to the use of said college by queen anne part whereof was applied to the purchase of three hundred and thirty acres of land at the middle plantation being the same place where the general assembly by their act passed in the year      had directed the said college to be built and whereon the same was accordingly built and the general assembly by one other act passed in the same year      intitled an act for laying an imposition upon skins and furs for the better support of the college of william and mary in virginia endowed the said college with certain duties on skins and furs therein specified which duties were afterwards enlarged and confirmed to the use of the said college and made payable to the president and professors by divers other acts of general assembly and by one other act passed in the year      the said college was further endowed by the general assembly with the sum of one thousand pounds out   0 of the public funds in the hands of the treasurer which was directed to be laid out for the maintaining and educating scholars and to be accounted for to the general assembly from time to time when required which sum was accordingly paid to the said visiters and by them invested in the purchase of two thousand one hundred and nineteen acres of land on both sides of the nottoway river in the counties of prince george surrey and brunswick and seventeen negro slaves to be employed in tilling and manuring the same and certain scholarships were accordingly established on the said funds and the general assembly by their act passed in the year      and entitled an act for laying a duty on liquors further endowed the said college with an annual revenue of two hundred pounds for twentyone years to be paid out of certain duties thereon imposed on liquors and by one other act passed in the year      endowed it with the whole of the said duties during the residue of the said term then unexpired a part or the whole thereof to be expended in purchasing a library for the said college and by divers other acts passed at subsequent times the assemblies for the time being having continued to the said college the whole of the annual revenues arising from the said duties until the first of june which shall be in the year    0 to be applied to the funding scholarships and other good uses for the support of the said college and to be accounted for to the general assembly and the general assembly by of in the year gave a further donation to the said college of to     be laid out in purchasing a mathematical apparatus for the said college which was accordingly purchased and the said trustees in pursuance of the trust reposed in them proceeded to erect the said college and established one school of sacred theology with two professorships therein to wit one for teaching the hebrew tongue and expounding the holy scriptures and the other for explaining the common places of divinity and controversies with heretics one other school for philosophy with two professorships therein to wit one for the study of rhetoric logic and ethics and the other of physics metaphysics and mathematics one other school for teaching the latin and greek tongues and one other for teaching indian boys reading writing vulgar arithmetic the catechism and the principles of the christian religion which last school was founded on the private donation of the honorable robert boyle of the kingdom of england and by authority from his executors submitted to the direction of the earl of burlington one of the said executors of the bishop of london for the time being and in default thereof to the said trustees and over the whole they appointed one president as supervisor sect ii and whereas the experience of near an hundred years hath proved that the said college thus amply endowed by the public hath not answered their expectations and there is reason to hope that it would become more useful if certain articles in its constitution were altered and amended which being fixed as before recited by the original charters cannot be reformed by the said trustees     whose powers are created and circumscribed by the said charters and the said college being erected and constituted on the requisition of the general assembly by the chief magistrate of the state their legal fiduciary for such purposes being founded and endowed with the lands and revenues of the public and intended for the sole use and improvement and no wise in nature of a private grant the same is of right subject to the public direction and may by them be altered and amended until such form be devised as will render the institution publicly advantageous in proportion as it is publicly expensive and the late change in the form of our government as well as the contest of arms in which we are at present engaged calling for extraordinary abilities both in council and field it becomes the peculiar duty of the legislature at this time to aid and improve that seminary in which those who are to be the future guardians of the rights and liberties of their country may be endowed with science and virtue to watch and preserve the sacred deposit be it therefore enacted by the general assembly that instead of eighteen visiters or governors of the said college there shall in future be five only who shall be appointed by joint ballot of both houses of assembly annually to enter on the duties of their office on the new years day ensuing their appointment having previously given assurance of fidelity to the commonwealth before any justice of the peace and to continue in office until those next appointed shall be qualified but those who shall be first appointed after the passing of this act and all others appointed     during the course of any year to fill up vacancies happening by death resignation or removal out of the commonwealth shall enter on duty immediately on such appointment any four of the said visiters may proceed to business they shall chuse their own rector at their first meeting in every year and shall be deemed the lawful successors of the first trustees and invested with all the rights powers and capacities given to them save only so far as the same shall be abridged by this act nor shall they be restrained in their legislation by the royal prerogative or the laws of the kingdom of england of the canons or the constitution of the english church as enjoined in the said charter there shall be three chancellors in like manner appointed by joint ballot of both houses from among the judges of the high court of chancery or of the general court to enter on that office immediately on such appointment and to continue therein so long as they remain in either of the said courts any two of whom may proceed to business to them shall belong solely the power of removing the professors for breach or neglect of duty immorality severity contumacy or other good cause and the judiciary powers in all disputes which shall arise on the statutes of the college being called on for that purpose by the rector or by the corporation of president and professors a copy of their sentence of deprivation being delivered to the sheriff of the county wherein the college is he shall forthwith cause the professor deprived to be ousted of his chambers and other freehold appertaining to the said college and the     remaining professors to be reseized thereof in like manner and form and subject on failure to the like fines by the said chancellors as in cases of writs of habere facias seisinam issued from courts of record but no person shall be capable of being both visiter and chancellor at the same time nor shall any professor be capable of being at the same time either visiter or chancellor instead of the president and six professors licensed by the said charter and established by the former visiters there shall be eight professors one of whom shall also be appointed president with an additional salary of one hundred pounds a year before they enter on the execution of their office they shall give assurance of fidelity to the commonwealth before some justice of the peace these shall be deemed the lawful successors of the president and professors appointed under the said charter and shall have all their rights powers and capabilities not otherwise disposed of by this act to them shall belong the ordinary government of the college and administration of its revenues taking the advice of the visiters on all matters of great concern there shall in like manner be eight professorships to wit one of moral philosophy and the laws of nature and of nations and of the fine arts one of law and police one of history civil and ecclesiastical one of mathematics one of anatomy and medicine one of natural philosophy and natural history one of the ancient languages oriental and northern and one of modern languages the said professors shall likewise appoint from time to time a missionary of approved veracity to the     several tribes of indians whose business shall be to investigate their laws customs religions traditions and more particularly their languages constructing grammars thereof as well as may be and copious vocabularies and on oath to communicate from time to time to the said president and professors the materials he collects to be by them laid up and preserved in their library for which trouble the said missionary shall be allowed a salary at the discretion of the visiters out of the revenues of the college and forasmuch as the revenue arising from the duties on skins and furs and those on liquors with which the said college was endowed by several acts of general assembly is subject to great fluctuations from circumstances unforseen insomuch that no calculation of foresight can enable the said visiters or professors to square thereto the expenditures of the said college which being regular and permanent should depend on stable funds be it therefore enacted that the revenue arising from the said duties shall be henceforth transferred to the use of the public to be applied towards supporting the contingent charges of government and that in lieu thereof the said college shall be endowed with an impost of five pounds of tobacco on every hogshead of tobacco to be exported from this commonwealth by land or by water to be paid to the inspectors accounted for on oath to the said president and professors on or before the  0th day of october in every year with an allowance of six per centum for their trouble and if the said tobacco be not carried to any public warehouse then the said impost shall     be paid collected and accounted for to the said president and professors by the same persons at the same times in and under the like manner penalties and conditions as prescribed by the laws which shall be in force at the time for collecting the duties imposed on exported tobacco towards raising supplies of money for the public exigencies and that this commonwealth may not be without so great an ornament nor its youth such an help towards attaining astronomical science as the mechanical representation or model of the solar system conceived and executed by that greatest of astronomers david ryttenhouse be it further enacted that the visiters first appointed under this act and their successors shall be authorized to engage the said david ryttenhouse on the part of this commonwealth to make and erect in the said college of william and mary and for its use one of the said models to be called by the name of the ryttenhouse the cost and expence of making transporting and erecting whereof shall according to the agreement or allowance of the said visiters be paid by the treasurer of this commonwealth on warrant from the auditors a bill for establishing a public library chapter lxxxi section i be it enacted by the general assembly that on the first day of january in every year there shall be paid out of the treasury the sum of two thousand pounds to be laid out in such books     and maps as may be proper to be preserved in a public library and in defraying the expences necessary for the care and preservation thereof which library shall be established at the town of richmond sect ii the two houses of assembly shall appoint three persons of learning and attention to literary matters to be visiters of the said library and shall remove them and fill any vacancies from time to time as they shall think fit which visiters shall have power to receive the annual sums beforementioned and therewith to procure such books and maps as aforesaid and shall superintend the preservation thereof whensoever a keeper shall be found necessary they shall appoint such keeper from time to time at their will on such annual salary not exceeding one hundred pounds as they shall think reasonable sect iii if during the time of war the importation of books and maps shall be hazardous or if the rate of exchange between this commonwealth and any state from which such articles are wanted shall from any cause be such that they cannot be imported to such advantage as may be hoped at a future day the visiters shall place the annual sums as they become due in the public loan office if any there be for the benefit of interest or otherwise shall suffer them to remain in the treasury until fit occasions shall occur of employing them sect iv it shall not be lawful for the said keeper or the visiters themselves or any other person to remove any book or map out of the said library unless it be for the necessary repair thereof     but the same be made useful by indulging the researches of the learned and curious within the said library without fee or reward and under such rules for preserving them safe and in good order and condition as the visiters shall constitute sect v the visiters shall annually settle their accounts with the auditors and leave with them the vouchers for the expenditure of the monies put into their hands a bill for establishing religious freedom  chapter lxxxii section i well aware that the opinions and belief of men depend not on their own will but follow involuntarily the evidence proposed to their minds that almighty god hath created the mind free and manifested his supreme will that free it shall remain by making it altogether insusceptible of     restraint that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burthens or by civil incapacitations tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness and are a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion who being lord both of body and mind yet choose not to propagate it by coercions on either as was in his almighty power to do but to exalt it by its influence on reason alone that the impious presumption of legislature and ruler civil as well as ecclesiastical who being themselves but fallible and uninspired men have assumed dominion over the faith of others setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible and as such endeavoring to impose them on others hath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world and through all time that to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical that even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern and whose   0 powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness and is withdrawing from the ministry those temporary rewards which proceeding from an approbation of their personal conduct are an additional incitement to earnest and unremitting labours for the instruction of mankind that our civil rights have no dependance on our religious opinions any more than our opinions in physics or geometry and therefore the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust or emolument unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion is depriving him injudiciously of those privileges and advantages to which in common with his fellowcitizens he has a natural right that it tends also to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to encourage by bribing with a monoploy of worldly honours and emoluments those who will externally profess and conform to it that though indeed these are criminals who do not withstand such temptation yet neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way that the opinions of men are not the object of civil government nor under its jurisdiction that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency is a dangerous falacy which at once destroys all religious liberty because he being of course judge of that tendency will make his opinions the rule of judgment and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or     suffer from his own that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order and finally that truth is great and will prevail if left to herself that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error and has nothing to fear from the conflict unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons free argument and debate errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them sect ii we the general assembly of virginia do enact that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship place or ministry whatsoever nor shall be enforced restrained molested or burthened in his body or goods or shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief but that all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion and that the same shall in no wise diminish enlarge or affect their civil capacities sect iii and though we well know that this assembly elected by the people for their ordinary purposes of legislation only have no power to restrain the acts of succeeding assemblies constituted with powers equal to our own and that therefore to declare this act to be irrevocable would be of no effect in law yet we are free to declare and do declare that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present or to narrow its operations such act will be an infringement of natural right                 correspondence and miscellaneous writings     –     thomas jefferson june         williamsburg general washington to general washington j mss williamsburg june   th      sir —i

suffered i have taken the liberty therefore of desiring them to apply for fifty  transmit them by a safe conveyance the inclosed order being in its nature important and generally interesting i thought it my duty to lay it before congress as early as possible with the reasons supporting it nothing doubting but it will meet with their approbation its justice seems to have been confirmed by the general sense of the people here before the receipt of your letter desiring a state to be made out of the ravages  enormities unjustifiable by the usage of civilized nations committed by the enemy on their late invasion near portsmouth i had taken measures for the same purpose meaning to transmit them to you they are not yet returned to me i have given the same orders with respect to their still later proceedings in the county of northumberland our trade has never been so distressed since the time of lord dunmore as it is at present by a parcel of trifling privateers under the countenance of two or three larger vessels who keep our little naval force from doing anything the uniform train of events which during the whole course of this war we are to     suppose has rendered it improper that the american fleet or any part of it should ever come to relieve or countenance the trade of certain places while the same train of events has as uniformly rendered it proper to confine them to the protection of certain other parts of the continent is a lamentable arrangement of fortune for us the same ill luck has attended us as to the disposition of the prizes taken by our navy which tho sometimes taken just off our capes it has always been expedient to carry elsewhere a british prize would be a more rare phenomenon here than a comet because the one has been seen but the other never

that   all persons subjects of his britannick majesty who on the nineteenth day of april in the year      when hostilities were commenced at lexington between the united states of america and the other parts of the british empire were resident or following their vocations in any     part of the world other than the said united states and have not since either entered into public employment of

resolution of the twenty sixth day of the last month they required that all the persons so described and now resident within this commonwealth should be banished from the same and the proper measures should be taken to prevent their return as also to exclude thereout all others so described and not now resident within this commonwealth i have therefore thought fit by and with the advice of the

on the  d inst it is now some time since colo bland wrote for leave to grant permits to capt bartling  lt campbell to come to the argyle flag leave was immediately given by letter to col bland sometime after i received another letter from him accompanied with one from general phillips informing me that lt campbell was come as far as richmond  waited for a permit to proceed a permit was instantly made out and dispatched capt bartling was not mentioned on that occasion  therefore no permit was made out for him the  d inst was fixed for lt campbell to be at the flag to do his business and it was only on the day before that your letter came to me by post i shall instantly write to capt bartling giving him license to proceed if his business remains still to be done by a conveyance which occurs tomorrow i thought it necessary to give you this detail of circumstances that any delays which may happen might be ascribed to those accidents which may have caused them i thank you for your kind congratulations tho condolations would be better suited to the occasion not only on account of the labours of the office to which i am called and its withdrawing me from retirement but also the loss of the agreeable society i have left of which madme de riedesel and yourself     were an important part mrs jefferson in this particular sympathizes with me and especially on her separation from madme de riedesel we are told you set out for the berkely springs about the middle of month we fear that this excursion necessary for your amusement to diversify the scenes of discomfort may deprive us of the pleasure of seeing you when we come to monticello the last of this month we shall stay there about a month mrs jefferson joins me in compliments to yourself  madme de riedesel i shall be able to execute her commission as to the spoons and bring them up with me thomas jefferson july         wmsburg general washington to general washington w mss wmsburg july         sir —i some time ago enclosed to you a printed copy of an order of council by which governor hamilton was to be confined in irons in close jail this has occasioned a letter from general phillips of which the inclosed is a copy the general seems to suppose that a prisoner on capitulation cannot be put into close confinement tho his capitulation shall not have provided against it my idea was that all persons taken in war were to be deemed prisoners of war that those who surrender on capitulation or convention are prisoners of war also subject to the same treatment with those who surrender at discretion except only so far as the terms of their capitulation or convention shall have guarded them in the capitulation of governor hamilton a copy of which     i inclose no stipulation is made as to the treatment of himself or those taken with him the governor indeed when he signs adds a flourish of reasons inducing him to capitulate one of which is the generosity of his enemy generosity on a large and comprehensive scale seems to dictate the making a signal example of this gentleman but waiving that these are only private motives inducing him to surrender and do not enter into the contract of colonel clarke i have the highest idea of the sacredness of those contracts which take place between nation and nation at war and would be the last on earth who should do anything in violation of them i can find nothing in those books usually recurred to as testimonials of the laws  usages of nature and nations which convicts the opinions i have above expressed of error yet there may be such an usage as general phillips seems to suppose tho not taken notice of by these writers i am obliged to trouble your excellency on this occasion by asking of you information on this point there is no other person whose decision will so authoritatively decide this point in the public mind and none with which i am disposed so implicitly to comply if you shall be of opinion that the bare existence of a capitulation in the case of governor hamilton privileges him from confinement tho there be no article to that effect in the capitulation justice shall most assuredly be done him the importance of this question in a public view  my own anxiety under a charge of violation of national faith by the executive of this commonwealth will i hope apologise for     my adding this to the many many troubles with which i know you to be burthened i have the honor to be with the most profound respect  esteem yr excellencys mo obedt  mo hble servt p s i have just received a letter from colo bland containing information of numerous desertions from the convention troops not less than  00 in the last fortnight he thinks he has reason to believe it is with the connivance of some of their officers some of these have been taken all of them going northwardly they had armed themselves with forged passports and with certificates of having taken the oath of fidelity to the state some of them forged others really given by weak magistrates i mention this to your excellency as perhaps it may be in your power to have such of them intercepted as shall be passing through pennsylvania  jersey your letter inclosing the opinion of the board of officers in the case between allison  lee is come safe to hand after a long passage it shall be answered by next post thomas jefferson july         wmsburg sir guy carleton to the governor of canada sir guy carleton v s a wmsburg july   d      sir —your letter on the subject of lieutenant governor hamiltons confinement came safely to hand i shall with great cheerfulness explain to you the reasons on which the advice of council was founded since after the satisfaction of doing what is     right the greatest is that of having what we do approved by those whose opinions deserve esteem we think ourselves justified in governor hamiltons strict confinement on the general principle of national retaliation to state to you the particular facts of british cruelty to american prisoners would be to give a melancholy history from the capture of colo ethan allen at the beginning of the war to the present day a history which i will avoid as equally disagreeable to you and to me i with pleasure do you the justice to say that i believe these facts to be very many unknown to you as canada has been the only scene of your service in america and in that quarter we have reason to believe that sir guy carleton and the three officers commanding there have treated our prisoners since the instance of colo allen with considerable lenity what has been done in england and what in new york  philadelphia you are probably uninformed as it would hardly be made the subject of epistolary correspondence i will only observe to you sir that the confinement and treatment of our officers soldiers and seamen have been so rigorous and cruel as that a very great portion of the whole of those captured in the course of this war  carried to philadelphia while in possession of the british army and to new york have perished miserably from that cause only and that this fact is as well established with us as any historical fact which has happened in the course of the war a gentleman of this commonwealth in public office and of known and established character who was taken on the sea carried to new york and     exchanged has given us lately a particular information of the treatment of our prisoners there officers taken by land it seems are permitted to go on parole within certain limits of long island till suggestions shall be made to their prejudice by some tory refugee or other equally worthless person when they are hurried to the provot in new york without enquiring whether they be founded upon positive facts be matter of hearsay or taken from the reports of interested men the example of enquiring into the truth of charges of this nature according to legal principles of evidence has surely not been set us by our enemies we enquired what these provots were and were told they were the common miserable jails built for the confinement of malefactors officers and men taken by sea were kept in prison ships infested with   ught on by the crowd parts of one line and all of another at bottom of the page lacking from five to ten a day when therefore we are desired to the possible consequence of treating prisoners with rigour i need only ask when did those rigours begin not with us assuredly i think you sir who have had as good opportunities as any british officer of learning in what manner we treat those whom the fortune of war has put in our hands can clear us from the charge of rigour as far as your knowledge or information has extended i can assert that governor hamiltons is the first instance which has occurred in my own country and if there has been another in any of the united states it is unknown to me these instances must have been extremely rare if they have ever     existed at all or they could not have been altogether unheard of by me when a uniform exercise of kindness to prisoners on our part has been returned by as uniform severity on the part of our enemies you must excuse me for saying it is high time by other lessons to teach respect to the dictates of humanity in such a case retaliation becomes an act of humanity but suppose sir we were willing still longer to decline the drudgery of general retaliation yet governor hamiltons conduct has been such as to call for exemplary punishment on him personally in saying this i have not so much in view his particular cruelties to our citizens prisoners with him which tho they have been great were of necessity confined to a small scale as the general nature of the service he undertook at detroit and the extensive exercise of cruelties which they involved those who act together in war are answerable for each other no distinction can be made between principal and ally by those against whom the war is waged he who employs another to do a deed makes the deed his own if he calls in the hand of the assassin or murderer himself becomes the assassin or murderer the known rule of warfare of the indian savages is an indiscriminate butchery of men women  children these savages under this well known character are employed by the british nation as allies in the war against the americans governor hamilton undertakes to be the conductor of the war in the execution of that undertaking he associates small parties of the whites under his immediate command with large parties of the     savages and sends them to act sometimes jointly and sometimes separately not against our forts or armies in the field but the farming settlements on our frontiers governor hamilton is himself the butcher of men women  children i will not say to what length the fair rules of war would extend the right of punishment against him but i am sure that confinement under its strictest circumstances for indian devastation and massacre must be deemed lenity i apprehend you had not sufficiently adverted to the expression in the advice of the council when you suppose the proclamation there alluded to to be the one addressed to the inhabitants of the illinois afterwards printed in the public papers  to be affirmed to contain denun two lines at bottom of page gone ians proclamation there alluded to contained nothing more than an invitation to our officers and soldiers to join british arms against those whom he is pleased to call rebels and traitors in order to introduce these among our people they were put into the hands of the indians and in every house where they murdered or carried away the family they left one of these proclamations some of them were found sticking on the breasts of the persons murdered one under the hand  seal of governor hamilton came to our hands the indians being the bearers of proclamations under the hand and seal of governor hamilton no matter what was the subject of them there can be no doubt they were acting under his direction and as including this proof the fact was cited in the advice of the council     but if you will be so good as to recur to the address of the illinois which you refer to you will find that tho it does not in express terms threaten vengeance blood  massacre yet it proves that the governor had made for us the most ample provision of all these calamities he there gives in detail the horrid catalogue of savage nations extending from south to north whom he had leagued with himself to wage combined war on our frontiers and it is well known that that war would of course be made up of blood and general massacres of men women and children other papers of governor hamiltons have come to our hands containing instructions to officers going out with scalping parties of indians  whites and proving that kind of war was waged under his express orders further proofs in abundance might be adduced but i suppose the fact is too notorious to need them your letter seems to admit an inference that whatever may have been the general conduct of our enemies towards their prisoners or whatever the personal conduct of governor hamilton yet as a prisoner by capitulation you consider him as privileged from strict confinement i do not pretend to an intimate knowledge of this subject my idea is that the term prisoners of war is a generic one the specification of which is— st prisoner at discretion   d prisoners on convention or capitulation thus in the debate of the house of commons of the   th november last on the address the minister speaking of general burgoyne and in his presence says he is a prisoner and general burgoyne calls himself a   0 prisoner under the terms of the convention of saratoga intimating that tho a prisoner he is a prisoner of a particular species entitled to certain terms the treatment of the first class ought to be such as to be approved by the usage of polished nations gentle and humain unless a contrary conduct in an enemy or individual render a stricter treatment necessary the prisoners of the  d class have nothing to exempt them from a like treatment with those of the first except so far as they shall have been able to make better terms by articles of capitulation so far then as these shall have provided for an exemption from strict treatment so prisoners on capitulation have a right to be distinguished from those at discretion two lines at bottom of the page gone certain causes antecedent thereto tho such instances might be produced from english history too and in one case where the king himself commanded in person marshal boufflers after the taking of the castle namur was arrested and detained prisoner of war by king william tho by an article of capitulation it was stipulated that the officers and soldiers of the garrison in general and marshal boufflers by name should be at liberty however we waive reasoning on this head because no article in the capitulation of governor hamilton is violated by his confinement perhaps not having seen the capitulation you were led to suppose it a thing of course that being able to obtain terms of surrender they would first provide for their own treatment i enclose you a copy of the capitulation by which you will see that  d article declares them prisoners of     war and nothing is said as to the treatment they were to be entitled to when governor hamilton signs indeed he adds a flourish containing the motives inducing him to capitulate one of which was confidence in a generous enemy he should have reflected that generosity on a large scale would take side against him however these were only his private motives and did not enter into the contract with colo clarke being prisoners of war then with only such privileges as their capitulation had provided and that having provided nothing on the subject of their treatment they are liable to be treated as other prisoners we have not extended our order as we might justifiably have done to the whole of this corps governor hamilton  capn lamothe alone as leading offenders are in confinement the other officers and men are treated as if they had been taken in justifiable war the officers being at large on their parole and the men also having their liberty to a certain extent dejean was not included in the capitulation being taken   days after on the wabache   0 miles from st vincennes i hope sir that being made more fully acquainted with the facts on which the advice of council was grounded and exercising your own good sense in cool and candid deliberation on these facts and the consequences deducible from them according to the usages and sentiments of civilized nations you will see the transaction in a very different light from that in which it appeared at the time of writing your letter and ascribe the advice of the council not to want of attention to the sacred nature of public     conventions of which i hope we shall never in any circumstances lose sight but to a desire of stopping the effusion of ye unoffending blood of women and children and the unjustifiable severities exercised on our captive officers and soldiers in general by proper severities on our part i have the honor to be with much personal respect sir your most obt  most hmble servt thomas jefferson aug        albemarle william fleming to col william fleming  albemarle aug        sir —the enclosed order will explain to you the general plan adopted for regimenting officering  stationing the two western battalions we are in hopes you will so far proceed in concert with the other commissioners as that the chain of posts to be recommended may form a complete western defence leaving no chasm in the middle we wish you when you report the stations proposed to advise us also to what particular station it will be best for the men of each county respectively to go as it will not be long before the men ought to be raised according to the directions of the law and it will be proper for the executive to pay immediate attention to the procuring arms and camp utensils for them i should therefore be glad if you will be so good as to lay before them a state of the arms in your possession or at any other convenient station also for your opinion what proportion of the men should be     furnished with rifles where rifles are to be had and on what terms hon elliot danforth august         new york to the county lieutenant of hampshire  august         sir —you are desired to call together your field officers and in conjunction with them to recommend to the executive a captain and lieutenant to take command in one of the battalions to be raised for the defence of the western frontier under an act of the late assembly entitled an act for raising a body of troops for the defence of the commonwealth the men to be raised in your county under the same act and the officers to be recommended by you are to hold themselves in readiness on the shortest warning to proceed to such western rendezvous as shall be notified to them by the executive or the field officer who shall be directed to take command of them be pleased to transmit your recommendations to the executive in williamsburgh by the earliest opportunity you can and also to report to them from time to time your progress in raising your men thomas jefferson sept         williamsburg john jay to the president of congress john jay c c williamsburg sept         sir —the various calamities which during the present year have befallen our crops of wheat have     reduced them so very low as to leave us little more than seed for the ensuing year were it to be solely applied to that purpose this country is therefore unable to furnish the necessary supplies of flour for the convention troops without lessening by so much as should be purchased the sowing for another crop i am therefore to submit to you sir the expediency of ordering your commissary general to send supplies of this article from the head of elk or wherever else you may think best to richmond colo aylett informs us they will require about ten thousand barrels for a years supply we hope there will be a plenty of forage and of all other articles necessary for their subsistence raised within this state thomas jefferson oct        williamsburg general washington to general washington j mss williamsburg oct        sir —on receipt of your letter of august  th during my absence the council had the irons taken off the prisoners of war when your advice was asked we meant it should decide with us and upon my return to williamsburg the matter was taken up and the enclosed advice given a parole was formed of which the enclosed is a copy and tendered to the prisoners they objected to that part of it which restrained them from saying anything to the prejudice of the united states and insisted on freedom of speech they were in consequence remanded to their confinement in the jail which must be considered as a voluntary one until they can determine     with themselves to be inoffensive in word as well as deed a flag sails hence tomorrow to new york to negotiate the exchange of some prisoners by her i have written to genl phillips on this subject  enclosed to him copies of the within intending it as an answer to a letter i received from him on the subject of governor hamilton i have the honor to be sir thomas jefferson oct        williamsburg general washington to general washington j mss williamsburg oct        sir —just as the letter accompanying this was going off col mathews arrived on parole from new york by the way of headquarters bringing your excellencys letter on his subject with that of the british commissary of prisoners the subject is of great importance  i must therefore reserve myself to answer after further consideration were i to speak from present impressions i should say it was happy for governor hamilton that a final determination of his fate was formed before this new information as the enemy have released capt willing from his irons the executive of this state will be induced perhaps not to alter their former opinion but it is impossible they can be serious in attempting to bully us in this manner we have too many of their subjects in our power  too much iron to clothe them with  i will add too much resolution to avail ourselves of both to fear their pretended retaliation however i will do myself the honor of forwarding to your excellency the ultimate result of council on this subject     in consequence of the information in the letter from the british commissary of prisoners that no officers of the virginia line should be exchanged till governor hamiltons affair should be settled we have stopped our flag which was just hoisting anchor with a load of privates for n york i must therefore ask the favor of your excellency to forward the enclosed by flag when an opportunity offers as i suppose genl phillips will be in n york before it reaches you i have the honor to be sir with the greatest esteem thomas jefferson oct        general washington to general washington j mss in council oct        sir —in mine of the second of the present month written on the instant of colo mathews delivery of your letter i informed you what had been done on the subject of governor hamilton  his companions previous to that moment i now enclose you an advice of council in consequence of the letter you were pleased to enclose me from the british commissary of prisoners with one from lord rawdon also a copy of my letter to colo mathews enclosing also the papers therein named the advice of council to allow the enlargement of prisoners on their giving a proper parole has not been recalled nor will be i suppose unless something on the part of the enemy should render it necessary i rather expect however that they will see it their interest to discontinue this kind of conduct i am afraid i shall hereafter perhaps be obliged to give your excellency some trouble     in aiding me to obtain information of the future usage of our prisoners i shall give immediate orders for having in readiness every engine which the enemy have contrived for the destruction of our unhappy citizens captivated by them the presentiment of these operations is shocking beyond expression i pray heaven to avert them but nothing in this world will do it but a proper conduct in the enemy in every event i shall resign myself to the hard necessity under which i shall act thomas jefferson oct        colonel george mathews to colonel george mathews  j mss in council oct        sir —the proceedings respecting governor hamilton  his companions previous to your arrival here you are acquainted with for your more precise information i enclose you the advice of council of june the   th of that of august the   th another of sep   th of the parole tendered them the  st instant and of governor hamiltons letter of the same day stating his objections in which he persevered from that time his confinement has become a voluntary one you delivered us your letters the next day when the post being just setting out much business prevented the council from taking them into consideration they have this day attended to them and found their resolution expressed in the enclosed advice bearing date this day it gives us great pain that any of our countrymen should be cut off from     the society of their friends  tenderest connections while it seems as if it was in our power to administer relief but we trust to their good sense for discerning  their spirit for bearing up against the fallacy of this appearance governor hamilton and his companions were imprisoned  ironed  st in retaliation for cruel treatment of our captive citizens by the enemy in general  d for the barbarous species of warfare which himself  his savage allies carried on in our western frontier  d for particular acts of barbarity of which he himself was personally guilty to some of our citizens in his power any one of these charges was sufficient to justify the measures we took of the truth of the first yourselves are witnesses your situation indeed seems to have been better since you were sent to new york but reflect on what you suffered before that  knew others of your countrymen to suffer  what you know is now suffered by that more unhappy part of them who are still confined on board the prison ships of the enemy proofs of the second charge we have under hamiltons own hand and of the third as sacred assurances as human testimony is capable of giving humane conduct on our part was found to produce no effect the contrary therefore was to be tried if it produces a proper lenity to our citizens in captivity it will have the effect we meant if it does not we shall return a severity as terrible as universal if the causes or our rigour against hamilton were founded in truth that rigour was just  would not give right to the enemy to commence any new hostilities on their part and all such new severities are to     be considered not as retaliation but as original and unprovoked if those causes were not founded in truth they should have denied them if declining the tribunal of truth  reason they chuse to pervert this into a contest of cruelty and destruction we will contend with them in that line  measure out misery to those in our power in that multiplied proportion which the advantage of superior numbers enables us to do we shall think it our particular duty after the information we gather from the papers which have been laid before us to pay very constant attention to your situation  that of your fellow prisoners we hope that the prudence of the enemy will be your protection from injury  we are assured that your regard for the honour of your country would not permit you to wish we should suffer ourselves to be bullied into an acquiescence under every insult  cruelty they may chuse to practice  a fear to retaliate lest you should be made to experience additional sufferings their officers  soldiers in our hands are pledges for your safety we are determined to use them as such iron will be retaliated by iron but a great multiplication on distinguished objects prison ships by prison ships and like for like in general i do not mean by this to cover any officer who has acted or shall act improperly they say capt willing was guilty of great cruelties at the natches if so they do right in punishing him i would use any powers i have for the punishment of any officer of our own who should be guilty of excesses unjustifiable under the usages of civilized nations however i do not find myself   0 obliged to believe the charge against capt willing to be true on the affirmation of the british commissary because in the next breath he affirms no cruelties have as yet been inflicted on him capt willing has been in irons i beg you to be assured there is nothing consistent with the honor of your country which we shall not at all times be ready to do for the relief of yourself  companions in captivity we know that ardent spirit and hatred for tyranny which brought you into your present situation will enable you to bear up against it with the firmness which has distinguished you as a soldier and to look forward with pleasure to the day when events shall take place against which the wounded spirits of your enemies will find no comfort even from reflections on the most refined of the cruelties with which they have glutted themselves thomas jefferson oct         benjamin harrison to the speaker of the house of delegates benjamin harrison v s a in council oct   d      sir —since the date of my former letter to you i have recd the inclosed resolutions of congress containing a requisition of additional supplies of money the general assembly in considering this subject will naturally cast their eyes on the funds already provided for the supply of their public treasury as a principal branch of these was in some degree under the care and direction of the executive i mean the proceeds of the estates of british subjects it becomes     my duty to guard the assembly against relying in their calculations for any great  immediate supplies from hence facts have come to our notice which give great reason to believe that the transverse  other pleadings justly allowed by the law for saving the rights of those who have real or probable appearance of right is perverted to frustrate or delay its effects by being put in on grounds either frivolous or false and by that means throwing the subject into a course of legal contestation which under the load of business now on the docquet of the general court may not be terminated in the present age in one instance we are certified by the clerk of the general court that the estate is claimed by the steward tho this very man undertook to act as commissioner of the estate under the sequestration law by our appointment and has himself personally rendered annual accounts to us of the proceeds of the estate as the estate of a british subject yet his claim palpably false as it is in order to obtain the ceremony of being adjudged so is to go through all the formalities of regular litigation before the estate can be exposed to sale perhaps the aids expected from this law might still be obtained however and as perfect justice done to every individual by a legislative provision for determining these pleadings in a speedy way i thought it my duty to guard the general assembly against any deception in their expectations from these funds that no disappointments may accrue in the measures they shall be pleased to adopt while on the subject of continental demands for supplies from this state i am to inform you sir of an     unfortunate delay in the settlement of the continental accounts immediately on the rising of the general assembly the executive proceeded without intermission to put into a course of execution the several things made incumbent on them it was the   th july before according to their arrangements they could proceed to appoint a commissioner to settle the continental account they then appointed a gentleman fully qualified in every point of view to discharge this duty perfectly his first letter dated three days after the appointment gave reason to hope he would undertake the charge ill health however and other subsequent circumstances obliged him to decline and the letter notifying that did not come to hand till the  0th of the last month since this no person has been found competent to the business  willing to undertake it we are in hopes that the more extensive acquaintance of the members of general assembly may enable them to appoint a person equal to this very difficult business a book of military institutions written by major general steuben and recommended for general use by congress has been transmitted to me i take the liberty of depositing it with the general assembly as on future revisions of their militia laws they may be able perhaps to extract some useful matters from it or it may be thought worth printing  dispersing among the officers of ye militia     thomas jefferson

proper choice of a supply of arms ordnance  military implements sent a mr le mair of the kingdom of france their agent express for that purpose to europe he executed his commission with a zeal and assiduity which we have rarely met with having traversed for fourteen months those parts of europe backwards  forwards where there was a hope of getting the articles wanted and after eighteen months absence returned himself in the last of three vessels which he charged with ordnance and other necessities his reasonable expenses we mean to pay and were about making him a proper pecuniary compensation for his time and great labour but he prays rather to be rewarded with military rank unattended by either pay or command expecting to reap greater benefit from this in his own country to which he is about to return the executive apprehending they have no authority to grant brevet commissions refer to the general assembly the expedience of authorizing them to give to this gentleman a lieutenant colonels commission by way of brevet they shall not indeed then think themselves discharged from making him some pecuniary compensation tho a much smaller may be given than they had before proposed     thomas jefferson oct  0      benjamin harrison to the speaker of the house of delegates benjamin harrison v s a in council oct  0th      sir —in pursuance of a resolution of the last session of general assembly the executive proceeded to form a contract with messrs penet windel  co for the establishment of a manufactury of fire arms  foundery of ordnance on james river and for extending navigation through its falls the several preliminary papers which passed between them are now transmitted to the general assembly that they may be enabled to judge of the obstacles the executive had to encounter and to see the reasons explained which led them to the several conclusions these articles also as ultimately concluded accompany this together with a subsequent letter from mr penet and memorial from mr savarit desiring some alterations in two of the articles the several objects of this contract must be admitted of the last importance the depending on the transportation of arms across an element on which our enemies have reigned for the defence of our own country has been already found insecure  distressing the endeavours of five years aided with some internal manufacturers have not yet found a tolerable supply of arms to make them within ourselves then as well as the other implements of war is as necessary as to make our bread within ourselves the present contract seems really to afford a promising appearance of future supply should these articles meet with ratification from the general     assembly i must still inform them that obstacles are likely to arise of a very perplexing nature from an unlucky connection of the public with a certain mr ballendine who has entangled himself into every part of the subjects of this contract some of his rights are real some only pretended unless they can be cleared away by legislation in a speedy mode liberal compensation being first allowed him for such of them as shall be found just the length of time which would be required to follow him through courts of justice in the ordinary course of proceedings will defeat every hope which might be entertained from this contract the duty imposed upon the executive by the resolution of assembly led them necessarily to an investigation of this mans rights  pretensions that the assembly may have proper lights to conduct their enquiries i will analyse his claims as they have appeared to us they refer to three several subjects which i will endeavour to keep distinct to avoid that confusion they might otherwise throw on one another   to the furnace in buckingham   to the foundary at westham   to the construction of a navigable canal at the falls of james river   mr ballendine with a partner mr reveley received by order from the assembly £ 000 in the year      for the purpose of erecting a furnace in buckingham  stipulated to repay it in pigiron at seven pounds ten shillings the ton which in fact amounted to a contract to pay the public    ⅔ tons of pigiron in december      he received a further sum of £  00 in may      he petitioned the     assembly to release him from the obligation of paying his debt in iron at £  0 the ton and to take it at the market price at the time of delivery of the iron the assembly agreed that he should be allowed more than £  0 but not the market price at the time of delivery thus signifying their sense that there was some intermediate ground on which they meant to take their stand but not pointing out what that was this led us to suppose that the market price of iron at the time of the paiment of the money to ballendine might be what the assembly had probably in view on settlement of his several accounts with the commissioners whom we appointed according to the resolution of assembly for that purpose  whose report is transmitted herewith there arose on one of them a balance in his favor for part of t c qr   0   of pigiron delivered the commissioners had extended it in money at £ 0 the ton and transferred the balance of £    which that produced to the credit of his account for the £ 000 or    ⅔ tons of iron we think they should have credited so much of the t c qr   0   of iron at £ 0 as would have balanced that account and transferred the residue in iron to the credit of his debt due in iron this error would have been too trivial to have noted to you sir but as it tended to induce a false principle into the account  to prevent us from informing you precisely that of the    ⅔ tons due to the public for the £ 000 there has been paid only t c   ′ and nothing paid towards discharging the additional £  00 to secure these balances the lands in which the money was invested were conveyed to the     trustees themselves but under an implied trust that on payment of the debt conveyances should be made to ballendine and reveley so that it is apprehended that they amount in fact to nothing more than mortgages there is little hope that the balance will ever be paid an opportunity now occurs not only of making the securities produce to the public the real worth of what was advanced on them but also of producing it in arms  implements of war the very articles originally proposed to be obtained by it and which of all others are most immediately essential to the public safety but a bill for foreclosing the trust to pass through the usual forms of proceedings in a court of chancery will hardly bring us relief till i hope we shall not need it   the general assembly in may      having determined to erect a foundry at westham for casting ordnance appointed commissioners for that purpose for the sum of £    0 which they paid mr ballendine they purchased from him for situating the foundry three acres  an half of land adjacent to a canal he was opening from westham and a right to deduce water from the canal for turning a boring mill  other works necessary for finishing the cannon—they were also to have free navigation down the canal to the foundry on contributing one moeity to the repairs of that part of the canal after it should have been once completed as he bound himself to compleat it they erected their foundery and found it necessary to make advances of money to ballendine to enable him to complete his canal  dam on which alone they depended for water the balance     due the commonwealth on these advances is £ 0    ½ as appears by one of the accounts transmitted herewith for securing which payments a mortgage had been taken on   ½ acres of land the whole of the real property of the said ballendine at that place so that the public possessions  interests at this place are the  ½ acres of land with the foundry on it a right to draw off water for working their machines for completing the cannon a common in the navigation paying one half the expense of keeping that part of the canal in repair  a mortgage on   ½ acres of land for securing the payment of £ 0    ½ but for the state of mr ballendines dam  canal  the prospect of obtaining water as long as he is to be depended on for it i beg leave to refer you to the report of the same commissioners   the extending navigation from westham to richmond besides its other very general importance being extremely requisite to promote the success of the proposed manufactory by reducing the difficulty  expence attending the transportation of the bulky articles of coal wood  other things necessary to be expended on it and its own very weighty produce we were led to inquire by what means mr ballendine had got foothold there and on what pretensions he founds a right of constructing the navigable canal in      the assembly passed an act authorising the opening the falls of james river by subscription of money from individuals and appointing trustees to take such subscriptions some persons accordingly subscribed but no appearance of the arising of the works being ever compleated in this way the assembly     after waiting   years to wit in      passed another act for putting the business into a different train they directed that as soon as the former  subsequent subscribers or a majority of them should think a sufficient sum raised any ten of them being subscribers of £ 00 each at last might appoint a general meeting at which a president     directors should be elected who should have power to agree with an undertaker to cut the canal proposed provided such undertaker should first give sufficient security to perform his agreement they gave to the adventurers authority to carry the canal through any persons lands paying the worth of them allowed them certain tolls and pointed out the precise mode in which they might transfer their shares in the undertaking to wit by deed executed by the president the subscriber having first tendered his share to the directors who were to have the refusal at the same price very considerable sums were engaged under this act but there never was a meeting of the subscribers to elect a president  directors nor an undertaker employed while this was in agitation mr ballendine proposing to clear the falls of james river  the falls of potowmack set on foot subscriptions for enabling him to go to england to learn how to do it great sums were subscribed he went returned  brought some workmen he purchased at the head of the falls of james river the  0 acres of land three  a half of which were conveyed as before mentioned to the public for the foundery and the other   ½ mortgaged to them he opened a canal through this land and then of his own   0 authority without any act of assembly or even an order of court as we are told he made a dam across an arm of james river  drew off  0 feet width of water along his canal in november      by petition to the assembly he informs them that the subscribers under the last act of assembly had transferred their interests to him that he had made considerable progress in the canal  should finish it if he met with no interruption from those through whose lands it must pass  prays an act might pass vesting him with the former subscribers had the allegation in his petition been true that the former subscribers had transferred their interests to him such an act would have been unnecessary because he would have stood on their footing but it could not be true because the transfer being to be executed by the president after a tender  refusal of the share to the company  no president having ever been elected there could have been no such transfer to him as he alleged i have been thus particular sir in order to show you that mr ballendine has no legal right to the conducting the canal which can stand in the way of the present contract he has an equity of redemption in the   ½ acres of land before mentioned and so far stands on the footing of every other landholder through whose lands the canall must pass he prayed earnestly that their rights might be sacrificed to him on his paying them the value can he then with modesty now say that his rights shall not be sacrificed to others paying him the value of the injury done him it is now four years since he begun his canal he has conducted it about     one twentieth part of the whole distance and this too while his workmen were with him  his means if he had any were fresh a very simple calculation then will inform us that in his hands the completion of this work will require near a century and then a question arises whether mr ballendine will live so long i think we may fairly conclude that he will never complete it it is right that in cases of such general importance the interests of a few individuals should give way to the general good full compensation being made them and as right that mr ballendines should as those of the others whose lands were to have been laid open to him he has had a long enough trial to convince the whole world he never will complete it other gentlemen now offer to do it within a reasonable term as the assembly then after an eight years trial  failure of the act of      made another experiment in      it seems reasonable after other seven years patience to try yet other means it is possible the present undertakers may not find it necessary to make use of mr ballendines canal at all but may take out the water elsewhere but should they find that it can be taken off no where else it is submitted to the assembly whether his having dug a canal along grounds thro which the navigable canal must necessarily pass shall privilege those grounds more than the meadows  grounds of others are privileged and for ever obstruct the opening that river and whether there can be any sound objection to the having in his case as well as in those of others a just valuation made of ye injury     he will sustain by the use which shall be made of his canal and after withholding the £  0   ½ due from him to the public on that particular account to pay him the balance if the injury shall be found to exceed that sum in stating to you the several obstacles which oppose themselves to the execution of the resolution of assembly i have been necessarily led to mention circumstances which are to be found among your own journals  acts  of which therefore you had knowledge before they were necessary to continue the thread of the relation so as to render it intelligible and are desired to be considered only as references to your own records for more authentic and precise information thomas jefferson nov  0      chevalier de la luzerne to the french minister  chevalier de la luzerne in council nov  0      sir —in compliance with the request which you were pleased to lay before us i am now to authorize the forces of his most christian majesty to land in such place and his vessels to withdraw into such harbors of this commonwealth as the admiral or other commanding officer shall think proper and to procure houses for the purpose of hospitals in determining on the place of his debarkation  encampment he will be pleased to follow his own judgment     receiving from us his information that the farther he can withdraw his vessels up our rivers into the country the more it would be in our power to assist in defending them against any attack from the enemy york river according to our present idea would offer itself as the most defencible but in this c the board of war will issue orders for their immediate supply of provisions from our magazines and will aid them with such of our vessels as may be necessary for procuring further supplies and landing their sick  other purposes these general resources seem to be all we can take for their present relief till their wants shall be more particularly laid before us we beg leave to take this early occasion to assure you that we shall receive into our state the forces of his most christian majesty with the utmost cordiality and spare nothing which shall be within our power to aid and accomodate them in whatever situation they shall choose but in this or any other we greatly apprehend the difficulties and distresses which may arise from the want of proper houses for hospitals i shall take great pleasure in showing on every occasion which shall occur my personal gratitude and affection to your nation and the particular esteem with which i am sir your most obedient and most humble sert     thomas jefferson november         wmsburg richard caswell to the governor of north carolina  richard caswell wmsburg november         sir —i have lately received messages and information from the cherokee nation of indians painting their nakedness and general distress for want of european goods so strongly as to call for pity and all possible relief their several settlements being contiguous to the two carolinas  to virginia they have at times received supplies i believe from each of these states their great numbers however  the extent of their settlements when taken into view by any one of our states bear a discourageing proportion to the moderate aids we can singly furnish and render a general distribution of them very troublesome these considerations have induced me to take the liberty of submitting to your excellency a proposition as i do to governor rutledge also by a letter of this days date to divide the trouble and task of supplying them among our three states the division of those indians into southern middle  northern settlements renders the apportionment of them obvious the protecting from intrusion the lands of the southern cherokees  furnishing them with goods seems most convenient to south carolina the same friendly offices to the middle settlements seem most within your power  the northern settlements are most convenient to us the attachment which each settlement will by these means acquire to the particular state which is its immediate     patron and benefactor will be a bond of peace and will lead to a separation of that powerfull people if this distribution should happily meet the approbation of your excellency  of governor rutledge we shall do every thing in our power for discharging our duties to the northern settlement knowing your disposition to have these people protected in the possession of their unpurchased lands i also take the liberty of mentioning to you that the old tassel in a late message to me complains of intrusions on their lands and particularly of some attempts to take from them the great island this by the late extension of our boundary falling as i understand within your state removes the application for protection to your excellency whose power alone can extend to the removal of intrusions from thence as to so much of their lands as lie within our latitudes as well as the lands of other indians generally our assembly now sitting has in contemplation to authorise the executive to send patrols of the military through them from time to time to destroy the habitations which shall be erected in them by intruders the bearer of this letter is a major martin our agent residing with the cherokees who will be able to inform your excellency of any particulars you may wish to learn we have reason to believe him a good kind of man  worthy of credit in tending to fix a post and small garrison in powells valley we have ordered part of a battalion thither to erect a stockade but as it would be proper for them first to assemble together being not yet embodied at a nearer station and there being a fort and houses at the great island     we have taken the liberty of appointing their rendezvous at that fort till there shall be so many embodied as may proceed with safety to powells valley we have reason to expect that their stay at that place will be very short and hope it will not be disagreeable to your excellency the necessity of immediate orders put it out of our power to apply for your previous approbation we consider the measure still however subject to your pleasure and therefore take this early opportunity of acquainting you with it thomas jefferson nov        wmsburg samuel huntington to the president of congress samuel huntington c c wmsburg novr   th      sir —colo bland being about to retire from his command at the barracks in albemarle and desirous to withdraw at the same time the party of his horse which has hitherto been stationed there wished that we should supply their place by sending thither about twenty or five and twenty of the horse of this state our horse being as yet not very well trained the officers represented that it would much impede that work and leave the remaining fragment in a very awkward situation should we divide a troop we have therefore ordered a complete troop to that station but wish congress would be pleased to notify as soon as convenient whether they approve of this or not we have hitherto been unable to raise more than about the half of a battalion of infantry for guarding     the convention troops at the same post the deficiencies have been endeavoured to be supplied with militia congress have had too much experience of the radical defects and inconveniences of militia service to need my enumerating them our assembly now sitting have in contemplation to put the garrison regiment on such a footing as gives us hopes of filling it by the next summer in the meantime a battalion which we are raising for our immediate defence may be spared to do garrison duty this winter and as but a small part of it is raised as yet and not probable that it will be completed within any short time we suppose that with colo taylors regiment it will not exceed the number required to guard the troops i would observe to you that the captains and subalterns of this new battalion are not to be called into service but as their men are raised so that the burthen which has sometimes been incurred of paying officers without men need not be apprehended in this instance we have therefore ordered this battalion to rendezvous at the barracks and do duty there this winter and that the battalion should be discharged in proportion as these come in on this measure also we ask the pleasure of congress the appointment of a successor to colo bland will give us great satisfaction and we hope congress will take it into early consideration the duties of that post call for respectable abilities and an uncommon vigilance and firmness of character     thomas jefferson nov  0      williamsburg general washington to general washington w mss williamsburg nov  0      sir —your excellencys letter on the discriminations which have been heretofore made between the troops raised within this state and considered as part of our quota  those not so considered was delivered me four days ago i immediately laid it before the assembly who thereupon came to the resolution i now do myself the honor of enclosing you the resolution of congress of mar         which you were so kind as to inclose was never known in this state till a few weeks ago when we received printed copies of the journals of congress it would be a great satisfaction to us to receive an exact return of all the men we have in continental service who come within the descriptions of the resolution together with our state troops in continental service colo cabell was so kind as to send me a return of octob      of the continental regiments commanded by lord sterling of the  st   d virginia state regiments and of colo gists regiment besides these are the following viz colonel harrisons regiment of artillery colonels baylors horse colonel blands horse general scotts new levies part of which are gone to carolina and part are here colonel gibsons regiment stationed on the ohio heath and oharas independent companies at the same stations colonel taylors regiment of guards to the convention troops of these we have a return there may possibly be others not occurring to me a return of all these would enable us to see what proportion of the continental army is contributed by     us we have at present very pressing calls to send additional numbers of men to the southward no inclination is wanting in either the legislature or executive powers to aid them or to strengthen you but we find it difficult to procure men i herewith transmit to your excellency some recruiting commissions to be put into such hands as you may think proper for reenlisting such of our soaldiery as are not engaged already for the war the act of assembly authorizing these instructions requires that the men enlisting should be reviewed  received by an officer to be appointed for that purpose a caution less necessary in the case of men now actually in service  therefore doubtless able bodied than in the raising new recruits the direction however goes to all cases and therefore we must trouble your excellency with the appointment of one or more officers of review mr moss our agent receives orders which accompany this to pay the bounty money  recruiting money  to deliver the clothing we have however certain reason to fear he has not any great sum of money on hand and it is absolutely out of our power at this time to supply him or to say with certainty when we shall be able to do it he is instructed to note his acceptances under the draughts and to assure payment as soon as we shall have it in our power to furnish him as the only substitute for money your excellencys directions to the officer of review will probably procure us the satisfaction of being informed from time to time how many men shall be reenlisted by colo mathews i informed your excellency   0 fully of the situation of governor hamilton  his companions lamothe  dejean have given their paroles and are at hanover courthouse hamilton hay and four others are still obstinate they therefore are still in close confinement tho their irons have never been on since your second letter on the subject i wrote full information of this matter to general phillips also from whom i had received letters on the subject i cannot in reason believe that the enemy on receiving this information either from yourself or general phillips will venture to impose any new distresses on our officers in captivity with them yet their conduct hitherto has been most successfully prognosticated by reversing the conclusions of right reason it is therefore my duty as well as it was my promise to the virginia captives to take measures for discovering any change which may be made in their situation for this purpose i must apply for your excellencys interposition i doubt not but you have an established mode of knowing at all times through your commissary of prisoners the precise state of those in the power of the enemy i must therefore pray you to put into motion any such means you have of obtaining knowledge of the situation of the virginia officers in captivity if you should think proper as i could wish to take upon yourself to retaliate any new sufferings which may be imposed on them it will be more likely to have due weight and to restore the unhappy on both sides to that benevolent treatment for which all should wish     thomas jefferson nov  0      proclamation laying embargo c c nov  0      by his excellency thomas jefferson esq governour or chief magistrate of the commonwealth of virginia a proclamation whereas the exportation of provisions from the state will be attended with manifest injury to the united states by supplying the enemy and by rendering it difficult for the publick agents and contractors to procure supplies for the american troops and will moreover give encouragement to engrossers and monopolizers to prosecute their baneful practices i have thought fit by and with the advice and consent of the council of state to issue this my proclamation for laying an embargo on provisions and i do hereby lay an embargo on provisions viz on all beef pork bacon wheat indian corn pease or other grain or flour or meal made of the same to continue until the first of may next and i do hereby strictly prohibit all mariners masters and commanders of vessels and all other persons whatsoever within this state from loading on board any vessel for exportation and from exporting all or any of the above species of provisions by land or water from the date hereof during the term aforesaid under pain of incurring the penalties inflicted by the act of assembly intitled an act to empower the governour and council to lay an embargo for a limited time except as in the said act is excepted and i do hereby strictly charge and command all naval officers and     others in their respective departments to exert their best endeavours to the end that this embargo be strictly observed given under my hand this  0th day of november      thomas jefferson dec         wmsburg samuel huntington to the president of congress samuel huntington c c wmsburg decr         sir —we have information from our delegates in congress that the detention of some continental arms by the executive of this state during the course of the last summer has given considerable umbrage to congress i beg leave therefore thro you sir to lay before that honorable body facts simply as they occurred hoping that these will satisfy them that the arms being justly due to this state necessity alone dictated the measure and that no sentiment of disrespect to congress entered into the transaction this state in an early part of the present contest raised at first two and soon afterwards seven battalions for its particular defence finding however that the dangers of our being invaded became less our legislature made a tender of these battalions for the continental service the tender was accepted of by congress only on condition that we would permit them to carry their arms with them they were accordingly marched to the grand army time after time as we could get them armed i think this condition was dispensed with as to two battalions only which congress induced by their increasing wants of men permitted     to march on without their arms this is one of the articles of debit in our account of arms against the continent which i state particularly in order to bring it into recollection with some of your honorable members and because being recollected it will go far in our justification as to the number of arms retained with us since this however at different times and for different corps many smaller parcels of arms have been sent to congress by us it is a fact which we are to lament that in the earlier part of our struggles we were so wholly occupied by the great object of establishing our rights that we attended not at all to those little circumstances of taking receipts and vouchers keeping regular accounts and preparing subjects for future disputes with our friends if we could have supported the whole continent i believe we should have done it and never dishonored our exertions by producing accounts sincerely assured that in no circumstances of future necessity or distress a like free application of anything theirs would have been thought hardly of or would have rendered necessary an appeal to accounts hence it has happened that in the present case the collection of vouchers for the arms furnished by this state has become tedious and difficult our board of war has been attending to this business a considerable time but have as yet authenticated the loan of only      stand of arms and   0 rifles they seem however to believe that exclusive of considerable numbers delivered where no receipts were taken and the officers to whom delivered are     dead or not to be found which of course we shall lose they will be able to establish a right to  0000 stand these arms were most of them of the very best quality imported from great britain by the state for its own use after the loan of so many to the continent the loss of a considerable number put into the hands of the militia during the short invasion of the last spring many of which we were never able to recover and a very recent loan of  000 stand to be sent on at the request of congress to south carolina we were reduced to not more than  000 stand in all our magazines rumors were spread of an intended invasion by the enemy for the purpose of rescuing the convention troops that body of men were in the heart of our country under a guard not able to furnish centinels for ordinary duty congress had just recommended to us to prepare for the most immediate and most vigorous operations and to have our militia ready to march at the shortest warning the knolege of the low state of our magazines had by some means got abroad and spread a general alarm among our people in this situation of things a vessel loaded with arms seemed to be guided by the hand of providence into one of our harbours they were its true the property of our friends but of friends indebted to us for those very articles they were for the common defence too and we were a part of the body to be defended an officer came for the purpose of removing them out of the state would circumstances have permitted a previous application to congress tho not present myself i so thoroughly know the respect which the executive bears for congress     that i am safe in affirming that such an application would most certainly have been made but had they awaited that ceremony the arms would have been gone the continent of course would have been at the expence and the arms exposed to the injury and risk of a double transportation for i cannot but take for granted that congress would on such an application in the case of a state so reduced in her magazines and reduced by loans to them have ordered the arms to be replaced time however did not admit of this ceremony the executive therefore retained  000 stand we shall not draw examples of similar liberties taken by other states we shall never recapitulate aids granted to or taken by our brethren from the common stock because we wish it to be freely used for their service and to draw nothing from it for ourselves unless our distresses should at any time be such as to point us out to them as objects needing the common aid but we will observe in general that between congress and this state similar freedoms in other articles had been repeatedly and mutually taken on many former occasions and never had been the cause of discontent to either party this precedent then strengthened by the existence of an actual debt seemed to give a double sanction to the executive for what they did nor did any instance occur to them of unreadiness at any time to spare freely on continental requisition any articles within possession or power which might expose them to experience in turn the disregard of congress i flatter myself therefore that that honorable body whenever this matter shall be the subject     of their deliberations will be of opinion that the proceedings of the lieutenant governor and council were substantially justifiable they hope that no want of ceremony or other smaller circumstance may have been matter of offence to congress if in this they should be mistaken feeling the most real respect for that body impressed with the idea that its authority can never be wounded without injury to the present union they are to lament the misapprehension  wish to remove it by assuring you as they may with truth that no sentiment of theirs either on this or any other occasion has justified it a motive of duty and respect to the collective council of our union has led me into this detail to remove all grounds of discontent from among us and to assure you sir at the same time that i shall consider as occasions of manifesting my zeal for our sacred cause thomas jefferson dec         williamsburg general washington to general washington w mss williamsburg decr         sir —i take the liberty of putting under cover to your excellency some letters to generals phillips and reidesel uninformed whether they are gone into new york or not and knowing that you can best forward them in either case i also trouble you with a letter from the master of the flag in this state to the british commissary of prisoners in new york trusting it will thus be more certainly conveyed than if sent to mr adam it is my wish the british commissary should return     his answer through your excellency or your commissary of prisoners and that they should not propose under this pretext to send another flag as the mission of this flag is not unattended by circumstances of suspicion and a certain information of the situation of ourselves and our allies here might influence the measures of the enemy perhaps your commissary of prisoners can effect the former method of answer i inclose to you part of an act of assembly ascertaining the quantities of land which shall be allowed to the officers and soldiers at the close of the war and providing means of keeping that country vacant which has been allotted to them i am advised to ask the attention of your excellency to the case of colo bland late commander at the barracks in albemarle when that gentleman was applied to to take that command he attended the executive here and informed them that he must either decline it or be supported in such a way as would keep up that respect which was essential to his command without at the same time ruining his private fortune the executive were sensible that he would be exposed to very great and unavoidable expence they observed that his command would be in a department separate from any other and that he actually relieved a major general from the same service they did not think themselves authorized to say what should be done in this case but undertook to represent the matter to congress and in the mean time gave it as their opinion that a decent table     ought to be found for him on this he undertook the command and in the course of it incurred expenses which seem to have been unavoidable unless he would have lived in such a way as is hardly reconcilable to the spirit of an officer or the reputation of those in whose service he is governor henry wrote on the subject to congress colo bland did the same but we learn that they have concluded the allowance to be unprecedented and inadmissable in the case of an officer of his rank the commissaries on this have called on colo bland for reimbursement a sale of his estate was about to take place when we undertook to recommend to them to suspend their demand till we could ask the favor of you to advocate this matter with congress so far as you think it right otherwise the ruin of a very worthy officer must inevitably follow thomas jefferson dec         benjamin harrison to the speaker of the house of delegates benjamin harrison v s a in council dec         sir —the inclosed letter from governor lee and intelligence  accompanying it gives reason to apprehend that the enemy meditate an invasion of this state the reasons which support this opinion as well as those which oppose it will occur to the general assembly it is our duty to provide against every event and the executive are accordingly engaged in concerting proper measures of defence among     others we think to call an immediate force from the militia to defend the post at york and to take a proper post on the south side of james river but the expence the difficulties which attend a general call of the militia into the field the disgust it gives them more especially when they find no enemy in place and the extreme rigor of the season induce us to refer to the decision of the general assembly whether we shall on the intelligence already received  now communicated to them call a competent force of militia to oppose the numbers of

assembly will also please to determine whether in case the enemy should make a lodgement in the country it would be expedient to avail ourselves of the laudable zeal which may prevail on their first landing and enlist a sufficient number to oppose them  to continue in service during the invasion or for any other term perhaps it may not be amiss to suggest to the assembly the tardiness of collecting even small numbers of men by divisions that if any better method should occur to them they may prescribe it the present state of the treasury in more points than one will no doubt be thought an absolute obstacle to every military endeavor which may be necessary  00 thomas jefferson dec  0      wmsburg samuel huntington to the president of congress samuel huntington c c wmsburg decr  0th      sir —your letter inclosing the resolutions of congress relating to the capture of the portuguese snow by captain cunningham has remained hitherto unanswered because i hoped daily to be enabled to write more fully on that subject the resolutions and documents accompanying them as soon as received were put into the hands of our attorney general for his opinion with intention to have such proceedings at law instituted as he should advise you will see that by his opinion which i do myself the honor of inclosing you the offence could not be prosecuted here criminally our act of assembly establishing a court of admiralty having in conformity with the articles of confederation expressly inhibited it from criminal jurisdiction the general assembly being then to meet in the month of october i reserved the subject to be laid before them which was accordingly done a great variety however of other business which would not admit of being postponed occasioned them to pretermit this til their next session so that if the offenders be within the cognizance of the criminal law at all which the attorney seems to doubt we have as yet no court wherein they may be prosecuted a civil action for damages may be instituted and if the sufferers shall think proper to direct it the countenance and protection of government here shall not be wanting so far as propriety will admit or justice require i am to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of  0  december  0th inclosing resolutions of congress of the same date approving our measures for guarding the convention troops and accepting the resignation of colo bland i hope that ere this his place has been supplied as the constant attention of an officer of knowledge and understanding is requisite there perhaps his troubles might be lessened and his office more fully discharged by residing at the barracks rather than at charlottesvile these posts being five or six miles apart the resolutions of the   th    th inst inclosed in your letter of the   th unfortunately came not to hand till two days after the rising of the general assembly which was on the   th and they will not meet again before the period for the delivery of the indian corn will be passed they had however early in the present year laid a tax payable in specific commodities and in their late session directed the executive to raise from the proceeds of that tax six hundred thousand pounds towards making up the quotas of money for which they were called on by congress the articles specified were wheat indian corn rye barley oats hemp and tobacco at the option of the payer but it is conjectured that paiment will be made almost wholly in indian corn  tobacco i am in hopes that on those acts of the legislature we shall be enabled to comply with your requisition as to the specific article and quantity required as we may retain the tax in its specific form instead of converting it into money but we shall fail in point of time because it happens that the ultimate term  0  of paiment allowed for this tax is the day on which your resolutions require delivery of it to your commissary at such places as he shall appoint in this point then will be felt the misfortune of the legislatures separation before receipt of the resolutions the executive having no powers to shorten the day of paiment i thought it my duty to give you this early notice of the particular part of that requisition with which from these circumstances we shall be unable to comply that the ill effects of disappointment may be lessened by other timely measures the resolution of the   th instant recommending the continuance of embargoes is also received that measure had been adopted some time ago as you will see by the proclamation inclosed i shall hereafter according to the desire of your secretary transmit you copies of our acts of assembly by which you will receive more minute information of the measures taken in consequence of your recommendations from time to time than the compass of a letter would admit end of volume ii   from harpers new monthly magazine lxxxi  0    kindly furnished by miss sarah n randolph for more

churchwardens and vestrymen of the upper parish in the county of nansemond and filed a libel in the general court as a court of ecclesiastical jurisdiction against the defendant charging that he was minister of the gospel of christ regularly ordained according to the rites of the church of england that he was received to the care of the said parish that he was of evil fame and profligate manners that he was much addicted to drunkenness in so much as to be often drunk at church and unable to go through divine service or to baptize or marry those who attended for those purposes that he officiated in ridiculous apparel unbecoming a priest that he was a common disturber of the peace and often quarrelling and fighting that he was a common and profane swearer that on the  0th of july      and at other times he exposed his private parts to view in public companies and solicited negro and other women to fornication and adultery with him that he neglected the parochial duties of performing divine service preaching and administering the sacrament of the lords supper that he had declared he did not believe in the revealed religion of christ and cared not of what religion he was so he got the tobacco nor what became of the flock so that he could get the fleece wherefore the libellants prayed that the said patrick lunan might be corrected punished and deprived or otherwise that right and justice might be administered the defendant pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court and on that plea it came to be argued in october         the court adjudged that they possessed ecclesiastical jurisdiction and that as an ecclesiastical court they might proceed to censure or deprive the defendant if there should be just cause   from a copy courteously furnished by dr j s h

new committee was named and on the arrival of harrison henry and jefferson on aug   they were added to this second committee but it was equally fruitless of results one of the last acts of the convention was dictated by a proclamation of the governor    declaring that the king had given orders that all vacant lands should be put up in lots at public sale    it was an innovation on the established usage of granting lands within the colony announced that revenue was to be hunted for in disregard of charters and ancient habits and to be embraced in it minutest shapes to attack this new head of the hydra of precedent a committee was appointed of patrick henry richard bland thomas jefferson robert carter nicholas and edmund randolph to inquire whether his majesty may of right advance the terms of granting lands in this colony and to make report to the next general assembly or convention but this affair was lost in the subsequent events and at any other time would probably

archibald cary and on its acceptance he was first named on the committee to present it to the governor both of which duties were usually assigned to the drafter but jefferson claims it as his

     the first of these papers is apparently jeffersons rough draft the second being that submitted to the committee they are both printed with the parts struck out or altered as an interesting

vaughn of july         post the adoption of the troops about boston into the continental service and the appointment of washington as commander in chief were the first real steps on the part of the united colonies towards war and required explanation and justification from congress on june   d accordingly on a motion the congress resolved that a committee of five be chosen to draw up a declaration to be published by general washington upon his arrival at the camp before boston the committee chosen are mr j rutledge mr w livingston mr franklin mr jay and mr johnson journal this commee brought in their report on june   th which was read and debated and after some time referred for farther consideration charles thomson states pa mag of hist and biography that it occasioned long and warm debates in congress in which dickinson took a distinguished part it was again considered on june   th and according to jefferson endorsement on draft of declaration being disliked it was recommitted  mr dickinson  t jefferson added to the committee the latter being desired by the commee to draw up a new one he prepared this paper on a meeting of the commee j dickinson objected that it was too harsh wanted softening c whereupon the commee desired him to retouch it which he did in the form which they reported july   which was adopted by congress and in his autobiography jefferson further stated on the   th a committee which had been appointed to prepare a declaration of the causes of the taking up arms brought in their report drawn i believe by j rutledge which not being liked the house recommitted it on the   th and added mr dickinson and myself to the committee on the rising of the house the committee not having yet met i happen to find myself near governor w livingston and proposed to him to draw the paper he excused himself and proposed that i should draw it    i prepared a draught of the declaration committed to us it was too strong for mr dickinson he still retained the hope of reconciliation with the mother country and was unwilling it should be lessened by offensive statements he was so honest a man and so able a one that he was greatly indulged even by those who could not feel his scruples we therefore requested him to take the paper and put it into a form he could approve he did so preparing an entire new statement and preserving of the former only the last four paragraphs and the half of the preceding one we approved and reported it to congress william livingston also wrote to stirling july  th we are now working upon a manifesto on arming the first was not liked by the congress and was recomitted the second was not liked by the committee both had the faults common to our southern gentlemen much faultfinding and declamation with little sense or dignity they seem to think a reiteration of tyranny despotism bloody c all that is needed to unite us at home and convince the bribed voters of north of the justice of our cause it is evident from a comparison of these two drafts with dickinsons draft reproduced in dr george h moores john dickinson as well as with that ultimately adopted by the congress journal july  th that jefferson is mistaken in claiming the final paragraphs of that accepted as his dickinson has certainly embodied a few of jeffersons phrases and ideas but not more so in those than in the other parts of the declaration   jefferson writes at bottom of page we did not embody men a soldiery to commit aggression on them we did not raise armies for march to glory or to conquest or for glory we did not invade

conciliatory resolution moved by lord north and adopted february  0      by the house of commons jefferson in the virginia house of burgesses had already drawn a reply to this which having been approved i was requested by the committee to prepare the report it was introduced july   th but was not adopted till july   st this is jeffersons draft of that paper and varies considerably from the paper as finally adopted   that there is no matter in dispute between us but the single circumstance of the mode of levying taxes which mode they are so good as to give up to us of course that the colonies are unreasonable if they are not thereby perfectly satisfied whereas in truth our adversaries not only still claim a right of demanding ad libitum and of taxing us themselves to the full amount of their demands if we do not fulfil their pleasure which leaves us without anything we can call property but what is of more importance  what they keep in this proposal out of sight as if no such point was in contest they claim a right of altering all our charters and established laws which leaves us without the least security for our lives or liberties the proposition seems also

constitution though mentioned in several of the histories and other works concerning virginia and though seen by wirt life of patrick henry p     and by leigh debates of virginia convention    0 p   0 has never yet been printed or even quoted the history of its production is as follows on december        the continental congress resolved that if the convention of virginia shall find it necessary to establish a form of government in that colony it be recommended to that convention to call a full and free representation of the people and that the said representatives if they think it necessary establish such forms of government as in their judgment will best produce the happiness of the people the convention received this resolution on dec   th but took no action upon it in april a new convention was elected which met on may  th and on may   th appointed a committee to prepare a declaration of rights and a form of government in the meantime the continental congress on motion of john adams may  0      recommended to the respective assemblies and conventions of these united colonies where no government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs hath been hitherto established to adopt such government as shall in the opinion of the representatives of the people best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular and america in general on may   th the resolutions of the virginia convention were laid before the continental congress and between that date and the middle part of june jefferson while attending congress drew up this constitution this he forwarded to pendleton in the convention by george wythe who was returning from congress to virginia and the latter wrote him july         when i came here the plan of government had been committed to the whole house to those who had the chief hand in forming it the one you put into my hands was shewn two or three parts of this were with little alteration inserted in that but such was the impatience of sitting long enough to discuss several important points in which they differ and so many other matters were necessary to be dispatched before the adjournment that i was persuaded the revision of a subject the members seemed tired of would at that time have been unsuccessfully proposed of it jefferson in      wrote i was then at philadelphia with congress and knowing that the convention of virginia was engaged in forming a plan of government i turned my mind to the same subject and drew a sketch or outline of a constitution with a preamble which i sent to mr pendleton president of the convention on the mere possibility that it might suggest something worth incorporation into that before the convention he informed me afterwards by letter that he received it on the day on which the committee of the whole had reported to the house the plan they had agreed to that that had been so long in hand so disputed inch by inch and the subject of so much altercation and debate that they were worried with the contentions it had produced and could not from mere lassitude have been induced to open the instrument again but that being pleased with the preamble to mine they adopted it in the house by way of amendment to the report of the committee and thus my preamble became tacked to the work of george mason the constitution with the preamble was passed on the   th of june and the committee of congress had only the day before that reported to that body the draught of the declaration of independence the fact is that that preamble was prior in composition to the declaration and both having the same object of justifying our separation from great britain they used necessarily the same materials of justification and hence their similitude jefferson both at the time and afterwards denied the power of the virginia convention to adopt a permanent constitution on the grounds that it was chosen an executive body to carry on the war and that independence and the establishment of a state government were not before the people when they chose the delegates to it edmund randolph ms history of virginia p    states that mr jefferson who was in congress urged a youthful friend in the convention to oppose a permanent constitution until the people should elect deputies for the special purpose he denied the power of the body elected as he conceived them to be agents for the management of the war to exceed some temporary regimen the leading members of the convention however according to randolph saw no distinction between the conceded powers to declare independence and its necessary consequence the fencing of society by the institution of government in pursuance of his opinion jeffersons proposed constitution was given the form of a mere act and much is included which has no place in a constitution the nonconcurrence of the convention in his view and even more the aristocratic limits on the franchise and the unfavorable discrimination against the western counties that the planter and tidewater representatives secured which made no grosser error than to suppose that the constitution of virginia was formed in      for its two great distinctive features the sectional and the aristocratic had been given to it a century before debates of virginia convention    0 were the causes for his dislike of the constitution adopted in      and of his constant attempts to obtain its alteration his objections are indicated in his notes on virginia query xiii ¶   as well as in his correspondence and his preparation of his fundamental constitution in      and his notes for a constitution in      both of which form striking examples in contrast to this of the democratic development of his mind   this heading is written on a separate

virginia convention of      elliot iii    as such in the following words there is one example of this violation in virginia of a most striking and shocking nature—an example so horrid that if i conceived my country would passively permit a repetition of it dear as it is to me i would seek means of expatriating myself from it a man who was then a citizen was deprived of his life thus from a mere reliance on general reports a gentleman in the house of delegates informed the house that a certain man josiah philips had committed several crimes and was running at large perpetrating other crimes he therefore moved leave to attaint him he obtained that leave instantly no sooner did he obtain it than he drew from his pocket a bill ready written for that effect it was read three times in one day and carried to the senate i will not say that it passed the same day through the senate but he was attainted very speedily and precipitately without any proof better than these vague reports without being confronted with his accusers and witnesses without the privilege of calling evidence on his behalf he was sentenced to death and was afterwards actually executed to this henry replied elliot iii   0 the honorable member has given you an elaborate account of what he judges tyrannical legislation and an ex post facto law in the case of josiah philips he has misrepresented the facts that man was not executed by a tyrannical stroke of power nor was he a socrates he was a fugitive murderer and an outlaw—a man who commanded an infamous banditti and at a time when the war was at the most perilous stage he committed the most cruel and shocking barbarities he was an enemy to the human name those who declare war against the human race may be struck out of existence as soon as they are apprehended he was not executed according to those beautiful legal ceremonies which are pointed out by the laws in criminal cases the enormity of his crimes did not entitle him to it i am truly a friend to legal forms and methods but sir the occasion warranted the measure a pirate an outlaw or a common enemy to all mankind may be put to death at any time it is justified by the laws of nature and nations jeffersons attention was first called to these statements in reading the proof sheets of girardins history of virginia he at once wrote to girardin march         i return the three cativers which i have perused with the usual satisfaction you will find a few pencilled notes merely verbal but in one place i have taken a greater liberty than i ever took before or ever indeed had occasion to take it is in the case of josiah philips which i find strangely represented by judge tucker and mr edmund randolph and very negligently vindicated by mr henry that case is personally known to me because i was of the legislature at the time was one of those consulted by mr henry and had my share in the passage of the bill i never before saw the observations of those gentlemen which you quote on this case and will now therefore briefly make some strictures on them judge tucker instead of a definition of the functions of bills of attainder has given a diatribe against their abuse the occasion and proper office of a bill of attainder is thus when a person charged with a crime withdraws from justice or resists it by force either in his own or a foreign country no other means of bringing him to trial or punishment being practicable a special act is passed by the legislature adapted to the particular case this prescribes to him a sufficient time to appear and submit to a trial by his peers declares that his refusal to appear shall be taken as a confession of guilt as in the ordinary case of an offender at the bar refusing to plead and pronounces the sentence which would have been rendered on his confession or conviction in a court of law no doubt that these acts of attainder have been abused in england as instruments of vengence by a successful over a defeated party but what institution is insusceptible of abuse in wicked hands again the judge says the court refused to pass sentence of execution pursuant to the direction of the act the court could not refuse this because it was never proposed to them and my authority for this assertion shall be presently given for the perversion of a fact so intimately known to himself mr randolph can be excused only by our indulgence for orators who pressed by a powerful adversary lose sight in the ardor of conflict of the rigorous accuracies of fact and permit their imagination to distort and color them to the views of the moment he was attorneygeneral at the time and told me himself the first time i saw him after the trial of philips that when taken and delivered up to justice he had thought it best to make no use of the act of attainder and to take no measure under it that he had indicted him at the common law either for murder or robbery i forgot which and whether for both that he was tried on this indictment in the ordinary way found guilty by the jury sentenced and executed under the common law a course which every one approves because the first object of the act of attainder was to bring him to fair trial whether mr randolph was right in this information to me or when in the debate with mr henry he represents this atrocious offender as sentenced and executed under the act of attainder let the record of the case decide without being confronted with his accusers and witnesses without the privilege of calling for evidence in his behalf he was sentenced to death and afterwards actually executed i appeal to the universe to produce one single instance from the first establishment of government in this state to the present day where in a trial at bar a criminal has been refused confrontation with his accusers and witnesses or denied the privilege of calling for evidence in his behalf had it been done in this case i would have asked of the attorneygeneral why he proposed or permitted it but without having seen the record i will venture on the character of our courts to deny that it was done but if mr randolph meant only that philips had not these advantages on the passage of the bill of attainder how idle to charge the legislature with omitting to confront the culprit with his witnesses when he was standing out in arms and in defiance of their authority and their sentence was to take effect only on his own refusal to come in and be confronted we must either therefore consider this as a mere hyperbolism of imagination in the heat of debate or what i should rather believe a defective statement by the reporter of mr randolphs argument i suspect this last the rather because this point in the charge of mr randolph is equally omitted in the defence of mr henry this gentleman must have known that philips was tried and executed under the common law and yet according to his report he rests his defence on a justification of the attainder only but all who knew mr henry know that when at ease in argument he was sometimes careless not giving himself the trouble of ransacking either his memory or imagination for all the topics of his subject or his audience that of hearing them no man on earth knew better when he had said enough for his hearers mr randolph charges us with having read the bill three times in the same day i do not remember the fact nor whether this was enforced on us by the urgency of the ravages of philips or of the time at which the bill was introduced i have some idea it was at or near the close of the session the journals which i have not will ascertain the fact after the particular strictures i will proceed to propose  st that the word substantially page    l   be changed for which has been charged with subjoining a note of reference   tuckers blackst append     debates of virginia convention   that the whole of the quotations from tucker randolph and henry be struck out and instead of the text beginning page    l    with the words bills of attainder c to the words so often merited page    l   be inserted the following towit this was passed on the following occasion a certain joshua philips laborer of the parish of lynhaven in the county of princess anne a man of daring and ferocious disposition associating with other individuals of a similar cast spread terror and desolation through the lower country committing murders burning houses wasting farms and perpetrating other enormities at the bare mention of which humanity shudders every effort to apprehend him proved abortive strong in the number of his ruffian associates or where force would have failed resorting to stratagem and ambush striking the deadly blow or applying the fatal torch at the midnight hour and in those places which their insulated situation left almost unprotected he retired with impunity to his secret haunts reeking with blood and loaded with plunder so far the text of mr girardin is preserved the inhabitants of the counties which were the theatre of his crimes never secure a moment by day or by night in their fields or their beds sent representations of their distresses to the governor claiming the public protection he consulted with some members of the legislature then sitting on the best method of proceeding against the atrocious offender too powerful to be arrested by the sheriff and his posse comitatus it was not doubted but an armed force might be sent to hunt and destroy him and his accomplices in their morasses and fastness wherever found but the proceeding concluded to be most consonant with the forms and principles of our government was that the legislature should pass an act giving him a reasonable but limited day to surrender himself to justice and to submit to a trial by his peers according to the laws of the land to consider a refusal as a confession of guilt and divesting him as an outlaw of the character of citizen to pass on him the sentence prescribed by the law and the public officer being defied to make every one his deputy and especially those whose safety hourly depended on his destruction the case was laid before the legislature the proofs were ample his outrages as notorious as those of the public enemy and well known to the members of both houses from those counties no one pretended then that the perpetrator of crimes who could successfully resist the officers of justice should be protected in the continuance of them by the privileges of his citizenship and that baffling ordinary process nothing extraordinary could be rightfully adopted to protect the citizens against him no one doubted that society had a right to erase from the role of its members any one who rendered his own existence inconsistent with theirs to withdraw from him the protection of their laws and to remove him from among them by exile or even by death if necessary an enemy in lawful war putting to death in cold blood the prisoner he has taken authorizes retaliation which would be inflicted with peculiar justice on the individual guilty of the deed were it to happen that he should be taken and could the murders and robberies of a pirate or outlaw entitle him to more tenderness they passed the law therefore and without opposition he did not come in before the day prescribed continued his lawless outrages was afterwards taken in arms but delivered over to the ordinary justice of the county the attorneygeneral for the commonwealth the immediate agent of the government waiving all appeal to the act of attainder indicted him at the common law as a murderer and robber he was arraigned on that indictment in the usual forms before a jury of his vicinage and no use whatever made of the act of attainder in any part of the proceedings he pleaded that he was a british subject authorized to bear arms by a commission from lord dunmore that he was therefore a mere prisoner of war and under the protection of the law of nations the court being of opinion that a commission from an enemy could not protect a citizen in deeds of murder and robbery overruled his plea he was found guilty by his jury sentenced by the court and executed by the ordinary officer of justice and all according to the forms and rules of the common law i recommend an examination of the records for ascertaining the facts of this case for although my memory assures me of the leading ones i am not so certain in my recollection of the details i am not sure of the character of the particular crimes committed by philips or charged in his indictment whether his plea of alien enemy was formally put in and overruled what were the specific provisions of the act of attainder the urgency which caused it to be read three times in one day if the fact were c c

heretofore capital and now enclose it to you with a request that you will be so good as scrupulously to examine and correct it that it may be presented to our committee with as few defects as possible in its style i have aimed at accuracy brevity and simplicity preserving however the very words of the established law wherever their meaning had been sanctioned by judicial decisions or rendered technical by usage the same matter if couched in the modern statutory language with all its tautologies redundancies and circumlocutions would have spread itself over many pages and been unintelligible to those whom it most concerns indeed i wished to exhibit a sample of reformation in the barbarous style into which modern statutes have degenerated from their ancient simplicity and i must pray you to be as watchful over what i have not said as what is said for the omissions of this bill have all their positive meaning i have thought it better to drop in silence the laws we mean to discontinue and let them be swept away by the general negative words of this than to detail them in clauses of express repeal by the side of the text i have written the notes i made as i went along for the benefit of my own memory they may serve to draw your attention to questions to which the expressions or the omissions of the text may give rise the extracts from the anglosaxon laws the sources of the common law i wrote in their original for my own satisfaction but i have added latin or liberal english translations from the time of canute to that of the magna charta you know the text of our statutes is preserved to us in latin only and some old french i have strictly observed the scale of punishments settled by the committee without being entirely satisfied with it the lex talionis although a restitution of the common law to the simplicity of which we have generally found it so advantageous to return will be revolting to the humanized feelings of modern times an eye for an eye and a hand for a hand will exhibit spectacles in execution whose moral effect would be questionable and even the membrum pro membro of bracton or the punishment of the offending member although long authorized by our law for the same offence in a slave has you know been not long since repealed in conformity with public sentiment this needs reconsideration the saxon character in which a part

the death of a bastard child is made murder in justification of this it is said that shame is a feeling which operates so strongly on the mind as frequently to induce the mother of such a child to murder it in order to conceal her disgrace the act of concealment therefore proves she was influenced by shame and that influence produces a presumption that she murdered the child the effect of this law then is to make what in its nature is only presumptive evidence of a murder conclusive of that fact to this i answer   so many children die before or soon after birth that to presume all those murdered who are found dead is a presumption which will lead us oftener wrong than right and consequently would shed more blood than it would save   if the child were born dead the mother would naturally choose rather to conceal it in hopes of still keeping a good character in the neighborhood so that the act of concealment is far from proving the guilt of murder on the mother   if shame be a powerful affection of the mind is not parental love also is it not the strongest affection known is it not greater than even that of selfpreservation while we draw presumptions from shame one affection of the mind against the life of the prisoner should we not give some weight to presumptions from parental love an affection at least as strong in favor of life if concealment of the fact is a presumptive evidence of murder so strong as to overbalance all other evidence that may possibly be produced to take away the presumption why not trust the force of this incontestable presumption to the jury who are in a regular course to hear presumptive as well as positive testimony if the presumption arising from the act of concealment may be destroyed by proof positive of circumstantial to the contrary why should the legislature preclude that contrary proof objection the crime is difficult to prove being usually committed in secret answer but circumstantial proof will do for example marks of violence the behavior countenance c of the prisoner c and if conclusive proof be difficult to be obtained shall we therefore fasten irremovably upon equivocal proof can we change the nature of what is contestable and make it incontestable can we make that conclusive which god and nature have made inconclusive solon made no law against parricide supposing it impossible that any one could be guilty of it and the persians from the same opinion adjudged all who killed their reputed parents to be bastards and although parental be yet stronger than filial affection we admit saticide proved
