the deaf lover  price one shilling  the deaf lover a farce in two acts as performed at the theater royal covent garden  written by f pilon  london printed for j bowen corner of beaufort buildings in the strand  m dcc lxxx  advertisement the following little piece meeting with uncommon success after having been withdrawn from the stage it may be expected that the author will say something by way of apology for the scene which in its former state was deemed exceptionable it was almost a literal translation from the poulet a dramatic proverb and pronounced by men of unquestionable judgment an excellent situation but nothing is so difficult to decide on with certainty as the effect any incident will have in representation much as was thought of the poulet in the closet it was much disliked on the stage and the piece consequently withdrawn for alteration fortunately for the author he has succeeded in his second attempt to please and the farce is once more in possession of the stage  prologue written by the author and spoken by mr lee jews statesmen and poets often one fortune find this court being discontent our bard resigned that is to say resigned as courtiers mean he was turned out but would come in again on one good point he is bent a reformation and bade me tell this grand association he now has made a total alteration m stakingly he built on gallic ground but
