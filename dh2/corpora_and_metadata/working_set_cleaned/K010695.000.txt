and assisted by reason  it is common in some degree to all men and is an improveable faculty  it derives its improvement from exercise and from the application of reason and good sense to the objects of taste  delicacy and correctness are the characters of taste in its most perfect state  the general sense and feelings of mankind form the standard of taste    criticism is the application of improved taste to the several fine arts  the rules of criticism are founded on experience or on the observation of such beauties as give the highest and most general pleasure to mankind    genius is a higher power of the mind than taste taste feels and judges genius invents and executes  genius is more limited in its sphere than taste genius may in some cases be strong where taste is incorrect    the pleasures of taste arise from various sources chiefly from grandeur and from beauty    the sensation of grandeur or sublimity is produced either by the view of certain external objects or by the description of them    in external objects grandeur arises from vastness or amplitude from loudness of sounds from the violence of the elements in general from all appearances of extraordinary force and might  the awful assists the impression of the grand or sublime darkness solitude and silence promote it supernatural scenes are always sublime  the moral sublime arises from sentiments of uncommon magnanimity or heroism    the description of grand or sublime objects in their proper colors or the representation of sublime sentiments constitutes sublime writing this term has been often used in too loose a sense  simplicity as opposed to a profusion of ornament is an essential requisite to sublime writing  conciseness as opposed to superfluous expression is another requisite  the proper selection circumstances is particularly necessary in sublime description one mean or trifling circumstance destroys the emotion which was intended to be raised  what is called a sublime style is commonly a very bad one to be sublime is to express great conceptions in few and plain words  the frigid and the bombast are the two opposites of the sublime    beauty extends to a much greater variety of objects than grandeur  it is ascribed to color to figure to motion to certain moral qualities to the human countenance to fitness and design in works of art to certain kinds of writing    novelty variety imitation harmony wit and humor are also sources of pleasure to taste   0 language possesses the most extensive power of exhibiting the objects which give pleasure to taste  ii   language is the expression of our ideas by certain articulate sounds which are used as the signs of those ideas    language in its early state was aided by expressive tones and gestures pronunciation among the ancients was more vehement than among the moderns  language in its early state was figurative and metaphorical and advanced gradually to simplicity  the arrangement of words in ancient languages followed most commonly the order of the imagination arrangement in modern languages follows the order of the understanding    written characters are of two kinds either representing objects or representing words  pictures hieroglyphics and the chinese characters are of the former kind and were the most ancient method of writing  alphabetical characters are of the latter kind and were an improvement on the ancient method  written language is more extensive and permanent than speech spoken language has more force and energy than writing    the parts of language or speech may be divided into substantives attributives and connectives    substantives are general names of objects and are particularised by the article  the most common affections of substantives are number and gender  varieties in the use of gender occur in different languages the english tongue possesses a considerable advantage in this respect  declension or cases of substantives express relations which objects bear to one another  the ancient tongues employed declension more than the modern    attributives express the attribute quality or action of some substance  the adjective is the simplest form of attributive words the verb the most complex  every verb expresses an attribute an affirmation and time  conjugation is the manner of expressing the diversity of circumstances included in the verb by a variation of syllables in the word conjugation is more regular and complete in ancient than in modern languages    connectives join words and sentences together and express the relations connections and dependencies of objects    the english language is a derived and compounded language  it is irregular in its structure  it is a copious and expressive language especially on the graver subjects  it is flexible or pssesses a considerable power of accommodation to different styles and manners  it is not unharmonious  iii   style is the peculiar manner in which different men employ language for expressing their conceptions    perspicuity is the first virtue of style  perspicuity in the choice of words requires purity propriety and precision  purity is the use of such words and phrasses as belong to the idiom of the language which we employ  propriety is the selection of such words belonging to the language as the most authorized usage has appropriated to the ideas which we mean to express by them  precision is the expression of those ideas which we intend to convey without any foreign or superfluous circumstance added to them  the loose use of words reputed synonymous is one great cause of want of precision  there are few words in any language that are strictly synonymous    a sentence is one complete proposition of enunciation of thought    variety is to be preserved with regard to long and short sentences    in the structure of a sentence the principal things to be studied are clearness unity strength and harmony    clearness consists in such a collocation of the words and members of a sentence as shall mark the relation of the several parts to each other without ambiguity  this requires particular attention to the position of adverbs of interposed circumstances and of relative pronouns and particles    the unity of a sentence requires the principal object not to be changed the sentence not to be crowded with things slightly related to each other parentheses to be seldom interposed and no adjections to be brought in after the natural close of the period    the strength of a sentence arises from such a disposition of the several words and members of it as shall render the impression which the sentence is designed to make most full and complete  this requires all redundant words and members to be rejected particular attention to be given to copulative and relative particles the capital words to be disposed of in the most proper place and to be kept clear from circumstances that would clog them the members of the sentence to be made to grow in their importance the sentence not to be terminated by particles prepositions or inconsiderable words and objects compared or contrasted to be expressed in resembling terms    the harmony of a sentence consists either in agreeable sound being so ordered as to become expressive of the sense  agreeableness of sound depends first on the choice of words and next on the arrangement of them  the greeks and romans for several reasons attended to musical arrangement more than the moderns  musical arrangement is sensible chiefly in the distribution of the members and rests of a period and in the close or cadence of it  monotony is always to be avoided sense is never to be sacrificed to sound  sounds may be rendered expressive of the sense either by adapting it to the general tenor of the discourse or by accomplishing a particular analogy between the sounds the motions and the sensations which are described and the words employed in describing them   0 figures of speech convey our ideas to others in a particular dress and with some circumstance added which is designed to render the idea more strong and vivid  they are a natural mode of language prompted by the imagination and passions  they take their rise partly from the barrenness of language but more from the influence of imagination over the use of language  they serve for the embellishment of style by rendering it more copious more dignified more expressive and more picturesque  all the relations which objects bear to one another may be sources of figures the most copious source of them is the relation of similitude or resemblance     metaphor is the most frequent of all figures it is an abridged comparison and consists in substituting one object in place of another on account of the close resemblance which is supposed betwixt them  metaphors ought to be suited to the strain of the subject they ought to be taken from objects of some dignity they ought to be founded on a resemblance which is clear and not intricate or farfetched the metaphorical and the literal sense must not be confounded metaphors must not be mixed nor crowded nor too far pursued     allegory is of the nature of metaphor and subject to the same rules     hyperbole is the effect of passion and heated imagination which are always prone to exaggerate their objects  passionate hyperboles are more natural and proper than descriptive ones  frequent or strained hyperboles weaken style in place of strengthening it     personification springs from a tendency in human nature to animate all objects when the mind is warmed it is a figure of extensive use  the lowest degree of it consists in ascribing to inanimate beings the qualities of such as have life the next in ascribing to them the actions of living creatures the highest in addressing ourselves to them as such or representing them as speaking to us  in this last degree it is the boldest of all figures of speech and is natural only when the mind is highly elevated or much moved     apostrophe is a direct address to persons who are absent or dead and is much allied to personification     comparison or smile is suggested by imagination not by passion  all comparisons are intended either to explain or to embellish  embellishing comparison should serve to produce a strong impression of the primary object should be founded on some likeness or analogy neither too near and obvious not too faint and remote and trite and beaten subjects of comparison should be avoided     antithesis is founded on the contrast and opposition of two objects  the frequent use of antithesis renders style quaint and disagreeable     interrogation exclamation vision and repetition are figures of the passionate kind and operate by means of sympathy     improper and unsuccessful attempts toward high and passionate figures render a writer ridiculous   0 amplification consists in the skilful employment of several figures particularly of the climax     figurative language does not constitute the principal beauty of composition  figures unless they rise naturally from the subject are blemishes not ornaments  they should not be employed too frequently  they should never be attempted by a writer whose genius does not lead to them     style and thought are intimately connected every mans peculiarity of thought imprints on his style a certain general character which may be denominated his manner     the diffuse and the concise manner possess each their several advantages are proper on different occasions and each are faulty when carried to an extreme     the feeble manner is always faulty and the nervous beautiful but attention to strength alone may lead to a harsh manner     the dry the plain the neat the elegant the florid manner express the several gradations of style with respect to ornament     simplicity of manner denotes an easy and natural style in opposition to stiffness and affectation  a high degree of ornament is consistent with simplicity of manner simplicity is one of the greatest perfections of style     the vehement and bold manner belongs to the higher kinds of oratory     the pert and conceited manner is of all others the worst     style is to be improved by studying to acquire clear ideas on the subjects concerning which we write by the frequent practice of translating composing correcting by attentive perusal of the best authors  servile imitation is to be guarded against  attention to style must not be allowed to detract from a higher attention to thought curam verborum rerum volo esse solicitudinem quinctil  iv   eloquence in general is the art of speaking in such a manner as to attain the end for which we speak    eloquence employed with reference to human action and conduct is the art of persuasion    persuasive eloquence will flourish most in free states where reason and discourse are the instruments by which man acquires power over man    the grecian republics afforded the first and most remarkable field to eloquence  the period of grecian eloquence extended from the time of pericles to the time of alexander the great  the rhetoricians and sophists were the first corrupters of grecian eloquence    demosthenes and cicero    the period of roman eloquence was of short duration and during the middle ages corrupted taste prevailed    in modern times eloquence from a concurrence of causes has not made so distinguished a figure as it did in the ancient republics  ancient eloquence was vehement and pathetick modern eloquence is temperate and cool    popular assemblies the bar and the pulpit form the three principal divisions of public speaking in modern times each of these have their distinct character and spirit    in popular assemblies persuasion ought to be the object and sound argument and reasoning the basis of the discourse  the speaker ought to be in earnest on the side which he espouses one who does not utter his own sentiments is seldom truly eloquent  the matter and subject ought to be premeditated rather than a set speech prepared  the warmth and vehemence which public debate admits are to be subjected to proper restraints  the style ought to be free and easy the delivery determined and firm   0 at the bar conviction is the object and the understanding is chiefly to be addressed  the state of the bar among the greeks and romans allowed more popular eloquence than the bar allows in modern times  profound knowledge of the law and diligent attention to the cause which is to be pleaded are the most essential requisites  purity and neatness of style are to be studied verbosity is to be guarded against distinctness and order are of the highest importance  dignity of character is carefully to be supported     gravity and warmth are the two chief characteristicks of the eloquence of the pulpit  a sermon ought to be a persuasive popular oration  in a sermon unity of subject should be preserved tedious fullness avoided an interesting manner studied the style plain expressive animated  no man can be a good preacher without being an useful one the great end of preaching must in every sermon be kept in view     the parts that compose a regular formal oration are the introduction the division the narration or explication the arguments the pathetick part and the conclusion     the introduction ought to be easy and natural plain but correct modest for most part calm and temperate proportioned to the discourse     the division ought to be clear and simple the partitions should exhaust the subject should not be multiplied unnecessarily should be expressed in the most concise terms     narration ought to be perspicuous probable picturesque explication profound and distinct  arguments of a separate nature must not be blended together they must be so arranged as mutually to support each other they must for most part ascend from the weaker to the stronger they ought to be stated without the appearance of art     the pathetick is confined to no particular part of a discourse and ought not to be introduced by any formal warning  passions are excited not by showing the hearers that they ought to be moved but by setting before them the circumstances which are proper for moving them  the speaker must feel the passion which he endeavors to excite  the language of passion is simple unadorned fervent and broken  an attempt to be pathetick beyond what is proper extinguishes passion     the conclusion or peroration is designed to dismiss the hearers with a strong impression of the subject and requires to be executed with spirit and dignity     pronunciation or delivery is one of the most important parts of eloquence  the first object in delivery is to speak so as to be fully and easily understood the next is to speak with grace and force  in order to be easily and fully understood the voice must be pitched on a proper key pronunciation must not be rapid and hurried it must be distinct and articulate it must be proper and correct in the sound given to words  in order to speak with grace and force the principal things to be attended to are the emphases the pauses the tones and the gestures which belong to discourse  these in public speaking are to be founded on the manner in which nature leads us to express ourselves in animated conversation  an artificial and affected delivery is of all others the worst a manner that is natural is always forcible and persuasive   0 virtue is a qualification essential to an orator  extensive knowledge and learning are requisite joined with the habits of industry  attention to the best models and frequent exercise of composing and of speaking in public are necessary means of improvement  v   the reputation of the ancient classicks is justly established on the approbation which they have received from the general taste of mankind throughout many ages and among many nations  the progress of knowledge has given the moderns an advantage in matters of learning and philosophy  the study of the ancient classicks is highly favorable to good taste in every kind of writing    history is the record of past transactions intended for the improvement of wisdom  fidelity impartiality and accuracy are the fundamental qualities of a historian  unity of object should be preserved as much as possible in historical writing  the most complete information should be given concerning every thing that relates to the subject of the history  historical narration should be perspicuous dignified descriptive and interesting  annals memoirs and lives are the subordinate parts of history    the principal requisite of philosophical writing is to be clear and precise it admits also of elegance and ornament    dialogue writing ought to be formed on real animated conversation and enlivened with a display of characters    epistolary writing ought to be easy natural and lively epistles composed with a view to publication are generally stiff and overlaboured    fictitious history if properly conducted is both an improving and entertaining species of composition    poetry is the language of enlivened imagination formed most commonly into regular numbers  poetry and music were at first always united and are found in the earliest periods of society amongst all nations  the first compositions that were recorded by letters or transmitted by tradition in every country are poetical compositions  the most ancient poetical productions of all countries though rude and artless abound with fire and spirit  the art of versification varies with the genius of different languages    pastoral poetry is founded on the ideas of tranquillity and innocence which are ascribed to rural life  in should display what is agreeable in rural life but conceal what is mean or displeasing  it requires simplicity of thought and excludes all studied refinements  dramatick pastoral is the highest form of this species of poetry    lyrick poetry or the ode derives its peculiar character from its being designed to be sung or to be accompanied with music  hence the enthusiasm fervor abrupt transition and neglect of method which this species of poetry admits of excuses more than any other  obscurity and disorder are to be guarded against as frequent faults in lyrick poetry   0 didactick poetry professes its intention of conveying instruction in a direct manner  it may be carried on either in the form of a regular treatise on some useful subject or in the more familiar style of satire and epistle     descriptive poetry is not confined to any one kind but runs through many different kinds of poetical composition  description is the great test of a poets imagination  description is rendered lively by a proper choice of circumstances  the circumstances selected for description must not be common and trite ones but such as are new striking and convey a strong impression of the object  a concise comprehensive style is more favorable to lively description than a diffuse one  the choice of epithets is of great importance in description     the sacred poetry of the hebrews possesses some characters peculiar to itself  it is formed into periods each of which consists of two correspondent versicles or members  it is remarkably strong concise and figurative in the style  the figures are derived from the natural objects of their own country from the arts and employments of their common life from the rites of their worship and the noted incidents of their history  the poetical composers of the sacred books are distinguished by a difference in their style and manner     an epick poem is the recital of some great enterprise in a poetical form  the end of epick poetry is to excite admiration of heroic actions and characters  the epick action must be one must be great must be interesting  an episode is a lesser action or incident subordinate to the principal one and connected with it  the subjects of epick poetry ought not to be of a recent date  the mavelous or machinery is not essential to the constitution of an epick poem but forms a proper ornament of it  an epick poem requires more strength and majesty in the composition than any other species of poetry     homer and virgil  simplicity and fire are the characterristicks of homer elegance and tenderness of virgil     lucans pharsalia tassos jerusalem camoenss lusiad fenelons telemachus voltaires henriade miltons paradise lost     tragedy is an imitation of the manners and actions of men placed in those interesting situations which inspire pity or terror  the end of tragedy is to improve virtuous sensibility  it is essential to tragedy that the natural and the probable should reign in it  for this end the conduct of the plot and the due connection of the several parts must be attended to with care  the unity of action is more important and necessary than the unities either of time or of place  mixed characters are the most proper to be represented in tragedy exhibiting the distresses which are brought upon men in consequence of their frailties and passions  the natural language of passion is very different from the description of passion  the style and versification of tragedy ought to be free easy and varied     the greek theater  the french theater  the english theater     comedy is a satirical exhibition of the improprieties and follies of mankind  its end ought to be to render vice and folly ridiculous  the subjects of comedy should be taken from living manners and the present times  comedies of character are preferable to comedies of mere intrigue  ancient comedy french comedy english comedy serious comedy  though the design of comedy be useful and laudable yet the execution is often licentious and immoral it is grossly so among the english writers  finis
