a naturalists calendar with observations in various branches of natural history  extracted from the papers of the late rev gilbert white m a of selborne hampshire senior fellow of oriel college oxford  never before published  london printed for b and j white horaces head fleet street       advertisement the reverend mr white so agreeably known to the public by his natural history of selborne left behind him a series of yearly books containing his diurnal observations on the occurrences in the various walks of rural nature from the year      to the time of his death in      from these annals he had already extracted all the matter comprised in the work above mentioned down to the middle of      but several curious facts in the preceding numbers had not been thus employed and all the subsequent ones remained untouched it was thought a mark of respect due to his memory and to the reputation he had acquired as a faithful and elegant observer not to consign these relics to neglect the manuscripts were accordingly put into my hands for the purpose of selecting from them what might seem worthy of laying before the public the present small publication is the fruit of my research with no small pains i collected the materials of it dispersed through the records of so many years and gave them such an arrangement as i thought would present them in the most agreeable and useful manner to the lovers of natural knowledge  j aikin london jan        the naturalists calendar the naturalists calendar the mode in which the following rural calendar of the year has been composed was to copy out from the journals all the circumstances thought worthy of noting with the several dates of their recurrence and to preserve the earliest and latest of these dates so that the calendar exhibits the extreme range of variation in the first occurrence of all the phenomena mentioned to many of them only one date is annexed only one observation having been entered this is particularly the case with respect to the flowering of plants with which the book of      alone was copiously filled and it is to be noted that this was rather a backward year  of the abbreviations used fl

to watered meadows for food the latter wades up to its belly in pursuit of the pupae of insects and runs along upon the floating grass and weeds many gnats are on the snow near the water these support the birds in part  birds are much influenced in their choice of food by color for though white currants are a much sweeter fruit than red yet they seldom touch the former till they have devoured every bunch of the latter  redstarts flycatchers and blackcaps arrive early in april if these little delicate beings are birds of passage as we have reason to suppose they are because they are never seen in winter how could they feeble as they seem bear up against such storms of snow and rain and make their way through such meteorous turbulencies as one should suppose would embarrass and retard the most hardy and resolute of the winged nation yet they keep their appointed times and seasons and in spite of frosts and winds return to their stations periodically as if they had met with nothing to obstruct them the withdrawing and appearance of the short winged summer birds is a very puzzling circumstance in natural history  when the boys bring me wasps nests my bantam fowls fare deliciously and when the combs are pulled to pieces devour the young wasps in their maggot state with the highest glee and delight any insecteating bird would do the same and therefore i have often wondered that the accurate mr ray should call one species of buzzard buteo apivorus sive vespivorus or the honey buzzard because some combs of wasps happened to be found in one of their nests the combs were conveyed thither doubtless for the sake of the maggots or nymphs and not for their honey since none is to be found in the combs of wasps birds of prey occasionally feed on insects thus have i seen a tame kite picking up the female ants full of eggs with much satisfaction  rooks rooks are continually fighting and pulling each others nests to pieces these proceedings are inconsistent with living in such close community and yet if a pair offers to build on a single tree the nest is plundered and demolished at once some rooks roost on their nest trees the twigs which the rooks drop in building supply the poor with brushwood to light their fires some unhappy pairs are not permitted to finish any nest till the rest have completed their building as soon as they get a few sticks together a party comes and demolishes the whole as soon as rooks have finished their nests and before they lay the cocks begin to feed the hens who receive their bounty with a fondling tremulous voice and fluttering wings and all the little blandishments that are expressed by the young while in a helpless state this gallant deportment of the males is continued through the whole season of incubation these birds do not copulate on trees nor in their nests but on the ground in open fields  thrushes thrushes during long droughts are of great service in hunting out shell snails which they pull in pieces for their young and are thereby very serviceable in gardens  missel thrushes do not destroy the fruit in gardens like the other species of turdi but feed on the berries of misseltoe and in the spring on ivy berries which then begin to ripen in the summer when their young become fledge they leave neighbourhoods and retire to sheep walks and wild commons  the magpies when they have young destroy the broods of missel thrushes though the dams are fierce birds and fight boldly in defense of their nests it is probably to avoid such insults that this species of thrush though wild at other times delights to build near houses and in frequented walks and gardens  poultry many creatures are endowed with a ready discernment to see what will turn to their own advantage and emolument and often discover more fagacity than could be expected thus my neighbors poultry watch for wagons loaded with wheat and running after them pick up a number of grains which are shaken from the sheaves by the agitation of the carriages thus when my brother used to take down his gun to shoot sparrows his cats would run out before him to be ready to catch up the birds as they fell  the earnest and early propensity of the gallinae to roost on high is very observable and discovers a strong dread impressed on their spirits respecting vermin that may annoy them on the ground during the hours of darkness hence poultry if left to themselves and not housed will perch the winter through on yewtrees and firtrees and turkies and guinea fowls heavy as they are get up into apple trees pheasants also in woods sleep on trees to avoid foxes while pea fowls climb to the tops of the highest trees round their owners house for security let the weather be ever so cold or blowing partridges it is true roost on the ground not having the faculty of perching but then the same fear prevails in their minds for through apprehensions from polecats and stoats they never trust themselves to coverts but nestle together in the midst of large fields far removed from hedges and coppices which they love to haunt in the day and where at that season they can sculk more secure from the ravages of rapacious birds  as to ducks and geese their awkward splay web feet forbid them to settle on trees they therefore in the hours of darkness and danger betake themselves to their own element the water where amidst large lakes and pools like ships riding at anchor they float the whole night long in peace and security  hen partridge a hen partridge came out of a ditch and ran along shivering with her wings and crying out as if wounded and unable to get from us while the dam acted this distress the boy who attended me saw her brood that was small and unable to fly run for shelter into an old foxearth under the bank so wonderful a power is instinct  a hybrid pheasant lord stawell sent me from the great lodge in the holt a curious bird for my inspection it was found by the spaniels of one of his keepers in a coppice and shot on the wing the shape and air and habit of the bird and the scarlet ring round the eyes agreed well with the appearance of a cock pheasant but then the head and neck and breast and belly were of a glossy black and though it weighed   lb   oz hen pheasants usually weigh only   lb   oz the weight of a large full grown cock pheasant yet there were no signs of any spurs on the legs as is usual with all grown cock pheasants who have long ones the legs and feet were naked of feathers and therefore it could be nothing of the grous kind in the tail were no long bending feathers such as cock pheasants usually have and are characteristic of the sex the tail was much shorter than the tail of a hen pheasant and blunt and square at the end the back wingfeathers and tail were all of a pale russet curiously streaked somewhat like the upper parts of a hen partridge i returned it with my verdict that it was probably a spurious or hybrid hen bird bred between a cock pheasant and some domestic fowl when i came to talk with the keeper who brought it he told me that some peahens had been known last summer to haunt the coppices and coverts where this mule was found  mr elmer of farnham the famous game painter was employed to take an exact copy of this curious bird  n b it ought to be mentioned that some good judges have imagined this bird to have been a stray grous or blackcock it is however to be observed that mr w remarks that its legs and feet were naked whereas those of the grous are feathered to the toes  land rail a man brought me a landrail or dakerhen a bird so rare in this district that we seldom see more than one or two in a season and those only in autumn this is deemed a bird of passage by all the writers yet from its formation seems to be poorly qualified for migration for its wings are short and placed so forward and out of the center of gravity that it flies in a very heavy and embarrassed manner with its legs hanging down and can hardly be sprung a second time as it runs very fast and seems to depend more on the swiftness of its feet than on its flying  when we came to draw it we found the entrails so soft and tender that in appearance they might have been dressed like the ropes of a woodcock the craw or crop was small and lank containing a mucus the gizzard thick and strong and filled with small shell snails some whole and many ground to pieces through the attrition which is occasioned by the muscular force and motion of that intestine we saw no gravels among the food perhaps the shell snails might perform the functions of gravels or pebbles and might grind one another landrails used to abound formerly i remember in the low wet bean fields of christianmalford in north wilts and in the meadows near paradise gardens at oxford where i have often heard them cry crex crex the bird mentioned above weighed   oz was fat and tender and in flavor like the flesh of a woodcock the liver was very large and delicate  food of the ring dove one of my neighbors shot a ringdove on an evening as it was returning from feed and going to roost when his wife had picked and drawn it she found its craw stuffed with the most nice and tender tops of turnips these she washed and boiled and so sat down to a choice and delicate plate of greens culled and provided in this extraordinary manner  hence we may see that graminivorous birds when grain fails can subsist on the leaves of vegetables there is reason to suppose that they would not long be healthy without for turkies though corn fed delight in a variety of plants such as cabbage lettuce endive etc and poultry pick much grass while geese live for months together on commons by grazing alone  naught is useless made on the barren heath the shepherd tends his flock that daily crop their verdant dinner from the mossy turf sufficient after them the cackling goose closegrazer finds wherewith to ease her want philipss cider hen harrier mr white of newton sprung a pheasant in a wheat stubble and shot at it when notwithstanding the report of the gun it was immediately pursued by the blue hawk known by the name of the henharrier but escaped into some covert he then sprung a second and a third in the same field that got away in the same manner the hawk hovering round him all the while that he was beating the field conscious no doubt of the game that lurked in the stubble hence we may conclude that this bird of prey was rendered very daring and bold by hunger and that hawks cannot always seize their game when they please we may farther observe that they cannot pounce their quarry on the ground where it might be able to make a stout resistance since so large a fowl as a pheasant could not but be visible to the piercing eye of a hawk when hovering over a field hence that propensity of cowring and squatting till they are almost trod on which no doubt was intended as a mode of security though long rendered destructive to the whole race of gallinae by the invention of nets and guns  great speckled diver or loon as one of my neighbors was traversing wolmer forest from bramshot across the moors he found a large uncommon bird fluttering in the heath but not wounded which he brought home alive on examination it proved to be colymbus glacialis linn the great speckled diver or loon which is most excellently described in willughbys ornithology  every part and proportion of this bird is so incomparably adapted to its mode of life that in no instance do we see the wisdom of god in the creation to more advantage the head is sharp and smaller than the part of the neck adjoining in order that it may pierce the water the wings are placed forward and out of the center of gravity for a purpose which shall be noticed hereafter the thighs quite at the podex in order to facilitate diving and the legs are flat and as sharp backwards almost as the edge of a knife that in striking they may easily cut the water while the feet are palmated and broad for swimming yet so folded up when advanced forward to take a fresh stroke as to be full as narrow as the shank the two exterior toes of the feet are longest the nails flat and broad resembling the human which give strength and increase the power of swimming the foot when expanded is not at right angles to the leg or body of the bird but the exterior part inclining toward the head forms an acute angle with the body the intention being not to give motion in the line of the legs themselves but by the combined impulse of both in an intermediate line the line of the body  most people know that have observed at all that the swimming of birds is nothing more than a walking in the water where one foot succeeds the other as on the land yet no one as far as i am aware has remarked that diving fowls while under water impel and row themselves forward by a motion of their wings as well as by the impulse of their feet but such is really the case as any person may easily be convinced who will observe ducks when hunted by dogs in a clear pond nor do i know that any one has given a reason why the wings of diving fowls are placed so forward doubtless not for the purpose of promoting their speed in flying since that position certainly impedes it but probably for the increase of their motion under water by the use of four oars instead of two yet were the wings and feet nearer together as in land birds they would when in action rather hinder than assist one another  this colymbus was of considerable bulk weighing only three drachms short of three pounds avoirdupois it measured in length from the bill to the tail which was very short two feet and to the extremities of the toes four inches more and the breadth of the wings expanded was    inches a person attempted to eat the body but found it very strong and rancid as is the flesh of all birds living on fish diverse or loons though bred in the most northerly parts of europe yet are seen with us in very severe winters and on the thames are called sprat loons because they prey much on that sort of fish  the legs of the colymbi and mergi are placed so very backward and so out of all center of gravity that these birds cannot walk at all they are called by linnaeus compedes because they move on the ground as if shackled or fettered  stone curlew on the   th of february      stone curlews were heard to pipe and on march  st after it was dark some were passing over the village as might be perceived by their quick short note which they use in their nocturnal excursions by way of watchword that they may not stray and lose their companions  thus we see that retire whithersoever they may in the winter they return again early in the spring and are as it now appears the first summer birds that come back perhaps the mildness of the season may have quickened the emigration of the curlews this year  they spend the day in high elevated fields and sheepwalks but seem to descend in the night to streams and meadows perhaps for water which their upland haunts do not afford them  the smallest willow wren the smallest uncrested or willow wren or chiff chaf is the next early summer bird which we have remarked it utters two sharp piercing notes so loud in hollow woods as to occasion an echo and is usually first heard about the  0th of march  fern owl or goat sucker the country people have a notion that the fern owl or churn owl or evejarr which they also call a puckeridge is very injurious to weanling calves by inflicting as it strikes at them the fatal distemper known to cowleeches by the name of puckeridge thus does this harmless illfated bird fall under a double imputation which it by no means deserves in italy of sucking the teats of goats whence it is called caprimulgus and with us of communicating a deadly disorder to cattle but the truth of the matter is the malady above mentioned is occasioned by the oestrus bovis a dipterous insect which lays its eggs along the chines of kine where the maggots when hatched eat their way through the hide of the beast into the flesh and grow to a very large size i have just talked with a man who says he has more than once stripped calves who have died of the puckeridge that the ail or complaint lay along the chine where the flesh was much swelled and filled with purulent matter once i myself saw a large rough maggot of this sort squeezed out of the back of a cow  these maggots in essex are called wornils  the least observation and attention would convince men that these birds neither injure the goatherd nor the grazier but are perfectly harmless and subsist alone being night birds on night insects such as scarabaei and phalaenae and through the month of july mostly on the scarabaeus solstitialis which in many districts abounds at that season those that we have opened have always had their craws stuffed with large nightmoths and their eggs and pieces of chaffers nor does it anywise appear how they can weak and unarmed as they seem inflict any harm upon kine unless they possess the powers of animal magnetism and can affect them by fluttering over them  a fern owl this evening august    showed off in a very unusual and entertaining manner by hawking round and round the circumference of my great spreading oak for twenty times following keeping mostly close to the grass but occasionally glancing up amidst the boughs of the tree this amusing bird was then in pursuit of a brood of some particular phalaena belonging to the oak of which there are several sorts and exhibited on the occasion a command of wing superior i think to that of the swallow itself  when a person approaches the haunt of fernowls in an evening they continue flying round the head of the obtruder and by striking their wings together above their backs in the manner that the pigeons called smiters are known to do make a smart snap perhaps at that time they are jealous for their young and this noise and gesture are intended by way of menace  fernowls have attachment to oaks no doubt on account of food for the next evening we saw one again several times among the boughs of the same tree but it did not skim round its stem over the grass as on the evening before in may these birds find the scarabaeus melolontha on the oak and the scarabaeus solstitialis at midsummer these peculiar birds can only be watched and observed for two hours in the twentyfour and then in a dubious twilight an hour after sunset and an hour before sunrise  on this day july         a woman brought me two eggs of a fernowl or evejarr which she found on the verge of the hanger to the left of the hermitage under a beechen shrub this person who lives just at the foot of the hanger seems well acquainted with these nocturnal swallows and says she has often found their eggs near that place and that they lay only two at a time on the bare ground the eggs were oblong dusky and streaked somewhat in the manner of the plumage of the parent bird and were equal in size at each end the dam was sitting on the eggs when found which contained the rudiments of young and would have been hatched perhaps in a week from hence we may see the time of their breeding which corresponds pretty well with that of the swift as does also the period of their arrival each species is usually seen about the beginning of may each breeds but once in a summer each lays only two eggs  july      0 the woman who brought me two fernowls eggs last year on july    on this day produced me two more one of which had been laid this morning as appears plainly because there was only one in the nest the evening before they were found as last july on the verge of the down above the hermitage under a beechen shrub on the naked ground  last year those eggs were full of young and just ready to be hatched  these circumstances point out the exact time when these curious nocturnal migratory birds lay their eggs and hatch their young  fernowls like snipes stone curlews and some other birds make no nest birds that build on the ground do not make much of nests  sand martins march         a gentleman who was this week on a visit at waverley took the opportunity of examining some of the holes in the sand banks with which that district abounds as these are undoubtedly bored by bankmartins and are the places where they avowedly breed he was in hopes they might have slept there also and that he might have surprised them just as they were awaking from their winter slumbers when he had dug for some time he found the holes were horizontal and serpentine as i had observed before and that the nests were deposited at the inner end and had been occupied by broods in former summers but no torpid birds were to be found he opened and examined about a dozen holes another gentleman made the same search many years ago with as little success  these holes were in depth about two feet  march       0 a single bank or sand martin was seen hovering and playing round the sand pit at short heath where in the summer they abound  april        a sober hind assures us that this day on wishhanger common between hedleigh and frinsham he saw several bankmartins playing in and out and hanging before some nest holes in a sand hill where these birds usually nestle  this incident confirms my suspicions that this species of hirundo is to be seen first of any and gives great reason to suppose that they do not leave their wild haunts at all but are secreted amidst the clefts and caverns of those abrupt cliffs where they usually spend their summers  the late severe weather considered it is not very probable that these birds should have migrated so early from a tropical region through all these cutting winds and pinching frosts but it is easy to suppose that they may like bats and flies have been awakened by the influence of the sun amidst their secret latebrae where they have spent the uncomfortable foodless months in a torpid state and the profoundest of slumbers  there is a large pond at wishhanger which induces these sandmartins to frequent that district for i have ever remarked that they haunt near great waters either rivers or lakes  swallows congregating and disappearance of during the severe winds that often prevail late in the spring it is not easy to say how the hirundines subsist for they withdraw themselves and are hardly ever seen nor do any insects appear for their support that they can retire to rest and sleep away these uncomfortable periods as the bats do is a matter rather to be suspected than proved or do they not rather spend their time in deep and sheltered vales near waters where insects are more likely to be found certain it is that hardly any individuals of this genus have at such times been seen for several days together  september         the congregating flocks of hirundines on the church and tower are very beautiful and amusing when they fly off all together from the roof on any alarm they quite swarm in the air but they soon settle in heaps and preening their feathers and lifting up their wings to admit the sun seem highly to enjoy the warm situation thus they spend the heat of the day preparing for their emigration and as it were consulting when and where they are to go the flight about the church seems to consist chiefly of housemartins about  00 in number but there are other places of rendezvous about the village frequented at the same time  it is remarkable that though most of them sit on the battlements and roof yet many hang or cling for some time by their claws against the surface of the walls in a manner not practiced by them at any other time of their remaining with us  the swallows seem to delight more in holding their assemblies on trees  nov        two swallows were seen this morning at newton vicarage house hovering and settling on the roofs and outbuildings none have been observed at selborne since october    it is very remarkable that after the hirundines have disappeared for some weeks a few are occasionally seen again sometimes in the first week in november and that only for one day do they not withdraw and slumber in some hiding place during the interval for we cannot suppose they had migrated to warmer climes and so returned again for one day is it not more probable that they are awakened from sleep and like the bats are come forth to collect a little food bats appear at all seasons through the autumn and spring months when the thermometer is at  0 because then phalaenae moths are stirring  these swallows looked like young ones  wagtails while the cows are feeding in moist low pastures broods of wagtails white and gray run round them close up to their noses and under their very bellies availing themselves of the flies that settle on their legs and probably finding worms and larvae that are roused by the trampling of their feet nature is such an oeconomist that the most incongruous animals can avail themselves of each other interest makes strange friendships  wryneck these birds appear on the grassplots and walks they walk a little as well as hop and thrust their bills into the turf in quest i conclude of ants which are their food while they hold their bills in the grass they draw out their prey with their tongues which are so long as to be coiled round their heads  grosbeak mr b shot a cock grosbeak which he had observed to haunt his garden for more than a fortnight i began to accuse this bird of making sad havoc among the buds of the cherries gooseberries and wall fruit of all the neighboring orchards upon opening its crop or craw no buds were to be seen but a mass of kernels of the stones of fruits mr b observed that this bird frequented the spot where plum trees grow and that he had seen it with somewhat hard in its mouth which it broke with difficulty these were the stones of damsons the latin ornithologists call this bird coccothraustes i e berrybreaker because with its large horny beak it cracks and breaks the shells of stone fruits for the sake of the seed or kernel birds of this sort are rarely seen in england and only in winter  observations on quadrupeds sheep the sheep on the downs this winter      are very ragged and their coats much torn the shepherds say they tear their fleeces with their own mouths and horns and that they are always in that way in mild wet winters being teased and tickled with a kind of lice  after ewes and lambs are shorn there is great confusion and bleating neither the dams nor the young being able to distinguish one another as before this embarrassment seems not so much to arise from the loss of the fleece which may occasion an alteration in their appearance as from the defect of that notus odor discriminating each individual personally which also is confounded by the strong scent of the pitch and tar wherewith they are newly marked for the brute creation recognize each other more from the smell than the sight and in matters of identity and diversity appeal much more to their noses than to their eyes  after sheep have been washed there is the same confusion from the reason given above  rabbits rabbits make incomparably the finest turf for they not only bite closer than larger quadrupeds but they allow no bents to rise hence warrens produce much the most delicate turf for gardens sheep never touch the stalks of grasses  cat and squirrels a boy has taken three little young squirrels in their nest or drey as it is called in these parts these small creatures he put under the care of a cat who had lately lost her kittens and finds that she nurses and suckles them with the same assiduity and affection as if they were her own offspring this circumstance corroborates my suspicion that the mention of exposed and deserted children being nurtured by female beasts of prey who had lost their young may not be so improbable an incident as many have supposed and therefore may be a justification of those authors who have gravely mentioned what some have deemed to be a wild and improbable story  so many people went to see the little squirrels suckled by a cat that the foster mother became jealous of her charge and in pain for their safety and therefore hid them over the ceiling where one died this circumstance shows her affection for these foundlings and that she supposes the squirrels to be her own young thus hens when they have hatched ducklings are equally attached to them as if they were their own chickens  horse an old hunting mare which ran on the common being taken very ill ran down into the village as it were to implore the help of men and died the night following in the street  hounds the kings staghounds came down to alton attended by a huntsman and six yeomen prickers with horns to try for the stag that has haunted hartley wood and its environs for so long a time many hundreds of people horse and foot attended the dogs to see the deer unharboured but though the huntsman drew hartley wood and long coppice and shrubwood and temple hangers and in their way back hartley and wardieham hangers yet no stag could be found  the royal pack accustomed to have the deer turned out before them never drew the coverts with any address and spirit as many people that were present observed and this remark the event has proved to be a true one for as a person was lately pursuing a pheasant that was wingbroken in hartley wood he stumbled upon the stag by accident and ran in upon him as he lay concealed amidst a thick brake of brambles and bushes  observations on insects and vermes insects in general the day and night insects occupy the annuals alternately the papilios muscae and apes are succeeded at the close of the day by phalaenae earwigs woodlice etc in the dusk of the evening when beetles begin to buz partridges begin to call these two circumstances are exactly coincident  ivy is the last flower that supports the hymenopterous and dipterous insects on sunny days quite on to november they swarm on trees covered with this plant and when they disappear probably retire under the shelter of its leaves concealing themselves between its fibers and the trees which it entwines  spiders woodlice lepismae in cupboards and among sugar some empedes gnats flies of several species some phalaenae in hedges earthworms etc are stirring at all times when winters are mild and are of great service to those softbilled birds that never leave us  on every sunny day the winter through clouds of insects usually called gnats i suppose tipulae and empedes appear sporting and dancing over the tops of the evergreen trees in the shrubbery and frisking about as if the business of generation was still going on hence it appears that these diptera which by their sizes appear to be of different species are not subject to a torpid state in the winter as most winged insects are at night and in frosty weather and when it rains and blows they seem to retire into those trees they often are out in a fog  humming in the air there is a natural occurrence to be met with upon the highest part of our down in hot summer days which always amuses me much without giving me any satisfaction with respect to the cause of it and that is a loud audible humming of bees in the air though not one insect is to be seen this sound is to be heard distinctly the whole common through from the moneydells to mr whites avenue gate any person would suppose that a large swarm of bees was in motion and playing about over his head this noise was heard last week on june   th  resounds the living surface of the ground nor undelightful is the ceaseless hum to him who muses  at noon thick in yon stream of light a thousand ways upward and downward thwarting and convolved the quivering nations sport thomsons seasons chaffers cockchaffers seldom abound oftener than once in three or four years when they swarm they deface the trees and hedges whole woods of oaks are stripped bare by them  chaffers are eaten by the turkey the rook and the house sparrow  the scarabaeus solstitialis first appears about june    they are very punctual in their coming out every year they are a small species about half the size of the may chaffer and are known in some parts by the name of the fern chaffer  ptinus pectinicornis those maggots that make wormholes in tables chairs bedposts etc and destroy wooden furniture especially where there is any sap are the larvae of the ptinus pectinicornis this insect it is probable deposits its eggs on the surface and the worms eat their way in  in their holes they turn into their pupae state and so come forth winged in july eating their way through the valances or curtains of a bed or any other furniture that happens to obstruct their passage  they seem to be most inclined to breed in beech hence beech will not make lasting utensils or furniture if their eggs are deposited on the surface frequent rubbings will preserve wooden furniture  blatta orientalis cockroach a neighbor complained to me that her house was overrun with a kind of black beetle or as she expressed herself with a kind of blackbob which swarmed in her kitchen when they get up in a morning before day break  soon after this account i observed an unusual insect in one of my dark chimney closets and find since that in the night they swarm also in my kitchen on examination i soon ascertained the species to be the blatta orientalis of linnaeus and the blatta molendinaria of mouffet the male is winged the female is not but shows somewhat like the rudiments of wings as if in the pupa state  these insects belonged originally to the warmer parts of america and were conveyed from thence by shipping to the east indies and by means of commerce begin to prevail in the more northern parts of europe as russia sweden etc how long they have abounded in england i cannot say but have never observed them in my house till lately  they love warmth and haunt chimneyclosets and the backs of ovens poda says that these and house crickets will not associate together but he is mistaken in that assertion as linnaeus suspected he was they are altogether night insects lucifugae never coming forth till the rooms are dark and still and escaping away nimbly at the approach of a candle their antennae are remarkably long slender and flexile  october    0 after the servants are gone to bed the kitchen hearth swarms with young crickets and young blattae molendinariae of all sizes from the most minute growth to their full proportions they seem to live in a friendly manner together and not to prey the one on the other  august      after the destruction of many thousands of blattae molendinariae we find that at intervals a fresh detachment of old ones arrives and particularly during this hot season for the windows being left open in the evenings the males come flying in at the casements from the neighboring houses which swarm with them how the females that seem to have no perfect wings that they can use can contrive to get from house to house does not so readily appear these like many insects when they find their present abodes overstocked have powers of migrating to fresh quarters since the blattae have been so much kept under the crickets have greatly increased in number  gryllus domest house cricket november after the servants are gone to bed the kitchen hearth swarms with minute crickets not so large as fleas which must have been lately hatched so that these domestic insects cherished by the influence of a constant large fire regard not the season of the year but produce their young at a time when their congeners are either dead or laid up for the winter to pass away the uncomfortable months in the profoundest slumbers and a state of torpidity  when housecrickets are out and running about in a room in the night if surprised by a candle they give two or three shrill notes as it were for a signal to their fellows that they may escape to their crannies and lurking holes to avoid danger  cimex linearis august         cimices lineares are now in high copulation on ponds and pools the females who vastly exceed the males in bulk dart and shoot along on the surface of the water with the males on their backs when a female chooses to be disengaged she rears and jumps and plunges like an unruly colt the lover thus dismounted soon finds a new mate the females as fast as their curiosities are satisfied retire to another part of the lake perhaps to deposit their foetus in quiet hence the sexes are found separate except where generation is going on from the multitude of minute young of all gradations of sizes these insects seem without doubt to be viviparous  phalaena quercus most of our oaks are naked of leaves and even the holt in general having been ravaged by the caterpillars of a small phalaena which is of a pale yellow color these insects though a feeble race yet from their infinite numbers are of wonderful effect being able to destroy the foliage of whole forests and districts at this season they leave their aurelia and issue forth in their flystate swarming and covering the trees and hedges  in a field at greatham i saw a flight of swifts busied in catching their prey near the ground and found they were hawking after these phalaenae the aurelia of this moth is shining and as black as jet and lies wrapped up in a leaf of the tree which is rolled round it and secured at the ends by a web to prevent the maggot from falling out  ephemera cauda biseta may fly june  0      myriads of may flies appear for the first time on the alresford stream the air was crowded with them and the surface of the water covered large trouts sucked them in as they lay struggling on the surface of the stream unable to rise till their wings were dried  this appearance reconciled me in some measure to the wonderful account that scopoli gives of the quantities emerging from the rivers of carniola their motions are very peculiar up and down for many yards almost in a perpendicular line  sphynx ocellata a vast insect appears after it is dusk flying with a humming noise and inserting its tongue into the bloom of the honeysuckle it scarcely settles upon the plants but feeds on the wing in the manner of humming birds  wild be there is a sort of wild be frequenting the gardencampion for the sake of its tomentum which probably it turns to some purpose in the business of nidification it is very pleasant to see with what address it strips off the pubes running from the top to the bottom of a branch and shaving it bare with all the dexterity of a hoopshaver when it has got a vast bundle almost as large as itself it flies away holding it secure between its chin and its fore legs  there is a remarkable hill on the downs near jews in sussex known by the name of mount carburn which overlooks that town and affords a most engaging prospect of all the country round besides several views of the sea on the very summit of this exalted promontory and amidst the trenches of its danish camp there haunts a species of wild be making its nest in the chalky soil when people approach the place these insects begin to be alarmed and with a sharp and hostile sound dash and strike round the heads and faces of intruders i have often been interrupted myself while contemplating the grandeur of the scenery around me and have thought myself in danger of being stung  wasps wasps abound in woody wild districts far from neighbourhoods they feed on flowers and catch flies and caterpillars to carry to their young wasps make their nests with the raspings of sound timber hornets with what they gnaw from decayed these particles of wood are kneaded up with a mixture of saliva from their bodies and molded into combs  when there is no fruit in the gardens wasps eat flies and suck the honey from flowers from ivy blossoms and umbellated plants they carry off also flesh from butchers shambles  oestrus curvicauda this insect lays its nits or eggs on horses legs flanks etc each on a single hair the maggots when hatched do not enter the horses skins but fall to the ground it seems to abound most in moist moorish places though sometimes seen in the uplands  nose fly about the beginning of july a species of fly musca obtains which proves very tormenting to horses trying still to enter their nostrils and ears and actually laying their eggs in the latter of those organs or perhaps in both when these abound horses in woodland districts become very impatient at their work continually tossing their heads and rubbing their noses on each other regardless of the driver so that accidents often ensue in the heat of the day men are often obliged to desist from plowing saddlehorses are also very troublesome at such seasons country people call this insect the nose fly  ichneumon fly i saw lately a small ichneumon fly attack a spider much larger than itself on a grass walk when the spider made any resistance the ichneumon applied her tail to him and stung him with great vehemence so that he soon became dead and motionless the ichneumon then running backward drew her prey very nimbly over the walk into the standing grass this spider would be deposited in some hole where the ichneumon would lay some eggs and as soon as the eggs were hatched the carcass would afford ready food for the maggots  perhaps some eggs might be injected into the body of the spider in the act of stinging some ichneumons deposit their eggs in the aurelia of moths and butterflies  bombylius medius the bombylius medius is much about in march and the beginning of april and soon seems to retire it is an hairy insect like an humblebee but with only two wings and a long straight beak with which it sucks the early flowers the female seems to lay its eggs as it poises on its wings by striking its tail on the ground and against the grass that stands in its way in a quick manner for several times together  muscae  flies in the decline of the year when the mornings and evenings become chilly many species of flies muscae retire into houses and swarm in the windows  at first they are very brisk and alert but as they grow more torpid one cannot help observing that they move with difficulty and are scarce able to lift their legs which seem as if glued to the glass and by degrees many do actually stick on till they die in the place  it has been observed that diverse flies besides their sharp hooked nails have also skinny palms or flaps to their feet whereby they are enabled to stick on glass and other smooth bodies and to walk on ceilings with their backs downward by means of the pressure of the atmosphere on those flaps the weight of which they easily overcome in warm weather when they are brisk and alert but in the decline of the year this resistance becomes too mighty for their diminished strength and we see flies laboring along and lugging their feet in windows as if they stuck fast to the glass and it is with the utmost difficulty they can draw one foot after another and disengage their hollow caps from the slippery surface  upon the same principle that flies stick and support themselves do boys by way of play carry heavy weights by only a piece of wet leather at the end of a string clapped close on the surface of a stone  tipulae or empedes millions of empedes or tipulae come forth at the close of day and swarm to such a degree as to fill the air at this juncture they sport and copulate as it grows more dark they retire all day they hide in the hedges as they rise in a cloud they appear like smoke  i do not ever remember to have seen such swarms except in the fens of the isle of ely they appear most over grass grounds  ants august    every anthill about this time is in a strange hurry and confusion and all the winged ants agitated by some violent impulse are leaving their homes and bent on emigration swarm by myriads in the air to the great emolument of the hirundines which fare luxuriously those that escape the swallows return no more to their nests but looking out for fresh settlements lay a foundation for future colonies all the females at this time are pregnant the males that escape being eaten wander away and die  october   flyingants male and female usually swarm and migrate on hot sunny days in august and september but this day a vast emigration took place in my garden and myriads came forth in appearance from the drain which goes under the fruit wall filling the air and the adjoining trees and shrubs with their numbers the females were full of eggs this late swarming is probably owing to the backward wet season the day following not one flying ant was to be seen  horseants travel home to their nests laden with flies which they have caught and the aureliae of smaller ants which they seize by violence  glow worms by observing two glowworms which were brought from the field to the bank in the garden it appeared to us that these little creatures put out their lamps between eleven and twelve and shine no more for the rest of the night  male glowworms attracted by the light of the candles come into the parlour  earth worms earth worms make their casts most in mild weather about march and april they do not lie torpid in winter but come forth when there is no frost they travel about in rainy nights as appears from their sinuous tracks on the soft muddy soil perhaps in search of food  when earthworms lie out anights on the turf though they extend their bodies a great way they do not quite leave their holes but keep the ends of their tails fixed therein so that on the least alarm they can retire with precipitation under the earth whatever food falls within their reach when thus extended they seem to be content with such as blades of grass straws fallen leaves the ends of which they often draw into their holes even in copulation their hinder parts never quit their holes so that no two except they lie within reach of each others bodies can have any commerce of that kind but as every individual is an hermaphrodite there is no difficulty in meeting with a mate as would be the case were they of different sexes  snails and slugs the shellless snails called slugs are in motion all the winter in mild weather and commit great depredations on garden plants and much injure the green wheat the loss of which is imputed to earth worms while the shelled snail the  does not come forth at all till about april  0th and not only lays itself up pretty early in autumn in places secure from frost but also throws out round the mouth of its shell a thick operculum formed from its own saliva so that it is perfectly secured and corked up as it were from all inclemencies the cause why the slugs are able to endure the cold so much better than shell snails is that their bodies are covered with slime as whales are with blubber  snails copulate about midsummer and soon after deposit their eggs in the mould by running their heads and bodies under ground hence the way to be rid of them is to kill as many as possible before they begin to breed  large gray shellless cellar snails lay themselves up about the same time with those that live abroad hence it is plain that a defect of warmth is not the only cause that influences their retreat  snakes slough  there the snake throws her enameled skin shakespeare mids nights dream about the middle of this month september we found in a field near a hedge the slough of a large snake which seemed to have been newly cast from circumstances it appeared as if turned wrong side outward and as drawn off backward like a stocking or womans glove not only the whole skin but scales from the very eyes are peeled off and appear in the head of the slough like a pair of spectacles the reptile at the time of changing his coat had entangled himself intricately in the grass and weeds so that the friction of the stalks and blades might promote this curious shifting of his exuviae   lubrica serpens exuit in spinis vestem lucret it would be a most entertaining sight could a person be an eyewitness to such a feat and see the snake in the act of changing his garment as the convexity of the scales of the eyes in the slough is now inward that circumstance alone is a proof that the skin has been turned not to mention that now the present inside is much darker than the outer if you look through the scales of the snakes eyes from the concave side viz as the reptile used them they lessen objects much thus it appears from what has been said that snakes crawl out of the mouth of their own sloughs and quit the tail part last just as eels are skinned by a cook maid while the scales of the eyes are growing loose and a new skin is forming the creature in appearance must be blind and feel itself in an awkward uneasy situation  observations on vegetables trees order of losing their leaves one of the first trees that becomes naked is the walnut the mulberry the ash especially if it bears many keys and the horsechestnut come next all lopped trees while their heads are young carry their leaves a long while apple trees and peaches remain green till very late often till the end of november young beeches never cast their leaves till spring till the new leaves sprout and push them off in the autumn the beechenleaves turn of a deep chestnut color tall beeches cast their leaves about the end of october  size and growth mr marsham of stratton near norwich informs me by letter thus i became a planter early so that an oak which i planted in    0 is become now at   foot from the earth    feet   inches in circumference and at    feet the half of the timber length is   feet   inches so if the bark was to be measured as timber the tree gives     feet buyers measure perhaps you never heard of a larger oak while the planter was living i flatter myself that i increased the growth by washing the stem and digging a circle as far as i supposed the roots to extend and by spreading sawdust etc as related in the phil trans i wish i had begun with beeches my favorite trees as well as yours i might then have seen very large trees of my own raising but i did not begin with beech till      and then by seed so that my largest is now at five feet from the ground   feet   inches in girth and with its head spreads a circle of  0 yards diameter this tree was also dug round washed etc  stratton    july    0    the circumference of trees planted by myself at   foot from the ground    0 feet inches oak in    0     ash    0     great fir        0 greatest beech        0 elm    0     lime           the great oak in the holt which is deemed by mr marsham to be the biggest in this island at   feet from the ground measures in circumference    feet it has in old times lost several of its boughs and is tending to decay mr marsham computes that at    feet length this oak contains  000 feet of timber  it has been the received opinion that trees grow in height only by their annual upper shoot but my neighbor over the way whose occupation confines him to one spot assures me that trees are expanded and raised in the lower parts also the reason that he gives is this the point of one of my firs began for the first time to peep over an opposite roof at the beginning of summer but before the growing season was over the whole shoot of the year and three or four joints of the body beside became visible to him as he sits on his form in his shop according to this supposition a tree may advance in height considerably though the summer shoot should be destroyed every year  flowing of sap if the bough of a vine is cut late in the spring just before the shoots push out it will bleed considerably but after the leaf is out any part may be taken off without the least inconvenience so oaks may be barked while the leaf is budding but as soon as they are expanded the bark will no longer part from the wood because the sap that lubricates the bark and makes it part is evaporated off through the leaves  renovation of leaves when oaks are quite stripped of their leaves by chaffers they are clothed again soon after midsummer with a beautiful foliage but beeches horsechestnuts and maples once defaced by those insects never recover their beauty again for the whole season  ash trees many ash trees bear loads of keys every year others never seem to bear any at all the prolific ones are naked of leaves and unsightly those that are steril abound in foliage and carry their verdure a long while and are pleasing objects  sycamore may    the sycamore or great maple is in bloom and at this season makes a beautiful appearance and affords much pabulum for bees smelling strongly like honey the foliage of this tree is very fine and very ornamental to outlets all the maples have saccharine juices  galls of lombardy poplar the stalks and ribs of the leaves of the lombardy poplar are embossed with large tumors of an oblong shape which by incurious observers have been taken for the fruit of the tree these galls are full of small insects some of which are winged and some not the parent insect is of the genus of cynips some poplars in the garden are quite loaded with these excrescences  chestnut timber john carpenter brings home some old chestnut trees which are very long in several places the woodpeckers had begun to bore them the timber and bark of these trees are so very like oak as might easily deceive an indifferent observer but the wood is very shakey and toward the heart cupshakey that is to say apt to separate in round pieces like cups so that the inward parts are of no use they were bought for the purpose of cooperage but must make but ordinary barrels buckets etc chestnut sells for half the price of oak but has sometimes been sent into the kings docks and passed off instead of oak  lime blossoms dr chandler tells that in the south of france an infusion of the blossoms of the lime tree tilia is in much esteem as a remedy for coughs hoarsnesses fevers etc and that at nismes he saw an avenue of limes that was quite ravaged and torn in pieces by people greedily gathering the bloom which they dried and kept for these purposes  upon the strength of this information we made some tea of lime blossoms and found it a very soft wellflavoured pleasant saccharine julep in taste much resembling the juice of liquorice  blackthorn this tree usually blossoms while cold n e winds blow so that the harsh rugged weather obtaining at this season is called by the country people blackthorn winter  ivy berries ivy berries afford a noble and providential supply for birds in winter and spring for the first severe frost freezes and spoils all the haws sometimes by the middle of november ivy berries do not seem to freeze  hops the culture of virgils vines corresponded very exactly with the modern management of hops i might instance in the perpetual diggings and hoeings in the tying to the stakes and poles in pruning the superfluous shoots etc but lately i have observed a new circumstance which was a neighboring farmers harrowing between the rows of hops with a small triangular harrow drawn by one horse and guided by two handles this occurrence brought to my mind the following passage   ipsa flectere luctantes inter vineta juvencos georgic ii hops are diecious plants hence perhaps it might be proper though not practiced to leave purposely some male plants in every garden that their farina might impregnate the blossoms the female plants without their male attendants are not in their natural state hence we may suppose the frequent failure of crop so incident to hopgrounds no other growth cultivated by man has such frequent and general failures as hops  two hop gardens much injured by a hail storm june   show now september   a prodigious crop and larger and fairer hops than any in the parish the owners seem now to be convinced that the hail by beating off the tops of the binds has increased the sideshoots and improved the crop query therefore should not the tops of hops be pinched off when the binds are very gross and strong  seed lying dormant the naked part of the hanger is now covered with thistles of various kinds the seeds of these thistles may have lain probably under the thick shade of the beeches for many years but could not vegetate till the sun and air were admitted when old beech trees are cleared away the naked ground in a year or two becomes covered with strawberry plants the seeds of which must have lain in the ground for an age at least one of the slidders or trenches down the middle of the hanger close covered over with lofty beeches near a century old is still called strawberry slidder though no strawberries have grown there in the memory of man that sort of fruit did once no doubt abound there and will again when the obstruction is removed  beans sown by birds many horsebeans sprang up in my fieldwalks in the autumn and are now grown to a considerable height as the ewel was in beans last summer it is most likely that these seeds came from thence but then the distance is too considerable for them to have been conveyed by mice it is most probable therefore that they were brought by birds and in particular by jays and pies who seem to have hid them among the grass and moss and then to have forgotten where they had stowed them some pease are growing also in the same situation and probly under the same circumstances  cucumbers set by bees if bees who are much the best setters of cucumbers do not happen to take kindly to the frames the best way is to tempt them by a little honey put on the male and female bloom when they are once induced to haunt the frames they set all the fruit and will hover with impatience round the lights in a morning till the glasses are opened probatum est  wheat a notion has always obtained that in england hot summers are productive of fine crops of wheat yet in the years    0 and      though the heat was intense the wheat was much mildewed and the crop light does not severe heat while the straw is milky occasion its juices to exsude which being extravasated occasion spots discolor the stems and blades and injure the health of the plants  truffles august a trufflehunter called on us having in his pocket several large truffles found in this neighborhood he says these roots are not to be found in deep woods but in narrow hedgerows and the skirts of coppices some truffles he informed us lie two feet within the earth and some quite on the surface the latter he added have little or no smell and are not so easily discovered by the dogs as those that lie deeper half a crown a pound was the price which he asked for this commodity  truffles never abound in wet winters and springs they are in season in different situations at least nine months in the year  tremella nostoc though the weather may have been ever so dry and burning yet after two or three wet days this jellylike substance abounds on the walks  fairy rings the cause occasion call it what you will of fairyrings subsists in the turf and is conveyable with it for the turf of my gardenwalks brought from the down above abounds with those appearances which vary their shape and shift situation continually discovering themselves now in circles now in segments and sometimes in irregular patches and spots wherever they obtain puffballs abound the seeds of which were doubtless brought in the turf  meteorological observations barometer november         a remarkable fall of the barometer all over the kingdom at selborne we had no wind and not much rain only vast swagging rocklike clouds appeared at a distance  partial frost the country people who are abroad in winter mornings long before sunrise talk much of hard frost in some spots and none in others the reason of these partial frosts is obvious for there are at such times partial fogs about where the fog obtains little or no frost appears but where the air is clear there it freezes hard so the frost takes place either on hill or in dale wherever the air happens to be clearest and freest from vapor  thaw thaws are sometimes surprisingly quick considering the small quantity of rain does not the warmth at such times come from below the cold in still severe seasons seems to come down from above for the coming over of a cloud in severe nights raises the thermometer abroad at once full ten degrees the first notices of thaws often seem to appear in vaults cellars etc  if a frost happens even when the ground is considerably dry as soon as a thaw takes place the paths and fields are all in a batter country people say that the frost draws moisture but the true philosophy is that the steam and vapors continually ascending from the earth are bound in by the frost and not suffered to escape till released by the thaw no wonder then that the surface is all in a float since the quantity of moisture by evaporation that arises daily from every acre of ground is astonishing  frozen sleet january  0 mr hs man says that he caught this day in a lane near hackwood park many rooks which attempting to fly fell from the trees with their wings frozen together by the sleet that froze as it fell there were he affirms many dozen so disabled  mist called london smoke this is a blue mist which has somewhat the smell of coal smoke and as it always comes to us with a n e wind is supposed to come from london it has a strong smell and is supposed to occasion blights when such mists appear they are usually followed by dry weather  reflection of fog when people walk in a deep white fog by night with a lanthorn if they will turn their backs to the light they will see their shades impressed on the fog in rude gigantic proportions this phenomenon seems not to have been attended to but implies the great density of the meteor at that juncture  honey dew june        vast honey dews this week the reason of these seem to be that in hot days the effluvia of flowers are drawn up by a brisk evaporation and then in the night fall down with the dews with which they are entangled  this clammy substance is very grateful to bees who gather it with great assiduity but it is injurious to the trees on which it happens to fall by stopping the pores of the leaves the greatest quantity falls in still close weather because winds disperse it and copious dews dilute it and prevent its ill effects it falls mostly in hazy warm weather  morning clouds after a bright night and vast dew the sky usually becomes cloudy by eleven or twelve oclock in the forenoon and clear again toward the decline of the day the reason seems to be that the dew drawn up by evaporation occasions the clouds which toward evening being no longer rendered buoyant by the warmth of the sun melt away and fall down again in dews if clouds are watched in a still warm evening they will be seen to melt away and disappear  dripping weather after drought no one that has not attended to such matters and taken down remarks can be aware how much ten days dripping weather will influence the growth of grass or corn after a severe dry season this present summer      yielded a remarkable instance for till the  0th of may the fields were burnt up and naked and the barley not half out of the ground but now june  0 there is an agreeable prospect of plenty  aurora borealis november        the n aurora made a particular appearance forming itself into a broad red fiery belt which extended from e to w across the welkin but the moon rising at about ten oclock in unclouded majesty in the e put an end to this grand but awful meteorous phenomenon  black spring      dr johnson says that in      the season was so severe in the island of sky that it is remembered by the name of the black spring the snow which seldom lies at all covered the ground for eight weeks many cattle died and those that survived were so emaciated that they did not require the male at the usual season the case was just the same with us here in the south never were so many barren cows known as in the spring following that dreadful period whole dairies missed being in calf together  at the end of march the face of the earth was naked to a surprising degree wheat hardly to be seen and no signs of any grass turnips all gone and sheep in a starving way all provisions rising in price farmers cannot sow for want of rain  on the
