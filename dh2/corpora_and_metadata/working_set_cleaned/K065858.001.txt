  see appendix vol i letter xvii  miscellaneous works of edward gibbon esquire  with memoirs of his life and writings composed by himself illustrated from his letters with occasional notes and narrative by john lord sheffield  in two volumes  vol i  london printed for a strahan and t cadell jun and w davies successors to mr cadell in the strand  mdccxcvi  the melancholy duty of examining the papers of my deceased friend devolved upon me at a time when i was depressed by severe afflictions  in that state of mind i hesitated to undertake the task of selecting and preparing his manuscripts for the press the warmth of my early and long attachment to mr gibbon made me conscious of a partiality which it was not proper to indulge especially in revising many of his juvenile and unfinished compositions i had to guard not only against a sentiment like my own which i found extensively diffused but also against the eagerness occasioned by a very general curiosity to see in print every literary relick however imperfect of so distinguished a writer  being aware how disgracefully authors of eminence have been often treated by an indiscreet posthumous publication of fragments and careless effusions when i had selected those papers which to myself appeared the fittest for the public eye i consulted some of our common friends whom i knew to be equally anxious with myself for mr gibbons fame and fully competent from their judgment to protect it  under such a sanction it is that no longer suspecting myself to view through too favorable a medium the compositions of my friend i now venture to publish them and it may here be proper to give some information to the reader respecting the contents of these volumes  the most important part consists of memoirs of mr gibbons life and writings a work which he seems to have projected with peculiar solicitude and attention and of which he left six different sketches all in his own handwriting one of these sketches the most diffuse and circumstantial so far as it proceeds ends at the time when he quitted oxford another at the year      when he traveled to italy a third at his fathers death in    0 a fourth which he continued to a short time after his return to lausanne in      appears in the form of annals much less detailed than the others the two remaining sketches are still more imperfect it is difficult to discover the order in which these several pieces were written but there is reason to believe that the most copious was the last from all these the following memoirs have been carefully selected and put together  my hesitation in giving these memoirs to the world arose principally from the circumstance of mr gibbons appearing in some respect not to have been satisfied with them as he had so frequently varied their form yet notwithstanding this diffidence the compositions though unfinished are so excellent that they may justly entitle my friend to appear as his own biographer rather than to have that task undertaken by any other person less qualified for it  this opinion has rendered me anxious to publish the present memoirs without any unnecessary delay for i am persuaded that the author of them cannot be made to appear in a truer light than he does in the following pages in them and in his different letters which i have added will be found a complete picture of his talents his disposition his studies and his seize  those slight variations of character which naturally arose in the progress of his life will be unfolded in a series of letters selected from a correspondence between him and myself which continued full thirty years and ended with his death  it is to be lamented that all the sketches of the memoirs except that composed in the form of annals and which seems rather designed as heads for a future work cease about twenty years before mr gibbons death and consequently that we have the least detailed account of the most interesting part of his life his correspondence during that period will in great measure supply the deficiency it will be separated from the memoirs and placed in an appendix that those who are not disposed to be pleased with the repetitions familiarities and trivial circumstances of epistolary writing may not be embarrassed by it by many the letters will be found a very interesting part of the present publication they will prove how pleasant friendly and amiable mr gibbon was in private life and if in publishing letters so flattering to myself i incur the imputation of vanity i shall meet the charge with a frank confession that i am indeed highly vain of having enjoyed for so many years the esteem the confidence and the affection of a man whose social qualities endeared him to the most accomplished society and whose talents great as they were must be acknowledged to have been fully equalled by the sincerity of his friendship  whatever censure may be pointed against the editor the public will set a due value on the letters for their intrinsic merit i must indeed be blinded either by vanity or affection if they do not display the heart and mind of their author in such a manner as justly to increase the number of his admirers  i have not been solicitous to garble or expunge passages which to some may appear trifling such passages will often in the opinion of the observing reader mark the character of the writer and the omission of them would materially take from the ease and familiarity of authentic letters  few men i believe have ever so fully unveiled their own character by a minute narrative of their sentiments and pursuits as mr gibbon will here be found to have done not with study and labor  not with an affected frankness  but with a genuine confession of his little foibles and peculiarities and a goodhumoured and natural display of his own conduct and opinions  mr gibbon began a journal a work distinct from the sketches already mentioned in the early part of his life with the following declaration  i propose from this day august   th      to keep an exact journal of my actions and studies both to assist my memory and to accustom me to set a due value on my time i shall begin by setting down some few events of my past life the dates of which i can remember  this industrious project he pursued occasionally in french under various titles and with the minuteness fidelity and liberality of a mind resolved to watch over and improve itself  the journal is continued under different titles and is sometimes very concise and sometimes singularly detailed one part of it is entitled my journal another ephemerides or journal of my actions studies and opinions the other parts are entitled ephemerides ou journal de ma vie de mes etudes et de mes sentimens in this journal among the most trivial circumstances are mixed very interesting observations and dissertations on a satire of juvenal a passage of homer or of longinus or of any other author whose works he happened to read in the course of the day and he often passes from a remark on the most common event to a critical disquisition of considerable learning or an enquiry into some abstruse point of philosophy  it certainly was not his intention that this private and motley diary should be presented to the public nor have i thought myself at liberty to present it in the shape in which he left it but by reducing it to an account of his literary occupations it formed so singular and so interesting a portrait of an indefatigable student that i persuade myself it will be regarded as a valuable acquisition by the literary world and as an accession of fame to the memory of my friend with the extracts from mr gibbons journal will be printed his dissertations entitled extraits raisonnes de mes lectures and recueil de mes observations et pieces detachees sur differens sujets a few other passages from other parts of the journals introduced in notes will make a curious addition to the memoirs  his first publication essai sur letude de la litterature with corrections and additions from an interleaved copy which my friend gave to me several years ago is reprinted as part of these volumes  three more of his smaller publications are also reprinted   his masterly criticism on the sixth book of virgil in answer to bishop warburton   his own vindication of the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters of his history in answer to mr davis and others and   his reponse a lexpose de la cour de france  an occasional composition which obtained the highest applause in foreign courts and of which he spoke to me with some pleasure observing that it had been translated even into the turkish language at petersburgh and vienna it was currently observed by the corpse diplomatique that the english ministry had published a memorial written not only with great ability but also in french so correct that they must have employed a frenchman   of these various writings the author has spoken himself in describing his own life i have yet to notice some articles not mentioned in his memoirs and which will be found in this publication   a juvenile sketch entitled outlines of the history of the world   a dissertation which he had shown to a few friends on that curious subject lhomme au masque de fer   a more considerable work the antiquities of the house of brunswick an historical discourse composed about the year    0 in this work he intended to appropriate separate books   to the italian descent   to the germanic reign and   to the british succession of the house of brunswick the manuscript closes in completing the italian branch of his subject  among the most splendid passages of that unfinished work may be enumerated the characters of leibnitz and muratori a sketch of albertazo the second a prince who retained his faculties and reputation beyond the age of one hundred years an account of padua and its university and remarks on the epic glory of ferrara  the last paper of these volumes has the mournful attraction of being a sketch interrupted by death and affords an honorable proof that my friends ardour for the promotion of historical knowledge attended him to the last it is entitled merely an address and expresses a wish that our latin memorials of the middle ages the scriptores rerum anglicarum may be published in england in a manner worthy of the subject and of the country he mentions mr john pinkerton as a person well qualified for the conduct of such a national undertaking  in the collection of writings which i am now sending to the press there is no article that will so much engage the public attention as the memoirs i will therefore close all i mean to say as their editor by assuring the reader that although i have in some measure newly arranged those interesting papers by forming one regular narrative from the six different sketches i have nevertheless adhered with scrupulous fidelity to the very words of their author and i use the letter s to mark such notes of my own as it seemed necessary to add  it remains only to express a wish that in discharging this latest office of affection my regard to the memory of my friend may appear as i trust it will do proportioned to the high satisfaction which i enjoyed for many years in possessing his entire confidence and very partial attachment  sheffield sheffieldplace  th aug

insert the memoirs of my life and writings in the fiftysecond year of my age after the completion of an arduous and successful work i now propose to employ some moments of my leisure in reviewing the simple transactions of a private and literary life truth naked unblushing truth the first virtue of more serious history must be the sole recommendation of this personal narrative the style shall be simple and familiar but style is the image of character and the habits of correct writing may produce without labor or design the appearance of art and study my own amusement is my motive and will be my reward and if these sheets are communicated to some discreet and indulgent friends they will be secreted from the public eye till the author shall be removed beyond the reach of criticism or ridicule this passage is found in one only of the six sketches and in that which seems to have been the first written and which was laid aside among loose papers mr gibbon in his communications with me on the subject of his memoirs a subject which he had never mentioned to any other person expressed a determination of publishing them in his lifetime and never appears to have departed from that resolution excepting in one of his letters annexed in which he intimates a doubt though rather carelessly whether in his time or at any time they would meet the eye of the public  in a conversation however not long before his death it was suggested to him that if he should make them a full image of his mind he would not have nerves to publish them in his lifetime and therefore that they should be posthumous  he answered rather eagerly that he was determined to publish them in his lifetime s   a lively desire of knowing and of recording our ancestors so generally prevails that it must depend on the influence of some common principle in the minds of men we seem to have lived in the persons of our forefathers it is the labor and reward of vanity to extend the term of this ideal longevity our imagination is always active to enlarge the narrow circle in which nature has confined us fifty or an hundred years may be allotted to an individual but we step forwards beyond death with such hopes as religion and philosophy will suggest and we fill up the silent vacancy that precedes our birth by associating ourselves to the authors of our existence our calmer judgment will rather tend to moderate than to suppress the pride of an ancient and worthy race the satyrist may laugh the philosopher may preach but reason herself will respect the prejudices and habits which have been consecrated by the experience of mankind  wherever the distinction of birth is allowed to form a superior order in the state education and example should always and will often produce among them a dignity of sentiment and propriety of conduct which is guarded from dishonor by their own and the public esteem if we read of some illustrious line so ancient that it has no beginning so worthy that it ought to have no end we sympathize in its various fortunes nor can we blame the generous enthusiasm or even the harmless vanity of those who are allied to the honors of its name for my own part could i draw my pedigree from a general a statesman or a celebrated author i should study their lives with the diligence of filial love in the investigation of past events our curiosity is stimulated by the immediate or indirect reference to ourselves but in the estimate of honor we should learn to value the gifts of nature above those of fortune to esteem in our ancestors the qualities that best promote the interests of society and to pronounce the descendant of a king less truly noble than the offspring of a man of genius whose writings will instruct or delight the latest posterity the family of confucius is in my opinion the most illustrious in the world after a painful ascent of eight or ten centuries our barons and princes of europe are lost in the darkness of the middle ages but in the vast equality of the empire of china the posterity of confucius have maintained above two thousand two hundred years their peaceful honors and perpetual succession the chief of the family is still revered by the sovereign and the people as the lively image of the wisest of mankind the nobility of the spencers has been illustrated and enriched by the trophies of marlborough but i exhort them to consider the fairy queen as the most precious jewel of their coronet i have exposed my private feelings as i shall always do without scruple or reserve that these sentiments are just or at least natural i am inclined to believe since i do not feel myself interested in the cause for i can derive from my ancestors neither glory nor shame  yet a sincere and simple narrative of my own life may amuse some of my leisure hours but it will subject me and perhaps with justice to the imputation of vanity i may judge however from the experience both of past and of the present times that the public are always curious to know the men who have left behind them any image of their minds the most scanty accounts of such men are compiled with diligence and perused with eagerness and the student of every class may derive a lesson or an example from the lives most similar to his own my name may hereafter be placed among the thousand articles of a biographia britannica and i must be conscious that no one is so well qualified as myself to describe the series of my thoughts and actions the authority of my masters of the grave thuanus and the philosophic hume might be sufficient to justify my design but it would not be difficult to produce a long list of ancients and moderns who in various forms have exhibited their own portraits such portraits are often the most interesting and sometimes the only interesting parts of their writings and if they be sincere we seldom complain of the minuteness or prolixity of these personal memorials the lives of the younger pliny of petrarch and of erasmus are expressed in the epistles which they themselves have given to the world the essays of montagne and sir william temple bring us home to the houses and bosoms of the authors we smile without contempt at the headstrong passions of benevenuto cellini and the gay follies of colley cibber the confessions of st austin and rousseau disclose the secrets of the human heart the commentaries of the learned huet have survived his evangelical demonstration and the memoirs of goldoni are more truly dramatic than his italian comedies the heretic and the churchman are strongly marked in the characters and fortunes of whiston and bishop newton and even the dullness of michael de marolles and anthony wood acquires some value from the faithful representation of men and manners that i am equal or superior to some of these the effects of modesty or affectation cannot force me to dissemble  my family is originally derived from the county of kent the southern district which borders on sussex and the sea was formerly overspread with the great forest anderida and even now retains the denomination of the weald or woodland in this district and in the hundred and parish of rolvenden the gibbons were possessed of lands in the year one thousand three hundred and twentysix and the elder branch of the family without much increase or diminution of property still adheres to its native soil fourteen years after the first appearance of his name john gibbon is recorded as the marmorarius or architect of king edward the third the strong and stately castle of queensborough which guarded the entrance of the medway was a monument of his skill and the grant of an hereditary toll on the passage from sandwich to stonar in the isle of thanet is the reward of no vulgar artist in the visitations of the heralds the gibbons are frequently mentioned they held the rank of esquire in an age when that title was less promiscuously assumed one of them under the reign of queen elizabeth was captain of the militia of kent and a free school in the neighboring town of benenden proclaims the charity and opulence of its founder but time or their own obscurity has cast a veil of oblivion over the virtues and vices of my kentish ancestors their character or station confined them to the labors and pleasures of a rural life nor is it in my power to follow the advice of the poet in an inquiry after a name  go search it there where to be born and die of rich and poor makes all the history so recent is the institution of our parish registers in the beginning of the seventeenth century a younger branch of the gibbons of rolvenden migrated from the country to the city and from this branch i do not blush to descend the law requires some abilities the church imposes some restraints and before our army and navy our civil establishments and india empire had opened so many paths of fortune the mercantile profession was more frequently chosen by youths of a liberal race and education who aspired to create their own independence our most respectable families have not disdained the counting house or even the shop their names are enrolled in the livery and companies of london and in england as well as in the italian commonwealths heralds have been compelled to declare that gentility is not degraded by the exercise of trade  the armorial ensigns which in the times of chivalry adorned the crest and shield of the soldier are now become an empty decoration which every man who has money to build a carriage may paint according to his fancy on the pannels my family arms are the same which were borne by the gibbons of kent in an age when the college of heralds religiously guarded the distinctions of blood and name a lion rampant gardant between three schallopshells argent on a field azure the father of lord chancellor hardwicke married an heiress of this family of gibbon the chancellors escutcheon in the temple hall quarters the arms of gibbon as does also that in lincolns inn hall of charles york chancellor in    0 s  i should not however have been tempted to blazon my coat of arms were it not connected with a whimsical anecdote  about the reign of james the first the three harmless schallopshells were changed by edmund gibbon esquire into three ogresses or female cannibals with a design of stigmatizing three ladies his kinswomen who had provoked him by an unjust lawsuit but this singular mode of revenge for which he obtained the sanction of sir william seagar king at arms soon expired with its author and on his own monument in the temple church the monsters vanish and the three schallopshells resume their proper and hereditary place  our alliances by marriage it is not disgraceful to mention the chief honor of my ancestry is james fiens baron say and seal and lord high treasurer of england in the reign of henry the sixth from whom by the phelips the whetnalls and the cromers i am lineally descended in the eleventh degree his dismission and imprisonment in the tower were insufficient to appease the popular clamor and the treasurer with his soninlaw cromer was beheaded    0 after a mock trial by the kentish insurgents the black list of his offenses as it is exhibited in shakespeare displays the ignorance and envy of a plebeian tyrant besides the vague reproaches of selling maine and normandy to the dauphin the treasurer is specially accused of luxury for riding on a footcloth and of treason for speaking french the language of our enemies thou have most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm says jack cade to the unfortunate lord in erecting a grammar school and whereas before our forefathers had no other books than the score and the tally thou have caused printing to be used and contrary to the king his crown and dignity thou have built a papermill it will be proved to thy face that thou have men about thee who usually talk of a noun and a verb and such abominable words as no christian ear can endure to hear our dramatic poet is generally more attentive to character than to history and i much fear that the art of printing was not introduced into england till several years after lord says death but of some of these meritorious crimes i should hope to find my ancestor guilty and a man of letters may be proud of his descent from a patron and martyr of learning  in the beginning of the last century robert gibbon esquire of rolvenden in kent who died in      had a son of the same name of robert who settled in london and became a member of the clothworkers company his wife was a daughter of the edgars who flourished about four hundred years in the county of suffolk and produced an eminent and wealthy serjeantatlaw sir gregory edgar in the reign of henry the seventh of the sons of robert gibbon who died in      matthew did not aspire above the station of a linendraper in leadenhallstreet but john has given to the public some curious memorials of his existence his character and his family he was born on the  d of november in the year      his education was liberal at a grammar school and afterward in jesus college at cambridge and he celebrates the retired content which he enjoyed at allesborough in worcestershire in the house of thomas lord coventry where john gibbon was employed as a domestic tutor the same office which mr hobbes exercised in the devonshire family but the spirit of my kinsman soon immerged into more active life he visited foreign countries as a soldier and a traveller acquired the knowledge of the french and spanish languages passed some time in the isle of jersey crossed the atlantic and resided upwards of a twelvemonth      in the rising colony of virginia in this remote province his taste or rather passion for heraldry found a singular gratification at a wardance of the native indians as they moved in measured steps brandishing their tomahawks his curious eye contemplated their little shields of bark and their naked bodies which were painted with the colors and symbols of his favorite science at which i exceedingly wondered and concluded that heraldry was ingrafted naturally into the sense of human race if so it deserves a greater esteem than nowadays is put upon it his return to england after the restoration was soon followed by his marraige  his settlement in a house in st catherines cloister near the tower which devolved to my grandfather  and his introduction into the heralds college in      by the style and title of bluemantle pursuivant at arms in this office he enjoyed near fifty years the rare felicity of uniting in the same pursuit his duty and inclination his name is remembered in the college and many of his letters are still preserved several of the most respectable characters of the age sir william dugdale mr ashmole dr john betts and dr nehemiah grew were his friends and in the society of such men john gibbon may be recorded without disgrace as the member of an astrological club the study of hereditary honors is favorable to the royal prerogative and my kinsman like most of his family was a high tory both in church and state in the latter end of the reign of charles the second his pen was exercised in the cause of the duke of york the republican faction he most cordially detested and as each animal is conscious of its proper arms the heralds revenge was emblazoned on a most diabolical escutcheon but the triumph of the whig government checked the preferment of bluemantle and he was even suspended from his office till his tongue could learn to pronounce the oath of abjuration his life was prolonged to the age of ninety and in the expectation of the inevitable though uncertain hour he wishes to preserve the blessings of health competence and virtue in the year      he published at london his introductio ad latinam blafoniam an original attempt which camden had desiderated to define in a roman idiom the terms and attributes of a gothic institution it is not two years since i acquired in a foreign land some domestic intelligence of my own family and this intelligence was conveyed to switzerland from the heart of germany i had formed an acquaintance with mr langer a lively and ingenious scholar while he resided at lausanne as preceptor to the hereditary prince of brunswick on his return to his proper station of librarian to the ducal library of wolfenbuttel he accidentally found among some literary rubbish a small old english volume of heraldry inscribed with the name of john gibbon from the title only mr langer judged that it might be an acceptable present to his friend and he judged rightly his manner is quaint and affected his order is confused but he displays some wit more reading and still more enthusiasm and if an enthusiast be often absurd he is never languid an english text is perpetually interspersed with latin sentences in prose and verse but in his own poetry he claims an exemption from the laws of prosody amidst a profusion of genealogical knowledge my kinsman could not be forgetful of his own name and to him i am indebted for almost the whole of my information concerning the gibbon family from this small work a duodecimo of one hundred and sixtyfive pages the author expected immortal fame and at the conclusion of his labor he sings in a strain of selfexultation  usque huc corrigitur romana blasonia per me verborumque dehinc barbara forma cadat hic liber in meritum si forsitan incidet usum testis rite meae sedulitatis erit quicquid agat zoilus ventura fatebitur aetas artis quod fueram non clypearis inops such are the hopes of authors in the failure of those hopes john gibbon has not been the first of his profession and very possibly may not be the last of his name his brother matthew gibbon the draper had one daughter and two sons  my grandfather edward who was born in the year      and thomas afterward dean of carlisle according to the mercantile creed that the best book is a profitable ledger the writings of john the herald would be much less precious than those of his nephew edward but an author professes at least to write for the public benefit and the slow balance of trade can be pleasing to those persons only to whom it is advantageous the successful industry of my grandfather raised him above the level of his immediate ancestors he appears to have launched into various and extensive dealings even his opinions were subordinate to his interest and i find him in flanders clothing king williams troops while he would have contracted with more pleasure though not perhaps at a cheaper rate for the service of king james during his residence abroad his concerns at home were managed by his mother hester an active and notable woman her second husband was a widower of the name of acton they united the children of their first nuptials after his marriage with the daughter of richard acton goldsmith in leadenhallstreet he gave his own sister to sir whitmore acton of aldenham and i am thus connected by a triple alliance with that ancient and loyal family of shropshire baronets it consisted about that time of seven brothers all of gigantic stature one of whom a pigmy of six feet two inches confessed himself the last and least of the seven adding in the true spirit of party that such men were not born since the revolution under the tory administration of the four last years of queen anne    0       mr edward gibbon was appointed one of the commissioners of the customs he sat at that board with prior but the merchant was better qualified for his station than the poet since lord bolingbroke has been heard to declare that he had never conversed with a man who more clearly understood the commerce and finances of england in the year      he was elected one of the directors of the south sea company and his books exhibited the proof that before his acceptance of this fatal office he had acquired an independent fortune of sixty thousand pounds  but his fortune was overwhelmed in the shipwreck of the year twenty and the labors of thirty years were blasted in a single day of the use or abuse of the south sea scheme of the guilt or innocence of my grandfather and his brother directors i am neither a competent nor a disinterested judge yet the equity of modern times must condemn the violent and arbitrary proceedings which would have disgraced the cause of justice and would render injustice still more odious no sooner had the nation awakened from its golden dream than a popular and even a parliamentary clamor demanded their victims but it was acknolwedged on all sides that the south sea directors however guilty could not be touched by any known laws of the lands the speech of lord molesworth the author of the state of denmark may show the temper or rather the intemperance of the house of commons extraordinary crimes exclaimed that ardent whig call aloud for extraordinary remedies the roman lawgivers had not foreseen the possible existence of a parricide but as soon as the first monster appeared he was sown in a sack and cast headlong into the river and i shall be content to inflict the same treatment on the authors of our present ruin his motion was not literally adopted but a bill of pains and penalties was introduced a retroactive statute to punish the offenses which did not exist at the time they were committed such a pernicious violation of liberty and law can be excused only by the most imperious necessity nor could it be defended on this occasion by the plea of impending danger or useful example the legislature restrained the persons of the directors imposed an exorbitant security for their appearance and marked their characters with a previous note of ignominy they were compelled to deliver upon oath the strict value of their estates and were disabled from making any transfer or alienation of any part of their property against a bill of pains and penalties it is the common right of every subject to be heard by his counsel at the bar they prayed to be heard their prayer was refused and their oppressors who required no evidence would listen to no defense it had been at first proposed that oneeighth of their respective estates should be allowed for the future support of the directors but it was speciously urged that in the various shades of opulence and guilt such an unequal proportion would be too light for many and for some might possibly be too heavy the character and conduct of each man were separately weighed but instead of the calm solemnity of a judicial inquiry the fortune and honor of three and thirty englishmen were made the topic of hasty conversation the sport of a lawless majority and the basest member of the committee by a malicious word or a silent vote might indulge his general spleen or personal animosity injury was aggravated by insult and insult was embittered by pleasantry allowances of twenty pounds or one shilling were facetiously moved a vague report that a director had formerly been concerned in another project by which some unknown persons had lost their money was admitted as a proof of his actual guilt one man was ruined because he had dropped a foolish speech that his horses should feed upon gold another because he was grown so proud that one day at the treasury he had refused a civil answer to persons much above him all were condemned absent and unheard in arbitrary fines and forfeitures which swept away the greatest part of their substance such bold oppression can scarcely be shielded by the omnipotence of parliament and yet it may be seriously questioned whether the judges of the south sea directors were the true and legal representatives of their country the first parliament of george the first had been chosen      for three years the term had elapsed their trust was expired and the four additional years            during which they continued to sit were derived not from the people but from themselves from the strong measure of the septennial bill which can only be paralleled by il serar di consiglio of the venetian history yet candor will own that to the same parliament every englishman is deeply indebted the septennial act so vicious in its origin has been sanctioned by time experience and the national consent its first operation secured the house of hanover on the throne and its permanent influence maintains the peace and stability of government as often as a repeal has been moved in the house of commons i have given in its defense a clear and conscientious vote  my grandfather could not expect to be treated with more lenity than his companions his tory principles and connections rendered him obnoxious to the ruling powers his name is reported in a suspicious secret and his wellknown abilities could not plead the excuse of ignorance or error in the first proceedings against the south sea directors mr gibbon is one of the few who were taken into custody and in the final sentence the measure of his fine proclaims him eminently guilty the total estimate which he delivered on oath to the house of commons amounted to one hundred and six thousand five hundred and fortythree pounds five shillings and sixpence exclusive of antecedent settlements two different allowances of fifteen and of ten thousand pounds were moved for mr gibbon but on the question being put it was carried without a division for the smaller sum on these ruins with the skill and credit of which parliament had not been able to despoil him my grandfather at a mature age erected the edifice of a new fortune the labors of sixteen years were amply rewarded and i have reason to believe that the second structure was not much inferior to the first he had realized a very considerable property in sussex hampshire buckinghamshire and the new river company and had acquired a spacious house since inhabited by mr wood sir john shelley the duke of norfolk etc s  with gardens and lands at putney in surry where he resided in decent hospitality he died in december      at the age of seventy and by his last will at the expense of edward his only son with whose marriage he was not perfectly reconciled enriched his two daughters catherine and hester the former became the wife of mr edward elliston an east india captain their daughter and heiress catherine was married in the year      to edward eliot esquire now lord eliot of port eliot in the county of cornwall and their three sons are my nearest male relations on the fathers side a life of devotion and celibacy was the choice of my aunt mrs hester gibbon who at the age of eightyfive still resides in a hermitage at cliffe in northamptonshire having long survived her spiritual guide and faithful companion mr william law who at an advanced age about the year      died in her house in our family he had left the reputation of a worthy and pious man who believed all that he professed and practiced all that he enjoined the character of a nonjuror which he maintained to the last is a sufficient evidence of his principles in church and state and the sacrifice of interest to consicence will be always respectable his theological writings which our domestic connection has tempted me to peruse preserve an imperfect sort of life and i can pronounce with more confidence and knowledge on the merits of the author his last compositions are darkly tinctured by the incomprehensible visions of jacob behmen and his discourse on the absolute unlawfulness of stageentertainments is sometimes quoted for a ridiculous intemperance of sentiment and language  the actors and spectators must all be damned the playhouse is the porch of hell the place of the devils abode where he holds his filthy court of evil spirits a play is the devils triumph a sacrifice performed to his glory as much as in the heathen temples of bacchus or venus etc etc but these sallies of religious phrensy must not extinguish the praise which is due to mr william law as a wit and a scholar his argument on topics of less absurdity is specious and acute his manner is lively his style forcible and clear and had not his vigorous mind been clouded by enthusiasm he might be ranked with the most agreeable and ingenious writers of the times while the bangorian controversy was a fashionable theme he entered the lists on the subject of christs kingdom and the authority of the priesthood against the plain account of the sacrament of the lords supper he resumed the combat with bishop hoadley the object of whig idolatry and tory abhorrence and at every weapon of attack and defense the nonjuror on the ground which is common to both approves himself at least equal to the prelate on the appearance of the fable of the bees he drew his pen against the licentious doctrine that private vices are public benefits and morality as well as religion must join in his applause mr laws masterwork the serious call is still read as a popular and powerful book of devotion his precepts are rigid but they are founded on the gospel his satire is sharp but it is drawn from the knowledge of human life and many of his portraits are not unworthy of the pen of la bruyere if he finds a spark of piety in his readers mind he will soon kindle it to a flame and a philosopher must allow that he exposes with equal severity and truth the strange contradiction between the faith and practice of the christian world under the names of flavia and miranda he has admirably described my two aunts  the heathen and the christian sister  my father edward gibbon was born in october   0  at the age of thriteen he could scarcely feel that he was disinherited by act of parliament and as he advanced toward manhood new prospects of fortune opened to his view a parent is most attentive to supply in his children the deficiencies of which he is conscious in himself my grandfathers knowledge was derived from a strong understanding and the experience of the ways of men but my father enjoyed the benefits of a liberal education as a scholar and a gentleman at westminster school and afterward at emanuel college in cambridge he passed through a regular course of academical discipline and the care of his leanring and morals was entrusted to his private tutor the same mr william law but the mind of a saint is above or below the present world and while the pupil proceeded on his travels the tutor remained at putney the muchhonoured friend and spiritual director of the whole family my father resided some time at paris to acquire the fashionable exercises and as his temper was warm and social he indulged in those pleasures for which the strictness of his former education had given him a keener relish he afterward visited several provinces of france but his excursions were neither long nor remote and the slender knowledge which he had gained of the french language was gradually obliterated his passage through besancon is marked by a singular consequence in the chain of human events in a dangerous illness mr gibbon was attended at his own request by one of his kinsmen of the name of acton the younger brother of a younger brother who had applied himself to the study of physic during the slow recovery of his patient the physician himself was attacked by the malady of love he married his mistress renounced his country and religion settled at besancon and became the father of three sons the eldest of whom general acton is conspicuous in europe as the principal minister of the king of the two sicilies by an uncle whom another stroke of fortune had transplanted to leghorn he was educated in the naval service of the emperor and his valor and conduct in the command of the tuscan frigates protected the retreat of the spaniards from algiers on my fathers return to england he was chosen in the general election of      to serve in parliament for the borough of petersfield a burgage tenure of which my grandfather possessed a weighty share till he alienated i know not why such important property in the opposition to sir robert walpole and the pelhams prejudice and society connected his son with the tories  shall i say jacobites or as they were pleased to style themselves the country gentlemen with them he gave many a vote with them he drank many a bottle without acquiring the fame of an orator or a statesman he eagerly joined in the great opposition which after a seven years chase hunted down sir robert walpole and in the pursuit of an unpopular minister he gratified a private revenge against the oppressor of his family in the south sea persecution  i was born at putney in the county of surry the   th of april o s in the year one thousand seven hundred and thirtyseven the first child of the marriage of edward gibbon esquire and of judith porten the union to which i owe my birth was a marriage of inclination and esteem mr james porten a merchant of london resided with his family at putney in a house adjoining to the bridge and churchyard where i have passed many happy hours of my childhood he left one son the late sir stanier porten and three daughters catherine who preserved her maiden name and of whom i shall hereafter speak another daughter married mr darrel of richmond and left two sons edward and robert the youngest of the three sisters was judith my mother  my lot might have been that of a slave a savage or a peasant nor can i reflect without pleasure on the bounty of nature which cast my birth in a free and civilized country in an age of science and philosophy in a family of honorable rank and decently endowed with the gifts of fortune from my birth i have enjoyed the right of primogeniture but i was succeeded by five brothers and one sister all of whom were snatched away in their infancy my five brothers whose names may be found in the parish register of putney i shall not pretend to lament but from my childhood to the present hour i have deeply and sincerely regretted my sister whose life was somewhat prolonged and whom i remember to have seen an amiable infant the relation of a brother and a sister especially if they do not marry appears to me of a very singular nature it is a familiar and tender friendship with a female much about our own age an affection perhaps softened by the secret influence of sex but pure from any mixture of sensual desire the sole species of platonic love that can be indulged with truth and without danger  at the general election of      mr gibbon and mr delme stood an expensive and successful contest at southampton against mr dummer and mr henly afterward lord chancellor and earl of northington the whig candidates had a majority of the resident voters but the corporation was firm in the tory interest a sudden creation of one hundred and seventy new freemen turned the scale and a supply was readily obtained of respectable volunteers who flocked from all parts of england to support the cause of their political friends the new parliament opened with the victory of an opposition which was fortified by strong clamor and strange coalitions from the event of the first divisions sir robert walpole perceived that he could no longer lead a majority in the house of commons and prudently resigned after a dominion of one and twenty years the guidance of the state      but the fall of an unpopular minister was not succeeded according to general expectation by a millenium of happiness and virtue some courtiers lost their places some patriots lost their characters lord orfords offenses vanished with his power and after a short vibration the pelham government was fixed on the old basis of the whig aristocracy in the year      the throne and the constitution were attacked by a rebellion which does not reflect much honor on the national spirit since the english friends of the pretender wanted courage to join his standard and his enemies the bulk of the people allowed him to advance into the heart of the kingdom without daring perhaps without desiring to aid the rebels my father invariably adhered to the tory opposition in the most critical season he accepted for the service of the party the office of alderman in the city of london but the duties were so repugnant to his inclination and habits that he resigned his gown at the end of a few months the second parliament in which he sat was prematurely dissolved      and as he was unable or unwilling to maintain a second contest for southampton the life of the senator expired in that dissolution  the death of a newborn child before that of its parents may seem an unnatural but it is strictly a probable event since of any given number the greater part are extinguished before their ninth year before they possess the faculties of the mind or body without accusing the profuse waste or imperfect workmanshiop of nature i shall only observe that this unfavourable chance was multiplied against my infant existence so feeble was my constitution so precarious my life that in the baptism of each of my brothers my fathers prudence successively repeated my christian name of edward that in case of the departure of the eldest son this patronymick appellation might be still perpetuated in the family  uno avulso non deficit alter to preserve and to rear so frail a being the most tender assiduity was scarcely sufficient and my mothers attention was somewhat diverted by her frequent pregnancies by an exclusive passion for her husband and by the dissipation of the world in which his taste and authority obliged her to mingle but the maternal office was supplied by my aunt mrs catherine porten at whose name i feel a tear of gratitude trickling down my cheek a life of celibacy transferred her vacant affection to her sisters first child my weakness excited her pity her attachment was fortified by labor and success and if there be any as i trust there are some who rejoice that i live to that dear and excellent woman they must hold themselves indebted many anxious and solitary days did she consume in the patient trial of every mode of relief and amusement many wakeful nights did she sit by my bedside in trembling expectation that each hour would be my last of the various and frequent disorders of my childhood my own recollection is dark nor do i wish to expatiate on so disgusting a topic suffice it to say that while every practitioner from sloane and ward to the chevalier tailor was successively summoned to torture or relieve me the care of my mind was too frequently neglected for that of my health compassion always suggested an excuse for the indulgence of the master or the idleness of the pupil and the chain of my education was broken as often as i was recalled from the school of learning to the bed of sickness  as soon as the use of speech had prepared my infant reason for the admission of knowledge i was taught the arts of reading writing and arithmetic so remote is the date so vague is the memory of their origin in myself that were not the error corrected by analogy i should be tempted to conceive them as innate in my childhood i was praised for the readiness with which i could multiply and divide by memory alone two sums of several figures such praise encouraged my growing talent and had i persevered in this line of application i might have acquired some fame in mathematical studies  after this previous institution at home or at a dayschool at putney i was delivered at the age of seven into the hands of mr john kirkby who exercised about eighteen months the office of my domestic tutor his own words which i shall here transcribe inspire in his favor a sentiment of pity and esteem  during my abode in my native county of cumberland in quality of an indigent curate i used nowandthen in a summer when the pleasantness of the season invited to take a solitary walk to the seashore which lies about two miles from the town where i lived here i would amuse myself one while in viewing at large the agreeable prospect which surrounded me and another while confining my sight to nearer objects in admiring the vast variety of beautiful shells thrown upon the beach some of the choicest of which i always picked up to divert my little ones upon my return one time among the rest taking such a journey in my head i sat down upon the declivity of the beach with my face to the sea which was now come up within a few yards of my feet when immediately the sad thoughts of the wretched condition of my family and the unsuccessfulness of all endeavors to amend it came crowding into my mind which drove me into a deep melancholy and ever and anon forced tears from my eyes distress at last forced him to leave the country his learning and virtue introduced him to my father and at putney he might have found at least a temporary shelter had not an act of indiscretion again driven him into the world one day reading prayers in the parish church he most unluckily forgot the name of king george his patron a loyal subject dismissed him with some reluctance and a decent reward and how the poor man ended his days i have never been able to learn mr john kirkby is the author of two small volumes the life of automathes london      and an english and latin grammar london      which as a testimony of gratitude he dedicated november  th      to my father the books are before me from them the pupil may judge the preceptor and upon the whole his judgment will not be unfavourable the grammar is executed with accuracy and skill and i know not whether any better existed at the time in our language but the life of automathes aspires to the honors of a philosophical fiction it is the story of a youth the son of a shipwrecked exile who lives alone on a desert island from infancy to the age of manhood a hind is his nurse he inherits a cottage with many useful and curious instruments some ideas remain of the education of his two first years some arts are borrowed from the beavers of a neighboring lake some truths are revealed in supernatural visions with these helps and his own industry automathes becomes a selftaught thought speechless philosopher who had investigated with success his own mind the natural world the abstract sciences and the great principles of morality and religion the author is not entitled to the merit of invention since he has blended the english story of robinson crusoe with the arabian romance of hai ebn yokhdan which he might have read in the latin version of pocock in the automathes i cannot praise either the depth of thought or elegance of style but the book is not devoid of entertainment or instruction and among several interesting passages i would select the discovery of fire which produces by accidental mischief the discovery of conscience a man who had though so much on the subjects of language and education was surely no ordinary preceptor my childish years and his hasty departure prevented me from enjoying the full benefit of his lessons but they enlarged my knowledge of arithmetic and left me a clear impression of the english and latin rudiments  in my ninth year january      in a lucid interval of comparative health my father adopted the convenient and customary mode of english education and i was sent to kingston upon thames to a school of about seventy boys which was kept by dr wooddeson and his assistants every time i have since passed over putney common i have always noticed the spot where my mother as we drove along in the coach admonished me that i was now going into the world and must learn to think and act for myself the expression may appear ludicrous yet there is not in the course of life a more remarkable change than the removal of a child from the luxury and freedom of a wealthy house to the frugal diet and strict subordination of a school from the tenderness of parents and the obsequiousness of servants to the rude familiarity of his equals the insolent tyranny of his seniors and the rod perhaps of a cruel and capricious pedagogue such hardships may steel the mind and body against the injuries of fortune but my timid reserve was astonished by the crowd and tumult of the school the want of strength and activity disqualified me for the sports of the playfield nor have i forgotten how often in the year fortysix i was reviled and buffetted for the sins of my tory ancestors by the common methods of discipline at the expense of many tears and some blood i purchased the knowledge of the latin syntax and not long since i was possessed of the dirty volumes of phaedrus and cornelius nepos which i painfully construed and darkly understood the choice of these authors is not injudicious the lives of cornelius nepos the friend of atticus and cicero are composed in the style of the purest age his simplicity is elegant his brevity copious he exhibits a series of men and manners and with such illustrations as every pedant is not indeed qualified to give this classic biographer may initiate a young student in the history of greece and rome the use of fables or apologues has been approved in every age from ancient india to modern europe they convey in familiar images the truths of morality and prudence and the most childish understanding i advert to the scruples of rousseau will not suppose either that beasts do speak or that men may lie a fable represents the genuine characters of animals and skilful master might extract from pliny and buffon some pleasing lessons of natural history a science well adapted to the taste and capacity of children the latinity of phaedrus is not exempt from an alloy of the silver age but his manner is concise terse and sententious the thracian slave discreetly breathes the spirit of a freeman and when the text is found the style is perspicuous but his fables after a long oblivion were first published by peter pithou from a corrupt manuscript the labors of fifty editors confess the defects of the copy as well as the value of the original and the schoolboy may have been whipped for misapprehending a passage which bentley could not restore and which burman could not explain  my studies were too frequently interrupted by sickness and after a real or nominal residence at kingstonschool of near two years i was finally recalled december      by my mothers death which was occasioned in her thirtyeighth year by the consequences of her last labor i was too young to feel the importance of my loss and the image of her person and conversation is faintly imprinted in my memory the affectionate heart of my aunt catherine porten bewailed a sister and a friend but my poor father was inconsolable and the transport of grief seemed to threaten his life or his reason i can never forget the seen of our first interview some weeks after the fatal event the awful silence the room hung with black the midday tapers his sighs and tears his praises of my mother a saint in heaven his solemn adjuration that i would cherish her memory and imitate her virtues and the fervor with which he kissed and blessed me as the sole surviving pledge of their loves the storm of passion insensibly subsided into calmer melancholy at a convivial meeting of his friends mr gibbon might affect or enjoy a gleam of cheerfulness but his plan of happiness was for ever destroyed and after the loss of his companion he was left alone in a world of which the business and pleasures were to him irksome or insipid after some unsuccessful trials he renounced the tumult of london and the hospitality of putney and buried himself in the rural or rather rustic solitude of buriton from which during several years he seldom emerged  as far back as i can remember the house near putneybridge and churchyard of my maternal grandfather appears in the light of my prper and native home it was there that i was allowed to spend the greatest part of my time in sickness or in health during my school vacations and my parents residence in london and finally after my mothers death three months after that event in the spring of      the commercial ruin of her father mr james porten was accomplished and declared he suddenly absconded but as his effects were not sold nor the house evacuated till the christmas following i enjoyed during the whole year the society of my aunt without much consciousness of her impending fate i feel a melancholy pleasure in repeating my obligations to that excellent woman mrs catherine porten the true mother of my mind as well as of my health her natural good sense was improved by the perusal of the best books in the english language and if her reason was sometimes clouded by prejudice her sentiments were never disguised by hypocrisy or affectation her indulgent tenderness the frankness of her temper and my innate rising curiosity soon removed all distance between us like friends of an equal age we freely conversed on every topic familiar or abstruse and it was her delight and reward to observe the first shoots of my young ideas pain and languor were often soothed by the voice of instruction and amusement and to her kind lessons i ascribe my early and invincible love of reading which i would not exchange for the treasures of india i should perhaps be astonished were it possible to ascertain the date at which a favorite tale was engraved by frequent repetition in my memory the cavern of the winds the palace of felicity and the fatal moment at the end of three months or centuries when prince adolphus is overtaken by time who had worn out so many pair of wings in the pursuit before i left kingston school i was well acquainted with popes homer and the arabian nights entertainments two books which will always please by the moving picture of human manners and specious miracles nor was i then capable of discerning that popes translation is a portrait endowed with every merit excepting that of likeness to the original the verses of pope accustomed my ear to the sound of poetic harmony in the death of hector and the shipwreck of ulysses i tasted the new emotions of terror and pity and seriously disputed with my aunt on the vices and virtues of the heroes of the trojan war from popes homer to drydens virgil was an easy transition but i know not how from some fault in the author the translator or the reader the pious aeneas did not so forcibly seize on my imagination and i derived more pleasure from ovids metamorphoses especially in the fall of phaeton and the speeches of ajax and ulysses my grandfathers flight unlocked the door of a tolerable library and i turned over many english pages of poetry and romance of history and travels where a title attracted my eye without fear or awe i snatched the volume from the shelf and mrs porten who indulged herself in moral and religious speculations was more prone to encourage than to check a curiosity above the strength of a boy this year      the twelfth of my age i shall note as the most propitious to the growth of my intellectual statue  the relies of my grandfathers fortune afforded a bare annuity for his own maintenance and his daughter my worthy aunt who had already passed her fortieth year was left destitute her noble spirit scorned a life of obligation and dependence and after revolving several schemes she preferred the humble industry of keeping a boardinghouse for westminsterschool it is said in the family that she was principally induced to this undertaking by her affection for her nephew whose weak constitution required her constant and unremitted attention s  where she laboriously earned a competence for her old age this singular opportunity of blending the advantages of private and public education decided my father after the christmas holidays in january      i accompanied mrs porten to her new house in collegestreet and was immediately entered in the school of which dr john nicoll was at that time headmaster at first i was alone but my aunts resolution was praised her character was esteemed her friends were numerous and active in the course of some years she became the mother of forty or fifty boys for the most part of family and fortune and as her primitive habitation was too narrow she built and occupied a spacious mansion in deans yard i shall always be ready to join in the common opinion that our public schools which have produced so many eminent characters are the best adapted to the genius and constitution of the english people a boy of spirit may acquire a previous and practical experience of the world and his playfellows may be the future friends of his heart or his interest in a free intercourse with his equals the habits of truth fortitude and prudence will insensibly be matured birth and riches are measured by the standard of personal merit and the mimic scene of a rebellion has displayed in their true colors the ministers and patriots of the rising generation our seminaries of learning do not exactly correspond with the precept of a spartan king that the child should be instructed in the arts which will be useful to the man since a finished scholar may emerge from the head of westminster or eton in total ignorance of the business and conversation of english gentlemen in the latter end of the eighteenth century but these schools may assume the merit of teaching all that they pretend to teach the latin and greek languages they deposit in the hands of a disciple the keys of two valuable chests nor can he complain if they are afterward lost or neglected by his own fault the necessity of leading in equal ranks so many unequal powers of capacity and application will prolong to eight or ten years the juvenile studies which might be dispatched in half that time by the skilful master of a single pupil yet even the repetition of exercise and discipline contributes to fix in a vacant mind the verbal science of grammar and prosody and the private or voluntary student who possesses the sense and spirit of the classics may offend by a false quantity the scrupulous ear of a wellflogged critic for myself i must be content with a very small share of the civil and literary fruits of a public school in the space of two years         0 interrupted by danger and debility i painfully climbed into the third form and my riper age was left to acquire the beauties of the latin and the rudiments of the greek tongue instead of audaciously mingling in the sports the quarrels and the connections of our little world i was still cherished at home under the maternal wing of my aunt and my removal from westminster long preceded the approach of manhood  the violence and variety of my complaints which had excused my frequent absence from westminsterschool at length engaged mrs porten with the advice of physicians to conduct me to bath at the end of the michaelmas vacation    0 she quitted me with reluctance and i remained several months under the care of a trusty maidservant a strange nervous affection which alternately contracted my legs and produced without any visible symptoms the most excruciating pain was ineffectually opposed by the various methods of bathing and pumping from bath i was transported to winchester to the house of a physician and after the failure of his medical skill we had again recourse to the virtues of the bath waters during the intervals of these fits i moved with my father to buriton and putney and a short unsuccessful trial was attempted to renew my attendance at westminsterschool but my infirmities could not be reconciled with the hours and discipline of a public seminary and instead of a domestic tutor who might have watched the favorable moments and gently advanced the progress of my learning my father was too easily content with such occasional teachers as the different places of my residence could supply i was never forced and seldom was i persuaded to admit these lessons yet i read with a clergyman at bath some odes of horace and several episodes of virgil which gave me an imperfect and transient enjoyment of the latin poets it might now be apprehended that i should continue for life an illiterate cripple but as i approached my sixteenth year nature displayed in my favor her mysterious energies my constitution was fortified and fixed and my disorders instead of growing with my growth and strengthening with my strength most wonderfully vanished i have never possessed or abused the insolence of health but since that time few persons have been more exempt from real or imaginary ills and till i am admonished by the gout the reader will no more be troubled with the history of my bodily complaints my unexpected recovery again encouraged the hope of my education and i was placed at esher in surry in the house of the reverend mr philip francis in a pleasant spot which promised to unite the various benefits of air exercise and study january      the translator of horace might have taught me to relish the latin poets had not my friends discovered in a few weeks that he preferred the pleasures of london to the instruction of his pupils my fathers perplexity at this time rather than his prudence was urged to embrace a singular and desperate measure without preparation or delay he carried me to oxford and i was matriculated in the university as a gentleman commoner of magdalen college before i had accomplished the fifteenth year of my age april         the curiosity which had been implanted in my infant mind was still alive and active but my reason was not sufficiently informed to understand the value or to lament the loss of three precious years from my entrance at westminster to my admission at oxford instead of repining at my long and frequent confinement to the chamber or the couch i secretly rejoiced in those infirmities which delivered me from the exercises of the school and the society of my equals as often as i was tolerably exempt from danger and pain reading free desultory reading was the employment and comfort of my solitary hours at westminster my aunt sought only to amuse and indulge me in my stations at bath and winchester at buriton and putney a false compassion respected my sufferings and i was allowed without control or advice to gratify the wanderings of an unripe taste my indiscriminate appetite subsided by degrees in the historic line and since philosophy has exploded all innate ideas and natural propensities i must ascribe this choice to the assiduous perusal of the universal history as the octavo volumes successively appeared this unequal work and a treatise of hearne the ductor historicus referred and introduced me to the greek and roman historians to as many at least as were accessible to an english reader all that i could find were greedily devoured from littleburys lame herodotus and spelmans valuable xenophon to the pompous folios of gordons tacitus and a ragged procopius of the beginning of the last century the cheap acquisition of so much knowledge confirmed my dislike to the study of languages and i argued with mrs porten that were i master of greek and latin i must interpret to myself in english the thoughts of the original and that such extemporary versions must be inferior to the elaborate translations of professed scholars a silly sophism which could not easily be confuted by a person ignorant of any other language than her own from the ancient i leaped to the modern world many crude lumps of speed rapin mezeray davila machiavel father paul bower etc i devoured like so many novels and i swallowed with the same voracious appetite the descriptions of india and china of mexico and peru  my first introduction to the historic scenes which have since engaged so many years of my life must be ascribed to an accident in the summer of      i accompanied my father on a visit to mr hoares in wiltshire but i was less delighted with the beauties of stourhead than with discovering in the library a common book the continuation of echards roman history which is indeed executed with more skill and taste than the previous work to me the reigns of the successors of constantine were absolutely new and i was immersed in the passage of the goths over the danube when the summons of the dinnerbell reluctantly dragged me from my intellectual feast this transient glance served rather to irritate than to appease my curiosity and as soon as i returned to bath i procured the second and third volumes of howels history of the world which exhibit the byzantine period on a larger scale mahomet and his saracens soon fixed my attention and some instinct of criticism directed me to the genuine sources simon ockley an original in every sense first opened my eyes and i was led from one book to another till i had ranged round the circle of oriental history before i was sixteen i had exhausted all that could be learned in english of the arabs and persians the tartars and turks and the same ardour urged me to guess at the french of dherbelot and to construe the barbarous latin of pococks abulfaragius such vague and multifarious reading could not teach me to think to write or to act and the only principle that darted a ray of light into the indigested chaos was an early and rational application to the order of time and place the maps of cellarius and wells imprinted in my mind the picture of ancient geography from stranchius i imbibed the elements of chronology the tables of helvicus and anderson the annals of usher and prideaux distinguished the connection of events and engraved the multitude of names and dates in a clear and indelible series but in the discussion of the first ages i overleaped the bounds of modesty and use in my childish balance i presumed to weigh the systems of scaliger and petavius of marsham and newton which i could seldom study in the originals and my sleep has been disturbed by the difficulty of reconciling the septuagint with the hebrew computation i arrived at oxford with a stock of erudition that might have puzzled a doctor and a degree of ignorance of which a schoolboy would have been ashamed  at the conclusion of this first period of my life i am tempted to enter a protest against the trite and lavish praise of the happiness of our boyish years which is echoed with so much affectation in the world that happiness i have never known that time i have never regretted and were my poor aunt still alive she would bear testimony to the early and constant uniformity of my sentiments it will indeed be replied that i am not a competent judge that pleasure is incompatible with pain that joy is excluded from sickness and that the felicity of a schoolboy consists in the perpetual motion of thoughtless and playful agility in which i was never qualified to excel my name it is most true could never be enrolled among the sprightly race the idle progeny of eton or westminster who foremost may delight to cleave with pliant arm the glassy wave or urge the flying ball the poet may gaily describe the short hours of recreation but he forgets the daily tedious labors of the school which is approached each morning with anxious and reluctant steps  a traveller who visits oxford or cambridge is surprised and edified by the apparent order and tranquillity that prevail in the seats of the english muses in the most celebrated universities of holland germany and italy the students who swarm from different countries are loosely dispersed in private lodgings at the houses of the burghers they dress according to their fancy and fortune and in the intemperate quarrels of youth and wine their swords though less frequently than of old are sometimes stained with each others blood the use of arms is banished from our english universities the uniform habit of the academics the square cap and black gown is adapted to the civil and even clerical profession and from the doctor in divinity to the undergraduate the degrees of learning and age are externally distinguished instead of being scattered in a town the students of oxford and cambridge are united in colleges their maintenance is provided at their own expense or that of the founders and the stated hours of the hall and chapel represent the discipline of a regular and as it were a religious community the eyes of the traveller are attracted by the size or beauty of the public edifices and the principal colleges appear to be so many palaces which a liberal nation has erected and endowed for the habitation of science my own introduction to the university of oxford forms a new era in my life and at the distance of forty years i still remember my first emotions of surprise and satisfaction in my fifteenth year i felt myself suddenly raised from a boy to a man the persons whom i respected as my superiors in age and academical rank entertained me with every mark of attention and civility and my vanity was flattered by the velvet cap and silk gown which distinguish a gentleman commoner from a plebeian student a decent allowance more money than a schoolboy had ever seen was at my own disposal and i might command among the tradesmen of oxford an indefinite and dangerous latitude of credit a key was delivered into my hands which gave me the free use of a numerous and learned library my apartment consisted of three elegant and wellfurnished rooms in the new building a stately pile of magdalen college and the adjacent walks had they been frequented by platos disciples might have been compared to the attic shade on the banks of the ilissus such was the fair prospect of my entrance april        into the university of oxford  a venerable prelate whose taste and erudition must reflect honor on the society in which they were formed has drawn a very interesting picture of his academical life  i was educated says bishop lowth in the university of oxford i enjoyed all the advantages both public and private which that famous seat of learning so largely affords i spent many years in that illustrious society in a wellregulated course of useful discipline and studies and in the agreeable and improving commerce of gentlemen and of scholars in a society where emulation without envy ambition without jealousy contention without animosity incited industry and awakened genius where a liberal pursuit of knowledge and a genuine freedom of thought was raised encouraged and pushed forward by example by commendation and by authority i breathed the same atmosphere that the hookers the chillingworths and the locks had breathed before whose benevolence and humanity were as extensive as their vast genius and comprehensive knowledge who always treated their adversaries with civility and respect who made candor moderation and liberal judgment as much the rule and law as the subject of their discourse and do you reproach me with my education in this place and with my relation to this most respectable body which i shall always esteem my greatest advantage and my highest honor i transcribe with pleasure this eloquent passage without examining what benefits or what rewards were derived by hooker or chillingworth or lock from their academical institution without inquiring whether in this angry controversy the spirit of lowth himself is purified from the intolerant zeal which warburton had ascribed to the genius of the place it may indeed be observed that the atmosphere of oxford did not agree with mr lockes constitution and that the philosopher justly despised the academical bigots who expelled his person and condemned his principles the expression of gratitude is a virtue and a pleasure a liberal mind will delight to cherish and celebrate the memory of its parents and the teachers of science are the parents of the mind i applaud the filial piety which it is impossible for me to imitate since i must not confess an imaginary debt to assume the merit of a just or generous retribution to the university of oxford i acknowledge no obligation and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son as i am willing to disclaim her for a mother i spent fourteen months at magdalen college they proved the fourteen months the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life the reader will pronounce between the school and the scholar but i cannot affect to believe that nature had disqualified me for all literary pursuits the specious and ready excuse of my tender age imperfect preparation and hasty departure may doubtless be alleged nor do i wish to defraud such excuses of their proper weight yet in my sixteenth year i was not devoid of capacity or application even my childish reading had displayed an early though blind propensity for books and the shallow flood might have been taught to flow in a deep channel and a clear stream in the discipline of a wellconstituted academy under the guidance of skilful and vigilant professors i should gradually have risen from translations to originals from the latin to the greek classics from dead languages to living science my hours would have been occupied by useful and agreeable studies the wanderings of fancy would have been restrained and i should have escaped the temptations of idleness which finally precipitated my departure from oxford  perhaps in a separate annotation i may coolly examine the fabulous and real antiquities of our sister universities a question which has kindled such fierce and foolish disputes among their fanatic sons in the mean while it will be acknolwedged that these venerable bodies are sufficiently old to partake of all the prejudices and infirmities of age the schools of oxford and cambridge were founded in a dark age of false and barbarous science and they are still tainted with the vices of their origin their primitive discipline was adapted to the education of priests and monks and the government still remains in the hands of the clergy an order of men whose manners are remote from the present world and whose eyes are dazzled by the light of philosophy the legal incorporation of these societies by the charters of popes and kings had given them a monopoly of the public instruction and the spirit of monopolists is narrow lazy and oppressive their work is more costly and less productive than that of independent artists and the new improvements so eagerly grasped by the competition of freedom are admitted with slow and sullen reluctance in those proud corporations above the fear of a rival and below the confession of an error we may scarcely hope that any reformation will be a voluntary act and so deeply are they rooted in law and prejudice that even the omnipotence of parliament would shrink from an inquiry into the state and abuses of the two universities  the use of academical degrees as old as the thirteenth century is visibly borrowed from the mechanic corporations in which an apprentice after serving his time obtains a testimonial of his skill and a license to practice his trade and mystery it is not my design to depreciate those honors which could never gratify or disappoint my ambition and i should applaud the institution if the degrees of bachelor or licentiate were bestowed as the reward of manly and successful study if the name and rank of doctor or master were strictly reserved for the professors of science who have approved their title to the public esteem  in all the universities of europe excepting our own the languages and sciences and distributed among a numerous list of effective professors the students according to their taste their calling and their diligence apply themselves to the proper masters and in the annual repetition of public and private lectures these masters are assiduously employed our curiosity may inquire what number of professors has been instituted at oxford for i shall now confine myself to my own university by whom are they appointed and what may be the probable chances of merit or incapacity how many are stationed to the three faculties and how many are left for the liberal arts what is the form and what the substance of their lessons but all these questions are silenced by one short and singular answer that in the university of oxford the greater part of the public professors have for these many years given up altogether even the pretense of teaching incredible as the fact may appear i must rest my belief on the positive and impartial evidence of a master of moral and political wisdom who had himself resided at oxford dr adam smith assigns as the cause of their indolence that instead of being paid by voluntary contributions which would urge them to increase the number and to deserve the gratitude of their pupils the oxford professors are secure in the enjoyment of a fixed stipend without the necessity of labor or the apprehension of control it has indeed been observed nor is the observation absurd that excepting in experimental sciences which demand a costly apparatus and a dexterous hand the many valuable treatises that have been published on every subject of learning may now supersede the ancient mode of oral instruction were this principle true in its utmost latitude i should only infer that the offices and salaries which are become useless ought without delay to be abolished but there still remains a material difference between a book and a professor the hour of the lecture inforces attendance attention is fixed by the presence the voice and the occasional questions of the teacher the most idle will carry something away and the more diligent will compare the instructions which they have heard in the school with the volumes which they peruse in their chamber the advice of a skilful professor will adapt a course of reading to every mind and every situation his authority will discover admonish and at last chastise the negligence of his disciples and his vigilant inquiries will ascertain the steps of their literary progress whatever science he professes he may illustrate in a series of discourses composed in the leisure of his closet pronounced on public occasions and finally delivered to the press i observe with pleasure that in the university of oxford dr lowth with equal eloquence and erudition has executed this task in his incomparable praelections on the poetry of the hebrews  the college of st mary magdalen was founded in the fifteenth century by wainfleet bishop of winchester and now consists of a president forty fellows and a number of inferior students it is esteemed one of the largest and most wealthy of our academical corporations which may be compared to the benedictine abbeys of catholic countries and i have loosely heard that the estates belonging to magdalen college which are leased by those indulgent landlords at small quitrents and occasional sines might be raised in the hands of private avarice to an annual revenue of nearly thirty thousand pounds our colleges are supposed to be schools of science as well as of education nor is it unreasonable to expect that a body of literary men devoted to a life of celibacy exempt from the care of their own subsistence and amply provided with books should devote their leisure to the prosecution of study and that some effects of their studies should be manifested to the world the shelves of their library groan under the weight of the benedictine folios of the editions of the fathers and the collections of the middle ages which have issued from the single abbey of st germain de prez at paris a composition of genius must be the offspring of one mind but such works of industry as may be divided among many hands and must be continued during many years are the peculiar province of a laborious community if i inquire into the manufactures of the monks of magdalen if i extend the inquiry to the other colleges of oxford and cambridge a silent blush or a scornful frown will be the only reply the fellows or monks of my time were decent easy men who supinely enjoyed the gifts of the founder their days were filled by a series of uniform employments the chapel and the hall the coffeehouse and the common room till they retired weary and well satisfied to a long slumber from the toil of reading or thinking or writing they had absolved their conscience and the first shoots of learning and ingenuity withered on the ground without yielding any fruits to the owners or the public as a gentleman commoner i was admitted to the society of the fellows and fondly expected that some questions of literature would be the amusing and instructive topics of their discourse their conversation stagnated in a round of college business tory politics personal anecdotes and private scandal their dull and deep potations excused the brisk intemperance of youth and their constitutional toasts were not expressive of the most lively loyalty for the house of hanover a general election was now approaching the great oxfordshire contest already blazed with all the malevolence of partyzeal magdalen college was devoutly attached to the old interest and the names of wenman and dashwood were more frequently pronounced than those of cicero and chrysostom the example of the senior fellows could not inspire the undergraduates with a liberal spirit or studious emulation and i cannot describe as i never knew the discipline of college some duties may possibly have been imposed on the poor scholars whose ambition aspired to the peaceful honors of a fellowship  ascribi quietis ordinibus  deorum but no independent members were admitted below the rank of a gentleman commoner and our velvet cap was the cap of liberty a tradition prevailed that some of our predecessors had spoken latin declamations in the hall but of this ancient custom no vestige remained the obvious methods of public exercises and examinations were totally unknown and i have never heard that either the president or the society interfered in the private economy of the tutors and their pupils  the silence of the oxford professors which deprives the youth of public instruction is imperfectly supplied by the tutors as they are styled of the several colleges instead of confining themselves to a single science which had satisfied the ambition of burman or bernoulli they teach or promise to teach either history or mathematics or ancient literature or moral philosophy and as it is possible that they may be defective in all it is highly probable that of some they will be ignorant they are paid indeed by private contributions but their appointment depends on the head of the house their diligence is voluntary and will consequently be languid while the pupils themselves or their parents are not indulged in the liberty of choice or change the first tutor into whose hands i was resigned appears to have been one of the best of the tribe dr waldegrave was a learned and pious man of a mild disposition strict morals and abstemious life who seldom mingled in the politics or the jollity of the college but his knowledge of the world was confined to the university his learning was of the last rather than of the present age his temper was indolent his faculties which were not of the first rate had been relaxed by the climate and he was satisfied like his fellows with the slight and superficial discharge of an important trust as soon as my tutor had sounded the insufficiency of his disciple in schoollearning he proposed that we should read every morning from ten to eleven the comedies of terence the sum of my improvement in the university of oxford is confined to three or four latin plays and even the study of an elegant classic which might have been illustrated by a comparison of ancient and modern theaters was reduced to a dry and literal interpretation of the authors text during the first weeks i constantly attended these lessons in my tutors room but as they appeared equally devoid of profit and pleasure i was once tempted to try the experiment of a formal apology the apology was accepted with a smile i repeated the offense with less ceremony the excuse was admitted with the same indulgence the slightest motive of laziness or indisposition the most trifling avocation at home or abroad was allowed as a worthy impediment nor did my tutor appear conscious of my absence or neglect had the hour of lecture been constantly filled a single hour was a small portion of my academic leisure no plan of study was recommended for my use no exercises were prescribed for his inspection and at the most precious season of youth whole days and weeks were suffered to elapse without labor or amusement without advice or account i should have listened to the voice of reason and of my tutor his mild behavior had gained my confidence i preferred his society to that of the younger students and in our evening walks to the top of heddingtonhill we freely conversed on a variety of subjects since the days of pocock and hyde oriental learning has always been the pride of oxford and i once expressed an inclination to study arabic his prudence discouraged this childish fancy but he neglected the fair occasion of directing the ardour of a curious mind during my absence in the summer vacation dr waldegrave accepted a college living at washington in sussex and on my return i no longer found him at oxford from that time i have lost sight of my first tutor but at the end of thirty years      he was still alive and the practice of exercise and temperance had entitled him to a healthy old age  the long recess between the trinity and michaelmas terms empties the colleges of oxford as well as the courts of westminster i spent at my fathers house at buriton in hampshire the two months of august and september it is whimsical enough that as soon as i left magdalen college my taste for books began to revive but it was the same blind and boyish taste for the pursuit of exotic history unprovided with original learning unformed in the habits of thinking unskilled in the arts of composition i resolved  to write a book the title of this first essay the age of sesostris was perhaps suggested by voltaires age of lewis xiv which was new and popular but my sole object was to investigate the probable date of the life and reign of the conqueror of asia i was then enamoured of sir john marshams canon chronicus an elaborate work of whose merits and defects i was not yet qualified to judge according to his specious though narrow plan i settled my hero about the time of solomon in the tenth century before the christian era it was therefore incumbent on me unless i would adopt sir isaac newtons shorter chronology to remove a formidable objection and my solution for a youth of fifteen is not devoid of ingenuity in his version of the sacred books manetho the high priest has identified sethosis or sesostris with the elder brother of danaus who landed in greece according to the parian marble fifteen hundred and ten years before christ but in my supposition the high priest is guilty of a voluntary error flattery is the prolific parent of falsehood manethos history of egypt is dedicated to ptolemy philadelphus who derived a fabulous or illegitimate pedigree from the macedonian kings of the race of hercules danaus is the ancestor of hercules and after the failure of the elder branch his descendants the ptolemies are the sole representatives of the royal family and may claim by inheritance the kingdom which they hold by conquest such were my juvenile discoveries at a riper age i no longer presume to connect the greek the jewish and the egyptian antiquities which are lost in a distant cloud nor is this the only instance in which the belief and knowledge of the child are superseded by the more rational ignorance of the man during my stay at buriton my infantlabour was diligently prosecuted without much interruption from company or country diversions and i already heard the music of public applause the discovery of my own weakness was the first symptom of taste on my return to oxford the age of sesostris was wisely relinquished but the imperfect sheets remained twenty years at the bottom of a drawer till in a general clearance of papers november      they were committed to the flames  after the departure of dr waldgrave i was transferred with his other pupils to his academical heir whose literary character did not command the respect of the college dr  well remembered that he had a salary to receive and only forgot that he had a duty to perform instead of guiding the studies and watching over the behavior of his disciple i was never summoned to attend even the ceremony of a lecture and excepting one voluntary visit to his rooms during the eight months of his titular office the tutor and pupil lived in the same college as strangers to each other the want of experience of advice and of occupation soon betrayed me into some improprieties of conduct illchosen company late hours and inconsiderate expense my growing debts might be secret but my frequent absence was visible and scandalous and a tour to bath a visit into buckinghamshire and four excursions to lodon in the same winter were costly and dangerous frolics they were indeed without a meaning as without an excuse the irksomeness of a cloistered life repeatedly tempted me to wander but my chief pleasure was that of traveling and i was too young and bashful to enjoy like a manly oxonian in town the pleasures of london in all these excursions i eloped from oxford i returned to college in a few days i eloped again as if i had been an independent stranger in a hired lodging without once hearing the voice of admonition without once feeling the hand of control yet my time was lost my expenses were multiplied my behavior abroad was unknown folly as well as vice should have awakened the attention of my superiors and my tender years would have justified a more than ordinary degree of restraint and discipline  it might at least be expected that an ecclesiastical school should inculcate the orthodox principles of religion but our venerable mother had contrived to unite the opposite extremes of bigotry and indifference an heretic or unbeliever was a monster in her eyes but she was always or often or sometimes remiss in the spiritual education of her own children according to the statutes of the university every student before he is matriculated must subscribe his assent to the thirtynine articles of the church of england which are signed by more than read and read by more than believe them my insufficient age excused me however from the immediate performance of this legal ceremony and the vice chancellor directed me to return as soon as i should have accomplished my fifteenth year recommending me in the mean while to the instruction of my college my college forgot to instruct i forgot to return and was myself forgotten by the first magistrate of the university without a single lecture either public or private either christian or protestant without any academical subscription without any episcopal confirmation i was left by the dim light of my catechism to grope my way to the chapel and communion table where i was admitted without a question how far or by what means i might be qualified to receive the sacrament such almost incredible neglect was productive of the worst mischiefs from my childhood i had been fond of religious disputation my poor aunt has been often puzzled by the mysteries which she strove to believe nor had the elastic spring been totally broken by the weight of the atmosphere of oxford the blind activity of idleness urged me to advance without armor into the dangerous mazes of controversy and at the age of sixteen i bewildered myself in the errors of the church of rome  the progress of my conversion may tend to illustrate at least the history of my own mind it was not long since dr middletons free inquiry had sounded an alarm in the theological world much ink and much gall had been spilt in the defense of the primitive miracles and the two dullest of their champions were crowned with academic honors by the university of oxford the name of middleton was unpopular and his proscription very naturally led me to peruse his writings and those of his antagonists his bold criticism which approaches the precipice of infidelity produced on my mind a singular effect and had i persevered in the communion of rome i should now apply to my own fortune the prediction of the sybil  via prima salutis quod minime reris graia pandetur ab urbe the elegance of style and freedom of argument were repelled by a shield of prejudice i still revered the character or rather the names of the saints and fathers whom dr middleton exposes nor could he destroy my implicit belief that the gift of miraculous powers was continued in the church during the first four or five centuries of christianity but i was unable to resist the weight of historical evidence that within the same period most of the leading doctrines of popery were already introduced in theory and practice nor was my conclusion absurd that miracles are the test of truth and that the church must be orthodox and pure which was so often approved by the visible interposition of the deity the mavelous tales which are so boldly attested by the basils and chrysostoms the austins and jeroms compelled me to embrace the superior merits of celibacy the institution of the monastic life the use of the sign of the cross of holy oil and even of images the invocation of saints the worship of relics the rudiments of purgatory in prayers for the dead and the tremendous mystery of the sacrifice of the body and blood of christ which insensibly swelled into the prodigy of transubstantiation in these dispositions and already more than half a convert i formed an unlucky intimacy with a young gentleman of our college whose name i shall spare with a character less resolute mr  had imbibed the same religious opinions and some popish books i know not through what channel were conveyed into his possession i read i applauded i believed the english translations of two famous works of bossuet bishop of meaux the exposition of the catholic doctrine and the history of the protestant variations achieved my conversion and i surely fell by a noble hand mr gibbon never talked with me on the subject of his conversion to popery but once and then he imputed his change to the works of parsons the jesuit who lived in the reign of elizabeth and who he said had urged all the best arguments in favor of the roman catholic religion  i have since examined the originals with a more discerning eye and shall not hesitate to pronounce that bossuet is indeed a master of all the weapons of controversy in the exposition a specious apology the orator assumes with consummate art the tone of candor and simplicity and the tenhorned monster is transformed at his magic touch into the milkwhite hind who must be loved as soon as she is seen in the history a bold and wellaimed attack he displays with a happy mixture of narrative and argument the faults and follies the changes and contradictions of our first reformers whose variations as he dexterously contends are the mark of historical error while the perpetual unity of the catholic church is the sign and test of infallible truth to my present feelings it seems incredible that i should ever believe that i believed in transubstantiation but my conqueror oppressed me with the sacramental words hoc est corpus meum and dashed against each other the figurative halfmeanings of the protestant sects every objection was resolved into omnipotence and after repeating at st marys the athanasian creed i humbly acquiesced in the mystery of the real presence to take up half on trust and half of try name it not faith but bungling bigotry both knave and fool the merchant we may call to pay great sums and to compound the small for who would break with heaven and would not break for all no sooner had i settled my new religion than i resolved to profess myself a catholic youth is sincere and impetuous and a momentary glow of enthusiasm had raised me above all temporal considerations he described the letter to his father announcing his conversion as written with all the pomp the dignity and selfsatisfaction of a martyr   by the keen protestants who would gladly retaliate the example of persecution a clamor is raised of the increase of popery and they are always loud to declaim against the toleration of priests and jesuits who pervert so many of his majestys subjects from their religion and allegiance on the present occasion the fall of one or more of her sons directed this clamor against the university and it was confidently affirmed that popish missionaries were suffered under various disguises to introduce themselves into the colleges of oxford but justice obliges me to declare that as far as relates to myself this assertion is false and that i never conversed with a priest or even with a papist till my resolution from books was absolutely fixed in my last excursion to london i addressed myself to mr lewis a roman catholic bookseller in russellstreet covent garden who recommended me to a priest of whose name and order i am at present ignorant in our first interview he soon discovered that persuasion was needless after sounding the motives and merits of my conversion he consented to admit me into the pale of the church and at his feet on the eighth of june      i solemnly though privately abjured the errors of heresy the seduction of an english youth of family and fortune was an act of as much danger as glory but he bravely overlooked the danger of which i was not then sufficiently informed where a person is reconciled to the sea of rome or procures others to be reconciled the offense says blackstone amounts to high treason and if the humanity of the age would prevent the execution of this sanguinary statute there were other laws of a less odious cast which condemned the priest to perpetual imprisonment and transferred the proselytes estate to his nearest relation an elaborate controversial epistle approved by my director and addressed to my father announced and justified the step which i had taken my father was neither a bigot nor a philosopher but his affection deplored the loss of an only son and his good sense was astonished at my strange departure from the religion of my country in the first sally of passion he divulged a secret which prudence might have suppressed and the gates of magdalen college were for ever shut against my return many years afterward when the name of gibbon was become as notorious as that of middleton it was industriously whispered at oxford that the historian had formerly turned papist my character stood exposed to the reproach of inconstancy and this invidious topic would have been handled without mercy by my opponents could they have separated my cause from that of the university for my own part i am proud of an honest sacrifice of interest to conscience i can never blush if my tender mind was entangled in the sophistry that seduced the acute and manly understandings of chillingworth and bail who afterward emerged from supersition to skepticism  while charles the first goverened england and was himself governed by a catholic queen it cannot be denied that the missionaries of rome labored with impunity and success in the court the country and even the universities one of the sheep  whom the grim wolf with privy paw daily devours apace and nothing said is mr william chillingworth master of arts and fellow of trinity college oxford who at the ripe age of twentyeight years was persuaded to elope from oxford to the english seminary at douay in flanders some disputes with fisher a subtle jesuit might first awaken him from the prejudices of education but he yielded to his own victorious argument that there must be somewhere an infallible judge and that the church of rome is the only christian society which either does or can pretend to that character after a short trial of a few months mr chillingworth was again tormented by religious scruples he returned home resumed his studies unravelled his mistakes and delivered his mind from the yoke of authority and superstition his new creed was built on the principle that the bible is our sole judge and private reason our sole interpreter and he ably maintains this principle in the religion of a protestant a book which after startling the doctors of oxford is still esteemed the most solid defense of the reformation the learning the virtue the recent merits of the author entitled him to fair preferment but the slave had now broken his fetters and the more he weighed the less was he disposed to subscribe to the thirtynine articles of the church of england in a private letter he declares with all the energy of language that he could not subscribe to them without subscribing to his own damnation and that if ever he should depart from this immovable resolution he would allow his friends to think him a madman or an atheist as the letter is without a date we cannot ascertain the number of weeks or months that elapsed between this passionate abhorrence and the salisbury register which is still extant ego gulielmus chillingworthomnibus hisce articuliset singulis in iisdem contentis volens et ex animo subscribo et consensum meum iisdem praebeo  0 die julii      but alas the chancellor and prebendary of sarum soon deviated from his own subscription as he more deeply scrutinized the article of the trinity neither scripture nor the primitive fathers could long uphold his orthodox belief and he could not but confess that the doctrine of arius is either a truth or at least no damnable heresy from this middle region of the air the descent of his reason would naturally rest on the firmer ground of the socinians and if we may credit a doubtful story and the popular opinion his anxious inquiries at last subsided in philosophic indifference so conspicuous however were the candor of his nature and the innocence of his heart that this apparent levity did not affect the reputation of chillingworth his frequent changes proceeded from too nice an inquisition into truth his doubts grew out of himself he assisted them with all the strength of his reason he was then too hard for himself but finding as little quiet and repose in those victories he quickly recovered by a new appeal to his own judgment so that in all his fallies and retreats he was in fact his own convert  bail was the son of a calvinist minister in a remote province of france at the foot of the pyrenees for the benefit of education the protestants were tempted to risk their children in the catholic universities and in the twentysecond year of his age young bail was seduced by the arts and arguments of the jesuits of thoulouse he remained about seventeen months   th march         th august    0 in their hands a voluntary captive and a letter to his parents which the new convert composed or subscribed   th april    0 is darkly tinged with the spirit of popery but nature had designed him to think as he pleased and to speak as he thought his piety was offended by the excessive worship of creatures and the study of physics convinced him of the impossibility of transubstantiation which is abundantly refuted by the testimony of our senses his return to the communion of a falling sect was a bold and disinterested step that exposed him to the rigor of the laws and a speedy flight to geneva protected him from the resentment of his spiritual tyrants unconscious as they were of the full value of the prize which they had lost had bail adhered to the catholic church had he embraced the ecclesiastical profession the genius and favor of such a proselyte might have aspired to wealth and honors in his native country but the hypocrite would have found less happiness in the comforts of a benefice or the dignity of a mitre than he enjoyed at rotterdam in a private state of exile indigence and freedom without a country or a patron or a prejudice he claimed the liberty and subsisted by the labors of his pen the inequality of his voluminous works is explained and excused by his alternately writing for himself for the booksellers and for posterity and if a severe critic would reduce him to a single folio that relic like the books of the sybil would become still more valuable a calm and lofty spectator of the religious tempest the philosopher of rotterdam condemned with equal firmness the persecution of lewis the fourteenth and the republican maxims of the calvinists their vain prophecies and the intolerant bigotry which sometimes vexed his solitary retreat in reviewing the controversies of the times he turned against each other the arguments of the disputants successively wielding the arms of the catholics and protestants he proves that neither the way of authority nor the way of examination can afford the multitude any test of religious truth and dexterously concludes that custom and education must be the sole grounds of popular belief the ancient paradox of plutarch that atheism is less pernicious than superstition acquires a tenfold vigor when it is adorned with the colors of his wit and pointed with the acuteness of his logic his critical dictionary is a vast repository of facts and opinions and he balances the false religions in his skeptical scales till the opposite quantities if i may use the language of algebra annihilate each other the wonderful power which he so boldly exercised of assembling doubts and objections had tempted him jocosely to assume the title of the  the cloudcompelling jove and in a conversation with the ingenious abbe afterward cardinal de polignac he freely disclosed his universal pyrrhonism i am most truly said bail a protestant for i protest indifferently against all systems and all sects  the academical resentment which i may possibly have provoked will prudently spare this plain narrative of my studies or rather of my idleness and of the unfortunate event which shortened the term of my residence at oxford but it may be suggested that my father was unlucky in the choice of a society and the chance of a tutor it will perhaps be asserted that in the lapse of forty years many improvements have taken place in the college and in the university i am not unwilling to believe that some tutors might have been found more active than dr waldgrave and less contemptible than dr  about the same time and in the same walk a bentham was still treading in the footsteps of a burton whose maxims he had adopted and whose life he had published the biographer indeed preferred the schoollogic to the new philosophy bugursdicius to lock and the hero appears in his own writings a stiff and conceited pedant yet even these men according to the measure of their capacity might be diligent and useful and it is recorded of burton that he taught his pupils what he knew some latin some greek some ethics and metaphysics referring them to proper masters for the languages and sciences of which he was ignorant at a more recent period many students have been attracted by the merit and reputation of sir william scott then a tutor in university college and now conspicuous in the profession of the civil law my personal acquaintance with that gentleman has inspired me with a just esteem for his abilities and knowledge and i am assured that his lectures on history would compose were they given to the public a most valuable treatise under the auspices of the present archbishop of york dr markham himself an eminent scholar a more regular discipline has been introduced as i am told at christ church this was written on the information mr gibbon had received and the observation he had made previous to his late residence at lausanne during his last visit to england he had an opportunity of seeing at sheffieldplace some young men of the college above alluded to he had great satisfaction in conversing with them made many inquiries respecting their course of study applauded the discipline of christ church and the liberal attention shown by the dean to those whose only recommendation was their merit had mr gibbon lived to revise this work i am sure he would have mentioned the name of dr jackson with the highest commendation there are other colleges at oxford with whose discipline my friend was unacquainted to which without doubt he would willingly have allowed their due praise particularly brazen nose and oriel colleges the former under the care of dr cleaver bishop of chester the latter under that of dr eveleigh it is still greatly to be wished that the general expense or rather extravagance of young men at our english universities may be more effectually restrained the expense in which they are permitted to indulge is inconsistent not only with a necessary degree of study but with those habits of morality which should be promoted by all means possible at an early period of life an academical education in england is at present an object of alarm and terror to every thinking parent of moderate fortune it is the apprehension of the expense of the dissipation and other evil consequences which arise from the want of proper restraint at our own universities that forces a number of our english youths to those of scotland and utterly excludes many from any sort of academical instruction if a charge be true which i have heard insisted on that the heads of our colleges in oxford and cambridge are vain of having under their care chiefly men of opulence who may be supposed exempt from the necessity of oeconomical control they are indeed highly censurable since the mischief of allowing early habits of expense and dissipation is great in various respects even to those possessed of large property and the most serious evil from this indulgence must happen to youths of humbler fortune who certainly form the majority of students both at oxford and cambridge s  a course of classical and philosophical studies is proposed and even pursued in that numerous seminary learning has been made a duty a pleasure and even a fashion and several young gentlemen do honor to the college in which they have been educated according to the will of the donor the profit of the second part of lord clarendons history has been applied to the establishment of a ridingschool that the polite exercises might be taught i know not with what success in the university the vinerian professorship is of far more serious importance the laws of his country are the first science of an englishman of rank and fortune who is called to be a magistrate and may hope to be a legislator this judicious institution was coldly entertained by the graver doctors who complained i have heard the complaint that it would take the young people from their books but mr viners benefaction is not unprofitable since it has at least produced the excellent commentaries of sir william blackstone  after carrying me to putney to the house of his friend mr mallet the author of a life of bacon which has been rated above its value of some forgotten poems and plays and of the pathetic ballad of william and margaret  by whose philosophy i was rather scandalized than reclaimed it was necessary for my father to form a new plan of education and to devise some method which if possible might effect the cure of my spiritual malady after much debate it was determined from the advice and personal experience of mr eliot now lord eliot to fix me during some years at lausanne in switzerland mr frey a swiss gentleman of basil undertook the conduct of the journey we left london the   th of june crossed the sea from dover to calais traveled post through several provinces of france by the direct road of st quentin rheims langres and besancon and arrived the  0th of june at lausanne where i was immediately settled under the roof and tuition of mr pavilliard a calvinist minister  the first marks of my fathers displeasure rather astonished than afflicted me when he threatened to banish and disown and disinherit a rebellious son i cherished a secret hope that he would not be able or willing to effect his menaces and the pride of conscience encouraged me to sustain the honorable and important part which i was now acting my spirits were raised and kept alive by the rapid motion of my journey the new and various scenes of the continent and the civility of mr frey a man of sense who was not ignorant of books or the world but after he had resigned me into pavilliards hands and i was fixed in my new habitation i had leisure to contemplate the strange and melancholy prospect before me my first complaint arose from my ignorance of the language in my childhood i had once studied the french grammar and i could imperfectly understand the easy prose of a familiar subject but when i was thus suddenly cast on a foreign land i found myself deprived of the use of speech and of hearing and during some weeks incapable not only of enjoying the pleasures of conversation but even of asking or answering a question in the common intercourse of life to a homebred englishman every object every custom was offensive but the native of any country might have been disgusted with the general aspect of his lodging and entertainment i had now exchanged my elegant apartment in magdalen college for a narrow gloomy street the most unfrequented of an unhandsome town for an old inconvenient house and for a small chamber illcontrived and illfurnished which on the approach of winter instead of a companionable fire must be warmed by the dull invisible heat of a stove from a man i was again degraded to the dependence of a schoolboy mr pavilliard managed my expenses which had been reduced to a diminutive state i received a small monthly allowance for my pocketmoney and helpless and awkward as i have ever been i no longer enjoyed the indispensable comfort of a servant my condition seemed as destitute of hope as it was devoid of pleasure i was separated for an indefinite which appeared an infinite term from my native country and i had lost all connection with my catholic friends i have since reflected with surprise that as the romish clergy of every part of europe maintain a close correspondence with each other they never attempted by letters or messages to rescue me from the hands of the heretics or at least to confirm my zeal and constancy in the profession of the faith such was my first introduction to lausanne a place where i spent nearly five years with pleasure and profit which i afterward revisited without compulsion and which i have finally selected as the most grateful retreat for the decline of my life  but it is the peculiar felicity of youth that the most unpleasing objects and events seldom make a deep or lasting impression it forgets the past enjoys the present and anticipates the future at the flexible age of sixteen i soon learned to endure and gradually to adopt the new forms of arbitrary manners the real hardships of my situation were alienated by time had i been sent abroad in a more splendid style such as the fortune and bounty of my father might have supplied i might have returned home with the same stock of language and science which our countrymen usually import from the continent an exile and a prisoner as i was their example betrayed me into some irregularities of wine of play and of idle excursions but i soon felt the impossibility of associating with them on equal terms and after the departure of my first acquaintance i held a cold and civil correspondence with their successors this seclusion from english society was attended with the most solid benefits in the pays de vaud the french language is used with less imperfection than in most of the distant provinces of france in pavilliards family necessity compelled me to listen and to speak and if i was at first disheartened by the apparent slowness in a few months i was astonished by the rapidity of my progress my pronunciation was formed by the constant repetition of the same sounds the variety of words and idioms the rules of grammar and distinctions of genders were impressed in my memory ease and freedom were obtained by practice correctness and elegance by labor and before i was recalled home french in which i spontaneously thought was more familiar than english to my ear my tongue and my pen the first effect of this opening knowledge was the revival of my love of reading which had been chilled at oxford and i soon turned over without much choice almost all the french books in my tutors library even these amusements were productive of real advantage my taste and judgment were now somewhat riper i was introduced to a new mode of style and literature by the comparison of manners and opinions my views were enlarged my prejudices were corrected and a copious voluntary abstract of the histoire de leglise at de lempire by le sueur may be placed in a middle line between my childish and my manly studies as soon as i was able to converse with the natives i began to feel some satisfaction in their company my awkward timidity was polished and emboldened and i frequented for the first time assemblies of men and women the acquaintance of the pavilliards prepared me by degrees for more elegant society i was received with kindness and indulgence in the best families of lausanne and it was in one of these that i formed an intimate and lasting connection with mr deyverdun a young man of an amiable temper and excellent understanding in the arts of fencing and dancing small indeed was my proficiency and some months were idly wasted in the ridingschool my unfitness to bodily exercise reconciled me to a sedentary life and the horse the favorite of my countrymen never contributed to the pleasures of my youth  my obligations to the lessons of mr pavilliard gratitude will not suffer me to forget he was endowed with a clear head and a warm heart his innate benevolence had assuaged the spirit of the church he was rational because he was moderate in the course of his studies he had acquired a just though superficial knowledge of most branches of literature by long practice he was skilled in the arts of teaching and he labored with assiduous patience to know the character gain the affection and open the mind of his english pupil extract of a letter from m pavilliard to edward gibbon esquire a lausanne ce    juillet      monsieur de gibbon se port tres bien par la grace de dieu et il me paroit quil ne se trouve pas mal de notre maison jai meme lieu de penser quil prend de lattachement pour moi ce dont je suis charm et que je travaillerai a augmenter parce quil aura plus de confiance en moi dans ce que je me propose de lui dire  je nai point encore entrepris de lui parler sur les matieres de religion parce que je nentens pas assez la langue angloise pour soutenir une longue conversation en cette langue quoique je lise les auteurs anglois avec assez de facilite et monsieur de gibbon nentend pas assez de francois mais il y fait beaucoup de progres  je suis sort content de la politesse et de la donceur de caractere de monsieur votre fills et je me flat que je pouvrai toujours vous parler de lui avec eloge il sapplique beaucoup a la lecture   from the same to the same a lausanne ce    aout      monsieur de gibbon se port bien par la grace de dieu je laime et je me suis extremement attache a lui parce quil est doux et tranquille pour ce que regard ses sentimens quoique je ne lui aie encore rien dit la dessus jai lieu desperer quil ouvrira les yeux a la verite je le pense ainsi parce quetant dans mon cabinet il a choisi deux livres de controverse quil a pris dans sa chamber et quil les lit il ma charge de vous offrir ses tres humble respects et de vous demander la permission de le laisser monter au manege cet exercise pourroit contribuer a donner de la force a son corpse cest lidee quil en a     as soon as we began to understand each other he gently led me from a blind and undistinguishing love of reading into the path of instruction i consented with pleasure that a portion of the morninghours should be consecrated to a plan of modern history and geography and to the critical perusal of the french and latin classics and at each step i felt myself invigorated by the habits of application and method his prudence repressed and dissembled some youthful fallies and as soon as i was confirmed in the habits of industry and temperance he gave the reins into my own hands his favorable report of my behavior and progress gradually obtained some latitude of action and expense and he wished to alleviate the hardships of my lodging and entertainment the principles of philosophy were associated with the examples of taste and by a singular chance the book as well as the man which contributed the most effectually to my education has a stronger claim on my gratitude than on my admiration mr de crousaz the adversary of bail and pope is not distinguished by lively fancy or profound reflection and even in his own country at the end of a few years his name and writings are almost obliterated but his philosophy had been formed in the school of lock his divinity in that of limborch and le clerc in a long and laborious life several generations of pupils were taught to think and even to write his lessons rescued the academy of lausanne from calvinistic prejudice and he had the rare merit of diffusing a more liberal spirit among the clergy and people of the pays de vaud his system of logic which in the last editions has swelled to six tedious and prolix volumes may be praised as a clear and methodical abridgment of the art of reasoning from our simple ideas to the most complex operations of the human understanding this system i studied and meditated and abstracted till i have obtained the free command of an universal instrument which i soon presumed to exercise on my catholic opinions pavilliard was not unmindful that his first task his most important duty was to reclaim me from the errors of popery the intermixture of sects has rendered the swiss clergy acute and learned on the topics of controversy and i have some of his letters in which he celebrates the dexterity of his attack and my gradual concessions after a firm and wellmanaged defense m pavilliard has described to me the astonishment with which he gazed on mr gibbon standing before him a thin little figure with a large head disputing and urging with the greatest ability all the best arguments that had ever been used in favor of popery mr gibbon many years ago became very fat and corpulent but he had uncommonly small bones and was very slight made  i was willing and i am now willing to allow him a handsome share of the honor of my conversion yet i must observe that it was principally effected by my private reflections and i still remember my solitary transport at the discovery of a philosophical argument against the doctrine of transubstantiation that the text of scripture which seems to inculcate the real presence is attested only by a single sense  our sight while the real presence itself is disproved by three of our senses  the sight the touch and the taste the various articles of the romish creed disappeared like a dream and after a full conviction on christmas day      i received the sacrament in the church of lausanne it was here that i suspended my religious inquiries acquiescing with implicit belief in the tenets and mysteries which are adopted by the general consent of catholics and protestants letter from mr pavilliard to edward gibbon esquire monsieur june   th      jespere que vous pardonnerez mon long silence en faveur des nouvelles que jai a vous

   march      were my useful studies the foundation of all my future improvements but every man who rises above the common level has received two educations the first from his teachers the second more personal and important from himself he will not like the fanatics of the last age define the moment of grace but he cannot forget the era of his life in which his mind has expanded to its proper form and dimensions my worthy tutor had the good sense and modesty to discorn how far he could be useful as soon as he felt that i advanced beyond his speed and measure he wisely left me to my genius and the hours of lesson were soon lost in the voluntary labor of the whole morning and sometimes of the whole day the desire of prolonging my time gradually confirmed the salutary habit of early rising to which i have always adhered with some regard to seasons and situations but it is happy for my eyes and my health that my temperate ardour has never been seduced to trespass on the hours of the night during the last three years of my residence at lausanne i may assume the merit of serious and solid application but i am tempted to distinguish the last eight months of the year      as the period of the most extraordinary diligence and rapid progress journal december       in finishing this year i must remark how favorable it was to my studies in the space of eight months from the beginning of april i learnt the principles of drawing made myself complete master of the french and latin languages with which i was very superficially acquainted before and wrote and translated a great deal in both read ciceros epistles ad familiares his brutus all his orations his dialogues de amicitia and de senectute terence twice and plinys epistles in french giannones history of naples and labbe banniers mythology and m de boehats memoirs sur la suisse and wrote a very ample relation of my tour i likewise began to study greek and went through the grammar i begun to make very large collections of what i read but what i esteem most of all from the perusal and meditation of de crousazs logic i not only understood the principles of that science but formed my mind to a habit of thinking and reasoning i had no idea of before  in my french and latin translations i adopted an excellent method which from my own success i would recommend to the imitation of students i chose some classic writer such as cicero and vertot the most approved for purity and elegance of style i translated for instance an epistle of cicero into french and after throwing it aside till the words and phrases were obliterated from my memory i retranslated my french into such latin as i could find and then compared each sentence of my imperfect version with the ease the grace the propriety of the roman orator a similar experiment was made on several pages of the revolutions of vertot i turned them into latin returned them after a sufficient interval into my own french and again scrutinized the resemblance or dissimilitude of the copy and the original by degrees i was less ashamed by degrees i was more satisfied with myself and i persevered in the practice of these double translations which filled several books till i had acquired the knowledge of both idioms and the command at least of a correct style this useful exercise of writing was accompanied and succeeded by the more pleasing occupation of reading the best authors the perusal of the roman classics was at once my exercise and reward dr middletons history which i then appreciated above its true value naturally directed me to the writings of cicero the most perfect editions that of olivet which may adorn the shelves of the rich that of ernesti which should lie on the table of the learned were not in my power for the familiar epistles i used the text and english commentary of bishop ross but my general edition was that of verburgius published at amsterdam in two large volumes in folio with an indifferent choice of various notes i read with application and pleasure all the epistles all the orations and the most important treatises of rhetoric and philosophy and as i read i applauded the observation of quintillian that every student may judge of his own proficiency by the satisfaction which he receives from the roman orator i tasted the beauties of language i breathed the spirit of freedom and i imbibed from his precepts and examples the public and private sense of a man cicero in latin and xenophon in greek are indeed the two ancients whom i would first propose to a liberal scholar not only for the merit of their style and sentiments but for the admirable lessons which may be applied almost to every situation of public and private life ciceros epistles may in particular afford the models of every form of correspondence from the careless effusions of tenderness and friendship to the wellguarded declaration of discreet and dignified resentment after finishing this great author a library of eloquence and reason i formed a more extensive plan of reviewing the latin classics journal january       i determined to read over the latin authors in order and read this year virgil sallust livy velleius paterculus valerius maximus tacitus suetonius quintus curtius justin florus plautus terence and lucretius i also read and meditated lock upon the understanding  under the four divisions of   historians   poets   orators and   philosophers in a chronological series from the days of plautus and sallust to the decline of the language and empire of rome and this plan in the last twentyseven months of my residence at lausanne january       april      i nearly accomplished nor was this review however rapid either hasty or supersicial i indulged myself in a second and even a third perusal of terence virgil horace tacitus etc and studied to imbibe the sense and spirit most congenial to my own i never suffered a difficult or corrupt passage to escape till i had viewed it in every light of which it was susceptible though often disappointed i always consulted the most learned or ingenious commentators torrentius and dacier on horace catrou and servius on virgil lipsius on tacitus meziriac on ovid etc and in the ardour of my inquiries i embraced a large circle of historical and critical erudition my abstracts of each book were made in the french language my observations often branched into particular essays and i can still read without contempt a dissertation of eight folio pages on eight lines        of the fourth georgic of virgil mr deyverdun my friend whose name will be frequently repeated had joined with equal zeal though not with equal perseverance in the same undertaking to him every thought every composition was instantly communicated with him i enjoyed the benefits of a free conversation on the topics of our common studies  but it is scarcely possible for a mind endowed with any active curiosity to be long conversant with the latin classics without aspiring to know the greek originals whom they celebrate as their masters and of whom they so warmly recommend the study and imitation   vos exemplaria graeca nocturna versate manu versate diurna it was now that i regretted the early years which had been wasted in sickness or idleness or mere idle reading that i condemned the perverse method of our schoolmasters who by first teaching the motherlanguage might descend with so much ease and perspicuity to the origin and etymology of a derivative idiom in the nineteenth year of my age i determined to supply this defect and the lessons of pavilliard again contributed to smooth the entrance of the way the greek alphabet the grammar and the pronunciation according to the french accent at my earnest request we presumed to open the iliad and i had the pleasure of beholding though darkly and through a glass the true image of homer whom i had long since admired in an english dress after my tutor had left me to myself i worked my way through about half the iliad and afterward interpreted alone a large portion of xenophon and herodotus but my ardour destitute of aid and emulation was gradually cooled and from the barren task of searching words in a lexicon i withdrew to the free and familiar conversation of virgil and tacitus yet in my residence at lausanne i had laid a solid foundation which enabled me in a more propitious season to prosecute the study of grecian literature  from a blind idea of the usefulness of such abstract science my father had been desirous and even pressing that i should devote some time to the mathematics extract of a letter from m pavilliard to edward gibbon esquire january   th      monsieur vous avez souhaitte que monsieur votre fills sappliquat a lalgebre le gout quil a pour les belles

jespere que quand il vous montrera en detail ce quil sait vous en serez tres content les belles lettres que sont son etude favorite ne loccupent pas entierement il continue les mathematiques et son

quil noublie presque rien de ce quil apprend je nai pas moins lieu detre content de sa conduite quoiquil etude beaucoup il voit cependant compagnie mais il ne voit que des persons dont le commerce peut lui etre utile     nor could i refuse to comply with so reasonable a wish during two winters i attended the private lectures of monsieur de traytorrens who explained the elements of algebra and geometry as far as the conic sections of the marquis de lhopital and appeared satisfied with my diligence and improvement journal january       i began to study algebra under m de traytorrens went through the elements of algebra and geometry and the three first books of the marquis de lhopitals conic sections i also read tibullus catullus propertius horace with daciers and torrentiuss notes virgil ovids epistles with meziriacs commentary the ars amandi and the elegies likewise the augustus and tiberius of suetonius and a latin translation of dion cassius from the death of julius caesar to the death of augustus i also continued my correspondence begun last year with m allemand of bex and the professor breitinger of zurich and opened a new one with the professor gesner of gottingen  n b last year and this i read st johns gospel with part of xenophons cyropoedia the iliad and herodotus but upon the whole i rather neglected my greek    but as my childish propensity for numbers and calculations was totally extinct i was content to receive the passive impression of my professors lectures without any active exercise of my own powers as soon as i understood the principles i relinquished for ever the pursuit of the mathematics nor can i lament that i desisted before my mind was hardened by the habit of rigid demonstration so destructive of the siner feelings of moral evidence which must however determine the actions and opinions of our lives i listened with more pleasure to the proposal of studying the law of nature and nations which was taught in the academy of lausanne by mr vicat a professor of some learning and reputation but instead of attending his public or private course i preferred in my closet the lessons of his masters and my own reason without being disgusted by grotius or puffendorf i studied in their writings the duties of a man the rights of a citizen the theory of justice it is alas a theory and the laws of peace and war which have had some influence on the practice of modern europe my fatigues were alleviated by the good sense of their commentator barbeyrac lockes treatise of government instructed me in the knowledge of whig principles which are rather founded in reason than experience but my delight was in the frequent perusal of montesquieu whose energy of style and boldness of hypothesis were powerful to awaken and stimulate the genius of the age the logic of de crousaz had prepared me to engage with his master lock and his antagonist bail of whom the former may be used as a bridle and the latter applied as a spur to the curiosity of a young philosopher according to the nature of their respective works the schools of argument and objection i carefully went through the essay on human understanding and occasionally consulted the most interesting articles of the philosophic dictionary in the infancy of my reason i turned over as an idle amusement the most serious and important treatise in its maturity the most trifling performance could exercise my taste or judgment and more than once i have been led by a novel into a deep and instructive train of thinking but i cannot forbear to mention three particular books since they may have remotely contributed to form the historian of the roman empire   from the provincial letters of pascal which almost every year i have perused with new pleasure i learned to manage the weapon of grave and temperate irony even on subjects of ecclesiastical solemnity   the life of julian by the abbe de la bleterie first introduced me to the man and the times and i should be glad to recover my first essay on the truth of the miracle which stopped the rebuilding of the temple of jerusalem   in giannones civil history of naples i observed with a critical eye the progress and abuse of sacerdotal power and the revolutions of italy in the darker ages this various reading which i now conducted with discretion was digested according to the precept and model of mr lock into a large commonplace book a practice however which i do not strenuously recommend the action of the pen will doubtless imprint an idea on the mind as well as on the paper but i much question whether the benefits of this laborious method are adequate to the waste of time and i must agree with dr johnson idler no    that what is twice read is commonly better remembered than what is transcribed  during two years if i forget some boyish excursions of a day or a week i was fixed at lausanne but at the end of the third summer my father consented that i should make the tour of switzerland with pavilliard and our short absence of one month september   st  october  0th      was a reward and relaxation of my assiduous studies from edward gibbon to mrs porten    now for myself as my father has given me leave to make a journey round switzerland we set out tomorrow buy a map of switzerland it will cost you but a shilling and follow me i go by iverdun neufchatel bienne or biel soleurre or solothurn bale or basil bade zurich lucerne and bern the voyage will be of about four weeks so that i hope to find a letter from you waiting for me as my father had given me leave to learn what i had a mind i have learned to ride and learn actually to dance and draw besides that i often give ten or twelve hours a day to my studies i find a great many agreeable people here see them sometimes and can say upon the whole without vanity that though i am the englishman here who spends the least money i am he who is the most generally liked i told you that my father had promised to send me into france and italy i have thanked him for it but if he would follow my plan he will not do it yet a while i never liked young travelers they go too raw to make and great remarks and they lose a time which is in my opinion the most precious part of a mans life my scheme would be to spend this winter at lausanne for though it is a very good place to acquire the air of good company and the french tongue we have no good professors to spend i say the winter at lausanne go into england to see my friends a couple of months and after that finish my studies either at cambridge for after what has passed one cannot think of oxford or at an university in holland if you liked the scheme could you not propose it to my father by metcalf or somebody who has a certain credit over him i forgot to ask you whether in case my father writes to tell me of his marriage would you advise me to compliment my motherinlaw i think so my health is so very regular that i have nothing to say about it  i have been the whole day writing you this letter the preparations for our voyage gave me a thousand interruptions besides that i was obliged to write in english this last reason will seem a paradox but i assure you the french is much more familiar to me i am etc  e gibbon lausanne sept  0         the fashion of climbing the mountains and reviewing the glaciers had not yet been introduced by foreign travelers who seek the sublime beauties of nature but the political face of the country is not less diversified by the forms and spirit of so many various republics from the jealous government of the few to the licentious freedom of the many i contemplated with pleasure the new prospects of men and manners though my conversation with the natives would have been more free and instructive had i possessed the german as well as the french language we passed through most of the principal towns of switzerland neufchatel bienne soleurre arau baden zurich basil and bern in every place we visited the churches arsenals libraries and all the most eminent persons and after my return i digested my notes in fourteen or fifteen sheets of a french journal which i dispatched to my father as a proof that my time and his money had not been misspent had i found this journal among his papers i might be tempted to select some passages but i will not transcribe the printed accounts and it may be sufficient to notice a remarkable spot which left a deep and lasting impression on my memory from zurich we proceeded to the benedictine abbey of einfidlen more commonly styled our lady of the hermits i was astonished by the profuse ostentation of riches in the poorest corner of europe amidst a savage scene of woods and mountains a palace appears to have been erected by magic and it was erected by the potent magic of religion a crowd of palmers and votaries was prostrate before the altar the title and worship of the mother of god provoked my indignation and the lively naked image of superstition suggested to me as in the same place it had done to zuinglius the most pressing argument for the reformation of the church about two years after this tour i passed at geneva a useful and agreeable month but this excursion and some short visits in the pais de vaud did not materially interrupt my studious and sedentary life at lausanne  my thirst of improvement and the languid state of science at lausanne soon prompted me to solicit a literary correspondence with several men of learning whom i had not an opportunity of personally consulting   in the perusal of livy xxx    i had been stopped by a sentence in a speech of hannibal which cannot be reconciled by any torture with his character or argument the commentators dissemble or confess their perplexity it occurred to me that the change of a single letter by substituting odio instead of odio might restore a clear and consistent sense but i wished to weigh my emendation in scales less partial than my own i addressed myself to m crevier see appendix letters no i  the successor of rollin and a professor in the university of paris who had published a large and valuable edition of livy his answer was speedy and polite he praised my ingenuity and adopted my conjecture   i maintained a latin correspondence at first anonymous and afterward in my own name with professor breitinger ditto no iv and v of zurich the learned editor of a septuagint bible in our frequent letters we discussed many questions of antiquity many passages of the latin classics i proposed my interpretations and amendments his censures for he did not spare my boldness of conjecture were sharp and strong and i was encouraged by the consciousness of my strength when i could stand in free debate against a critic of such eminence and erudition   i corresponded on similar topics with the celebrated professor matthew gesner ditto no vi vii and viii  of the university of gottingen and he accepted as courteously as the two former the invitation of an unknown youth but his abilities might possibly be decayed his elaborate letters were feeble and prolix and when i asked his proper direction the vain old man covered half a sheet of paper with the foolish enumeration of his titles and offices   these professors of paris zurich and gottingen were strangers whom i presumed to address on the credit of their name but mr allamand see appendix letters no ii and iii  minister at bex was my personal friend with whom i maintained a more free and interesting correspondence he was a master of language of science and above all of dispute and his acute and flexible logic could support with equal address and perhaps with equal indifference the adverse sides of every possible question his spirit was active but his pen had been indolent mr allamand had exposed himself to much scandal and reproach by an anonymous letter      to the protestants of france in which he labors to persuade them that public worship is the exclusive right and duty of the state and that their numerous assemblies of dissenters and rebels were not authorized by the law or the gospel his style is animated his arguments specious and if the papist may seem to lurk under the mask of a protestant the philosopher is concealed under the disguise of a papist after some trials in france and holland which were defeated by his fortune or his character a genius that might have enlightened or deluded the world was buried in a country living unknown to fame and discontented with mankind est sacrificulus in pago et rusticos decipit as often as private or ecclesiastical business called him to lausanne i enjoyed the pleasure and benefit of his conversation and we were mutually flattered by our attention to each other our correspondence in his absence chiefly turned on lockes metaphysics which he attacked and i defended the origin of ideas the principles of evidence and the doctrine of liberty and found no end in wandering mazes lost by fencing with so skilful a master i acquired some dexterity in the use of my philosophic weapons but i was still the slave of education and prejudice he had some measures to keep and i much suspect that he never showed me the true colors of his secret skepticism  before i was recalled from switzerland i had the satisfaction of seeing the most extraordinary man of the age a poet an historian a philosopher who has filled thirty quartos of prose and verse with his various productions often excellent and always entertaining need i add the name of voltaire after forfeiting by his own misconduct the friendship of the first of kings he retired at the age of sixty with a plentiful fortune to a free and beautiful country and resided two winters      and      in the town or neighborhood of lausanne my desire of beholding voltaire whom i then rated above his real magnitude was easily gratified he received me with civility as an english youth but i cannot boast of any peculiar notice or distinction virgilium vidi tantum  the ode which he composed on his first arrival on the banks of the leman lake o maison d aristippe o jardin depicure etc had been imparted as a secret to the gentleman by whom i was introduced he allowed me to read it twice i knew it by heart and as my discretion was not equal to my memory the author was soon displeased by the circulation of a copy in writing this trivial anecdote i wished to observe whether my memory was impaired and i have the comfort of finding that every line of the poem is still engraved in fresh and indelible characters the highest gratification which i derived from voltaires residence at lausanne was the uncommon circumstance of hearing a great poet declaim his own productions on the stage he had formed a company of gentlemen and ladies some of whom were not destitute of talents a decent theater was framed at monrepos a country house at the end of a suburb dresses and scenes were provided at the expense of the actors and the author directed the rehearsals with the zeal and attention of paternal love in two successive winters his tragedies of zayre alzire zulime and his sentimental comedy of the enfant prodigue were played at the theater of monrepos voltaire represented the characters best adapted to his years lusignan alvarez benassar euphemon his declamation was fashioned to the pomp and cadence of the old stage and he expressed the enthusiasm of poetry rather than the feelings of nature my ardour which soon became conspicuous seldom failed of procuring me a ticket the habits of pleasure fortified my taste for the french theater and that taste has perhaps abated my idolatry for the gigantic genius of shakespeare which is inculcated from our infancy as the first duty of an englishman the wit and philosophy of voltaire his table and theater refined in a visible degree the manners of lausanne and however addicted to study i enjoyed my share of the amusements of society after the representation of monrepos i sometimes supped with the actors i was now familiar in some and acquainted in many houses and my evenings were generally devoted to cards and conversation either in private parties or numerous assemblies  i hesitate from the apprehension of ridicule when i approach the delicate subject of my early love by this word i do not mean the polite attention the gallantry without hope or design which has originated in the spirit of chivalry and is interwoven with the texture of french manners i understand by this passion the union of desire friendship and tenderness which is inflamed by a single female which prefers her to the rest of her sex and which seeks her possession as the supreme or the sole happiness of our being i need not blush at recollecting the object of my choice and though my love was disappointed of success i am rather proud that i was once capable of feeling such a pure and exalted sentiment the personal attractions of mademoiselle susan curchod were embellished by the virtues and talents of the mind her fortune was humble but her family was respectable her mother a native of france had preferred her religion to her country the profession of her father did not extinguish the moderation and philosophy of his temper and he lived content with a small salary and laborious duty in the obscure lot of minister of crassy in the mountains that separate the pays de vaud from the county of burgundy extracts from the journal march      i wrote some critical observations upon plautus march  th i wrote a long dissertation on some lines of virgil june i saw mademoiselle curchod  omnia vincit amor et nos cedamus amori august i went to crassy and staid two days sept   th i went to geneva oct   th i came back to lausanne having passed through crassy nov  st i went to visit m de watteviile at loin and saw mademoiselle curchod in my way through roll nov   th i went to crassy and staid there six days jan      in the three first months of this year i read ovids metamorphoses finished the conic sections with m de traytorrens and went as far as the infinite series i likewise read sir isaac newtons chronology and wrote my critical observations upon it jan   d i saw alzire acted by the society at monrepos voltaire acted alvares dhermanches zamore de st cierge gusman m de gentil monteze and madame denis alzire   in the solitude of a sequestered village he bestowed a liberal and even learned education on his only daughter she surpassed his hopes by her proficiency in the sciences and languages and in her short visits to some relations at lausanne the wit the beauty and erudition of mademoiselle curchod were the theme of universal applause the report of such a prodigy awakened my curiosity i saw and loved i found her learned without pedantry lively in conversation pure in sentiment and elegant in manners and the first sudden emotion was fortified by the habits and knowledge of a more familiar acquaintance she permitted me to make her two or three visits at her fathers house i passed some happy days there in the mountains of burgundy and her parents honorably encouraged the connection in a calm retirement the gay vanity of youth no longer fluttered in her bosom she listened to the voice of truth and passion and i might presume to hope that i had made some impression on a virtuous heart at crassy and lausanne i indulged my dream of felicity but on my return to england i soon discovered that my father would not hear of this strange alliance and that without his consent i was myself destitute and helpless after a painful struggle i yielded to my fate i sighed as a lover i obeyed as a son see oeuvres de rousseau tom xxxiii p       octavo edition as an author i shall not appeal from the judgment or taste or caprice of jean jaques but that extraordinary man whom i admire and pity should have been less precipitate in condemning the moral character and conduct of a stranger  my wound was insensibly healed by time absence and the habits of a new life my cure was accelerated by a faithful report of the tranquillity and cheerfulness of the lady herself and my love subsided in friendship and esteem the minister of crassy soon afterward died his stipend died with him his daughter retired to geneva where by teaching young ladies she earned a hard subsistence for herself and her mother but in her lowest distress she maintained a spotless reputation and a dignified behavior a rich banker of paris a citizen of geneva had the good fortune and good sense to discover and possess this inestimable treasure and in the capital of taste and luxury she resisted the temptations of wealth as she had sustained the hardships of indigence the genius of her husband has exalted him to the most conspicuous station in europe in every change of prosperity and disgrace he has reclined on the bosom of a faithful friend and mademoiselle curchod is now the wife of m necker the minister and perhaps the legislator of the french monarchy  whatsoever have been the fruits of my education they must be ascribed to the fortunate banishment which placed me at lausanne i have sometimes applied to my own fate the verses of pindar which remind an olympic champion that his victory was the consequence of his exile and that at home like a domestic fowl his days might have rolled away inactive or inglorious        thus like the crested bird of mars at home engaged in foul domestic jars and wasted with intestine wars inglorious had thou spent thy vigorous bloom had not seditions civil broils expelled thee from thy native crete and driven thee with more glorious toils the olympic crown in pisas plain to meet   wesps pindar olymp xii if my childish revolt against the religion of my country had not stripped me in time of my academic gown the five important years so liberally improved in the studies and conversation of lausanne would have been steeped in port and prejudice among the monks of oxford had the fatigue of idleness compelled me to read the path of learning would not have been enlightened by a ray of philosophic freedom i should have grown to manhood ignorant of the life and language of europe and my knowledge of the world would have been confined to an english cloister but my religious error fixed me at lausanne in a state of banishment and disgrace the rigid course of discipline and abstinence to which i was condemned invigorated the constitution of my mind and body poverty and pride estranged me from my countrymen one mischief however and in their eyes a serious and irreparable mischief was derived from the success of my swiss education i had ceased to be an englishman at the flexible period of youth from the age of sixteen to twentyone my opinions habits and sentiments were cast in a foreign mould the faint and distant remembrance of england was almost obliterated my native language was grown less familiar and i should have cheerfully accepted the offer of a moderate independence on the terms of perpetual exile by the good sense and temper of pavilliard my yoke was insensibly lightened he left me master of my time and actions but he could neither change my situation nor increase my allowance and with the progress of my years and reason i impatiently sighed for the moment of my deliverance at length in the spring of the year one thousand seven hundred and fiftyeight my father signified his permission and his pleasure that i should immediately return home we were then in the midst of a war the resentment of the french at our taking their ships without a declaration had rendered that polite nation somewhat peevish and difficult they denied a passage to english travelers and the road through germany was circuitous toilsome and perhaps in the neighborhood of the armies exposed to some danger in this perplexity two swiss officers of my acquaintance in the dutch service who were returning to their garrisons offered to conduct me through france as one of their companions nor did we sufficiently reflect that my borrowed name and regimentals might have been considered in case of a discovery in a very serious light i took my leave of lausanne on the   th of april      with a mixture of joy and regret in the firm resolution of revisiting as a man the persons and places which had been so dear to my youth we traveled slowly but pleasantly in a hired coach over the hills of franchecompte and the fertile province of lorraine and passed without accident or inquiry through several fortified towns of the french frontier from thence we entered the wild ardennes of the austrian duchy of luxemburg and after crossing the meuse at liege we traversed the heaths of brabant and reached on the fifteenth day our dutch garrison of bois le duc in our passage through nancy my eye was gratified by the aspect of a regular and beautiful city the work of stanislaus who after the storms of polish royalty reposed in the love and gratitude of his new subjects of lorraine in our halt at maestricht i visited mr de beaufort a learned critic who was known to me by his specious arguments against the five first centuries of the roman history after dropping my regimental companions i stepped aside to visit rotterdam and the hague i wished to have observed a country the monument of freedom and industry but my days were numbered and a longer delay would have been ungraceful i hastened to embark at the brill landed the next day at harwich and proceeded to london where my father awaited my arrival the whole term of my first absence from england was four years ten months and fifteen days  in the prayers of the church our personal concerns are judiciously reduced to the threefold distinction of mind body and estate the sentiments of the mind excite and exercise our social sympathy the review of my moral and literary character is the most interesting to myself and to the public and i may expatiate without reproach on my private studies since they have produced the publc writings which can alone entitle me to the esteem and friendship of my readers the experience of the world inculcates a discreet reserve on the subject of our person and estate and we soon learn that a free disclosure of our riches or poverty would provoke the malice of envy or encourage the insolence of contempt  the only person in england whom i was impatient to see was my aunt porten the affectionate guardian of my tender years i hastened to her house in collegestreet westminster and the evening was spent in the effusions of joy and confidence it was not without some awe and apprehension that i approached the presence of my father my infancy to speak the truth had been neglected at home the severity of his look and language at our last parting still dwelt on my memory nor could i form any notion of his character or my probable reception they were both more agreeable than i could expect the domestic discipline of our ancestors has been relaxed by the philosophy and softness of the age and if my father remembered that he had trembled before a stern parent it was only to adopt with his own son an opposite mode of behavior he received me as a man and a friend all constraint was banished at our first interview and we ever afterward continued on the same terms of easy and equal politeness he applauded the success of my education every word and action was expressive of the most cordial affection and our lives would have passed without a cloud if his economy had been equal to his fortune or if his fortune had been equal to his desires during my absence he had married his second wife miss dorothea patton who was introduced to me with the most unfavourable prejudice i considered his second marriage as an act of displeasure and i was disposed to hate the rival of my mother but the injustice was in my own fancy and the imaginary monster was an amiable and deserving woman i could not be mistaken in the first view of her understanding her knowledge and the elegant spirit of her conversation her polite welcome and her assiduous care to study and gratify my wishes announced at least that the surface would be smooth and my suspicions of art and falsehood were gradually dispelled by the full discovery of her warm and exquisite sensibility after some reserve on my side our minds associated in confidence and friendship and as mrs gibbon had neither children nor the hopes of children we more easily adopted the tender names and genuine characters of mother and of son by the indulgence of these parents i was left at liberty to consult my taste or reason in the choice of place of company and of amusements and my excursions were bounded only by the limits of the island and the measure of my income some faint efforts were made to procure me the employment of secretary to a foreign embassy and i listened to a scheme which would again have transported me to the continent mrs gibbon with seeming wisdom exhorted me to take chambers in the temple and devote my leisure to the study of the law i cannot repent of having neglected her advice few men without the spur of necessity have resolution to force their way through the thorns and thickets of that gloomy labyrinth nature had not endowed me with the bold and ready eloquence which makes itself heard amidst the tumult of the bar and i should probably have been diverted from the labors of literature without acquiring the fame or fortune of a successful pleader i had no need to call to my aid the regular duties of a profession every day every hour was agreeably filled nor have i known like so many of my countrymen the tediousness of an idle life  of the two years may       may    0 between my return to england and the embodying of the hampshire militia i passed about nine months in london and the remainder in the country the metropolis affords many amusements which are open to all it is itself an astonishing and perpetual spectacle to the curious eye and each taste each sense may be gratified by the variety of objects which will occur in the long circuit of a morning walk i assiduously frequented the theaters at a very propitious era of the stage when a constellation of excellent actors both in tragedy and comedy was eclipsed by the meridian brightness of garrick in the maturity of his judgment and vigor of his performance the pleasures of a townlife are within the reach of every man who is regardless of his health his money and his company by the contagion of example i was sometimes seduced but the better habits which i had formed at lausanne induced me to seek a more elegant and rational society and if my search was less easy and successful than i might have hoped i shall at present impute the failure to the disadvantages of my situation and character had the rank and fortune of my parents given them an annual establishment in london their own house would have introduced me to a numerous and polite circle of acquaintance but my fathers taste had always preferred the highest and the lowest company for which he was equally qualified and after a twelve years retirement he was no longer in the memory of the great with whom he had associated i found myself a stranger in the midst of a vast and unknown city and at my entrance into life i was reduced to some dull family parties and some scattered connections which were not such as i should have chosen for myself the most useful friends of my father were the mallets they received me with civility and kindness at first on his account and afterward on my own and if i may use lord chesterfields words i was soon domesticated in their house mr mallet a name among the english poets is praised by an unforgiving enemy for the ease and elegance of his conversation and his wife was not destitute of wit or learning by his assistance i was introduced to lady hervey the mother of the present earl of bristol her age and infirmities confined her at home her dinners were select in the evening her house was open to the best company of both sexes and all nations nor was i displeased at her preference and affectation of the manners the language and the literature of france but my progress in the english world was in general left to my own efforts and those efforts were languid and slow i had not been endowed by art or nature with those happy gifts of confidence and address which unlock every door and every bosom nor would it be reasonable to complain of the just consequences of my sickly childhood foreign education and reserved temper while coaches were rattling through bondstreet i have passed many a solitary evening in my lodging with my books my studies were sometimes interrupted by a sigh which i breathed toward lausanne and on the approach of spring i withdrew without reluctance from the noisy and extensive scene of crowds without company and dissipation without pleasure in each of the twentyfive years of my acquaintance with london            the prospect gradually brightened and this unfavourable picture most properly belongs to the first period after my return from switzerland  my fathers residence in hampshire where i have passed many light and some heavy hours was at buriton near peterssield one mile from the portsmouth road and at the easy distance of fiftyeight miles from london the estate and manner of beriton otherwise buriton were considerable and were sold a few years ago to lord stawell s an old mansion in a state of decay had been converted into the fashion and convenience of a modern house and if strangers had nothing to see the inhabitants had little to desire the spot was not happily chosen at the end of the village and the bottom of the hill but the aspect of the adjacent grounds was various and cheerful the downs commanded a noble prospect and the long hanging woods in sight of the house could not perhaps have been improved by art or expense my father kept in his own hands the whole of the estate and even rented some additional land and whatsoever might be the balance of profit and loss the farm supplied him with amusement and plenty the produce maintained a number of men and horses which were multiplied by the intermixture of domestic and rural servants and in the intervals of labor the favorite team a handsome set of bays or greys was harnessed to the coach the economy of the house was regulated by the taste and prudence of mrs gibbon she prided herself in the elegance of her occasional dinners and from the uncleanly avarice of madame pavilliard i was suddenly transported to the daily neatness and luxury of an english table our immediate neighborhood was rare and rustic but from the verge of our hills as far as chichester and goodwood the western district of sussex was interspersed with noble seats and hospitable families with whom we cultivated a friendly and might have enjoyed a very frequent intercourse as my stay at buriton was always voluntary i was received and dismissed with smilies but the comforts of my retirement did not depend on the ordinary pleasures of the country my father could never inspire me with his love and knowledge of farming i never handled a gun i seldom mounted an horse and my philosophic walks were soon terminated by a shady bench where i was long detained by the sedentary amusement of reading or meditation at home i occupied a pleasant and spacious apartment the library on the same floor was soon considered as my peculiar domain and i might say with truth that i was never less alone than when by myself my sole complaint which i piously suppressed arose from the kind restraint imposed on the freedom of my time by the habit of early rising i always secured a sacred portion of the day and many scattered moments were stolen and employed by my studious industry but the family hours of breakfast of dinner of tea and of supper were regular and long after breakfast mrs gibbon expected my company in her dressing room after tea my father claimed my conversation and the perusal of the newspapers and in the midst of an interesting work i was often called down to receive the visit of some idle neighbors their dinners and visits required in due season a similar return and i dreaded the period of the full moon which was usually reserved for our more distant excursions i could not refuse attending my father in the summer of      to the races at stockbridge reading and odiam where he had entered a horse for the hunters plate and i was not displeased with the sight of our olympic games the beauty of the spot the fleetness of the horses and the gay tumult of the numerous spectators as soon as the militia business was agitated many days were tediously consumed in meetings of deputy lieutenants at petersfield alton and winchester in the close of the same year      sir simeon then mr stewart attempted an unsuccessful contest for the county of southampton against mr leg chancellor of the exchequer a wellknown contest in which lord butes influence was first exerted and censured our canvas at portsmouth and gosport lasted several days but the interruption of my studies was compensated in some degree by the spectacle of english manners and the acquisition of some practical knowledge  if in a more domestic or more dissipated scene my application was somewhat relaxed the love of knowledge was inflamed and gratified by the command of books and i compared the poverty of lausanne with the plenty of london my fathers study at buriton was stuffed with much trash of the last age with much high church divinity and politics which have long since gone to their proper place yet it contained some valuable editions of the classics and the fathers the choice as it should seem of mr law and many english publications of the times had been occasionally added from this slender beginning i have gradually formed a numerous and select library the foundation of my works and the best comfort of my life both at home and abroad on the receipt of the first quarter a large share of my allowance was appropriated to my literary wants i cannot forget the joy with which i exchanged a banknote of twenty pounds for the twenty volumes of the memoirs of the academy of inscriptions nor would it have been easy by any other expenditure of the same sum to have procured so large and lasting a fund of rational amusement at a time when i most assiduously frequented this school of ancient literature i thus expressed my opinion of a learned and various collection which since the year      has been doubled in magnitude though not in merit  une de ces societes qui ont mieux immortalise louis xiv quun ambition souvent pernicieuse aux hommes commencoit deja ces recherches qui reunissent la justesse de lesprit lamenete and lerudition ou lon voit tant des decouvertes et quelquefois ce qui ne cede qua peine aux decouvertes une ignorance modeste et savante the review of my library must be reserved for the period of its maturity but in this place i may allow myself to observe that i am not conscious of having ever bought a book from a motive of ostentation that every volume before it was deposited on the shelf was either read or sufficiently examined and that i soon adopted the tolerating maxim of the elder pliny nullum esse librum tam malum ut non ex aliqua part prodesset i could not yet find leisure or courage to renew the pursuit of the greek language excepting by reading the lessons of the old and new testament every sunday when i attended the family to church the series of my latin authors was less strenuously completed but the acquisition by inheritance or purchase of the best editions of cicero quintilian livy tacitus ovid etc afforded a fair prospect which i seldom neglected i persevered in the useful method of abstracts and observations and a single example may suffice of a note which had almost swelled into a work the solution of a passage of livy xxxviii    involved me in the dry and dark treatises of greaves arbuthnot hooper bernard eisenschmidt gronovius la bar freret etc and in my french essay chap  0 i ridiculously send the reader to my own manuscript remarks on the weights coins and measures of the ancients which were abruptly terminated by the militia drum  as i am now entering on a more ample field of society and study i can only hope to avoid a vain and prolix garrulity by overlooking the vulgar crowd of my acquaintance and confining myself to such intimate friends among books and men as are best entitled to my notice by their own merit and reputation or by the deep impression which they have left on my mind yet i will embrace this occasion of recommending to the young student a practice which about this time i myself adopted after glancing my eye over the design and order of a new book i suspended the perusal till i had finished the task of selfexamination till i had revolved in a solitary walk all that i knew or believed or had thought on the subject of the whole work or of some particular chapter i was then qualified to discern how much the author added to my original stock and i was sometimes satisfied by the agreement i was sometimes armed by the opposition of our ideas the favorite companions of my leisure were our english writers since the revolution they breathe the spirit of reason and liberty and they most seasonably contributed to restore the purity of my own language which had been corrupted by the long use of a foreign idiom by the judicious advice of mr mallet i was directed to the writings of swift and addison wit and simplicity are their common attributes but the style of swift is supported by manly original vigor that of addison is adorned by the female graces of elegance and mildness the old reproach that no british altars had been raised to the muse of history was recently disproved by the first performances of robertson and hume the histories of scotland and of the stuarts i will assume the presumption of saying that i was not unworthy to read them nor will i disguise my different feelings in the repeated perusals the perfect composition the nervous language the wellturned periods of dr robertson inflamed me to the ambitious hope that i might one day tread in his footsteps the calm philosophy the careless inimitable beauties of his friend and rival often forced me to close the volume with a mixed sensation of delight and despair  the design of my first work the essay on the study of literature was suggested by a refinement of vanity the desire of justifying and praising the object of a favorite pursuit in france to which my ideas were confined the learning and language of greece and rome were neglected by a philosophic age the guardian of those studies the academy of inscriptions was degraded to the lowest rank among the three royal societies of paris the new appellation of erudits was contemptuously applied to the successors of lipsius and casaubon and i was provoked to hear see m dalembert discourse preliminaire a lencyclopedie that the exercise of the memory their sole merit had been superseded by the nobler faculties of the imagination and the judgment i was ambitious of proving by my own example as well as by my precepts that all the faculties of the mind may be exercised and displayed by the study of ancient literature i began to select and adorn the various proofs and illustrations which had offered themselves in reading the classics and the first pages or chapters of my essay were composed before my departure from lausanne the hurry of the journey and of the first weeks of my english life suspended all thoughts of serious application but my object was ever before my eyes and no more than ten days from the first to the eleventh of july were suffered to elapse after my summer establishment at buriton my essay was finished in about six weeks and as soon as a fair copy had been transcribed by one of the french prisoners at peterssield i looked round for a critic and judge of my first performance a writer can seldom be content with the doubtful recompense of solitary approbation but a youth ignorant of the world and of himself must desire to weigh his talents in some scales less partial than his own my conduct was natural my motive laudable my choice of dr maty judicious and fortunate by descent and education dr maty though born in holland might be considered as a frenchman but he was fixed in london by the practice of physic and an office in the british museum his reputation was justly founded on the eighteen volumes of the journal britannique which he had supported almost alone with perseverance and success this humble though useful labor which had once been dignisied by the genius of bail and the learning of le clerc was not disgraced by the taste the knowledge and the judgment of maty he exhibits a candid and pleasing view of the state of literature in england during a period of six years january    0  december      and far different from his angry son he handles the rod of criticism with the tenderness and reluctance of a parent the author of the journal britannique sometimes aspires to the character of a poet and philosopher his style is pure and elegant and in his virtues or even in his defects he may be ranked as one of the last disciples of the school of fontenelle his answer to my first letter was prompt and polite after a careful examination he returned my manuscript with some animadversion and much applause and when i visited london in the ensuing winter we discussed the design and execution in several free and familiar conversations in a short excursion to buriton i reviewed my essay according to his friendly advice and after suppressing a third adding a third and altering a third i consummated my first labor by a short preface which is dated february  d      yet i still shrunk from the press with the terrors of virgin modesty the manuscript was safely deposited in my desk and as my attention was engaged by new objects the delay might have been prolonged till i had fulfilled the precept of horace nonumque prematur in annum father sirmond a learned jesuit was still more rigid since he advised a young friend to expect the mature age of fifty before he gave himself or his writings to the public olivet histoire de lacademie francoise tom ii p     the counsel was singular but it is still more singular that it should have been approved by the example of the author sirmond was himself fiftyfive years of age when he published in      his first work an edition of sidonius apollinaris with many valuable annotations see his life before the great edition of his works in five volumes folio paris      e typographia regia  two years elapsed in silence but in the spring of      i yielded to the authority of a parent and complied like a pious son with the wish of my own heart journal march  th       i began my essai sur letude de la litterature and wrote the    first chapters excepting the following ones                 0       before i left switzerland  july   th i again took in hand my essay and in about six weeks finished it from c        excepting           0          and note to c    besides a number of chapters from c    to the end which are now struck out  feb   th      i wrote the chapters of my essay           0    the note to c    and the first part of the preface  april   d      being at length by my fathers advice determined to publish my essay i revised it with great care made many alterations struck out a considerable part and wrote the chapters from        which i was obliged myself to copy out fair  june  0th      finding the printing of my book proceeded but slowly i went up to town where i found the whole was finished i gave becket orders for the presents  0 for lausanne copies for the duke of richmond marquis of carnarvon lords waldegrave litchfield bath granville bute shelbourn chesterfield hardwicke lady hervey sir joseph york sir matthew featherstone m m mallet maty scott wray lord egremont m de bussy mademoiselle la duchess daguilion and m le comte de caylus  great part of these were only my fathers or mallets acquaintance    my private resolves were influenced by the state of europe about this time the belligerent powers had made and accepted overtures of peace our english plenipotentiaries were named to assist at the congress of augsbourg which never met i wished to attend them as a gentleman or a secretary and my father fondly believed that the proof of some literary talents might introduce me to public notice and second the recommendations of my friends after a last revisal i consulted with mr mallet and dr maty who approved the design and promoted the execution mr mallet after hearing me read my manuscript received it from my hands and delivered it into those of becket with whom he made an agreement in my name an easy agreement i required only a certain number of copies and without transferring my property i devolved on the bookseller the charges and profits of the edition dr maty undertook in my absence to correct the sheets he inserted without my knowledge an elegant and flattering epistle to the author which is composed however with so much art that in case of a defeat his favorable report might have been ascribed to the indulgence of a friend for the rash attempt of a young english gentleman the work was printed and published under the title of essai sur letude de la litterature a londres chez t becket et p a de hondt      in a small volume in duodecimo my dedication to my father a proper and pious address was composed the twentyeighth of may dr matys letter is dated the   th of june and i received the first copy june   d at alresford two days before i marched with the hampshire militia some weeks afterward on the same ground i presented my book to the late duke of york who breakfasted in colonel pitts tent by my fathers direction and mallets advice many literary gifts were distributed to several eminent characters in england and france two books were sent to the count de caylus and the duchess daiguillon at paris i had reserved twenty copies for my friends at lausanne as the first fruits of my education and a grateful token of my remembrance and on all these persons i levied an unavoidable tax of civility and compliment it is not surprising that a work of which the style and sentiments were so totally foreign should have been more successful abroad than at home i was delighted by the copious extracts the warm commendations and the flattering predictions of the journals of france and holland and the next year      a new edition i believe at geneva extended the fame or at least the circulation of the work in england it was received with cold indifference little read and speedily forgotten a small impression was slowly dispersed the bookseller murmured and the author had his feelings been more exquisite might have wept over the blunders and baldness of the english translation the publication of my history fifteen years afterward revived the memory of my first performance and the essay was eagerly sought in the shops but i refused the permission which becket solicited of reprinting it the public curiosity was imperfectly satisfied by a pirated copy of the booksellers of dublin and when a copy of the original edition has been discovered in a sale the primitive value of halfacrown has risen to the fanciful price of a guinea or thirty shillings  i have expatiated on the petty circumstances and period of my first publication a memorable era in the life of a student when he ventures to reveal the measure of his mind his hopes and fears are multiplied by the idea of selfimportance and he believes for a while that the eyes of mankind are sixed on his person and performance whatever may be my present reputation it no longer rests on the merit of this first essay and at the end of twentyeight years i may appreciate my juvenile work with the impartiality and almost with the indifference of a stranger in his answer to lady hervey the count de caylus admires or affects to admire les livres sans nombre que mr gibbon a lus et tres bien lus see appendix letter no x  but alas my stock of erudition at that time was scanty and superficial and if i allow myself the liberty of naming the greek masters my genuine and personal acquaintance was consined to the latin classics the most serious defect of my essay is a kind of obscurity and abruptness which always fatigues and may often elude the attention of the reader instead of a precise and proper definition of the title itself the sense of the word litterature is loosely and variously applied a number of remarks and examples historical critical philosophical are heaped on each other without method or connection and if we except some introductory pages all the remaining chapters might indifferently be reversed or transposed the obscurity of many passages is often affected brevis esse laboro obscurus fio the desire of expressing perhaps a common idea with sententious and oracular brevity alas how fatal has been the imitation of montesquieu but this obscurity sometimes proceeds from a mixture of light and darkness in the authors mind from a partial ray which strikes upon an angle instead of spreading itself over the surface of an object after this fair confession i shall presume to say that the essay does credit to a young writer of two and twenty years of age who had read with taste who thinks with freedom and who writes in a foreign language with spirit and elegance the defense of the early history of rome and the new chronology of sir isaac newton form a specious argument the patriotic and political design of the georgies is happily conceived and any probable conjecture which tends to raise the dignity of the poet and the poem deserves to be adopted without a rigid scrutiny some dawnings of a philosophic spirit enlighten the general remarks on the study of history and of man i am not displeased with the inquiry into the origin and nature of the gods of polytheism which might deserve the illustration of a riper judgment upon the whole i may apply to the first labor of my pen the speech of a far superior artist when he surveyed the first productions of his pencil after viewing some portraits which he had painted in his youth my friend sir joshua reynolds acknowledged to me that he was rather humbled than flattered by the comparison with his present works and that after so much time and study he had conceived his improvement to be much greater than he found it to have been  at lausanne i composed the first chapters of my essay in french the familiar language of my conversation and studies in which it was easier for me to write than in my mother tongue after my return to england i continued the same practice without any affectation or design of repudiating as dr bentley would say my vernacular idiom but i should have escaped some antigallican clamor had i been content with the more natural character of an english author i should have been more consistent had i rejected mallets advice of prefixing an english dedication to a french book a confusion of tongues that seemed to accuse the ignorance of my patron the use of a foreign dialect might be excused by the hope of being employed as a negociator by the desire of being generally understood on the continent but my true motive was doubtless the ambition of new and singular fame an englishman claiming a place among the writers of france the latin tongue had been consecrated by the service of the church it was refined by the imitation of the ancients and in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the scholars of europe enjoyed the advantage which they have gradually resigned of conversing and writing in a common and learned idiom as that idiom was no longer in any country the vulgar speech they all stood on a level with each other yet a citizen of old rome might have smiled at the best latinity of the germans and britons and we may learn from the ciceronianus of erasmus how difficult it was found to steer a middle course between pedantry and barbarism the romans themselves had sometimes attempted a more perilous task of writing in a living language and appealing to the taste and judgment of the natives the vanity of tully was doubly interested in the greek memoirs of his own consulship and if he modestly supposes that some latinisms might be detected in his style he is confident of his own skill in the art of isocrates and aristotle and he requests his friend atticus to disperse the copies of his work at athens and in the other cities of greece  ad atticum i    ii   but it must not be forgotten that from infancy to manhood cicero and his contemporaries had read and declaimed and composed with equal diligence in both languages and that he was not allowed to frequent a latin school till he had imbibed the lessons of the greek grammarians and rhetoricians in modern times the language of france has been diffused by the merit of her writers the social manners of the natives the influence of the monarchy and the exile of the protestants several foreigners have seized the opportunity of speaking to europe in this common dialect and germany may plead the authority of leibnitz and frederic of the first of her philosophers and the greatest of her kings the just pride and laudable prejudice of england has restrained this communication of idioms and of all the nations on this side of the alps my countrymen are the least practiced and least perfect in the exercise of the french tongue by sir william temple and lord chesterfield it was only used on occasions of civility and business and their printed letters will not be quoted as models of composition lord bolingbroke may have published in french a sketch of his reflections on exile but his reputation now reposes on the address of voltaire docte sermones utriusque linguae and by his english dedication to queen caroline and his essay on epic poetry it should seem that voltaire himself wished to deserve a return of the same compliment the exception of count hamilton cannot fairly be urged though an irishman by birth he was educated in france from his childhood yet i am surprised that a long residence in england and the habits of domestic conversation did not affect the ease and purity of his inimitable style and i regret the omission of his english verses which might have afforded an amusing object of comparison i might therefore assume the primus ego in patriam etc but with what success i have explored this untrodden path must be left to the decision of my french readers dr maty who might himself be questioned as a foreigner has secured his retreat at my expense je ne crois pas que vous vous piquiez detre moins facile a reconnoitre pour un anglois que lucullus pour un romain my friends at paris have been more indulgent they received me as a countryman or at least as a provincial but they were friends and parisians the copious extracts which were given in the journal etranger by mr suard a judicious critic must satisfy both the author and the public i may here observe that i have never seen in any literary review a tolerable account of my history the manufacture of journals at least on the continent is miserably debased  the defects which maty insinuates ces traits saillans ces figures hardies ce sacrifice de la regle au sentiment et de la cadence a la force are the faults of the youth rather than of the stranger and after the long and laborious exercise of my own language i am conscious that my french style has been ripened and improved  i have already hinted that the publication of my essay was delayed till i had embraced the military profession i shall now amuse myself with the recollection of an active scene which bears no affinity to any other period of my studious and social life  in the outset of a glorious war the english people had been defended by the aid of german mercenaries a national militia has been the cry of every patriot since the revolution and this measure both in parliament and in the field was supported by the country gentlemen or tories who insensibly transferred their loyalty to the house of hanover in the language of mr burke they have changed the idol but they have preserved the idolatry in the act of offering our names and receiving our commissions as major and captain in the hampshire regiment june   th      we had not supposed that we should be dragged away my father from his farm myself from my books and condemned during two years and a half may  0    0  december         to a wandering life of military servitude but a weekly or monthly exercise of thirty thousand provincials would have left them useless and ridiculous and after the pretense of an invasion had vanished the popularity of mr pit gave a sanction to the illegal step of keeping them till the end of the war under arms in constant pay and duty and at a distance from their respective homes when the kings order for our embodying came down it was too late to retreat and too soon to repent the south battalion of the hampshire militia was a small independent corpse of four hundred and seventysix officers and men commanded by lieutenant colonel sir thomas worsley who after a prolix and passionate contest delivered us from the tyranny of the lord lieutenant the duke of bolton my proper station as first captain was at the head of my own and afterward of the grenadier company but in the absence or even in the presence of the two field officers i was entrusted by my friend and my father with the effective labor of dictatig the orders and exercising the battalion with the help of our original journal i could write the history of my bloodless and inglorious campaigns but as these events have lost much of their importance in my own eyes they shall be dispatched in a few words from winchester the first place of assembly june      0 we were removed at our own request for the benefit of a foreign education by the arbitrary and often capricious orders of the waroffice the battalion successively marched to the pleasant and hospitable blandford june    to hilsea barracks a seat of disease and discord september   to cranbrook in the weald of kent december    to the seacoast of dover december    to winchester camp june         to the populous and disorderly town of devizes october    to salisbury february         to our beloved blandford a second time march   and finally to the fashionable resort of southampton june   where the colors were fixed till our final dissolution december    on the beach at dover we had exercised in sight of the gallic shores but the most splendid and useful scene of our life was a four months encampment on winchester down under the command of the earl of effingham our army consisted of the thirtyfourth regiment of foot and six militia corpse the consciousness of our defects was stimulated by friendly emulation we improved our time and opportunities in morning and evening fielddays and in the general reviews the south hampshire were rather a credit than a disgrace to the line in our subsequent quarters of the devizes and blandford we advanced with a quick step in our military studies the ballot of the ensuing summer renewed our vigor and youth and had the militia subsisted another year we might have contested the prize with the most perfect of our brethren  the loss of so many busy and idle hours was not compensated by any elegant pleasure and my temper was insensibly soured by the society of our rustic officers in every state there exists however a balance of good and evil the habits of a sedentary life were usefully broken by the duties of an active profession in the healthful exercise of the field i hunted with a battalion instead of a pack and at that time i was ready at any hour of the day or night to fly from quarters to london from london to quarters on the slightest call of private or regimental business but my principal obligation to the militia was the making me an englishman and a soldier after my foreign education with my reserved temper i should long have continued a stranger in my native country had i not been shaken in this various scene of new faces and new friends had not experience forced me to feel the characters of our leading men the state of parties the forms of office and the operation of our civil and military system in this peaceful service i imbibed the rudiments of the language and science of tactics which opened a new field of study and observation i diligently read and meditated the memoires militaires of quintus icilius mr guichardt the only writer who has united the merits of a professor and a veteran the discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the phalanx and the legion and the captain of the hampshire grenadiers the reader may smile has not been useless to the historian of the roman empire  a youth of any spirit is fired even by the play of arms and in the first sallies of my enthusiasm i had seriously attempted to embrace the regular profession of a soldier but this military fever was cooled by the enjoyment of our mimic bellona who soon unveiled to my eyes her naked deformity how often did i sigh for my proper station in society and letters how often a proud comparison did i repeat the complaint of cicero in the command of a provincial army clitellae bovi sunt impositae est incredibile quam me negotii taedeat non habet satis magnum campum ille tibi non ignotus cursus animi et industriae meae praeclara opera cessat lucem libros urbem domum vos desidero sed feram ut potero sit modo annuum si prorogatur actum est epist ad atticum lib v     from a service without danger i might indeed have retired without disgrace but as often as i hinted a wish of resigning my fetters were rivetted by the friendly entreaties of the colonel the parental authority of the major and my own regard for the honor and welfare of the battalion when i felt that my personal escape was impracticable i bowed my neck to the yoke my servitude was protracted far beyond the annual patience of cicero and it was not till after the preliminaries of peace that i received my discharge from the act of government which disembodied the militia journal january   th       in these seven or eight months of a most disagreeably active life i have had no studies to set down indeed i hardly took a book in my hand the whole time the first two months at blandford i might have done something but the novelty of the thing of which for some time i was so fond as to think of going into the army our fielddays our dinners abroad and the drinking and late hours we got into prevented any serious reflections from the day we marched from blandford i had hardly a moment i could call my own almost continually in motion if i was fixed for a day it was in the guardroom a barrack or an inn our disputes consumed the little time i had left every letter every memorial relative to them fell to my share and our evening conferences were used to hear all the morning hours strike at last i got to dover and sir thomas left us for two months the charm was over i was sick of so hateful a service i was settled in a comparatively quiet situation once more i began to taste the pleasure of thinking  recollecting some thoughts i had formerly had in relation to the system of paganism which i intended to make use of in my essay i resolved to read tully de natura deorum and finished it in about a month i lost some time before i could recover my habit of application  oct   d  our first design was to march through marlborough but finding on inquiry that it was a bad road and a great way about we resolved to push for the devizes in one day though nearly thirty miles we accordingly arrived there about three oclock in the afternoon  nov  d  i have very little to say for this and the following month nothing could be more uniform than the life i led there the little civility of the neighboring gentlemen gave us no opportunity of dining out the time of year did not tempt us to any excursions round the country and at first my indolence and afterward a violent cold prevented my going over to bath i believe in the two months i never dined or lay from quarters i can therefore only set down what i did in the literary way designing to recover my greek which i had somewhat neglected i set myself to read homer and finished the four first books of the iliad with popes translation and notes at the same time to understand the geography of the iliad and particularly the catalogue i read the  th  th  0th   th   th and   th books of strabo in casaubons latin translation i likewise read humes history of england to the reign of henry the seventh just published ingenious but superficial and the journals des scavans for august september and october      with the bibliotheque des sciences etc from july to october both these journals speak very handsomely of my book  december   th       when upon finishing the year i take a review of what i have done i am not dissatisfied with what i did in it upon making proper allowances on the one hand i could begin nothing before the middle of january the deal duty lost me part of february although i was at home part of march and all april yet electioneering is no friend to the muses may indeed though dissipated by our sea parties was pretty quiet but june was absolutely lost upon the march at alton and settling ourselves in camp the four succeeding months in camp allowed me little leisure and less quiet november and december were indeed as much my own as any time can be whilst i remain in the militia but still it is at best not a life for a man of letters however in this tumultuous year besides smaller things which i have set down i read four books of homer in greek six of strabo in latin cicero de natura deorum and the great philosophical and theological work of m de beausobre i wrote in the same time a long dissertation on the succession of naples reviewed sitted for the press and augmented above a fourth my essai sur letude de la litterature  in the six weeks i passed at beriton as i never stirred from it every day was like the former i had neither visits hunting or walking my only resources were myself my books and family conversations  but to me these were great resources  april   th       i waited upon colonel harvey in the morning to get him to apply for me to be brigade major to lord essingham as a post i should be very fond of and for which i am not unfit harvey received me with great goodnature and candor told me he was both willing and able to serve me that indeed he had already applied to lord essingham for      one of his own officers and though there would be more than one brigade major he did not think he could properly recommend two but that if i could get some other person to break the ice he would second it and believed he should succeed should that fail as      was in bad circumstances he believed he could make a compromise with him this was my desire to let me do the duty without pay i went from him to the mallets who promised to get sir charles howard to speak to lord essingham  august   d  i went with ballard to the french church where i heard a most indifferent sermon preached by m       a very bad style a worse pronunciation and action and a very great vacuity of ideas composed this excellent performance upon the whole which is preferable the philosophic method of the english or the rhetoric of the french preachers the first though less glorious is certainly safer for the preacher it is difficult for a man to make himself ridiculous who proposes only to deliver plain sense on a subject he has thoroughly studied but the instant he discovers the least pretensions toward the sublime or the pathetic there is no medium we must either admire or laugh and there are so many various talents requisite to form the character of an orator that it is more than probable we shall laugh as to the advantage of the hearer which ought to be the great consideration the dilemma is much greater excepting in some particular cases where we are blinded by popular prejudices we are in general so well acquainted with our duty that it is almost superfluous to convince us of it it is the heart and not the head that holds out and it is certainly possible by a moving eloquence to rouse the sleeping sentiments of that heart and incite it to acts of virtue unluckily it is not so much acts as habits of virtue we should have in view and the preacher who is inculcating with the eloquence of a bourdaloue the necessity of a virtuous life will dismiss his assembly full of emotions which a variety of other objects the coldness of our northern constitutions and no immediate opportunity of exerting their good resolutions will dissipate in a few moments  august   th  the same reason that carried so many people to the assembly tonight was what kept me away i mean the dancing    th  today sir thomas came to us to dinner the spa has done him a great deal of good for he looks another man pleased to see him we kept bumperizing till after rollcalling sir thomas assuring us every fresh bottle how infinitely soberer he was grown    th  i felt the usual consequences of sir thomass company and lost a morning because i had lost the day before however having finished voltaire i returned to le clerc i mean for the amusement of my leisure hours and laid aside for some time his bibliotheque universelle to look into the bibliotheque choisie which is by far the better work  september   d  colonel wilkes of the buckinghamshire militia dined with us and renewed the acquaintance sir thomas and myself had begun with him at reading i scarcely ever met with a better companion he has inexhaustible spirits infinite wit and humor and a great deal of knowledge he told us himself that in this time of public dissension he was resolved to make his fortune upon this principle he has connected himself closely with lord temple and mr pit commenced a public adversary to lord bute whom he abuses weekly in the north briton and other political papers in which he is concerned this proved a very debauched day we drank a good deal both after dinner and supper and when at last wilkes had retired sir thomas and some others of whom i was not one broke into his room and made him drink a bottle of claret in bed  october  th  the review which lasted about three hours concluded as usual with marching by lord essingham by grand divisions upon the whole considering the camp had done both the winchester and the gosport duties all the summer they behaved very well and made a sine appearance as they marched by i had my usual curiosity to count their files the following is my field return i think it a curiosity i am sure it is more exact than is commonly made to a reviewing general  number of files number of men establishment berkshire grenadiers               0 battalion    w essex grenadiers               0 battalion  0 s gloucester grenadiers  0  0         00 battalion    n gloucester grenadiers               0 battalion    lancashire grenadiers  0  0         00 battalion    wiltshire grenadiers               00 battalion   0 total  0         00 n b the gosport detachment from the lancashire consisted of two hundred and fifty men the buckinghamshire took the winchester duty that day  so that this camp in england supposed complete with only one detachment had under arms on the day of the grand review little more than half their establishment this amazing deficiency though exemplified in every regiment i have seen is an extraordinary military phoenomenon what must it be upon foreign service i doubt whether a nominal army of an hundred thousand men often brings fifty into the field  upon our return to southampton in the evening we found sir thomas worsley  october   st  one of those impulses which it is neither very easy nor very necessary to withstand drew me from longinus to a very different subject the greek calendar last night when in bed i was thinking of a dissertation of m de la nauze upon the roman calendar which i read last year this led me to consider what was the greek and finding myself very ignorant of it i determined to read a short but very excellent abstract of mr dodwells book de cyclis by the famous dr halley it is only twentyfive pages but as i meditated it thoroughly and verified all the calculations it was a very good mornings work  october   th  i looked over a new greek lexicon which i have just received from london it is that of robert constantine lugdun      it is a very large volume in folio in two parts comprising in the whole      pages after the great thesaurus this is esteemed the best greek lexicon it seems to be so of a variety of words for which i looked i always found an exact definition the various senses well distinguished and properly supported by the best authorities however i still prefer the radical method of scapula to this alphabetical one  december   th  i have already given an idea of the gosport duty i shall only add a trait which characterizes admirably our unthinking sailors at a time when they knew that they should infallibly be discharged in a few weeks numbers who had considerable wages due to them were continually jumping over the walls and risquing the losing of it for a few hours amusement at portsmouth    th  we found old captain meard at alresford with the second division of the fourteenth he and all his officers supped with us and made the evening rather a drunken one    th  about the same hour our two corpse paraded to march off they an old corpse of regulars who had been two years quiet in dover castle we part of a young body of militia twothirds of our men recruits of four months standing two of which they had passed upon very disagreeable duty every advantage was on their side and yet our superiority both as to appearance and discipline was so striking that the most prejudiced regular could not have hesitated a moment at the end of the town our two companies separated my fathers struck off for petersfield whilst i continued my rout to alton into which place i marched my company about noon two years six months and fifteen days after my first leaving it i gave the men some beer at rollcalling which they received with great cheerfulness and decency i dined and lay at harrisons where i was received with that oldfashioned breeding which is at once so honorable and so troublesome    d  our two companies were disembodied mine at alton and my fathers at beriton smith marched them over from petersfield they fired three vollies lodged the majors colors delivered up their arms received their money partook of a dinner at the majors expense and then separated with great cheerfulness and regularity thus ended the militia i may say ended since our annual assemblies in may are so very precarious and can be of so little use however our sergeants and drums are still kept up and quartered at the rendezvous of their company and the adjutant remains at southampton in full pay  as this was an extraordinary scene of life in which i was engaged above three years and a half from the date of my commission and above two years and a half from the time of our embodying i cannot take my leave of it without some few reflections when i engaged in it i was totally ignorant of its nature and consequences i offered because my father did without ever imagining that we should be called out till it was too late to retreat with honor indeed i believe it happens throughout that our most important actions have been often determined by chance caprice or some very inadequate motive after our embodying many things contributed to make me support it with great impatience our continual disputes with the duke of bolton our unsettled way of life which hardly allowed me books or leisure for study and more than all the disagreeable society in which i was forced to live  after mentioning my sufferings i must say something of what i found agreeable now it is over i can make the separation much better than i could at the time   the unsettled way of life itself had its advantages the exercise and change of air and of objects amused me at the same time that it fortified my health   a new field of knowledge and amusement opened itself to me that of military affairs which both in my studies and travels will give me eyes for a new world of things which before would have passed unheeded indeed in that respect i can hardly help wishing our battalion had continued another year we had got a fine set of new men all our difficulties were over we were perfectly well clothed and appointed and from the progress our recruits had already made we could promise ourselves that we should be one of the best militia corpse by next summer a circumstance that would have been the more agreeable to me as i am now established the real acting major of the battalion but what i value most is the knowledge it has given me of mankind in general and of my own country in particular the general system of our government the methods of our several offices the departments and powers of their respective officers our provincial and municipal administration the views of our several parties the characters connections and influence of our principal people have been impressed on my mind not by vain theory but by the indelible lessons of action and experience i have made a number of valuable acquaintance and am myself much better known than with my reserved character i should have been in ten years passing regularly my summers at beriton and my winters in london so that the sum of all is that i am glad the militia has been and glad that it is no more     when i complain of the loss of time justice to myself and to the militia must throw the greatest part of that reproach on the first seven or eight months while i was obliged to learn as well as to teach the dissipation of blandford and the disputes of portsmouth consumed the hours which were not employed in the field and amid the perpetual hurry of an inn a barrack or a guardroom all literary ideas were banished from my mind after this long fast the longest which i have ever known i once more tasted at dover the pleasures of reading and thinking and the hungry appetite with which i opened a volume of tullys philosophical works is still present to my memory the last review of my essay before its publication had prompted me to investigate the nature of the gods my inquiries led me to the histoire critique du manicheisme of beausobre who discusses many deep questions of pagan and christian theology and from this rich treasury of facts and opinions i deduced my own consequences beyond the holy circle of the author after this recovery i never relapsed into indolence and my example might prove that in the life most averse to study some hours may be stolen some minutes may be snatched amidst the tumult of winchester camp i sometimes thought and read in my tent in the more settled quarters of the devizes blandford and southampton i always secured a separate lodging and the necessary books and in the summer of      while the new militia was raising i enjoyed at beriton two or three months of literary repose journal may  th       this was my birthday on which i entered into the twentysixth year of my age this gave me occasion to look a little into myself and consider impartially my good and bad qualities it appeared to me upon this inquiry that my character was virtuous incapable of a base action and formed for generous ones but that it was proud violent and disagreeable in society these qualities i must endeavor to cultivate extirpate or restrain according to their different tendency wit i have none my imagination is rather strong than pleasing my memory both capacious and retentive the shining qualities of my understanding are extensiveness and penetration but i want both quickness and exactness as to my situation in life though i may sometimes repine at it it perhaps is the best adapted to my character i can command all the conveniences of life and i can command too that independence that first earthly blessing which is hardly to be met with in a higher or lower fortune when i talk of my situation i must exclude that temporary one of being in the militia though i go through it with spirit and application it is both unfit for and unworthy of me  in forming a new plan of study i hesitated between the mathematics and the greek language both of which i had neglected since my return from lausanne i consulted a learned and friendly mathematician mr george scott a pupil of de moivre and his map of a country which i have never explored may perhaps be more serviceable to others see appendix letter no xi excellent from mr scott to mr gibbon  as soon as i had given the preference to greek the example of scaliger and my own reason determined me on the choice of homer the father of poetry and the bible of the ancients but scaliger ran through the iliad in one and twenty days and i was not dissatisfied with my own diligence for performing the same labor in an equal number of weeks after the first difficulties were surmounted the language of nature and harmony soon became easy and familiar and each day i sailed upon the ocean with a brisker gale and a more steady course      fair wind and blowing fresh apollo sent them quick they reared the mast then spread thunsullied canvas to the gale and the wind filled it roared the fable flood around the bark that ever as the went dashed wide the brine and scudded swift away cowpers homer  ilias a     in the study of a poet who has since become the most intimate of my friends i successively applied many passages and fragments of greek writers and among these i shall notice a life of homer in the opuscula mythologica of gale several books of the geography of strabo and the entire treatise of longinus which from the title and the style is equally worthy of the epithet of sublime my grammatical skill was improved my vocabulary was enlarged and in the militia i acquired a just and indelible knowledge of the first of languages on every march in every journey horace was always in my pocket and often in my hand but i should not mention his two critical epistles the amusement of a morning had they not been accompanied by the elaborate commentary of dr hurd now bishop of worcester on the interesting subjects of composition and imitation of epic and dramatic poetry i presumed to think for myself and thirty closewritten pages in folio could scarcely comprise my full and free discussion of the sense of the master and the pedantry of the servant see vol ii miscellaneous works   after his oracle dr johnson my friend sir joshua reynolds denies all original genius any natural propensity of the mind to one art or science rather than another without engaging in a metaphysical or rather verbal dispute i know by experience that from my early youth i aspired to the character of an historian while i served in the militia before and after the publication of my essay this idea ripened in my mind nor can i paint in more lively colors the feelings of the moment than by transcribing some passages under their respective dates from a journal which i kept at that time  beriton april         in a short excursion from dover  having thought of several subjects for an historical composition i chose the expedition of charles viii of france into italy i read two memoirs of mr de foncemagne in the academy of inscriptions tom xvii p       0  and abstracted them i likewise finished this day a dissertation in which i examine the right of charles viii to the crown of naples and the rival claims of the house of anjou and arragon it consists of ten folio pages besides large notes see vol ii p     beriton august        in a weeks excursion from winchester camp  after having long revolved subjects for my intended historical essay i renounced my first thought of the expedition of charles viii as too remote from us and rather an introduction to great events than great and important in itself i successively chose and rejected the crusade of richard the first the barons wars against john and henry the third the history of edward the black prince the lives and comparisons of henry v and the emperor titus the life of sir philip sidney and that of the marquis of montrose at length i have fixed on sir walter raleigh for my hero his eventful story is varied by the characters of the soldier and sailor the courtier and historian and it may afford such a fund of materials as i desire which have not yet been properly manufactured at present i cannot attempt the execution of this work free leisure and the opportunity of consulting many books both printed and manuscript are as necessary as they are impossible to be attained in my present way of life however to acquire a general insight into my subject and resources i read the life of sir walter raleigh by dr birch his copious article in the general dictionary by the same hand and the reigns of queen elizabeth and james the first in humes history of england  beriton january      in a months absence from the devizes  during this interval of repose i again turned my thoughts to sir walter raleigh and looked more closely into my materials i read the two volumes in quarto of the bacon papers published by dr birch the fragmenta regalia of sir robert naunton mallets life of lord bacon and the political treatises of that great man in the first volume of his works with many of his letters in the second sir william monsons naval tracts and the elaborate life of sir walter raleigh which mr oldys has prefixed to the best edition of his history of the world my subject opens upon me and in general improves upon a nearer prospect  beriton july         during my summer residence  i am afraid of being reduced to drop my hero but my time has not however been lost in the research of his story and of a memorable era of our english annals the life of sir walter raleigh by oldys is a very poor performance a servile panegyric or flat apology tediously minute and composed in a dull and affected style yet the author was a man of diligence and learning who had read every thing relative to his subject and whose ample collections are arranged with perspicuity and method excepting some anecdotes lately revealed in the sidney and bacon papers i know not what i should be able to add my ambition exclusive of the uncertain merit of style and sentiment must be confined to the hope of giving a good abridgment of oldys i i have even the disappointment of finding some parts of this copious work very dry and barren and these parts are unluckily some of the most characteristic raleighs colony of virginia his quarrels with essex the true secret of his conspiracy and above all the detail of his private life the most essential and important to a biographer my best resource would be in the circumjacent history of the times and perhaps in some digressions artfully introduced like the fortunes of the peripatetic philosophy in the portrait of lord bacon but the reigns of elizabeth and james the first are the periods of english history which have been the most variously illustrated and what new lights could i reflect on a subject which has exercised the accurate industry of birch the lively and curious acuteness of walpole the critical spirit of hurd the vigorous sense of mallet and robertson and the impartial philosophy of hume could i even surmount these obstacles i should shrink with terror from the modern history of england where every character is a problem and every reader a friend or an enemy where a writer is supposed to hoist a flag of party and is devoted to damnation by the adverse faction such would be my reception at home and abroad the historian of raleigh must encounter an indifference far more bitter than censure or reproach the events of his life are interesting but his character is ambiguous his actions are obscure his writings are english and his fame is confined to the narrow limits of our language and our island i must embrace a safer and more extensive theme  there is one which i should prefer to all others the history of the liberty of the swiss of that independence which a brave people rescued from the house of austria defended against a dauphin of france and finally sealed with the blood of charles of burgundy from such a theme so full of public spirit of military glory of examples of virtue of lessons of government the dullest stranger would catch fire what might not i hope whose talents whatsoever they may be would be inflamed with the zeal of patriotism but the materials of this history are inaccessible to me fast locked in the obscurity of an old barbarous german dialect of which i am totally ignorant and which i cannot resolve to learn for this sole and peculiar purpose  i have another subject in view which is the contrast of the former history the one a poor warlike virtuous republic which emerges into glory and freedom the other a commonwealth soft opulent and corrupt which by just degrees is precipitated from the abuse to the loss of her liberty both lessons are perhaps equally instructive this second subject is the history of the republic of florence under the house of medicis a period of one hundred and fifty years which rises or descends from the dregs of the florentine democracy to the title and dominion of cosmo de medicis in the grand duchy of tuscany i might deduce a chain of revolutions not unworthy of the pen of vertot singular men and singular events the medicis four times expelled and as often recalled and the genius of freedom reluctantly yielding to the arms of charles v and the policy of cosmo the character and fate of savanerola and the revival of arts and letters in italy will be essentially connected with the elevation of the family and the fall of the republic the medicis stirps quasi fataliter nata ad instauranda vel fovenda studia lipsius ad germanos et gallos epist viii were illustrated by the patronage of learning and enthusiasm was the most formidable weapon of their adversaries on this splendid subject i shall most probably six but when or where or how will it be executed i behold in a dark and doubtful perspective  res alta terra et caligine mersas journal july          the reflections which i was making yesterday i continued and digested today i dont absolutely look on that time as lost but that it might have been better employed than in revolving schemes the execution of which is so far distant i must learn to check these wanderings of my imagination  nov     i dined at the cocoa tree with       who under a great appearance of oddity conceals more real honor good sense and even knowledge than half those who laugh at him we went thence to the play the spanish friar and when it was over returned to the cocoa tree that respectable body of which i have the honor of being a member affords every evening a sight truly english twenty or thirty perhaps of the first men in the kingdom in point of fashion and fortune supping at little tables covered with a napkin in the middle of a coffeeroom upon a bit of cold meat or a sandwich and drinking a glass of punch at present we are full of kings counselors and lords of the bedchamber who having jumped into the ministry make a very singular medley of their old principles and language with their modern ones  nov     i went with mallet to breakfast with garrick and thence to drurylane house where i assisted at a very private rehearsal in the greenroom of a new tragedy of mallets called elvira as i have since seen it acted i shall defer my opinion of it till then but i cannot help mentioning here the surprising versatility of mrs pritchards talents who rehearsed almost at the same time the part of a furious queen in the greenroom and that of a coquette on the stage and passed several times from one to the other with the utmost ease and happiness  dec  0  before i close the year i must balance my accounts  not of money but of time i may divide my studies into four branches   books that i have read for themselves classic writers or capital treatises upon any science such books as ought to be perused with attention and meditated with care of these i read the twenty last books of the iliad twice the three first books of the odyssey the life of homer and longinus    books which i have read or consulted to illustrate the former such as this year blackwalls inquiry into the life and writings of homer burkes sublime and beautiful hurds horace guichards memoires militaires a great variety of passages of the ancients occasionally useful large extracts from mezeriac bail and poter and many memoirs and abstracts from the academy of belles lettres among these i shall only mention here two long and curious suites of dissertations  the one upon the temple of delphi the amphictyonic council and the holy wars by m m hardion and de valois the other upon the games of the grecians by m m burette gedoyne and de la bar   books of amusement and instruction perused at my leisure hours without any reference to a regular plan of study of these perhaps i read too many since i went through the life of erasmus by le clerc and burigny many extracts from le clercs bibliotheques the ciceronianus and colloquies of erasmus barclays argenis terassons sethos voltaires siecle de louis xiv madame de mottevilles memoirs and fontenelles works   compositions of my own i find hardly any except this journal and the extract of hurds horace which like a chapter of montaigne contains many things very different from its title to these four heads i must this year add a fifth   those treatises of english history which i read in january with a view to my now abortive scheme of the life of sir walter raleigh i ought indeed to have known my own mind better before i undertook them upon the whole after making proper allowances i am not dissatisfied with the year  the three weeks which i passed at beriton at the end of this and the beginning of the ensuing year are almost a blank i seldom went out and as the scheme of my traveling was at last entirely settled the hurry of impatience the cares of preparations and the tenderness of friends i was going to quit allowed me hardly any moments for study    the youthful habits of the language and manners of france had left in my mind an ardent desire of revisiting the continent on a larger and more liberal plan according to the law of custom and perhaps of reason foreign travel completes the education of an english gentleman my father had consented to my wish but i was detained above four years by my rash engagement in the militia i eagerly grasped the first moments of freedom three or four weeks in hampshire and london were employed in the preparations of my journey and the farewell visits of friendship and civility my last act in town was to applaud mallets new tragedy of elvira journal january   th       i called upon dr maty in the morning he told me that the duke de nivernois desired to be acquainted with me it was indeed with that view that i had written to maty from beriton to present in my name a copy of my book to him thence i went to becket paid him his bill fiftyfour pounds and gave him back his translation it must be printed though very indifferent my comfort is that my misfortune is not an uncommon one we dined and supped at the mallets    th i went with maty to visit the duke in albemarle street he is a little emaciated figure but appears to possess a good understanding taste and knowledge he offered me very politely letters for paris we dined at our lodgings i went to covent garden to see woodward in bobadil and supped with the mallets at george scotts  journal jan   th       i waited upon lady hervey and the duke de nivernois and received my credentials lady herveys are for m le comte de caylus and madame geoffrin the duke received me civilly but perhaps through matys fault treated me more as a man of letters than as a man of fashion his letters are entirely in that style for the count de caylus and m m de la bleterie de ste palaye caperonier du clos de forcemagne and dalembert i then undressed for the play my father and i went to the rose in the passage of the playhouse where we found mallet with about thirty friends we dined together and went thence into the pit where we took our places in a body ready to silence all opposition however we had no occasion to exert ourselves notwithstanding the malice of party mallets nation connections and indeed imprudence we heard nothing but applause i think it was deserved the plan was borrowed from de la motte but the details and language have great merit a sine vein of dramatic poetry runs through the piece the scenes between the father and son awaken almost every sensation of the human breast and the counsel would have equally moved but for the inconvenience unavoidable upon all theaters that of entrusting fine speeches to indifferent actors the perplexity of the catastrophe is much and i believe justly criticized but another defect made a stronger impression upon me when a poet ventures upon the dreadful situation of a father who condemns his son to death there is no medium the father must either be a monster or a hero his obligations of justice of the public good must be as binding as apparent as perhaps those of the first brutus the cruel necessity consecrates his actions and leaves no room for repentance the thought is shocking if not carried into action in the execution of brutuss sons i am sensible of that fatal necessity without such an example the unsettled liberty of rome would have perished the instant after its birth but alonzo might have pardoned his son for a rash attempt the cause of which was a private injury and whose consequences could never have disturbed an established government he might have pardoned such a crime in any other subject and as the laws could exact only an equal rigor for a son a vain appetite for glory and a mad assectation of heroism could alone have influenced him to exert an unequal and superior severity    a postchaise conveyed me to dover the packet to boulogne and such was my diligence that i reached paris on the   th of january      only thirtysix days after the disbanding of the militia two or three years were loosely defined for the term of my absence and i was left at liberty to spend that time in such places and in such a manner as was most agreeable to my taste and judgment  in this first visit i passed three months and a half january     may   and a much longer space might have been agreeably filled without any intercourse with the natives at home we are content to move in the daily round of pleasure and business and a scene which is always present is supposed to be within our knowledge or at least within our power but in a foreign country curiosity is our business and our pleasure and the traveller conscious of his ignorance and covetous of his time is diligent in the search and the view of every object that can deserve his attention i devoted many hours of the morning to the circuit of paris and the neighborhood to the visit of churches and palaces conspicuous by their architecture to the royal manufactures collections of books and pictures and all the various treasures of art of learning and of luxury an englishman may hear without reluctance that in these curious and costly articles paris is superior to london since the opulence of the french capital arises from the defects of its government and religion in the absence of louis xiv and his successors the louvre has been left unfinished but the millions which have been lavished on the sands of versailles and the morass of marli could not be supplied by the legal allowance of a british king the splendor of the french nobles is confined to their town residence that of the english is more usefully distributed in their country feats and we should be astonished at our own riches if the labors of architecture the spoils of italy and greece which are now scattered from inverary to wilton were accumulated in a few streets between marybone and westminster all superfluous ornament is rejected by the cold frugality of the protestants but the catholic superstition which is always the enemy of reason is often the parent of the arts the wealthy communities of priests and monks expend their revenues in stately edifices and the parish church of st sulpice one of the noblest structures in paris was built and adorned by the private industry of a late cure in this outset and still more in the sequel of my tour my eye was amused but the pleasing vision cannot be fixed by the pen the particular images are darkly seen through the medium of fiveandtwenty years and the narrative of my life must not degenerate into a book of travels journal    fevrier       aujourdhui jai commence ma tournee pour voir les endroits dignes dattention dans la ville daugny ma accompagne nous sommes alles dabord a la bibliotheque de labbaye de st germain des prez ou tout le monde etoit occupe a larrangement dun cabinet de curiosites et a lhopital des invalides ou le dome etoit ferme a cause des reparations quon y faisoit il faut donc differer la visit et la description de ces deux endroits de la nous sommes alles voir lecole militaire comme ce batiment seleve a cote des invalides bien des gens y verroient un moyen assez facile dapprecier les ames differentes de leurs fondateurs dans lun tout est grand et fastueux dans lautre tout est petit et mesquin de petits corpse de logis blancs et assez propres qui au lieu de  00 gentilshommes dont on a parle en contiennent     composent tout letablissement car le manege et les ecuries ne sont rien il est vrai quon dit que ces batimens ne sont quun echaffaudage quon doit oter pour elever le veritable ouvrage sur ces debris il faut bien en effet quon nait pas bati pour leternite puisque dans vingt ans la plupart des poutres se font pourries nous jettames ensuite un coup doeil sur leglise de st sulpice dont la facade le pretexte et le fruit de tant de lotteries nest point encore achevee   but the principal end of my journey was to enjoy the society of a polished and amiable people in whose favor i was strongly prejudiced and to converse with some authors whose conversation as i fondly imagined must be far more pleasing and instructive than their writings the moment was happily chosen at the close of a successful war the british name was respected on the continent  clarum et venerabile nomen gentibus our opinions our fashions even our games were adopted in france a ray of national glory illuminated each individual and every englishman was supposed to be born a patriot and a philosopher for myself i carried a personal recommendation my name and my essay were already known the compliment of having written in the french language entitled me to some returns of civility and gratitude i was considered as a man of letters who wrote for amusement before my departure i had obtained from the duke de nivernois lady hervey the mallets mr walpole etc many letters of recommendation to their private or literary friends of these epistles the reception and success were determined by the character and situation of the persons by whom and to whom they were addressed the seed was sometimes cast on a barren rock and it sometimes multiplied an hundred fold in the production of new shoots spreading branches and exquisite fruit but upon the whole i had reason to praise the national urbanity which from the court has diffused its gentle influence to the shop the cottage and the schools of the men of genius of the age montesquieu and fontenelle were no more voltaire resided on his own estate near geneva rousseau in the preceding year had been driven from his hermitage of montmorency and i blush at my having neglected to seek in this journey the acquaintance of buffon among the men of letters whom i saw dalembert and diderot held the foremost rank in merit or at least in fame i shall content myself with enumerating the wellknown names of the count de caylus of the abbe de la bleterie barthelemy reynal arnaud of messieurs de la condamine du clos de ste palaye de bougainville caperonnier de guignes suard etc without attempting to discriminate the shades of their characters or the degrees of our connection alone in a morning visit i commonly found the artists and authors of paris less vain and more reasonable than in the circles of their equals with whom they mingle in the houses of the rich four days in a week i had a place without invitation at the hospitable tables of mesdames geoffrin and du bocage of the celebrated helvetius and of the baron dolbach in these symposia the pleasures of the table were improved by lively and liberal conversation the company was select though various and voluntary journal fevrier          je sis une visit a labbe de la bleterie qui veut me mener chez la duchess daiguillon je me fis ecrire chez m de bougainville que jai grande envy de connoitre et me rendis ensuite chez le baron dolbach ami de m helvetius cetoit ma premiere visit et le premier pas dans une fort bonne maison le baron a de lesprit et des connoissances et surtout il done souvent et fort bien a diner  fevrier     labbe barthelemy est fort aimable et na de lantiquaire quune tres grande erudition je finis la soiree par un souper tres agreeable chez madame bontems avec m le marquis de mirabeau cet homme est singulier il a assez dimagination pour dix autres et pas assez de sens rassis pour lui seul je lui ai fait beaucoup de questions sur les titres de la noblesse francoise mais tout ce que jen ai pu comprendre cest que person na la dessus des idees bien nets  may       muni dune double lettre de recommandation pour m le comte de caylus je metois imagine que je trouverois reunis en lui lhomme de lettres et lhomme de qualite je le vis trois ou quatre fois et je vis un homme simple uni bon et qui me temoignoit une bonte extreme si je nen ai point profit je lattribue moins a son caractere qua son genre de vie il se leve de grand matin court les atteliers des artistes pendant tout le jour et rentre chez lui a six heurs du soir pour se mettre en robe de chamber et senfermer dans son cabinet le moyen de voir ses amiss  si ces recommendations etoient steriles il y en eut dautres que devinrent aussi fecondes par leurs fuites quelles etoient agreables en else memes dans une capitale comme paris il est necessaire il est just que des lettres de recommendation vous ayent distingue de la soul mais desque la glace est rompue vos connoissances se multiplient et vos nouveaux amiss se font un plaisir de vous en procurer dautres plus nouveaux encore heureux effet de ce caractere ledger et aimable du francois qui a etabli dans paris une douceur et une liberte dans la societe inconnues a lantiquite et encore ignorees des autres nations a londres il faut fair son chemin dans les maisons que ne souvrent quavec peine la on croit vous fair plaisir en vous recevant ici on croit sen fair a soimeme aussi je connois plus de maisons a paris qua londres le fait nest pas vraisemblable mais il est vrai     the society of madame du bocage was more soft and moderate than that of her rivals and the evening conversations of m de foncemagne were supported by the good sense and learning of the principal members of the academy of inscriptions the opera and the italians i occasionally visited but the french theater both in tragedy and comedy was my daily and favorite amusement two famous actresses then divided the public applause for my own part i preferred the consummate art of the clairon to the intemperate sallies of the dumesnil which were extolled by her admirers as the genuine voice of nature and passion fourteen weeks insensibly stole away but had i been rich and independent i should have prolonged and perhaps have fixed my residence at paris  between the expensive style of paris and of italy it was prudent to interpose some months of tranquil simplicity and at the thoughts of lausanne i again lived in the pleasures and studies of my early youth shaping my course through dijon and besancon in the last of which places i was kindly entertained by my cousin acton i arrived in the month of may      on the banks of the leman lake it had been my intention to pass the alps in the autumn but such are the simple attractions of the place that the year had almost expired before my departure from lausanne in the ensuing spring an absence of five years had not made much alteration in manners or even in persons my old friends of both sexes hailed my voluntary return the most genuine proof of my attachment they had been flattered by the present of my book the produce of their soil and the good pavilliard shed tears of joy as he embraced a pupil whose literary merit he might fairly impute to his own labors to my old list i added some new acquaintance and among the strangers i shall distinguish prince lewis of wirtemberg the brother of the reigning duke at whose country house near lausanne i frequently dined a wandering meteor and at length a falling star his light and ambitious spirit had successively dropped from the firmament of prussia of france and of austria and his faults which he styled his misfortunes had driven him into philosophic exile in the pais de vaud he could now moralize on the vanity of the world the equality of mankind and the happiness of a private station his address was affable and polite and as he had shone in courts and armies his memory could supply and his eloquence could adorn a copious fund of interesting anecdotes his first enthusiasm was that of charity and agriculture but the sage gradually lapsed in the saint and prince lewis of wirtemberg is now buried in a hermitage near mayence in the last stage of mystic devotion by some ecclesiastical quarrel voltaire had been provoked to withdraw himself from lausanne and retire to his castle at ferney where i again visited the poet and the actor without seeking his more intimate acquaintance to which i might now have pleaded a better title but the theater which he had founded the actors whom he had formed survived the loss of their master and recent from paris i attended with pleasure at the representation of several tragedies and comedies i shall not descend to specify particular names and characters but i cannot forget a private institution which will display the innocent freedom of swiss manners my favorite society had assumed from the age of its members the proud denomination of the spring  la societe du printems it consisted of fifteen or twenty young unmarried ladies of genteel though not of the very first families the eldest perhaps about twenty all agreeable several handsome and two or three of exquisite beauty at each others houses they assembled almost every day without the control or even the presence of a mother or an aunt they were trusted to their own prudence among a crowd of young men of every nation in europe they laughed they sung they danced they played at cards they acted comedies but in the midst of this careless gaiety they respected themselves and were respected by the men the invisible line between liberty and licentiousness was never trangressed by a gesture a word or a look and their virgin chastity was never sullied by the breath of scandal or suspicion a singular institution expressive of the innocent simplicity of swiss manners after having tasted the luxury of england and paris i could not have returned with satisfaction to the coarse and homely table of madame pavilliard nor was her husband offended that i now entered myself as a pensionaire or boarder in the elegant house of mr de mesery which may be entitled to a short remembrance as it has stood above twenty years perhaps without a parallel in europe the house in which we lodged was spacious and convenient in the best street and commanding from behind a noble prospect over the country and the lake our table was served with neatness and plenty the boarders were select we had the liberty of inviting any guests at a stated price and in the summer the scene was occasionally transferred to a pleasant villa about a league from lausanne the characters of master and mistress were happily suited to each other and to their situation at the age of seventyfive madame de mesery who has survived her husband is still a graceful i had almost said a handsome woman she was alike qualified to preside in her kitchen and her drawing room and such was the equal propriety of her conduct that of two or three hundred foreigners none ever failed in respect none could complain of her neglect and none could ever boast of her favor mesery himself of the noble family of de crousaz was a man of the world a jovial companion whose easy manners and natural fallies maintained the cheerfulness of his house his wit could laugh at his own ignorance he disguised by an air of profusion a strict attention to his interest and in this situation he appeared like a nobleman who spent his fortune and entertained his friends in this agreeable society i resided nearly eleven months may       april      and in this second visit to lausanne among a crowd of my english companions i knew and esteemed mr holroyd now lord sheffield and our mutual attachment was renewed and fortified in the subsequent stages of our italian journey our lives are in the power of chance and a slight variation on either side in time or place might have deprived me of a friend whose activity in the ardour of youth was always prompted by a benevolent heart and directed by a strong understanding journal septembre               et     nous ont quitte le premier est une mechante beat grossier ignorant et sans

lhabitude de la dissipation quon prend si facilement dans les grandes villes ne me permettoient pas de mettre a prosit le tems qui me demeuroit a la verite si jai peu feuillete les livres lobservation de tous les objets curieux qui se presentent dans une grande capitale et la conversation avec les plus grands hommes du siecle mont instruit de beaucoup de chooses que je naurois point trouve dans les livres les sept ou huit derniers mois de cette annee ont ete plus tranquilles des que je me suis vu etabli a lausanne jai entrepris une etude suivie sur la geographie ancienne de litalie mon ardeur sest tres bien foutenue pendant six semaines jusqua la fin du mois de juin ce fut alors quun voyage de geneve interrompit un peu mon assiduite que le sejour de mesery mossrit mill distractions et que la societe de saussure acheva de me fair perdre mon tems je repris mon travail avec ce journal au milieu daout et depuis ce tems jusquau commencement de novembre jai mis a profit tous mes instans javoue que pendant les deux derniers mois mon ardeur sest un peu rallantie iremet dans cette etude suivie jai lu   pres de deux livres de la geographie de strabon sur litalie deux fois   une party du deuxieme livre de lhistoire naturelle de pline   le quatrieme chapitre du deuxieme livre de pomponius mela   les itineraires dantonin et de jerusalem pour ce qui regard litalie je les ai lus avec les

ce moment de vuide par la lecture de juvenal poet qui je ne connoissois encore que de reputation je le lu deux fois avec plaisir et avec soin iiiment pendant lannee jai lu quelques journaux enter autres le journal etranger depuis son commencement un tome des nouvelles de bail et les xxxv premiers volumes de la bibliotheque raisonnee ivment jai beaucoup ecrit de mon recueil geographique de litalie qui est deja bien ample et assez curieux vment je ne dois point oublier ce journal meme qui est devenu un ouvrage     pages en quatre mois et demi et des pages des mieux fournies font un objet considerable aussi sans compter un grand nombre dobservations detachees il sy trouve des dissertations savantes et raisonees celle du passage dannibal contient dix pages et celle sur le guerre sociale en a douze mais ces morceaux sont trop etendus et le journal meme a besoin dune reform qui lui retranche quantite de pieces qui sont assez etrangeres a son veritable plan apres avoir un peu reflechi la dessus voici quelques regles que je me suis faites sur les objets qui lui conviennent iment toute ma vie civil et privee mes amusemens mes liaisons mes ecarts meme et toutes mes reflections qui ne roulent que sur des sujets qui me sont personels je conviens que tout cela nest interessant que pour moi mais aussi ce nest que pour moi que jecris mon journal iiment tout ce que japprens par lobservation ou la conversation a legard de celleci je ne rapporterai que ce que je tiens de persons tout a la sois instruites et veridiques lorsquil est question de faits ou du petit nombre de ceux qui meritent le titre de grand homme sil sagit de sentimens et dopinions iiiment jy mettrai soigneusement tout ce quon peut appeller la party materielle de mes etudes combien dheures jai travaille combien de pages jai ecrit ou lu avec une court notice du sujet quelles contenoient ivment je serois fache de lire fans reflechir sur mes lectures sans porter des jugemens raisonnes sur mes auteurs et sans eplucher avec soin leurs idees et leurs expressions mais toute lecture ne fournit pas egalement il y a des livres quon parcourt et il y en a quon lit il y en a enfin quon doit etudier mes observations sur ceux de la premiere class no peuvent quetre courts et detachees else conviennent au journal celles qui regardent la second class ny entreront quautant quelles auront le meme caractere vment mes reflections sur ce petit nombre dauteurs classiques quon medite avec soin seront naturellement plus approfondies et plus suivies cest pour else et pour des pieces plus etendues et plus originales aux quelles la lecture ou la meditation peut donner lieu que je serai un recueil separe je conserverai cependant fa liaison avec le journal par des renvois constans qui marqueront le numero de chaque piece avec le tems et loccasion de sa composition moyennant ces precautions mon journal ne peut que metre utile ce compte exact de mon tems men sera mieux sentir le prix il dissipera par son detail lillusion quon se fait dinvisager seulement les annees et les mois et de mepriser les heures et les jours je ne dis rien de lagrement cen est un bien grand cependant de pouvoir repasser chaque epoque de sa vie et de se placer des quon le veut au milieu de toutes les petites scenes quon a joue ou quon a vu jouer    avril       jai ete eveille par pavilliard et h     pour arreter une facheuse

unprofitably spent my visits however superficial to the academy of medals and the public libraries opened a new field of inquiry and the view of so many manuscripts of different ages and characters induced me to consult the two great benedictine works the diplomatica of mabillon and the palaeographia of montfaucon istudied the theory without attaining the practice of the art nor should i complain of the intricacy of greek abbreviations and gothic alphabets since every day in a familiar language i am at a loss to decypher the hieroglyphics of a female note in a tranquil scene which revived the memory of my first studies idleness would have been less pardonable the public libraries of lausanne and geneva liberally supplied me with books and if many hours were lost in dissipation many more were employed in literary labor in the country horace and virgil juvenal and ovid were my assiduous companions but in town i formed and executed a plan of study for the use of my transalpine expedition the topography of old rome the ancient geography of italy and the science of medals   i diligently read almost always with my pen in my hand the elaborate treatises of nardini donatus etc which fill the fourth volume of the roman antiquities of graevius   i next undertook and finished the italia antiqua of cluverius a learned native of prussia who had measured on foot every spot and has compiled and digested every passage of the ancient writers these passages in greek or latin authors i perused in the text of cluverius in two folio volumes but i separately read the descriptions of italy by strabo pliny and pomponius mela the catalogues of the epic poets the itineraries of wesselings antoninus and the coasting voyage of rutilius numatianus and i studied two kindred subjects in the mesures itineraires of danville and the copious work of bergier histoire des grands chemins de lempire romain from these materials i formed a table of roads and distances reduced to our english measure filled a folio commonplace book with my collections and remarks on the geography of italy and inferted in my journal many long and learned notes on the insulae and populousness of rome the social war the passage of the alps by hannibal etc   after glancing my eye over addisons agreeable dialogues i more seriously read the great work of ezechiel spanheim de praestantia et usu numismatum and applied with him the medals of the kings and emperors the families and colonies to the illustration of ancient history and thus was i armed for my italian journey journal lausanne avril

tour in which somewhat more than a year april       may      was agreeably employed content with tracing my line of march and slightly touching on my personal feelings i shall wave the minute investigation of the scenes which have been viewed by thousands and described by hundreds of our modern travelers rome is the great object of our pilgrimage and  st the journey  d the residence and  d the return will form the most proper and perspicuous division   i climbed mount cenis and descended into the plain of piedmont not on the back of an elephant but on a light osier seat in the hands of the dextrous and intrepid chairmen of the alps the architecture and government of turin presented the same aspect of tame and tiresome uniformity but the court was regulated with decent and splendid economy and i was introduced to his sardinian majesty see appendix letter no xii charles emanuel who after the incomparable frederic held the second rank proximus longo tamen intervallo among the kings of europe the size and populousness of milan could not surprise an inhabitant of london but the fancy is amused by a visit to the boromean islands an enchanted palace a work of the fairies in the midst of a lake encompassed with mountains and far removed from the haunts of men i was less amused by the marble palaces of genoa than by the recent memorials of her deliverance in december      from the austrian tyranny and i took a military survey of every scene of action within the enclosure of her double walls my steps were detained at parma and modena by the precious relics of the farnese and este collections but alas the far greater part had been already transported by inheritance or purchase to naples and dresden by the road of bologna and the apennine i at last reached florence where i reposed from june to september during the heat of the summer months in the gallery and especially in the tribune i first acknowledged at the feet of the venus of medicis that the chissel may dispute the preeminence with the pencil a truth in the fine arts which cannot on this side of the alps be felt or understood at home i had taken some lessons of italian on the spot i read with a learned native the classics of the tuscan idiom but the shortness of my time and the use of the french language prevented my acquiring any facility of speaking and i was a silent spectator in the conversations of our envoy sir horace mann whose most serious business was that of entertaining the english at his hospitable table journal florence aout  me       cocchi a dine avec nous nous

pisa with the industry of lucca and leghorn and continued my journey through sienna to rome where i arrived in the beginning of october   my temper is not very susceptible of enthusiasm and the enthusiasm which i do not feel i have ever scorned to affect but at the distance of twentyfive years i can neither forget nor express the strong emotions which agitated my mind as i first approached and entered the eternal city after a sleepless night i trod with a lofty step the ruins of the forum each memorable spot where romulus stood or tully spoke or caesar fell was at once present to my eye and several days of intoxication were lost or enjoyed before i could descend to a cool and minute investigation my guide was mr buyers a scotch antiquary of experience and taste but in the daily labor of eighteen weeks the powers of attention were sometimes fatigued till i was myself qualified in a last review to select and study the capital works of ancient and modern art six weeks were borrowed for my tour of naples the most populous of cities relative to its size whose luxurious inhabitants seem to dwell on the consines of paradise and hellsire i was presented to the boyking by our new envoy sir william hamilton who wisely diverting his correspondence from the secretary of state to the royal society and british museum has elucidated a country of such inestimable value to the naturalist and antiquarian on my return i fondly embraced for the last time the miracles of rome but i departed without kissing the feet of rezzonico clement xiii who neither possessed the wit of his predecessor lambertini nor the virtues of his successor ganganelli   in my pilgrimage from rome to loretto i again crossed the apennine from the coast of the adriatic i traversed a fruitful and populous country which could alone disprove the paradox of montesquieu that modern italy is a desert without adopting the exclusive prejudice of the natives i sincerely admire the paintings of the bologna school i hastened to escape from the sad solitude of ferrara which in the age of caesar was still more desolate the spectacle of venice afforded some hours of astonishment the university of padua is a dying taper but verona still boasts her amphitheatre and his native vicenza is adorned by the classic architecture of palladio the road of lombardy and piedmont did montesquieu find them without inhabitants led me back to milan turin and the passage of mount cenis where i again crossed the alps in my way to lions  the use of foreign travel has been often debated as a general question but the conclusion must be finally applied to the character and circumstances of each individual with the education of boys where or how they may pass over some juvenile years with the least mischief to themselves or others i have no concern but after supposing the previous and indispensable requisites of age judgment a competent knowledge of men and books and a freedom from domestic prejudices i will briefly describe the qualifications which i deem most essential to a traveller he should be endowed with an active indefatigable vigor of mind and body which can seize every mode of conveyance and support with a careless smile every hardship of the road the weather or the inn the benefits of foreign travel will correspond with the degrees of these qualifications but in this sketch those to whom i am known will not accuse me of framing my own panegyric it was at rome on the   th of october      as i sat musing amidst the ruins of the capitol while the barefooted friars were singing vespers in the temple of jupiter now the church of the zoccolants or franciscan friars  that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind but my original plan was circumscribed to the decay of the city rather than of the empire and though my reading and reflections began to point toward that object some years elapsed and several avocations intervened before i was seriously engaged in the execution of that laborious work  i had not totally renounced the southern provinces of france but the letters which i found at lions were expressive of some impatience rome and italy had satiared my curious appetite and i was now ready to return to the peaceful retreat of my family and books after a happy fortnight i reluctantly left paris embarked at calais again landed at dover after an interval of two years and five months and hastily drove through the summer dust and solitude of london on the   th of june      i arrived at my fathers house and the five years and a half between my travels and my fathers death    0 are the portion of my life which i passed with the least enjoyment and which i remember with the least satisfaction every spring i attended the monthly meeting and exercise of the militia at southampton and by the resignation of my father and the death of sir thomas worsley i was successively promoted to the rank of major and lieutenant colonel commandant but i was each year more disgusted with the inn the wine the company and the tiresome repetition of annual attendance and daily exercise at home the economy of the family and farm still maintained the same creditable appearance my connection with mrs gibbon was mellowed into a warm and solid attachment my growing years abolished the distance that might yet remain between a parent and a son and my behavior satisfied my father who was proud of the success however imperfect in his own lifetime of my literary talents our solitude was soon and often enlivened by the visit of the friend of my youth mr deyverdun whose absence from lausanne i had sincerely lamented about three years after my first departure he had emigrated from his native lake to the banks of the oder in germany the res angusta domi the waste of a decent patrimony by an improvident father obliged him like many of his countrymen to confide in his own industry and he was entrusted with the education of a young prince the grandson of the margrave of schavedt of the royal family of prussia our friendship was never cooled our correspondence was sometimes interrupted but i rather wished than hoped to obtain mr deyverdun for the companion of my italian tour an unhappy though honorable passion drove him from his german court and the attractions of hope and curiosity were fortified by the expectation of my speedy return to england during four successive summers he passed several weeks or months at beriton and our free conversations on every topic that could interest the heart or understanding would have reconciled me to a desert or a prison in the winter months of london my sphere of knowledge and action was somewhat enlarged by the many new acquaintance which i had contracted in the militia and abroad and i must regret as more than an acquaintance mr godfrey clarke of derbyshire an amiable and worthy young man who was snatched away by an untimely death a weekly convivial meeting was established by myself and travelers under the name of the roman club the members were lord mountstuart now earl of bute colonel edmonstone weddal palgrave lord berkley godfrey clarke holroyd lord shesfield major ridley sir william guize sir john aubrey lord abingdon hon peregrine bertie cleaver hon john damer hon george damer lord milton sir thomas gascoygne sir john hort e gibbon   the renewal or perhaps the improvement of my english life was embittered by the alteration of my own feelings at the age of twentyone i was in my proper station of a youth delivered from the yoke of education and delighted with the comparative state of liberty and affluence my silial obedience was natural and easy and in the gay prospect of futurity my ambition did not extend beyond the enjoyment of my books my leisure and my patrimonial estate undisturbed by the cares of a family and the duties of a profession but in the militia i was armed with power in my travels i was exempt from control and as i approached as i gradually passed my thirtieth year i began to feel the desire of being master in my own house the most gentle authority will sometimes frown without reason the most cheerful submission will sometimes murmur without cause and such is the law of our imperfect nature that we must either command or obey that our personal liberty is supported by the obsequiousness of our own dependants while so many of my acquaintance were married or in parliament or advancing with a rapid step in the various roads of honor and fortune i stood alone immovable and insignificant for after the monthly meeting of    0 i had even withdrawn myself from the militia by the resignation of an empty and barren commission my temper is not susceptible of envy and the view of successful merit has always excited my warmest applause the miseries of a vacant life were never known to a man whose hours were insufficient for the inexhaustible pleasures of study but i lamented that at the proper age i had not embraced the lucrative pursuits of the law or of trade the chances of civil office or india adventure or even the fat slumbers of the church and my repentance became more lively as the loss of time was more irretrievable experience showed me the use of grafting my private consequence on the importance of a great professional body the benefits of those firm connections which are cemented by hope and interest by gratitude and emulation by the mutual exchange of services and favors from the emoluments of a profession i might have derived an ample fortune or a competent income instead of being stinted to the same narrow allowance to be increased only by an event which i sincerely deprecated the progress and the knowledge of our domestic disorders aggravated my anxiety and i began to apprehend that i might be left in my old age without the fruits either of industry or inheritance  in the first summer after my return whilst i enjoyed at beriton the society of my friend deyverdun our daily conversations expatiated over the field of ancient and modern literature and we freely discussed my studies my first essay and my future projects the decline and fall of rome i still contemplated at an awful distance but the two historical designs which had balanced my choice were submitted to his taste and in the parallel between the revolutions of florence and switzerland our common partiality for a country which was his by birth and mine by adoption inclined the scale in favor of the latter according to the plan which was soon conceived and digested i embraced a period of two hundred years from the association of the three peasants of the alps to the plenitude and prosperity of the helvetic body in the sixteenth century i should have described the deliverance and victory of the swiss who have never shed the blood of their tyrants but in a field of battle the laws and manners of the confederate states the splendid trophies of the austrian burgundian and italian wars and the wisdom of a nation who after some sallies of martial adventure has been content to guard the blessings of peace with the sword of freedom   manus haec inimica tyrannis ense petit placidam sub liberate quietem my judgment as well as my enthusiasm was satisfied with the glorious theme and the assistance of deyverdun seemed to remove an insuperable obstacle the french or latin memorials of which i was not ignorant are inconsiderable in number and weight but in the perfect acquaintance of my friend with the german language i found the key of a more valuable collection the most necessary books were procured he translated for my use the folio volume of schilling a copious and contemporary relation of the war of burgundy we read and marked the most interesting parts of the great chronicle of tschudi and by his labor or that of an inferior assistant large extracts were made from the history of lauffer and the dictionary of lew yet such was the distance and delay that two years elapsed in these preparatory steps and it was late in the third summer      before i entered with these slender materials on the more agreeable task of composition a specimen of my history the first book was read the following winter in a literary society of foreigners in london and as the author was unknown i listened without observation to the free strictures and unfavourable sentence of my judges mr hume seems to have had a different opinion of this work  from mr hume to mr gibbon sir it is but a few days ago since m deyverdun put your manuscript into my hands and i have perused it with great pleasure and satisfaction i have only one objection derived from the language in which it is written why do you compose in french and carry faggots into the wood as horace says with regard to romans who wrote in greek i grant that you have a like motive to those romans and adopt a language much more generally diffused than your native tongue but have you not remarked the fate of those two ancient languages in following ages the latin though then less celebrated and consined to more narrow limits has in some measure outlived the greek and is now more generally understood by men of letters let the french therefore triumph in the present dissusion of their tongue our solid and increasing establishments in america where we need less dread the inundation of barbarians promise a superior stability and duration to the english language  your use of the french tongue has also led you into a style more poetical and figurative and more highly colored than our language seems to admit of in historical productions for such is the practice of french writers particularly the more recent ones who illuminate their pictures more than custom will permit us on the whole your history in my opinion is written with spirit and judgment and i exhort you very earnestly to continue it the objections that occurred to me on reading it were so frivolous that i shall not trouble you with them and should i believe have a difficulty to recollect them i am with great esteem  london   th of oct      sir your most obedient and most humble servant signed david hume     the momentary sensation was painful but their condemnation was ratified by my cooler thoughts i delivered my imperfect sheets to the flames he neglected to burn them he left at sheffieldplace the introduction or first book in fortythree pages folio written in a very small hand besides a considerable number of notes if mr gibbon had not declared his judgment perhaps mr humes opinion expressed in the letter in the last note might have justified the publication of it s  and forever renounced a design in which some expense much labor and more time had been so vainly consumed i cannot regret the loss of a slight and superficial essay for such the work must have been in the hands of a stranger uninformed by the scholars and statesmen and remote from the libraries and archives of the swiss republics my ancient habits and the presence of deyverdun encouraged me to write in french for the continent of europe but i was conscious myself that my style above prose and below poetry degenerated into a verbose and turgid declamation perhaps i may impute the failure to the injudicious choice of a foreign language perhaps i may suspect that the language itself is ill adapted to sustain the vigor and dignity of an important narrative but if france so rich in literary merit had produced a great original historian his genius would have formed and fixed the idiom to the proper tone the peculiar mode of historical eloquence  it was in search of some liberal and lucrative employment that my friend deyverdun had visited england his remittances from home were scanty and precarious my purse was always open but it was often empty and i bitterly felt the want of riches and power which might have enabled me to correct the errors of his fortune his wishes and qualifications solicited the station of the traveling governor of some wealthy pupil but every vacancy provoked so many eager candidates that for a long time i struggled without success nor was it till after much application that i could even place him as a clerk in the office of the secretary of state in a residence of several years he never acquired the just pronunciation and familiar use of the english tongue but he read our most difficult authors with ease and taste his critical knowledge of our language and poetry was such as few foreigners have possessed and few of our countrymen could enjoy the theater of shakespeare and garrick with more exquisite feeling and discernment the consciousness of his own strength and the assurance of my aid emboldened him to imitate the example of dr maty whose journal britannique was esteemed and regretted and to improve his model by uniting with the transactions of literature a philosophic view of the arts and manners of the british nation our journal for the year      under the title of memoires literaires de la grand bretagne was soon finished and sent to the press for the first article lord lytteltons history of henry ii i must own myself responsible but the public has ratified my judgment of that voluminous work in which sense and learning are not illuminated by a ray of genius the next specimen was the choice of my friend the bath guide a light and whimsical performance of local and even verbal pleasantry i started at the attempt he smiled at my fears his courage was justified by success and a master of both languages will applaud the curious felicity with which he has transfused into french prose the spirit and even the humor of the english verse it is not my wish to deny how deeply i was interested in these memoirs of which i need not surely be ashamed but at the distance of more than twenty years it would be impossible for me to ascertain the respective shares of the two associates a long and intimate communication of ideas had cast our sentiments and style in the same mould in our social labors we composed and corrected by turns and the praise which i might honestly bestow would fall perhaps on some article or passage most properly my own a second volume for the year      was published of these memoirs i will presume to say that their merit was superior to their reputation but it is not less true that they were productive of more reputation than emolument they introduced my friend to the protection and myself to the acquaintance of the earl of chesterfield whose age and infirmities secluded him from the world and of mr david hume who was undersecretary to the office in which deyverdun was more humbly employed the former accepted a dedication april   th      and reserved the author for the future educacation of his successor the latter enriched the journal with a reply to mr walpoles historical doubts which he afterward shaped into the form of a note the materials of the third volume were almost completed when i recommended deyverdun as governor to sir richard worsley a youth the son of my old lieutenant colonel who was lately deceased they set forwards on their travels nor did they return to england till some time after my fathers death  my next publication was an accidental sally of love and resentment of my reverence for modest genius and my aversion for insolent pedantry the sixth book of the aeneid is the most pleasing and perfect composition of latin poetry the descent of aeneas and the sybil to the infernal regions to the world of spirits expands an awful and boundless prospect from the nocturnal gloom of the cumaean grot ibant obscurisola sub nocte per umbram to the meridian brightness of the elysian fields largior hic campos ether et lumine vestit purpureo  from the dreams of simple nature to the dreams alas of egyptian theology and the philosophy of the greeks but the final dismission of the hero through the ivory gate whence falsa ad coelum mittunt insomnia manes seems to dissolve the whole enchantment and leaves the reader in a state of cold and anxious skepticism this most lame and impotent conclusion has been variously imputed to the taste or irreligion of virgil but according to the more elaborate interpretation of bishop warburton the descent to hell is not a false but a mimic scene which represents the initiation of aeneas in the character of a lawgiver to the eleusinian mysteries this hypothesis a singular chapter in the divine legation of moses had been admitted by many as true it was praised by all as ingenious nor had it been exposed in a space of thirty years to a fair and critical discussion the learning and the abilities of the author had raised him to a just eminence but he reigned the dictator and tyrant of the world of literature the real merit of warburton was degraded by the pride and presumption with which he pronounced his infallible decrees in his polemic writings he lashed his antagonists without mercy or moderation and his servile flatterers see the base and malignant essay on the delicacy of friendship exalting the master critic far above aristotle and longinus assaulted every modest dissenter who refused to consult the oracle and to adore the idol in a land of liberty such despotism must provoke a general opposition and the zeal of opposition is seldom candid or impartial a late professor of oxford dr lowth in a pointed and polished epistle august   st      defended himself and attacked the bishop and whatsoever might be the merits of an insignificant controversy his victory was clearly established by the silent confusion of warburton and his slaves i too without any private offense was ambitious of breaking a lance against the giants shield and in the beginning of the year    0 my critical observations on the sixth book of the aeneid were sent without my name to the press in this short essay my first english publication i aimed my strokes against the person and the hypothesis of bishop warburton i proved at least to my own satisfaction that the ancient lawgivers did not invent the mysteries and that aeneas was never invested with the office of lawgiver that there is not any argument any circumstance which can melt a fable into allegory or remove the seen from the lake avernus to the temple of ceres that such a wild supposition is equally injurious to the poet and the man that if virgil was not initiated he could not if he were he would not reveal the secrets of the initiation that the anathema of horace  vetabo qui cereris sacrum vulgarit etc at once attests his own ignorance and the innocence of his friend as the bishop of gloucester and his party maintained a discreet silence my critical disquisition was soon lost among the pamphlets of the day but the public coldness was overbalanced to my feelings by the weighty approbation of the last and best editor of virgil professor heyne of gottingen who acquiesces in my confutation and styles the unknown author doctus  et elegantissimus britannus but i cannot resist the temptation of transcribing the favorable judgment of mr hayley himself a poet and a scholar an intricate hypothesis twisted into a long and labored chain of quotation and argument the dissertation on the sixth book of virgil remained some time unrefuted  at length a superior but anonymous critic arose who in one of the most judicious and spirited essays that our nation has produced on a point of classical literature completely overturned this illfounded edifice and exposed the arrogance and futility of its assuming architect he even condescends to justify an acrimony of style which had been gently blamed by the more unbiassed german paullo acrius quam velis  perstrinxit the editor of the warburtonian tracts dr parr p     considers the allegorical interpretation as completely refuted in a most clear elegant and decisive work of criticism which could not indeed derive authority from the greatest name but to which the greatest name might with propriety have been affixed  but i cannot forgive myself the contemptuous treatment of a man who with all his faults was entitled to my esteem the divine legation of moses is a monument already crumbling in the dust of the vigor and weakness of the human mind if warburtons new argument proved any thing it would be a demonstration against the legislator who left his people without the knowledge of a future state but some episodes of the work on the greek philosophy the hieroglyphics of egypt etc are entitled to the praise of learning imagination and discernment  and i can less forgive in a personal attack the cowardly concealment of my name and character  in the fifteen years between my essay on the study of literature and the first volume of the decline and fall            this criticism on warburton and some articles in the journal were my sole publications it is more especially incumbent on me to mark the employment or to confess the waste of time from my travels to my fathers death an interval in which i was not diverted by any professional duties from the labors and pleasures of a studious life   as soon as i was released from the fruitless task of the swiss revolutions      i began gradually to advance from the wish to the hope from the hope to the design from the design to the execution of my historical work of whose limits and extent i had yet a very inadequate notion the classics as low as tacitus the younger pliny and juvenal were my old and familiar companions i insensibly plunged into the ocean of the augustan history and in the descending series i investigated with my pen almost always in my hand the original records both greek and latin from dion cassius to ammianus marcellinus from the reign of trajan to the last age of the western caesars the subsidiary rays of medals and inscriptions of geography and chronology were thrown on their proper objects and i applied the collections of tillemont whose inimitable accuracy almost assumes the character of genius to fix and arrange within my reach the loose and scattered atoms of historical information through the darkness of the middle ages i explored my way in the annals and antiquities of italy of the learned muratori and diligently compared them with the parallel or transverse lines of sigonius and maffei baronius and pagi till i almost grasped the ruins of rome in the fourteenth century without suspecting that this final chapter must be attained by the labor of six quartos and twenty years among the books which i purchased the theodocian code with the commentary of james godefroy must be gratefully remembered i used it and much i used it as a work of history rather than of jurisprudence but in every light it may be considered as a full and capacious repository of the political state of the empire in the fourth and fifth centuries as i believed and as i still believe that the propagation of the gospel and the triumph of the church are inseparably connected with the decline of the roman monarchy i weighed the causes and effects of the revolution and contrasted the narratives and apologies of the christians themselves with the glances of candor or enmity which the pagans have cast on the rising sects the jewish and heathen testimonies as they are collected and illustrated by dr lardner directed without superseding my search of the originals and in an ample dissertation on the miraculous darkness of the passion i privately withdrew my conclusions from the silence of an unbelieving age i have assembled the preparatory studies directly or indirectly relative to my history but in strict equity they must be spread beyond this period of my life over the two summers      and      that elapsed between my fathers death and my settlement in london   in a free conversation with books and men it would be endless to enumerate the names and characters of all who are introduced to our acquaintance but in this general acquaintance we may select the degrees of friendship and esteem according to the wise maxim multum legere potius quam multa i reviewed again and again the immortal works of the french and english the latin and italian classics my greek studies though less assiduous than i designed maintained and extended my knowledge of that incomparable idiom homer and xenophon were still my favorite authors and i had almost prepared for the press an essay on the cyropoedia which in my own judgment is not unhappily labored after a certain age the new publications of merit are the sole food of the many and the most austere student will be often tempted to break the line for the sake of indulging his own curiosity and of providing the topics of fashionable currency a more respectable motive may be assigned for the third perusal of blackstones commentaries and a copious and critical abstract of that english work was my first serious production in my native language   my literary leisure was much less complete and independent than it might appear to the eye of a stranger in the hurry of london i was destitute of books in the solitude of hampshire i was not master of my time my quiet was gradually disturbed by our domestic anxiety and i should be ashamed of my unfeeling philosophy had i found much time or taste for study in the last fatal summer      of my fathers decay and dissolution  the disembodying of the militia at the close of the war      had restored the major a new cincinnatus to a life of agriculture his labors were useful his pleasures innocent his wishes moderate and my father seemed to enjoy the state of happiness which is celebrated by poets and philosophers as the most agreeable to nature and the least accessible to fortune  beatus ille qui procul negotiis ut prisca gens mortalium paterna rura bubus exercet suis solutus omni foenore like the first mortals blessed is he from debts and usury and business free with his own team who ploughs the soil which grateful once confessed his fathers toil   francis hor epod ii but the last indispensable condition the freedom from debt was wanting to my fathers felicity and the vanities of his youth were severely punished by the solicitude and sorrow of his declining age the first mortgage on my return from lausanne      had afforded him a partial and transient relief the annual demand of interest and allowance was a heavy deduction from his income the militia was a source of expense the farm in his hands was not a profitable adventure he was loaded with the costs and damages of an obsolete lawsuit and each year multiplied the number and exhausted the patience of his creditors under these painful circumstances i consented to an additional mortgage to the sale of putney and to every sacrifice that could alleviate his distress but he was no longer capable of a rational effort and his reluctant delays postponed not the evils themselves but the remedies of those evils  remedia malorum potius quam mala differebat the pangs of shame tenderness and selfreproach incessantly preyed on his vitals his constitution was broken he lost his strength and his sight the rapid progress of a dropsy admonished him of his end and he sunk into the grave on the  0th of november    0 in the sixtyfourth year of his age a familytradition insinuates that mr william law had drawn his pupil in the light and inconstant character of flatus who is ever confident and ever disappointed in the chase of happiness but these constitutional failings were happily compensated by the virtues of the head and heart by the warmest sentiments of honor and humanity his graceful person polite address gentle manners and unaffected cheerfulness recommended him to the favor of every company and in the change of times and opinions his liberal spirit had long since delivered him from the zeal and prejudice of a tory education i submitted to the order of nature and my grief was soothed by the conscious satisfaction that i had discharged all the duties of filial piety  as soon as i had paid the last solemn duties to my father and obtained from time and reason a tolerable composure of mind i began to form the plan of an independent life most adapted to my circumstances and inclination yet so intricate was the net my efforts were so awkward and feeble that nearly two years november    0  october      were suffered to elapse before i could disentangle myself from the management of the farm and transfer my residence from beriton to a house in london during this interval i continued to divide my year between town and the country but my new situation was brightened by hope my stay in london was prolonged into the summer and the uniformity of the summer was occasionally broken by visits and excursions at a distance from home the gratification of my desires they were not immoderate has been seldom disappointed by the want of money or credit my pride was never insulted by the visit of an importunate tradesman and my transient anxiety for the past or future has been dispelled by the studious or social occupation of the present hour my conscience does not accuse me of any act of extravagance or injustice and the remnant of my estate affords an ample and honorable provision for my declining age i shall not expatiate on my oeconomical affairs which cannot be instructive or amusing to the reader it is a rule of prudence as well as of politeness to reserve such confidence for the ear of a private friend without exposing our situation to the envy or pity of strangers for envy is productive of hatred and pity borders too nearly on contempt yet i may believe and even assert that in circumstances more indigent or more wealthy i should never have accomplished the task or acquired the fame of an historian that my spirit would have been broken by poverty and contempt and that my industry might have been relaxed in the labor and luxury of a superfluous fortune  i had now attained the first of earthly blessings independence i was the absolute master of my hours and actions nor was i deceived in the hope that the establishment of my library in town would allow me to divide the day between study and society each year the circle of my acquaintance the number of my dead and living companions was enlarged to a lover of books the shops and sales of london present irresistible temptations and the manufacture of my history required a various and growing stock of materials the militia my travels the house of commons the fame of an author contributed to multiply my connections i was chosen a member of the fashionable clubs and before i left england in      there were few persons of any eminence in the literary or political world to whom i was a stranger from the mixed though polite company of boodles whites and brookss i must honorably distinguish a weekly society which was instituted in the year      and which still continues to flourish under the title of the literary club hawkinss life of johnson p     boswells tour to the hebrides p    the names of dr johnson mr burke mr topham beauclerc mr garrick dr goldsmith sir joshua reynolds mr colman sir william jones dr percy mr fox mr sheridan mr adam smith mr steevens mr dunning sir joseph banks dr warton and his brother mr thomas warton dr burney etc form a large and luminous constellation of british stars  it would most assuredly be in my power to amuse the reader with a gallery of portraits and a collection of anecdotes but i have always condemned the practice of transforming a private memorial into a vehicle of satire or praise by my own choice i passed in town the greatest part of the year but whenever i was desirous of breathing the air of the country i possessed an hospitable retreat at sheffieldplace in sussex in the family of my valuable friend mr holroyd whose character under the name of lord sheffield has since been more conspicuous to the public  no sooner was i settled in my house and library than i undertook the composition of the first volume of my history at the outset all was dark and doubtful even the title of the work the true era of the decline and fall of the empire the limits of the introduction the division of the chapters and the order of the narrative and i was often tempted to cast away the labor of seven years the style of an author should be the image of his mind but the choice and command of language is the fruit of exercise many experiments were made before i could hit the middle tone between a dull chronicle and a rhetorical declamation three times did i compose the first chapter and twice the second and third before i was tolerably satisfied with their effect in the remainder of the way i advanced with a more equal and easy pace but the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters have been reduced by three successive revisals from a large volume to their present size and they might still be compressed without any loss of facts or sentiments an opposite fault may be imputed to the concise and superficial narrative of the first reigns from commodus to alexander a fault of which i have never heard except from mr hume in his last journey to london such an oracle might have been consulted and obeyed with rational devotion but i was soon disgusted with the modest practice of reading the manuscript to my friends of such friends some will praise from politeness and some will criticize from vanity the author himself is the best judge of his own performance no one has so deeply meditated on the subject no one is so sincerely interested in the event  by the friendship of mr now lord eliot who had married my first cousin i was returned at the general election for the borough of leskeard i took my seat at the beginning of the memorable contest between great britain and america and supported with many a sincere and silent vote the rights though not perhaps the interest of the mother country after a fleeting illusive hope prudence condemned me to acquiesce in the humble station of a mute i was not armed by nature and education with the intrepid energy of mind and voice  vincentem strepitus et natum rebus agendis timidity was fortified by pride and even the success of my pen discouraged the trial of my voice a french sketch of mr gibbons life written by himself probably for the use of some foreign journalist or translator contains no fact not mentioned in his english life he there describes himself with his usual candor depuis huit ans il a assiste aux deliberations les plus importantes mais il ne sest jamais trouve le courage ni le talent de parler dans une assemblee public this sketch was written before the publication of his three last volumes as in closing it he says of his history cette entreprise lui demand encore plusieurs annees dune application soutenue mais quelquen soit le succes il trouve dans cette application meme un plaisir toujours vary et toujours renaissant  but i assisted at the debates of a free assembly i listened to the attack and defense of eloquence and reason i had a near prospect of the characters views and passions of the first men of the age the cause of government was ably vindicated by lord north a statesman of spotless integrity a consummate master of debate who could wield with equal dexterity the arms of reason and of ridicule he was seated on the treasurybench between his attorney and solicitor general the two pillars of the law and state magis pares quam similes and the minister might indulge in a short slumber whilst he was upholden on either hand by the majestic sense of thurlow and the skilful eloquence of wedderburne from the adverse side of the house an ardent and powerful opposition was supported by the lively declamation of bar the legal acuteness of dunning the profuse and philosophic fancy of burke and the argumentative vehemence of fox who in the conduct of a party approved himself equal to the conduct of an empire by such men every operation of peace and war every principle of justice or policy every question of authority and freedom was attacked and defended and the subject of the momentous contest was the union or separation of great britain and america the eight sessions that i sat in parliament were a school of civil prudence the first and most essential virtue of an historian  the volume of my history which had been somewhat delayed by the novelty and tumult of a first session was now ready for the press after the perilous adventure had been declined by my friend mr elmsly i agreed upon easy terms with mr thomas cadell a respectable bookseller and mr william strahan an eminent printer and they undertook the care and risk of the publication which derived more credit from the name of the shop than from that of the author the last revisal of the proofs was submitted to my vigilance and many blemishes of style which had been invisible in the manuscript were discovered and corrected in the printed sheet so moderate were our hopes that the original impression had been stinted to five hundred till the number was doubled by the prophetic taste of mr strahan during this awful interval i was neither elated by the ambition of fame nor depressed by the apprehension of contempt my diligence and accuracy were attested by my own conscience history is the most popular species of writing since it can adapt itself to the highest or the lowest capacity i had chosen an illustrious subject rome is familiar to the schoolboy and the statesman and my narrative was deduced from the last period of classical reading i had likewise flattered myself that an age of light and liberty would receive without scandal an inquiry into the human causes of the progress and establishment of christianity  i am at a loss how to describe the success of the work without betraying the vanity of the writer the first impression was exbausted in a few days a second and third edition were scarcely adequate to the demand and the booksellers property was twice invaded by the pirates of dublin my book was on every table and almost on every toilette the historian was crowned by the taste or fashion of the day nor was the general voice disturbed by the barking of any profane critic the favor of mankind is most freely bestowed on a new acquaintance of any original merit and the mutual surprise of the public and their favorite is productive of those warm sensibilities which at a second meeting can no longer be rekindled if i listened to the music of praise i was more seriously satisfied with the approbation of my judges the candor of dr robertson embraced his disciple a letter from mr hume overpaid the labor of ten years but i have never presumed to accept a place in the triumvirate of british historians  that curious and original letter will amuse the reader and his gratitude should shield my free communication from the reproach of vanity  edinburgh   th march      dear sir as i ran through your volume of history with great avidity and impatience i cannot forbear discovering somewhat of the same impatience in returning you thanks for your agreeable present and expressing the satisfaction which the performance has given me whether i consider the dignity of your style the depth of your matter or the extensiveness of your learning i must regard the work as equally the object of esteem and i own that if i had not previously had the happiness of your personal acquaintance such a performance from an englishman in our age would have given me some surprise you may smile at this sentiment but as it seems to me that your countrymen for almost a whole generation have given themselves up to barbarous and absurd faction and have totally neglected all polite letters i no longer expected any valuable production ever to come from them i know it will give you pleasure as it did me to find that all the men of letters in this place concur in their admiration of your work and in their anxious desire of your continuing it  when i heard of your undertaking which was some time ago i own i was a little curious to see how you would extricate yourself from the subject of your two last chapters i think you have observed a very prudent temperament but it was impossible to treat the subject so as not to give grounds of suspicion against you and you may expect that a clamor will arise this if any thing will retard your success with the public for in every other respect your work is calculated to be popular but among many other marks of decline the prevalence of superstition in england prognosticates the fall of philosophy and decay of taste and though nobody be more capable than you to revive them you will probably find a struggle in your first advances  i see you entertain a great doubt with regard to the authenticity of the poems of ossian you are certainly right in so doing it is indeed strange that any men of sense could have imagined it possible that above twenty thousand verses along with numberless historical facts could have been preserved by oral tradition during fifty generations by the rudest perhaps of all the european nations the most necessitous the most turbulent and the most unsettled where a supposition is so contrary to common sense any positive evidence of it ought never to be regarded men run with great avidity to give their evidence in favor of what flatters their passions and their national prejudices you are therefore over and above indulgent to us in speaking of the matter with hesitation  i must inform you that we are all very anxious to hear that you have fully collected the materials for your second volume and that you are even considerably advanced in the composition of it i speak this more in the name of my friends than in my own as i cannot expect to live so long as to see the publication of it your ensuing volume will be more delicate than the preceding but i trust in your prudence for extricating you from the difficulties and in all events you have courage to despise the clamor of bigots  i am with great regard dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant david hume   some weeks afterward i had the melancholy pleasure of seeing mr hume in his passage through london his body feeble his mind firm on the   th of august of the same year      he died at edinburgh the death of a philosopher  my second excursion to paris was determined by the pressing invitation of m and madame necker who had visited england in the preceding summer on my arrival i found m necker directorgeneral of the finances in the first bloom of power and popularity his private fortune enabled him to support a liberal establishment and his wife whose talents and virtues i had long admired was admirably qualified to preside in the conversation of her table and drawing room as their friend i was introduced to the best company of both sexes to the foreign ministers of all nations and to the first names and characters of france who distinguished me by such marks of civility and kindness as gratitude will not suffer me to forget and modesty will not allow me to enumerate the fashionable suppers often broke into the morning hours yet i occasionally consulted the royal library and that of the abbey of st germain and in the free use of their books at home i had always reason to praise the liberality of those institutions the society of men of letters i neither courted nor declined but i was happy in the acquaintance of m de buffon who united with a sublime genius the most amiable simplicity of mind and manners at the table of my old friend m de foncemagne i was involved in a dispute with the abbe de mably and his jealous irascible spirit revenged itself on a work which he was incapable of reading in the original  as i might be partial in my own cause i shall transcribe the words of an unknown critic observing only that this dispute had been preceded by another on the english constitution at the house of the countess de froulay an old jansenist lady  vous etiez chez m de foncemagne mon cher theodon le jour que m labbe de mably et m gibbon y dinerent en grande compagnie la conversation roula presque entierement sur lhistoire labbe etant un profond politic la tourna sur ladministration quand on fut au desert et

principes du droit public de l europe and the first part of the observations sur l histoire de france may be deservedly praised and even the maniere decrire l histoire contains several useful precepts and judicious remarks mably was a lover of virtue and freedom but his virtue was austere and his freedom was impatient of an equal kings magistrates nobles and successful writers were the objects of his contempt or hatred or envy but his illiberal abuse of voltaire hume buffon the abbe reynal dr robertson and tutti quanti can be injurious only to himself  est il rien de plus fastidieux says the polite censor quun m gibbon qui dans son eternelle histoire des empereurs romans suspend a chaque instant son insipide et lent narration pour vous expliquer la cause de faits que vous allez lire maniere decrire lhistoire p     see another passage p   0 yet i am indebted to the abbe de mably for two such advocates as the anonymous french critic and my friend mr hayley hayleys works  vo edit vol ii p            nearly two years had elapsed between the publication of my first and the commencement of my second volume and the causes must be assigned of this long delay   after a short holiday i indulged my curiosity in some studies of a very different nature a course of anatomy which was demonstrated by doctor hunter and some lessons of chemistry which were delivered by mr higgins the principles of these sciences and taste for books of natural history contributed to multiply my ideas and images and the anatomist and chemist may sometimes track me in their own snow   i dived perhaps too deeply into the mud of the arian controversy and many days of reading thinking and writing were consumed in the pursuit of a phantom   it is difficult to arrange with order and perspicuity the various transactions of the age of constantine and so much was i displeased with the first essay that i committed to the flames above fifty sheets   the six months of paris and pleasure must be deducted from the account but when i resumed my task i felt my improvement i was now master of my style and subject and while the measure of my daily performance was enlarged i discovered less reason to cancel or correct it has always been my practice to cast a long paragraph in a single mould to try it by my ear to deposit it in my memory but to suspend the action of the pen till i had given the last polish to my work shall i add that i never found my mind more vigorous nor my composition more happy than in the winter hurry of society and parliament  had i believed that the majority of english readers were so fondly attached even to the name and shadow of christianity had i forescen that the pious the timid and the prudent would feel or affect to feel with such exquisite sensibility i might perhaps have sostened the two invidious chapters which would create many enemies and conciliate few friends but the shaft was shot the alarm was sounded and i could only rejoice that if the voice of our priests was clamorous and bitter their hands were disarmed from the powers of persecution i adhered to the wise resolution of trusting myself and my writings to the candor of the public till mr davies of oxford presumed to attack not the faith but the fidelity of the historian my vindication expressive of less anger than contempt amused for a moment the busy and idle metropolis and the most rational part of the laity and even of the clergy appear to have been satisfied of my innocence and accuracy i would not print this vindication in quarto lest it should be bound and preserved with the history itself at the distance of twelve years i calmly affirm my judgment of davies chelsum etc a victory over such antagonists was a sufficient humiliation they however were rewarded in this world poor chelsum was indeed neglected and i dare not boast the making dr watson a bishop he is a prelate of a large mind and liberal spirit see appendix letters no lxviii lxix and c  but i enjoyed the pleasure of giving a royal pension to mr davies and of collating dr apthorpe to an archiepiscopal living their success encouraged the zeal of tailor the arian the stupendous title thoughts on the causes of the grand apostasy at first agitated my nerves till i discovered that it was the apostasy of the whole church since the council of nice from mr taylors private religion his book is a thorough mixture of high enthusiasm and low buffoonery and the millenium is a fundamental article of his creed  and milner the methodist from his grammar school at kingston upon hull mr joseph milner pronounces an anathema against all rational religion his faith is a divine taste a spiritual inspiration his church is a mystic and invisible body the natural christians such as mr lock who believe and interpret the scriptures are in his judgment no better than profane infidels  with many others whom it would be difficult to remember and tedious to rehearse the list of my adversaries however was graced with the more respectable names of dr priestley sir david dalrymple and dr white and every polemic of either university discharged his sermon or pamphlet against the impenetrable silence of the roman historian in his history of the corruptions of christianity dr priestley threw down his two gauntlets to bishop hurd and mr gibbon i declined the challenge in a letter exhorting my opponent to enlighten the world by his philosophical discoveries and to remember that the merit of his predecessor servetus is now reduced to a single passage which indicates the smaller circulation of the blood through the lungs from and to the heart astruc de la structure du coeur tom i       appendix letters cxixcxxiv instead of listening to this friendly advice the dauntless philosopher of birmingham continued to sire away his double battery against those who believed too little and those who believed too much from my replies he has nothing to hope or fear but his socinian shield has repeatedly been pierced by the spear of horsley and his trumpet of sedition may at length awaken the magistrates of a free country  the profession and rank of sir david dalrymple now a lord of session has given a more decent color to his style but he scrutinized each separate passage of the two chapters with the dry minuteness of a special pleader and as he was always solicitous to make he may have succeeded sometimes in finding a flaw in his annals of scotland he has shown himself a diligent collector and an accurate critic  i have praised and i still praise the eloquent sermons which were preached in st marys pulpit at oxford by dr white if he assaulted me with some degree of illiberal acrimony in such a place and before such an audience he was obliged to speak the language of the country i smiled at a passage in one of his private letters to mr badcock the part where we encounter gibbon must be brilliant and striking  in a sermon preached before the university of cambridge dr edwards complimented a work which can only perish with the language itself and esteems the author a formidable enemy he is indeed astonished that more learning and ingenuity has not been shown in the defense of israel that the prelates and dignitaries of the church alas good man did not vie with each other whose stone should sink the deepest in the forehead of this goliath  but the force of truth will oblige us to confess that in the attacks which have been levelled against our skeptical historian we can discover but slender traces of profound and exquisite erudition of solid criticism and accurate investigation but we are too frequently disgusted by vague and inconclusive reasoning by unseasonable banter and senseless witticisms by imbittered bigotry and enthusiastic jargon by futile cavils and illiberal invectives proud and elated by the weakness of his antagonists he condescends not to handle the sword of controversy monthly review oct    0   let me frankly own that i was startled at the first discharge of ecclesiastical ordnance but as soon as i found that this empty noise was mischievous only in the intention my fear was converted into indignation and every feeling of indignation or curiosity has long since subsided in pure and placid indifference  the prosecution of my history was soon afterward checked by another controversy of a very different kind at the request of the lord chancellor and of lord weymouth then secretary of state i vindicated against the french manifesto the justice of the british arms the whole correspondence of lord stormont our late ambassador at paris was submitted to my inspection and the memoire justificatif which i composed in french was first approved by the cabinet ministers and then delivered as a state paper to the courts of europe the style and manner are praised by beaumarchais himself who in his private quarrel attempted a reply but he flatters me by ascribing the memoir to lord stormont and the grossness of his invective betrays the loss of temper and of wit he acknowledged oeuvres de beaumarchais tom iii p          that le style ne seroit pas sans grace ni la logique sans justesse etc if the facts were true which he undertakes to disprove for these facts my credit is not pledged i spoke as a lawyer from my brief but the veracity of beaumarchais may be estimated from the assertion that france by the treaty of paris      was limited to a certain number of ships of war on the application of the duke of choiseul he was obliged to retract this daring falsehood  among the honorable connections which i had formed i may justly be proud of the friendship of mr wedderburne at that time attorney general who now illustrates the title of lord loughborough and the office of chief justice of the common pleas by his strong recommendation and the favorable disposition of lord north i was appointed one of the lords commissioners of trade and plantations and my private income was enlarged by a clear addition of between seven and eight hundred pounds a year the fancy of an hostile orator may paint in the strong colors of ridicule the perpetual virtual adjournment and the unbroken sitting vacation of the board of trade i can never forget the delight with which that diffusive and ingenious orator mr burke was heard by all sides of the house and even by those whose existence he proscribed see mr burkes speech on the bill of reform p    0 the lords of trade blushed at their insignificancy and mr edens appeal to the two thousand five hundred volumes of our reports served only to excite a general laugh i take this opportunity of certifying the correctness of mr burkes printed speeches which i have heard and read  but it must be allowed that our duty was not intolerably severe and that i enjoyed many days and weeks of repose without being called away from my library to the office my acceptance of a place provoked some of the leaders of opposition with whom i had lived in habits of intimacy and i was most unjustly accused of deserting a party in which i had never inlisted from edward gibbon esquire to  esquire  d july      dear sir yesterday i received a very interesting communication from my friend whose kind and honorable behavior toward me i must always remember with the highest gratitude he informed me that in consequence of an arrangement a place at the board of trade was reserved for me and that as soon as i signified my acceptance of it he was satisfied no farther difficulties would arise my answer to him was sincere and explicit i told him that i was far from approving all the past measures of the administration even some of those in which i myself had silently concurred that i saw with the rest of the world many capital defects in the characters of some of the present ministers and was sorry that in so alarming a situation of public affairs the country had not the assistance of several able and honest men who are now in opposition but that i had not formed with any of those persons in opposition any engagements or connections which could in the least restrain or affect my parliamentary conduct that i could not discover among them such superior advantages either of measures or of abilities as could make me consider it as a duty to attach myself to their cause and that i clearly understood from the public and private language of  one of their leaders that in the actual state of the country he himself was seriously of opinion that opposition could not tend to any good purpose and might be productive of much mischief that for those reasons i saw no objections which could prevent me from accepting an office under the present government and that i was ready to take a step which i found to be consistent both with my interest and my honor  it must now be decided whether i may continue to live in england or whether i must soon withdraw myself into a kind of philosophical exile in switzerland my father left his affairs in a state of embarrassment and even of distress my attempts to dispose of a part of my landed property have hitherto been disappointed and are not likely at present to be more successful and my plan of expense though moderate in itself deserves the name of extravagance since it exceeds my real income the addition of the salary which is now offered will make my situation perfectly easy but i hope you will do me the justice to believe that my mind could not be so unless i were satisfied of the rectitude of my own conduct      the aspect of the next session of parliament was stormy and perilous county meetings petitions and committees of correspondence announced the public discontent and instead of voting with a triumphant majority the friends of government were often exposed to a struggle and sometimes to a defeat the house of commons adopted mr dunnings motion that the influence of the crown had increased was increasing and ought to be diminished and mr burkes bill of reform was framed with skill introduced with eloquence and supported by numbers our late president the american secretary of state very narrowly escaped the sentence of proscription but the unfortunate board of trade was abolished in the committee by a small majority  0  to     of eight votes the storm however blew over for a time a large defection of country gentlemen eluded the sanguine hopes of the patriots the lords of trade were revived administration recovered their strength and spirit and the flames of london which were kindled by a mischievous madman admonished all thinking men of the danger of an appeal to the people in the premature dissolution which followed this session of parliament i lost my seat mr elliot was now deeply engaged in the measures of opposition and the electors of leskeard the borough which mr gibbon had represented in parliament are commonly of the same opinion as mr elliot  in this interval of my senatorial life i published the second and third volumes of the decline and fall my ecclesiastical history still breathed the same spirit of freedom but protestant zeal is more indifferent to the characters and controversies of the fourth and fifth centuries my obstinate silence had damped the ardour of the polemics dr watson the most candid of my adversaries assured me that he had no thoughts of renewing the attack and my impartial balance of the virtues and vices of julian was generally praised this truce was interrupted only by some animadversions of the catholics of italy and by some angry letters from mr travis who made me personally responsible for condemning with the best critics the spurious text of the three heavenly witnesses  the piety or prudence of my italian translator has provided an antidote against the poison of his original the  th and  th volumes are armed with five letters from an anonymous divine to his friends foothead and kirk two english students at rome and this meritorious service is commended by monsignor stonor a prelate of the same nation who discovers much venom in the fluid and nervous style of gibbon the critical essay at the end of the third volume was furnished by the abbate nicola spedalieri whose zeal has gradually swelled to a more solid confutation in two quarto volumes  shall i be excused for not having read them  the brutal insolence of mr traviss challenge can only be excused by the absence of learning judgment and humanity and to that excuse he has the fairest or foulest pretension compared with archdeacon travis chelsum and davies assume the title of respectable enemies  the bigoted advocate of popes and monks may be turned over even to the bigots of oxford and the wretched travis still smarts under the lash of the merciless porson i consider mr porsons answer to archdeacon travis as the most acute and accurate piece of criticism which has appeared since the days of bentley his strictures are founded in argument enriched with learning and enlivened with wit and his adversary neither deserves nor finds any quarter at his hands the evidence of the three heavenly witnesses would now be rejected in any court of justice but prejudice is blind authority is deaf and our vulgar bibles will ever be polluted by this spurious text sedet aeternumque sedebit the more learned ecclesiastics will indeed have the secret satisfaction of reprobating in the closet what they read in the church  i perceived and without surprise the coldness and even prejudice of the town nor could a whisper escape my ear that in the judgment of many readers my continuation was much inferior to the original attempts an author who cannot ascend will always appear to sink envy was now prepared for my reception and the zeal of my religious was fortified by the motive of my political enemies bishop newton in writing his own life was at full liberty to declare how much he himself and two eminent brethren were disgusted by mr gs prolixity tediousness and affectation but the old man should not have indulged his zeal in a false and feeble charge against the historian extract from mr gibbons common place book  thomas newton bishop of bristol and dean of st pauls was born at litchfield on the   st of december   0  o s   st january   0  n s and died the   th of february      in the   th year of his age a few days before his death he finished the memoirs of his own life which have been prefixed to an edition of his posthumous works first published in quarto and since      republished in six volume octavo  p         some books were published in      which employed some of the bishops leisure hours and during his illness mr gibbons history of the decline and fall of the roman empire he read throughout but it by no means answered his expectation for he found it rather a prolix and tedious performance his matter uninteresting and his style affected his testimonies not to be depended upon and his frequent scoffs at religion offensive to every sober mind he had before been convicted of making false quotations which should have taught him more prudence and caution but without examining his authorities there is one which must necessarily strike every man who has read dr burnets treatise de statu mortuorum in vol iii p    mr g has the following note  burnet  de s m p        collects the opinions of the fathers as far as they assert the sleep or repose of human souls till the day of judgment he afterward exposes p    the inconveniences which must arise if they possessed a more active and sensible existence who would not from hence infer that dr b was an advocate for the sleep or insensible existence of the soul after death whereas his doctrine is directly the contrary he has employed some chapters in treating of the state of human souls in the interval between death and the resurrection and after various proofs from reason from scripture and the fathers his conclusions are that human souls exist after their separation from the body that they are in a good or evil state according to their good or ill behavior but that neither their happiness nor their misery will be complete or perfect before the day of judgment his argumentation is thus summed up at the end of the  th chapter  ex quibus constat primo animas superesse extincto corpore secundo bonas been malas male se habituras tertio nec illis summam felicitatem nec his summam miseriam accessuram esse ante diem judicii the bishops reading the whole was a greater compliment to the work than was paid to it by two of the most eminent of his brethren for their learning and station the one entered upon it but was soon wearied and laid it aside in disgust the other returned it upon the booksellers hands and it is said that mr g himself happened unluckily to be in the shop at the same time  does the bishop comply with his own precept in the next page p     old age should lenify should soften mens manners and make them more mild and gentle but often has the contrary effect hardens their hearts and makes them more sour and crabbed  he is speaking of dr johnson  have i ever infinuated that prefermenthunting is the great occupation of an ecclesiastical life memoirs passim that a ministers influence and a bishops patronage are sometimes pledged eleven deep p     that a prebendary considers the audit week as the better part of the year p     or that the most eminent of priests the pope himself would change their religion if any thing better could be offered them p    such things are more than insinuated in the bishops life which afforded some scandal to the church and some diversion to the profane laity    who had faithfully and even cautiously rendered dr burnets meaning by the alternative of sleep or repose that philosophic divine supposes that in the period between death and the resurrection human souls exist without a body endowed with internal consciousness but destitute of all active or passive connection with the external world secundum communem dictionem sacrae

some domestic and foreign testimonies of applause and the second and third volumes insensibly rose in sale and reputation to a level with the first but the public is seldom wrong and i am inclined to believe that especially in the beginning they are more prolix and less entertaining than the first my efforts had not been relaxed by success and i had rather deviated into the opposite fault of minute and superfluous diligence on the continent my name and writings were slowly diffused a french translation of the first volume had disappointed the booksellers of paris and a passage in the third was construed as a personal reflection on the reigning monarch it may not be generally known that louis the sixteenth is a great reader and a reader of english books on perusing a passage of my history which seems to compare him to arcadius or honorius he expressed his resentment to the prince of b  from whom the intelligence was conveyed to me i shall neither disclaim the allusion nor examine the likeness but the situation of the late king of france excludes all suspicion of flattery and i am ready to declare that the concluding observations of my third volume were written before his accession to the throne   before i could apply for a seat at the general election the list was already full but lord norths promise was sincere his recommendation was effectual and i was soon chosen on a vacancy for the borough of lymington in hampshire in the first session of the new parliament administration stood their ground their final overthrow was reserved for the second the american war had once been the favorite of the country the pride of england was irritated by the resistance of her colonies and the executive power was driven by national clamor into the most vigorous and coercive measures but the length of a fruitless contest the loss of armies the accumulation of debt and taxes and the hostile confederacy of france spain and holland indisposed the public to the american war and the persons by whom it was conducted the representatives of the people followed at a slow distance the changes of their opinion and the ministers who refused to bend were broken by the tempest as soon as lord north had lost or was about to lose a majority in the house of commons he surrendered his office and retired to a private station with the tranquil assurance of a clear conscience and a cheerful temper the old fabric was dissolved and the posts of government were occupied by the victorious and veteran troops of opposition the lords of trade were not immediately dismissed but the board itself was abolished by mr burkes bill which decency had compelled the patriots to revive and i was stripped of a convenient salary after having enjoyed it about three years  so flexible is the title of my history that the final era might be fixed at my own choice and i long hesitated whether i should be content with the three volumes the fall of the western empire which fulfilled my first engagement with the public in this interval of suspense nearly a twelvemonth i returned by a natural impulse to the greek authors of antiquity i read with new pleasure the iliad and the odyssey the histories of herodotus thucydides and xenophon a large portion of the tragic and comic theater of athens and many interesting dialogues of the socratic school yet in the luxury of freedom i began to wish for the daily task the active pursuit which gave a value to every book and an object to every inquiry the preface of a new edition announced my design and i dropped without reluctance from the age of plato to that of justinian the original texts of procopius and agathias supplied the events and even the characters of his reign but a laborious winter was devoted to the codes the pandects and the modern interpreters before i presumed to form an abstract of the civil law my skill was improved by practice my diligence perhaps was quickened by the loss of office and excepting the last chapter i had finished the fourth volume before i sought a retreat on the banks of the leman lake  it is not the purpose of this narrative to expatiate on the public or secret history of the times the schism which followed the death of the marquis of rockingham the appointment of the earl of shelburne the resignation of mr fox and his famous coalition with lord north but i may assert with some degree of assurance that in their political conflict those great antagonists had never felt any personal animosity to each other that their reconciliation was easy and sincere and that their friendship has never been clouded by the shadow of suspicion or jealousy the most violent or venal of their respective followers embraced this fair occasion of revolt but their alliance still commanded a majority in the house of commons the peace was censured lord shelburne resigned and the two friends knelt on the same cushion to take the oath of secretary of state from a principle of gratitude i adhered to the coalition my vote was counted in the day of battle but i was overlooked in the division of the spoil there were many claimants more deserving and importunate than myself the board of trade could not be restored and while the list of places was curtailed the number of candidates was doubled an easy dismission to a secure seat at the board of customs or excise was promised on the first vacancy but the chance was distant and doubtful nor could i solicit with much ardour an ignoble servitude which would have robbed me of the most valuable of my studious hours at the same time the tumult of london and the attendance on parliament were grown more irksome and without some additional income i could not long or prudently maintain the style of expense to which i was accustomed  from my early acquaintance with lausanne i had always cherished a secret wish that the school of my youth might become the retreat of my declining age a moderate fortune would secure the blessings of ease leisure and independence the country the people the manners the language were congenial to my taste and i might indulge the hope of passing some years in the domestic society of a friend after traveling with several english sir richard worsley lord chesterfield broderick lord midleton and mr hume brother to sir abraham mr deyverdun was now settled at home in a pleasant habitation the gift of his deceased aunt we had long been separated we had long been silent yet in my first letter i exposed with the most perfect confidence my situation my sentiments and my designs his immediate answer was a warm and joyful acceptance the picture of our future life provoked my impatience and the terms of arrangement were short and simple as he possessed the property and i undertook the expense of our common house see appendix letters no cxxv cxxvi cxxvii cxxviii cxxix cxxx before i could break my english chain it was incumbent on me to struggle with the feelings of my heart the indolence of my temper and the opinion of the world which unanimously condemned this voluntary banishment in the disposal of my effects the library a sacred deposit was alone excepted as my postchaise moved over westminsterbridge i bid a long farewell to the fumum et opes strepitumque romae my journey by the direct road through france was not attended with any accident and i arrived at lausanne nearly twenty years after my second departure within less than three months the coalition struck on some hidden rocks had i remained on board i should have perished in the general shipwreck see appendix letter no cl   since my establishment at lausanne more than seven years have elapsed and if every day has not been equally soft and serene not a day not a moment has occurred in which i have repented of my choice during my absence a long portion of human life many changes had happened my elder acquaintance had left the stage virgins were ripened into matrons and children were grown to the age of manhood but the same manners were transmitted from one generation to another my friend alone was an inestimable treasure my name was not totally forgotten and all were ambitious to welcome the arrival of a stranger and the return of a fellowcitizen the first winter was given to a general embrace without any nice discrimination of persons and characters after a more regular settlement a more accurate survey i discovered three solid and permanent benefits of my new situation   my personal freedom had been somewhat impaired by the house of commons and the board of trade but i was now delivered from the chain of duty and dependence from the hopes and fears of political adventure my sober mind was no longer intoxicated by the fumes of party and i rejoiced in my escape as often as i read of the midnight debates which preceded the dissolution of parliament see appendix letter no cxlvi    my english economy had been that of a solitary bachelor who might afford some occasional dinners in switzerland i enjoyed at every meal at every hour the free and pleasant conversation of the friend of my youth and my daily table was always provided for the reception of one or two extraordinary guests our importance in society is less a positive than a relative weight in london i was lost in the crowd i ranked with the first families of lausanne and my style of prudent expense enabled me to maintain a fair balance of reciprocal civilities   instead of a small house between a street and a stableyard i began to occupy a spacious and convenient mansion connected on the north side with the city and open on the south to a beautiful and boundless horizon a garden of four acres had been laid out by the taste of mr deyverdun from the garden a rich scenery of meadows and vineyards descends to the leman lake and the prospect far beyond the lake is crowned by the stupendous mountains of savoy my books and my acquaintance had been first united in london but this happy position of my library in town and country was finally reserved for lausanne possessed of every comfort in this triple alliance i could not be tempted to change my habitation with the changes of the seasons  my friends had been kindly apprehensive that i should not be able to exist in a swiss town at the foot of the alps after having so long conversed with the first men of the first cities of the world such lofty connections may attract the curious and gratify the vain but i am too modest or too proud to rate my own value by that of my associates and whatsoever may be the fame of learning or genius experience has shown me that the cheaper qualifications of politeness and good sense are of more useful currency in the commerce of life by many conversation is esteemed as a theater or a school but after the morning has been occupied by the labors of the library i wish to unbend rather than to exercise my mind and in the interval between tea and supper i am far from disdaining the innocent amusement of a game at cards lausanne is peopled by a numerous gentry whose companionable idleness is seldom disturbed by the pursuits of avarice or ambition the women though consined to a domestic education are endowed for the most part with more taste and knowledge than their husbands and brothers but the decent freedom of both sexes is equally remote from the extremes of simplicity and refinement i shall add as a misfortune rather than a merit that the situation and beauty of the pays de vaud the long habits of the english the medical reputation of dr tissot and the fashion of viewing the mountains and glaciers have opened us on all sides to the incursions of foreigners the visits of mr and madame necker of prince henry of prussia and of mr fox may from some pleasing exceptions but in general lausanne has appeared most agreeable in my eyes when we have been abandoned to our own society i had frequently seen mr necker in the summer of      at a country house near lausanne where he composed his treatise on the administration of the finances i have since in october    0 visited him in his present residence the castle and barony of copet near geneva of the merits and measures of that statesman various opinions may be entertained but all impartial men must agree in their esteem of his integrity and patriotism  in the month of august      prince henry of prussia in his way to paris passed three days at lausanne his military conduct has been praised by professional men his character has been vilified by the wit and malice of a demon memoire secret de la cour de berlin  but i was flattered by his affability and entertained by his conversation  in his tour of switzerland september      mr fox gave me two days of free and private society see letter in the continuation october         he seemed to feel and even to envy the happiness of my situation while i admired the powers of a superior man as they are blended in his attractive character with the softness and simplicity of a child perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence vanity or falsehood  my transmigration from london to lausanne could not be effected without interrupting the course of my historical labors the hurry of my departure the joy of my arrival the delay of my tools suspended their progress and a full twelvemonth was lost before i could resume the thread of regular and daily industry a number of books most requisite and least common had been previously selected the academical library of lausanne which i could use as my own contained at least the fathers and councils and i have derived some occasional succor from the public collections of berne and geneva the fourth volume was soon terminated by an abstract of the controversies of the incarnation which the learned dr prideaux was apprehensive of exposing to profane eyes it had been the original design of the learned dean prideaux to write the history of the ruin of the eastern church in this work it would have been necessary not only to unravel all those controversies which the christians made about the hypostatical union but also to unfold all the niceties and subtle notions which each sect entertained concerning it the pious historian was apprehensive of exposing that incomprehensible mystery to the cavils and objections of unbelievers and he durst not seeing the nature of this book venture it abroad in so wanton and lewd an age see preface to the life of mahomet p  0      in the fifth and sixth volumes the revolutions of the empire and the world are most rapid various and instructive and the greek or roman historians are checked by the hostile narratives of the barbarians of the east and the west i have followed the judicious precept of the abbe de mably maniere decrire lhistoire p   0 who advises the historian not to dwell too minutely on the decay of the eastern empire but to consider the barbarian conquerors as a more worthy subject of his narrative fas est et ab host doceri   it was not till after many designs and many trials that i preferred as i still prefer the method of grouping my picture by nations and the seeming neglect of chronological order is surely compensated by the superior merits of interest and perspicuity the style of the first volume is in my opinion somewhat crude and elaborate in the second and third it is ripened into ease correctness and numbers but in the three last i may have been seduced by the facility of my pen and the constant habit of speaking one language and writing another may have infused some mixture of gallic idioms happily for my eyes i have always closed my studies with the day and commonly with the morning and a long but temperate labor has been accomplished without fatiguing either the mind or body but when i computed the remainder of my time and my task it was apparent that according to the season of publication the delay of a month would be productive of that of a year i was now straining for the goal and in the last winter many evenings were borrowed from the social pleasures of lausanne i could now wish that a pause an interval had been allowed for a serious revisal  i have presumed to mark the moment of conception i shall now commemorate the hour of my final deliverance it was on the day or rather night of the   th of june      between the hours of eleven and twelve that i wrote the last lines of the last page in a summer house in my garden after laying down my pen i took several turns in a berceau or covered walk of acacias which commands a prospect of the country the lake and the mountains the air was temperate the sky was serene the silver orb of the moon was reflected from the waters and all nature was silent i will not dissemble the first emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom and perhaps the establishment of my fame but my pride was soon humbled and a sober melancholy was spread over my mind by the idea that i had taken an everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion and that whatsoever might be the future date of my history the life of the historian must be short and precarious i will add two facts which have seldom occurred in the composition of six or at least of five quartos   my first rough manuscript without any intermediate copy has been sent to the press   not a sheet has been seen by any human eyes excepting those of the author and the printer the faults and the merits are exclusively my own extract from mr gibbons commonplace book the ivth volume of the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire   begun march  st       ended june      the vth volume   begun july       ended may  st      the vith volume   begun may   th       ended june   th      these three volumes were sent to press august   th      and the whole impression was concluded april following     i cannot help recollecting a much more extraordinary fact which is affirmed of himself by retif de la bretorme a voluminous and original writer of french novels he labored and may still labor in the humble office of corrector to a printing house but this office enabled him to transport an entire volume from his mind to the press and his work was given to the public without ever having been written with a pen  after a quiet residence of four years during which i had never moved ten miles from lausanne it was not without some reluctance and terror that i undertook in a journey of two hundred leagues to cross the mountains and the sea yet this formidable adventure was achieved without danger or fatigue and at the end of a fortnight i found myself in lord sheffields house and library safe happy and at home the character of my friend mr holroyd had recommended him to a seat in parliament for coventry the command of a regiment of light dragoons and an irish peerage the sense and spirit of his political writings have decided the public opinion on the great questions of our commercial interest with america and ireland observations on the commerce of the american states by john lord shessield the  th edition london      in octavo   the sale of his observations on the american states was diffusive their effect beneficial the navigation act the palladium of britain was defended and perhaps saved by his pen and he proves by the weight of fact and argument that the mother country may survive and flourish after the loss of america my friend has never cultivated the arts of composition but his materials are copious and correct and he leaves on his paper the clear impression of an active and vigorous mind his observations on the trade manufactures and present state of ireland were intended to guide the industry to correct the prejudices and to assuage the passions of a country which seemed to forget that she could be free and prosperous only by a friendly connection with great britain the concluding observations are written with so much ease and spirit that they may be read by those who are the least interested in the subject  he fell in      with the unpopular coalition but his merit has been acknowledged at the last general election    0 by the honorable invitation and free choice of the city of bristol during the whole time of my residence in england i was entertained at sheffieldplace and in downingstreet by his hospitable kindness and the most pleasant period was that which i passed in the domestic society of the family in the larger circle of the metropolis i observed the country and the inhabitants with the knowledge and without the prejudices of an englishman but i rejoiced in the apparent increase of wealth and prosperity which might be fairly divided between the spirit of the nation and the wisdom of the minister all partyresentment was now lost in oblivion since i was no mans rival no man was my enemy i felt the dignity of independence and as i asked no more i was satisfied with the general civilities of the world the house in london which i frequented with most pleasure and assiduity was that of lord north after the loss of power and of sight he was still happy in himself and his friends and my public tribute of gratitude and esteem could no longer be suspected of any intrested motive before my departure from england i was present at the august spectacle of mr hastingss trial in westminster hall it is not my province to absolve or condemn the governor of india but mr sheridans eloquence demanded my applause nor could i hear without emotion the personal compliment which he paid me in the presence of the british nation he said the facts that made up the volume of narrative were unparalleled in atrociousness and that nothing equal in criminality was to be traced either in ancient or modern history in the correct periods of tacitus or the luminous page of gibbon morning chronicle june           from this display of genius which blazed four successive days i shall stoop to a very mechanical circumstance as i was waiting in the managers box i had the curiosity to inquire of the shorthand writer how many words a ready and rapid orator might pronounce in an hour from  000 to   00 was his answer the medium of   00 will afford   0 words in a minute and two words in each second but this computation will only apply to the english language  as the publication of my three last volumes was the principal object so it was the first care of my english journey the previous arrangements with the bookseller and the printer were settled in my passage through london and the proofs which i returned more correct were transmitted every post from the press to sheffieldplace the length of the operation and the leisure of the country allowed some time to review my manuscript several rare and useful books the assizes de jerusalem ramusius de bello c paro the greek acts of the synod of florence the statuta urbis romae etc were procured and introduced in their proper places the supplements which they afforded the impression of the fourth volume had consumed three months our common interest required that we should move with a quicker pace and mr strahan fulfilled his engagement which few printers could sustain of delivering every week three thousand copies of nine sheets the day of publication was however delayed that it might coincide with the fiftyfirst anniversary of my own birthday the double festival was celebrated by a cheerful literary dinner at mr cadells house and i seemed to blush while they read an elegant compliment from mr hayley occasional stanzas by mr hayley read after the dinner at mr

conclusion of my work was generally read and variously judged the style has been exposed to much academical criticism a religious clamor was revived and the reproach of indecency has been loudly echoed by the rigid censors of morals i never could understand the clamor that has been raised against the indecency of my three last volumes   an equal degree of freedom in the former part especially in the first volume had passed without reproach   i am justified in painting the manners of the times the vices of theodora form an essential feature in the reign and character of justinian   my

various success but instead of patronizing i should willingly suppress such imperfect copies which injure the character while they propagate the name of the author the first volume had been feebly though faithfully translated into french by m le clerc de septchenes a young gentleman of a studious character and liberal fortune after his decease the work was continued by two manufacturers of paris m m desmuniers and cantwell but the former is now an active member in the national assembly and the undertaking languishes in the hands of his associate the superior merit of the interpreter or his language inclines me to prefer the italian version but i wish that it were in my power to read the german which is praised by the best judges the irish pirates are at once my friends and my enemies but i cannot be displeased with the two numerous and correct impressions which have been published for the use of the continent at basil in switzerland of their fourteen octavo volumes the two last include the whole body of the notes the public importunity had forced me to remove them from the end of the volume to the bottom of the page but i have often repented of my compliance  the conquests of our language and literature are not confined to europe alone and a writer who succeeds in london is speedily read on the banks of the delaware and the ganges  in the preface of the fourth volume while i gloried in the name of an englishman i announced my approaching return to the neighborhood of the lake of lausanne this last trial confirmed my assurance that i had wisely chosen for my own happiness nor did i once in a years visit entertain a wish of settling in my native country britain is the free and fortunate island but where is the spot in which i could unite the comforts and beauties of my establishment at lausanne the tumult of london astonished my eyes and ears the amusements of public places were no longer adequate to the trouble the clubs and assemblies were filled with new faces and young men and our best society our long and late dinners would soon have been prejudicial to my health without any share in the political wheel i must be idle and insignificant yet the most splendid temptations would not have enticed me to engage a second time in the servitude of parliament or office at tunbridge some weeks after the publication of my history i reluctantly quitted lord and lady sheffield and with a young swiss friend m wilhelm de severy  whom i had introduced to the english world i pursued the road of dover and lausanne my habitation was embellished in my absence and the last division of books which followed my steps increased my chosen library to the number of between six and seven thousand volumes my seraglio was ample my choice was free my appetite was keen after a full repast on homer and aristophanes i involved myself in the philosophic maze of the writings of plato of which the dramatic is perhaps more interesting than the argumentative part but i stepped aside into every path of inquiry which reading or reflection accidentally opened  alas the joy of my return and my studious ardour were soon damped by the melancholy state of my friend mr deyverdun his health and spirits had long suffered a gradual decline a succession of apoplectic fits anounced his dissolution and before he expired those who loved him could not wish for the continuance of his life the voice of reason might congratulate his deliverance but the feelings of nature and friendship could be subdued only by time his amiable character was still alive in my remembrance each room each walk was imprinted with our common footsteps and i should blush at my own philosophy if a long interval of study had not preceded and followed the death of my friend by his last will he left to me the option of purchasing his house and garden or of possessing them during my life on the payment either of a stipulated price or of an easy retribution to his kinsman and heir i should probably have been tempted by the demon of property if some legal difficulties had not been started against my title a contest would have been vexatious doubtful and invidious and the heir most gratefully subscribed an agreement which rendered my lifepossession more perfect and his future condition more advantageous yet i had often revolved the judicious lines in which pope answers the objections of his longsighted friend  pity to build without or child or wife why you will enjoy it only all your life well if the use be mine does it concern one whether the name belong to pope or vernon the certainty of my tenure has allowed me to lay out a considerable sum in improvements and alterations they have been executed with skill and taste and few men of letters perhaps in europe are so desirably lodged as myself but i feel and with the decline of years i shall more painfully feel that i am alone in paradise among the circle of my acquaintance at lausanne i have gradually acquired the solid and tender friendship of a respectable family the family of de severy  the four persons of whom it is composed are all endowed with the virtues best adapted to their age and situation and i am encouraged to love the parents as a brother and the children as a father every day we seek and find the opportunities of meeting yet even this valuable connection cannot supply the loss of domestic society  within the last two or three years our tranquillity has been clouded by the disorders of france many families at lausanne were alarmed and affected by the terrors of an impending bankruptcy but the revolution or rather the dissolution of the kingdom has been heard and felt in the adjacent lands  i beg leave to subscribe my assent to mr burkes creed on the revolution of france i admire his eloquence i approve his politics i adore his chivalry and i can almost excuse his reverence for church establishments i have sometimes thought of writing a dialogue of the dead in which lucian erasmus and voltaire should mutually acknowledge the danger of exposing an old superstition to the contempt of the blind and fanatic multitude  a swarm of emigrants of both sexes who escaped from the public ruin has been attracted by the vicinity the manners and the language of lausanne and our narrow habitations in town and country are now occupied by the first names and titles of the departed monarchy these noble fugitives are entitled to our pity they may claim our esteem but they cannot in their present state of mind and fortune much contribute to our amusement instead of looking down as calm and idle spectators on the theater of europe our domestic harmony is somewhat embittered by the infusion of party spirit our ladies and gentlemen assume the character of selftaught politicians and the sober dictates of wisdom and experience are silenced by the clamor of the triumphant democrates the fanatic missionaries of sedition have scattered the seeds of discontent in our cities and villages which had flourished above two hundred and fifty years without fearing the approach of war or feeling the weight of government many individuals and some communities appear to be infested with the gallic phrenzy the wild theories of equal and boundless freedom but i trust that the body of the people will be faithful to their sovereign and to themselves and i am satisfied that the failure or success of a revolt would equally terminate in the ruin of the country while the aristocracy of bern protects the happiness it is superfluous to enquire whether it be founded in the rights of man the economy of the state is liberally supplied without the aid of taxes and the magistrates must reign with prudence and equity since they are unarmed in the midst of an armed nation  the revenue of bern excepting some small duties is derived from church lands tithes feudal rights and interest of money the republic has nearly  00000l sterling in the english funds and the amount of their treasure is unknown to the citizens themselves for myself may the omen be averted i can only declare that the first stroke of a rebel drum would be the signal of my immediate departure  when i contemplate the common lot of mortality i must acknowledge that i have drawn a high prize in the lottery of life the far greater part of the globe is overspread with barbarism or slavery in the civilized world the most numerous class is condemned to ignorance and poverty and the double fortune of my birth in a free and enlightened country in an honorable and wealthy family is the lucky chance of an unit against millions the general probability is about three to one that a newborn infant will not live to complete his fiftieth year see buffon supplement a lhistoire naturelle tom vii page          of a given number of newborn infants one half by the fault of nature or man is extinguished before the age of puberty and reason  a melancholy calculation  i have now passed that age and may fairly estimate the present value of my existence in the threefold division of mind body and estate    the first and indispensable requisite of happiness is a clear conscience unsullied by the reproach or remembrance of an unworthy action   hic murus aheneus esto nil conscire sibi nulla pallescere culpa i am endowed with a cheerful temper a moderate sensibility and a natural disposition to repose rather than to activity some mischievous appetites and habits have perhaps been corrected by philosophy or time the love of study a passion which derives fresh vigor from enjoyment supplies each day each hour with a perpetual source of independent and rational pleasure and i am not sensible of any decay of the mental faculties the original soil has been highly improved by cultivation but it may be questioned whether some flowers of fancy some grateful errors have not been eradicated with the weeds of prejudice   since i have escaped from the long perils of my childhood the serious advice of a physician has seldom been requisite the madness of superfluous health i have never known but my tender constitution has been fortified by time and the inestimable gift of the sound and peaceful slumbers of infancy may be imputed both to the mind and body   i have already described the merits of my society and situation but these enjoyments would be tasteless or bitter if their possession were not assured by an annual and adequate supply according to the scale of switzerland i am a rich man and i am indeed rich since my income is superior to my expense and my expense is equal to my wishes my friend lord sheffield has kindly relieved me from the cares to which my taste and temper are most adverse shall i add that since the failure of my first wishes i have never entertained any serious thoughts of a matrimonial connection  i am disgusted with the affectation of men of letters who complain that they have renounced a substance for a shadow and that their fame which sometimes is no insupportable weight affords a poor compensation for envy censure and persecution mr dalembert relates that as he was walking in the gardens of sans souci with the king of prussia frederic said to him do you see that old woman a poor weeder asleep on that sunny bank she is probably a more happy being than either of us the king and the philosopher may speak for themselves for my part i do not envy the old woman  my own experience at least has taught me a very different lesson twenty happy years have been animated by the labor of my history and its success has given me a name a rank a character in the world to which i should not otherwise have been entitled the freedom of my writings has indeed provoked an implacable tribe but as i was safe from the stings i was soon accustomed to the buzzing of the hornets my nerves are not tremblingly alive and my literary temper is so happily framed that i am less sensible of pain than of pleasure the rational pride of an author may be offended rather than flattered by vague indiscriminate praise but he cannot he should not be indifferent to the fair testimonies of private and public esteem even his moral sympathy may be gratified by the idea that now in the present hour he is imparting some degree of amusement or knowledge to his friends in a distant land that one day his mind will be familiar to the grandchildren of those who are yet unborn in the first of ancient or modern romances tom jones this proud sentiment this feast of fancy is enjoyed by the genius of fielding  come bright love of fame etc fill my ravished fancy with the hopes of charming ages yet to come foretell me that some tender maid whose grandmother is yet unborn hereafter when under the fictitious name of sophia she reads the real worth which once existed in my charlotte shall from her sympathetic breast send forth the heaving sigh do thou teach me not only to foresee but to enjoy nay even to feed on future praise comfort me by the solemn assurance that when the little parlour in which i sit at this moment shall be reduced to a worse furnished box i shall be read with honor by those who never knew nor saw me and whom i shall neither know nor see book xiii chapter    i cannot boast of the friendship or favor of princes the patronage of english literature has long since been devolved on our booksellers and the measure of their liberality is the least ambiguous test of our common success perhaps the golden mediocrity of my fortune has contributed to fortify my application  the present is a fleeting moment the past is no more and our prospect of futurity is dark and doubtful this day may possibly be my last but the laws of probability so true in general so fallacious in particular still allow about fifteen years mr buffon from our disregard of the possibility of death within the four and twenty hours concludes that a chance which falls below or rises above ten thousand to one will never affect the hopes or fears of a reasonable man the fact is true but our courage is the effect of thoughtlessness rather than of reflection if a public lottery were drawn for the choice of an immediate victim and if our name were inscribed on one of the ten thousand tickets should we be perfectly easy  i shall soon enter into the period which as the most agreeable of his long life was selected by the judgment and experience of the sage fontenelle his choice is approved by the eloquent historian of nature who sixes our moral happiness to the mature season in which our passions are supposed to be calmed our duties fulfilled our ambition satisfied our fame and fortune established on a solid basis see buffon  in private conversation that great and amiable man added the weight of his own experience and this autumnal felicity might be exemplified in the lives of voltaire hume and many other men of letters i am far more inclined to embrace than to dispute this comfortable doctrine i will not suppose any premature decay of the mind or body but i must reluctantly observe that two causes the abbreviation of time and the failure of hope will always tinge with a browner shade the evening of life  when i first undertook to prepare mr gibbons memoirs for the press i supposed that it would be necessary to introduce some continuation of them from the time when they cease namely soon after his return to switzerland in the year      but the examination of his correspondence with me suggested that the best continuation would be the publication of his letters from that time to his death i shall thus give more satisfaction by employing the language of mr gibbon instead of my own and the public will see him in a new and i think an admirable light as a writer of letters by the insertion of a few occasional sentences i shall obviate the disadvantages that are apt to arise from an interrupted narration a prejudiced or a fastidious critic may condemn perhaps some parts of the letters as trivial but many readers i flatter myself will be gratified by discovering even in these my friends affectionate feelings and his character in familiar life his letters in general bear a strong resemblance to the style and turn of his conversation the characteristics of which were vivacity elegance and precision with knowledge astonishingly extensive and correct he never ceased to be instructive and entertaining and in general there was a vein of pleasantry in his conversation which prevented its becoming languid even during a residence of many months with a family in the country  it has been supposed that he always arranged what he intended to say before he spoke his quickness in conversation contradicts this notion but it is very true that before he sat down to write a note or letter he completely arranged in his mind what he meant to express he pursued the same method in respect to other composition and he occasionally would walk several times about his apartment before he had rounded a period to his taste he has pleasantly remarked to me that it sometimes cost him many a turn before he could throw a sentiment into a form that gratified his own criticism his systematic habit of arrangement in point of style assisted in his instance by an excellent memory and correct judgment is much to be recommended to those who aspire to any perfection in writing  although the memoirs extend beyond the time of mr gibbons return to lausanne i shall insert a few letters written immediately after his arrival there and combine them so far as to include even the last note which he wrote a few days previously to his death some of them contain few incidents but they connect and carry on the account either of his opinions or of his employment  letters from edward gibbon esquire to the right hon lord sheffield lausanne july  0       wednesday   oclock i have but a moment to say before the departure of the post that after a very pleasant journey i arrived here about half an hour ago that i am as well arranged as if i had never stirred from this place and that dinner on the table is just announced severy i dropped at his country house about two leagues off i just saluted the family who dine with me the day after tomorrow and return to town for some days i hope weeks on my account the son is an amiable and grateful youth and even this journey has taught me to know and to love him still better my satisfaction would be complete had i not found a sad and serious alteration in poor deyverdun but thus our joys are chequered i embrace all and at this moment feel the last pang of our parting at tunbridge convey this letter or information without delay from sheffieldplace to bath in a few days i shall write more amply to both places  october        after such an act of vigor as my first letter composed finished and dispatched within half an hour after my landing while the dinner was smoking on the table your knowledge of the animal must have taught you to expect a proportionable degree of relaxation and you will be satisfied to hear that for many wednesdays and saturdays i have consumed more time than would have sufficed for the epistle in devising reasons for procrastinating it to the next post at this very moment i begin so very late as i am just going to dress and dine in the country that i can take only the benefit of the date october the first and must be content to seal and send my letter next saturday  october the  th saturday is now arrived and i much doubt whether i shall have time to finish i rose as usual about seven but as i knew i should have so much time you know it would have been ridiculous to begin any thing before breakfast when i returned from my breakfastroom to the library unluckily i found on the table some new and interesting books which instantly caught my attention and without injuring my correspondent i could safely bestow a single hour to gratify my curiosity some things which i found in them insensibly led me to other books and other enquiries the morning has stolen away and i shall be soon summoned to dress and dine with the two severys father and son who are returned from the country on a disagreeable errand an illness of madame from which she is however recovering such is the faithful picture of my mind and manners and from a single day disce omnes after having been so long chained to the oar in a splendid galley indeed i freely and fairly enjoy my liberty as i promised in my preface range without control over the wide expanse of my library converse as my fancy prompts me with poets and historians philosophers and orators of every age and language and often indulge my meditations in the invention and arrangement of mighty works which i shall probably never find time or application to execute my garden berceau and pavilion often varied the scene of my studies the beautiful weather which we have enjoyed exhilarated my spirits and i again tasted the wisdom and happiness of my retirement till that happiness was interrupted by a very serious calamity which took from me for above a fortnight all thoughts of study of amusement and even of correspondence i mentioned in my first letter the uneasiness i felt at poor deyverduns declining health how much the pleasure of my life was embittered by the sight of a suffering and languid friend the joy of our meeting appeared at first to revive him and though not satisfied i began to think at least to hope that he was every day gaining ground when alas one morning i was suddenly recalled from my berceau to the house with the dreadful intelligence of an apoplectic stroke i found him senseless the best assistance was instantly collected and he had the aid of the genius and experience of mr tissot and of the assiduous care of another physician who for some time scarcely quitted his bedside either night or day while i was in momentary dread of a relapse with a confession from his physicians that such a relapse must be fatal you will feel that i was much more to be pitied than my friend at length art or nature triumphed over the enemy of life i was soon assured that all immediate danger was past and now for many days i have had the satisfaction of seeing him recover though by slow degrees his health and strength his sleep and appetite he now walks about the garden and receives his particular friends but has not yet gone abroad his future health will depend very much upon his own prudence but at all events this has been a very serious warning and the slightest indisposition will hereafter assume a very formidable aspect but let us turn from this melancholy subject  the man of the people escaped from the tumult the bloody tumult of the westminster election to the lakes and mountains of switzerland and i was informed that he was arrived at the lion dor i sent a compliment he answered it in person and settled at my house for the remainder of the day i have eat and drank and conversed and sat up all night with fox in england but it never has happened perhaps it never can happen again that i should enjoy him as i did that day alone from ten in the morning till ten at night poor deyverdun before his accident wanted spirits to appear and has regretted it since our conversation never flagged a moment and he seemed thoroughly pleased with the place and with his company we had little politics though he gave me in a few words such a character of pit as one great man should give of another his rival much of books from my own on which he flattered me very pleasantly to homer and the arabian nights much about the country my garden which he understands far better than i do and upon the whole i think he envies me and would do so were he minister the next morning i gave him a guide to walk him about the town and country and invited some company to meet him at dinner the following day he continued his journey to bern and zurich and i have heard of him by various means the people gaze on him as a prodigy but he shows little inclination to converse with them etc etc etc our friend douglas has been curious attentive agreeable and in every place where he has resided some days he has left acquaintance who esteem and regret him i never knew so clear and general an impression  after this long letter i have yet many things to say though none of any pressing consequence i hope you are not idle in the deliverance of beriton though the late events and edicts in france begin to reconcile me to the possession of dirty acres what think you of necker and the states generales are not the public expectations too sanguine adieu i will write soon to my lady separately though i have not any particular subject for her ear ever yours  lausanne nov         as i have no correspondents but yourself i should have been reduced to the stale and stupid communications of the newspapers if you had not dispatched me an excellent sketch of the extraordinary state of things in so new a case the salus populi must be the first law and any extraordinary acts of the two remaining branches of the legislature must be excused by necessity and ratified by general consent                     till things are settled i ecpect a regular journal  from kingdoms i descend to farms                  adieu  lausanne dec                                  of public affairs i can only hear with curiosity and wonder careless as you may think me i feel myself deeply interested you must now write often make miss firth copy any curious fragments and stir up any of my wellinformed acquaintance batt douglas adam perhaps lord loughborough to correspond with me i will answer them  we are now cold and gay at lausanne the severys came to town yesterday i saw a good deal of lords malmsbury and beauchamp and their ladies ellis of the rolliad was with them i like him much i gave them a dinner  adieu for the present deyverdun is not worse  lausanne april         before your letter which i received yesterday i was in the anxious situation of a king who hourly expects a courier from his general with the news of a decisive engagement i had abstained from writing for fear of dropping a word or betraying a feeling which might render you too cautious or too bold on the famous  th of april between twelve and two i reflected that the business was determined and each succeeding day i computed the speedy approach of your messenger with favorable or melancholy tidings when i broke the seal i expected to read what a damned unlucky fellow you are nothing tolerable was offered and i indignantly withdrew the estate i did remember the fate of poor lenborough and i was afraid of your magnanimity etc it is whimsical enough but it is human nature that i now begin to think of the deeprooted foundations of land and the airy fabric of the funds i not only consent but even wish to have eight or ten thousand pounds on a good mortgage the pipe of wine you sent to me was seized and would have been confiscated if the government of berne had not treated me with the most flattering and distinguished civility they not only released the wine but they paid out of their own pocket the shares to which the bailiff and the informer were entitled by law i should not forget that the bailiff refused to accept of his part poor deyverduns constitution is quite broken he has had two or three attacks not so violent as the first every time the door is hastily opened i expect to hear of some fatal accident the best or worst hopes of the physicians are only that he may linger some time longer but if he lives till the summer they propose sending him to some mineral waters at aix in savoy you will be glad to hear that i am now assured of possessing during my life this delightful house and garden the act has been lately executed in the best form and the handsomest manner i know not what to say of your miracles at home we rejoice in the kings recovery and its ministerial consequences and i cannot be insensible to the hope at least the chance of seeing in this country a first lord of trade or secretary at war in your answer which i shall impatiently expect you will give me a full and true account of your designs which by this time must have dropped or be determined at least for the present year if you come it is high time that we should look out for a house  a task much less easy than you may possibly imagine among new books i recommend to you the count de mirabeaus great work sur la monarchy prussienne it is in your own way and gives a very just and complete idea of that wonderful machine his correspondence secrette is diabolically good adieu ever yours  lausanne june         you are in truth a wise active indefatigable and inestimable friend and as our virtues are often connected with our faults if you were more tame and placid you would be perhaps of less use and value a very important and difficult transaction seems to be nearly terminated with success and mutual satisfaction we seem to run before the wind with a prosperous gale and unless we should strike on some secret rocks which i do not foresee shall on or before the   st july enter the harbor of content though i cannot pursue the metaphor by adding we shall land since our operation is of a very opposite tendency i could not easily forgive myself for shutting you up in a dark room with parchments and attorneys did i not reflect that this probably is the last material trouble that you will ever have on my account and that after the labors and delays of twenty years i shall at last attain what i have always sighed for a clear and competent income above my wants and equal to my wishes in this contemplation you will be sufficiently rewarded i hope      will be content with our titledeeds for i cannot furnish another shred of parchment mrs gibbons jointure is secured on the beriton estate and her legal consent is requisite for the sale again and again i must repeat my hope that she is perfectly satisfied and that the close of her life may not be embittered by suspicion or fear or discontent what new security does she prefer  the funds the mortgage or your land at all events she must be made easy i wrote to her again some time ago and begged that if she were too weak to write she would desire mrs gould or mrs holroyd to give me a line concerning her state of health to this no answer i am afraid she is displeased  now for the disposal of the money i approve of the  000l mortgage on beriton and honor your prudence in not showing by the comparison of the rent and interest how foolish it is to purchase land                                   there is a chance of my drawing a considerable sum into this country for an arrangement which you yourself must approve but which i have not time to explain at present for the sake of dispatching by this evenings post an answer to your letter which arrived this morning i confine myself to the needful but in the course of a few days i will send a more familiar epistle adieu ever yours  lausanne july         poor deyverdun is no more he expired saturday the  th instant and in his unfortunate situation death could only be viewed by himself and by his friends in the light of a consummation devoutly to be wished since september he has had a dozen apoplectic strokes more or less violent in the intervals between them his strength gradually decayed every principle of life was exhausted and had he continued to drag a miserable existence he must probably have survived the loss of his faculties of all misfortunes this was what he himself most apprehended but his reason was clear and calm to the last he beheld his approaching dissolution with the firmness of a philosopher i fancied that time and reflection had prepared me for the event but the habits of threeandthirty years friendship are not so easily broken the first days and more especially the first nights were indeed painful last wednesday and saturday it would not have been in my power to write i must now recollect myself since it is necessary for me not only to impart the news but to ask your opinion in a very serious and doubtful question which must be decided without loss of time i shall state the facts but as i am on the spot and as new lights may occur i do not promise implicit obedience  had my poor friend died without a will a female first cousin settled somewhere in the north of germany and whom i believe he had never seen would have been his heir at law in the next degree he had several cousins and one of these an old companion by name mr de montagny he has chosen for his heir as this house and garden was the best and clearest part of poor deyverduns fortune as there is a heavy duty or fine what they call lods on every change of property out of the legal descent as montagny has a small estate and a large family it was necessary to make some provision in his favor the will therefore leaves me the option of enjoying this place during my life on paying the sum of   0l i reckon in english money at present and an annual rent of  0l or else of purchasing the house and garden for a sum which including the duty will amount to   00l if i value the rent of  0l at twelve years purchase i may acquire my enjoyment for life at about the rate of  00l and the remaining   00l will be the difference between that tenure and absolute perpetual property as you have never accused me of too much zeal for the interest of posterity you will easily guess which scale at first preponderated i deeply felt the advantage of acquiring for the smaller sum every possible enjoyment as long as i myself should be capable of enjoying i rejected with scorn the idea of giving   00l for ideal posthumous property and i deemed it of little moment whose name after my death should be inscribed on my house and garden at lausanne how often did i repeat to myself the philosophical lines of pope which seem to determine the question  pray heaven cries swift it last as you go on i wish to god this house had been your own pity to build without or son or wife why you will enjoy it only all your life well if the use be mine does it concern one whether the name belong to pope or vernon in this state of selfsatisfaction i was not much disturbed by all my real or nominal friends who exhort me to prefer the right of purchase among such friends some are careless and some are ignorant and the judgment of those who are able and willing to form an opinion is often biassed by some selfish or social affection by some visible or invisible interest but my own reflections have gradually and forcibly driven me from my first propensity and these reflections i will now proceed to enumerate    i can make this purchase with ease and prudence as i have had the pleasure of not hearing from you very lately i flatter myself that you advance on a carpet road and that almost by the receipt of this letter july   st the acres of beriton will be transmuted into sixteen thousand pounds if the payment be not absolutely completed by that day      will not scruple i suppose depositing the   00l at goslings to meet my draught should he hesitate i can desire darrel to sell quantum sufficit of my short annuities as soon as the new settlement of my affairs is made i shall be able after deducting this sum to square my expense to my income etc    on mature consideration i am perhaps less selfish and less philosophical than i appear at first sight indeed were i not so it would now be in my power to turn my fortune into lifeannuities and let the devil take the hindmost i feel perhaps it is foolish but i feel that this little paradise will please me still more when it is absolutely my own and that i shall be encouraged in every improvement of use or beauty by the prospect that after my departure it will be enjoyed by some person of my own choice i sometimes reflect with pleasure that my writings will survive me and that idea is at least as vain and chimerical    the heir mr de montagny is an old acquaintance my situation of a lifeholder is rather new and singular in this country the laws have not provided for many nice cases which may arise between the landlord and tenant some i can foresee others have been suggested many more i might feel when it would be too late his right of property might plague and confine me he might forbid my lending to a friend inspect my conduct check my improvements call for securities repairs etc but if i purchase i walk on my own terrace fierce and erect the free master of one of the most delicious spots on the globe  should i ever migrate homewards you stare but such an event is less improbable than i could have thought it two years ago this place would be disputed by strangers and natives  weigh these reasons and send me without delay a rational explicit opinion to which i shall pay such regard as the nature of circumstances will allow but alas when all is determined i shall possess this house by whatsoever tenure without friendship or domestic society i did not imagine six years ago that a plan of life so congenial to my wishes would so speedily vanish i cannot write upon any other subject adieu yours ever  lausanne august      after receiving and dispatching the power of attorney last wednesday i opened with some palpitation the unexpected missive which arrived this morning the perusal of the contents spoiled my breakfast they are disagreeable in themselves alarming in their consequences and peculiarly unpleasant at the present moment when i hoped to have formed and secured the arrangements of my future life i do not perfectly understand what are these deeds which are so inflexibly required the wills and marriagesettlements i have sufficiently answered but your arguments do not convince      and i have very little hope from the lenborough search what will be the event if his objections are only the result of legal scrupulosity surely they might be removed and every chink might be filled by a general bond of indemnity in which i boldly ask you to join as it will be a substantial important act of friendship without any possible risk to yourself or your successors should he still remain obdurate i must believe what i already suspect that    repents of his purchase and wishes to elude the conclusion our case would be then hopeless ibi omnis effusus labor and the estate would be returned on our hands with the taint of a bad title the refusal of mortgage does not please me but surely our offer shows some confidence in the goodness of my title if he will not take eight thousand pounds at four per cent we must look out elsewhere new doubts and delays will arise and i am persuaded that you will not place an implicit confidence in any attorney i know not as yet your opinion about my lausanne purchase if you are against it the present position of affairs gives you great advantage etc etc the severys are all well an uncommon circumstance for the four persons of the family at once they are now at mex a country house six miles from hence which i visit tomorrow for two or three days they often come to town and we shall contrive to pass a part of the autumn together at roll i want to change the scene and beautiful as the garden and prospect must appear to every eye i feel that the state of my own mind casts a gloom over them every spot every walk every bench recals the memory of those hours of those conversations which will return no more but i tear myself from the subject i could not help writing today though i do not find i have said any thing very material as you must be conscious that you have agitated me you will not postpone any agreeable or even decisive intelligence i almost hesitate whether i shall run over to england to consult with you on the spot and to fly from poor deyverduns shade which meets me at every turn i did not expect to have felt his loss so sharply but six hundred miles why are we so far off  once more what is the difficulty of the title will men of sense in a sensible country never get rid of the tyranny of lawyers more oppressive and ridiculous than even the old yoke of the clergy is not a term of seventy or eighty years nearly twenty in my own person sufficient to prove our legal possession will not the records of fines and recoveries attest that i am free from any bar of entails and settlements consult some sage of the law whether their present demand be necessary and legal if your ground be firm force them to execute the agreement or forfeit the deposit but if as i much fear they have a right and a wish to elude the consummation would it not be better to release them at once than to be hung up for five years as in the case of lovegrove which cost me in the end four or five thousand pounds you are bold you are wise consult resolve act in my penultimate letter i dropped a strange hint that a migration homeward was not impossible i know not what to say my mind is all afloat yet you will not reproach me with caprice or inconstancy how many years did you damn my scheme of retiring to lausanne i executed that plan i found as much happiness as is compatible with human nature and during four years            i never breathed a sigh of repentance on my return from england the scene was changed i found only a faint semblance of deyverdun and that semblance was each day fading from my sight i have passed an anxious year but my anxiety is now at an end and the prospect before me is a melancholy solitude i am still deeply rooted in this country the possession of this paradise the friendship of the severys a mode of society suited to my taste and the enormous trouble and expense of a migration yet in england when the present clouds are dispelled i could form a very comfortable establishment in london or rather at bath and i have a very noble countryseat at about ten miles from east grinstead in sussex alluding to sheffieldplace  that spot is dearer to me than the rest of the three kingdoms and i have sometimes wondered how two men so opposite in their tempers and pursuits should have imbibed so long and lively a propensity for each other sir stanier porten is just dead he has left his widow with a moderate pension and two children my nearest relations the eldest charlotte is about louisas age and also a most amiable sensible young creature i have conceived a romantic idea of educating and adopting her as we descend into the vale of years our infirmities require some domestic female society charlotte would be the comfort of my age and i could reward her care and tenderness with a decent fortune a thousand difficulties oppose the execution of the plan which i have never opened but to you yet it would be less impracticable in england than in switzerland adieu i am wounded pour some oil into my wounds yet i am less unhappy since i have thrown my mind upon paper  are you not amazed at the french revolution they have the power will they have the moderation to establish a good constitution adieu ever yours  lausanne sept        within an hour after the reception of your last i drew my pen for the purpose of a reply and my exordium ran in the following words i find by experience that it is much more rational as well as easy to answer a letter of real business by the return of the post this important truth is again verified by my own example after writing three pages i was called away by a very rational motive and the post departed before i could return to the conclusion a second delay was colored by some decent pretense three weeks have slipped away and i now force myself on a task which i should have dispatched without an effort on the first summons my only excuse is that i had little to write about english business and that i could write nothing definitive about my swiss affairs and first as aristotle says of the first    i was indeed in low spirits when i sent what you so justly style my dismal letter but i do assure you that my own feelings contributed much more to sink me than any events or terrors relative to the sale of beriton but i again hope and trust from your consolatory epistle that etc etc    my swiss transaction has suffered a great alteration i shall not become the proprietor of my house and garden at lausanne and i relinquish the phantom with more regret than you could easily imagine but i have been determined by a difficulty which at first appeared of little moment but which has gradually swelled to an alarming magnitude there is a law in this country as well as in some provinces of france which is styled le droit de retrait le retrait lignagere lord loughborough must have heard of it by which the relations of the deceased are entitled to redeem a house or estate at the price for which it has been sold and as the sum fixed by poor deyverdun is much below its known value a crowd of competitors are beginning to start the best opinions for they are divided are in my favor that i am not subject to le droit de retrait since i take not as a purchaser but as a legatee but the words of the will are somewhat ambiguous the event of law is always uncertain the administration of justice at bern the last appeal depends too much on favor and intrigue and it is very doubtful whether i could revert to the lifeholding after having chosen and lost the property these considerations engaged me to open a negotiation with mr de montagny through the medium of my friend the judge and as he most ardently wishes to keep the house he consented though with some reluctance to my proposals yesterday he signed a covenant in the most regular and binding form by which he allows my power of transferring my interest interprets in the most ample sense my right of making alterations and expressly renounces all claim as landlord of visiting or inspecting the premises i have promised to lend him twelve thousand livres between seven and eight hundred pounds secured on the house and land the mortgage is four times its value the interest of four pounds per cent will be annually discharged by the rent of thirty guineas so that i am now tranquil on that score for the remainder of my days i hope that time will gradually reconcile me to the place which i have inhabited with my poor friend for in spite of the cream of london i am still persuaded that no other place is so well adapted to my taste and habits of studious and social life  far from delighting in the whirl of a metropolis my only complaint against lausanne is the great number of strangers always of english and now of french by whom we are infested in summer yet we have escaped the damned great ones the count dartois the polignacs etc who slip by us to turin what a scene is france while the assembly is voting abstract propositions paris is an independent republic the provinces have neither authority nor freedom and poor necker declares that credit is no more and that the people refuse to pay taxes yet i think you must be seduced by the abolition of tithes if eden goes to paris you may have some curious information give me some account of mr and mrs douglas do they live with lord north i hope they do when will parliament be dissolved are you still coventrymad i embrace my lady the sprightly maria and the smiling louisa alas alas you will never come to switzerland adieu ever yours  lausanne sept   th      alas what perils do environ the man who meddles with cold iron alas what delays and difficulties do attend the man who meddles with legal and landed business yet if it be only to disappoint your expectation i am not so very nervous at this new provoking obstacle i had totally forgotten the deed in question which was contrived in the last year of my fathers life to tie his hands and regulate the disorder of his affairs and which might have been so easily cancelled by sir stanier who had not the smallest interest in it either for himself or his family the amicable suit which is now become necessary must i think be short and unambiguous yet i cannot help dreading the crotchets that lurk under the chancellors great wig and at all events i foresee some additional delay and expense the golden pill of the two thousand eight hundred pounds has soothed my discontent and if it be safely lodged with the goslings i agree with you in considering it as an unequivocal pledge of a fair and willing purchaser it is indeed chiefly in that light i now rejoice in so large a deposit which is no longer necessary in its full extent you are apprised by my last letter that i have reduced myself to the lifeenjoyment of the house and garden and in spite of my feelings i am every day more convinced that i have chosen the safer side i believe my cause to have been good but it was doubtful law in this country is not so expensive as in england but it is more troublesome i must have gone to bern have solicited my judges in person a vile custom the event was uncertain and during at least two years i should have been in a state of suspense and anxiety till the conclusion of which it would have been madness to have attempted any alteration or improvement according to my present arrangement i shall want no more than eleven hundred pounds of the two thousand and i suppose you will direct gosling to lay out the remainder in india bonds that it may not lie quite dead while i am accountable to     for the interest the elderly lady in a male habit who informed me that yorkshire is a register county is a certain judge one sir william blackstone whose name you may possibly have heard after stating the danger of purchasers and creditors with regard to the title of estates on which they lay out or lend their money he thus continues in scotland every act and event regarding the transmission of property is regularly entered on record and some of our own provincial divisions particularly the extended county of york and the populous county of middlesex have prevailed with the legislature to erect such registers in their respective districts blackstones commentaries vol ii p     edition of      in quarto if i am mistaken it is in pretty good company but i suspect that we are all right and that the register is confined to one or two ridings as we have alas two or three months before us i should hope that your prudent sagacity will discover some sound land in case you should not have time to arrange another mortgage i now write in a hurry as i am just setting out for roll where i shall be settled with cook and servants in a pleasant apartment till the middle of november the severys have a house there where they pass the autumn i am not sorry to vary the scene for a few weeks and i wish to be absent while some alterations are making in my house at lausanne i wish the change of air may be of service to severy the father but we do not at all like his present state of health how completely alas how completely could i now lodge you but your firm resolve of making me a visit seems to have vanished like a dream next summer you will not find five hundred pounds for a rational friendly expedition and should parliament be dissolved you will perhaps find five thousand for  i cannot think of it with patience pray take serious strenuous measures for sending me a pipe of excellent madeira in cask with some dozens of malmsey madeira it should be consigned to messrs romberg voituriers at ostend and i must have timely notice of its march we have so much to say about france that i suppose we shall never say any thing that country is now in a state of dissolution adieu  lausanne december   th      you have often reason to accuse my strange silence and neglect in the most important of my own affairs for i will presume to assert that in a business of yours of equal consequence you should not find me cold or careless but on the present occasion my silence is perhaps the highest compliment i ever paid you you remember the answer of philip of macedon philip may sleep while he knows that parmenio is awake i expected and to say the truth i wished that my parmenio would have decided and acted without expecting my dilatory answer and in his decision i should have acquiesced with implicit confidence but since you will have my opinion let us consider the present state of my affairs in the course of my life i have often known and sometimes felt the difficulty of getting money but i now find myself involved in a more singular distress the difficulty of placing it and if it continues much longer i shall almost wish for my land again  i perfectly agree with you that it is bad management to purchase in the funds when they do not yield four pounds per cent              some of this money i can place safely by means of my banker here and i shall possess what i have always desired a command of cash which i cannot abuse to my prejudice since i have it in my power to supply with my pen any extraordinary or fanciful indulgence of expense and so much much indeed for pecuniary matters what would you have me say of the affairs of france we are too near and too remote to form an accurate judgment of that wonderful scene the abuses of the court and government called aloud for reformation and it has happened as it will always happen tha an innocent welldisposed prince has paid the forfeit of the sins of his predecessors of the ambition of lewis the fourteenth of the profusion of lewis the fifteenth the french nation had a glorious opportunity but they have abused and may lose their advantages if they had been content with a liberal translation of our system if they had respected the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the nobles they might have raised a solid fabric on the only true foundation the natural aristocracy of a great country how different is the prospect their king brought a captive to paris after his palace had been stained with the blood of his guards the nobles in exile the clergy plundered in a way which strikes at the root of all property the capital an independent republic the union of the provinces dissolved the flames of discord kindled by the worst of men in that light i consider mirabeau and the honestest of the assembly a set of wild visionaries like our dr price who gravely debate and dream about the establishment of a pure and perfect democracy of fiveandtwenty millions the virtues of the golden age and the primitive rights and equality of mankind which would lead in fair reasoning to an equal partition of lands and money how many years must elapse before france can recover any vigor or resume her station among the powers of europe as yet there is no symptom of a great man a richlieu or a cromwell arising either to restore the monarchy or to lead the commonwealth the weight of paris more deeply engaged in the funds than all the rest of the kingdom will long delay a bankruptcy and if it should happen it will be both in the cause and the effect a measure of weakness rather than of strength you send me to chamberry to see a prince and an archbishop alas we have exiles enough here with the marshal de castries and the duke de guignes at their head and this inundation of strangers which used to be confined to the summer will now stagnate all the winter the only ones whom i have seen with pleasure are mr mounier the late president of the national assembly and the count de lally they have both dined with me mounier who is a serious dry politician is returned to dauphine lally is an amiable man of the world and a poet he passes the winter here you know how much i prefer a quiet select society to a crowd of names and titles and that i always seek conversation with a view to amusement rather than information what happy countries are england and switzerland if they know and preserve their happiness  i have a thousand things to say to my lady maria and louisa but i can add only a short postscript about the madeira good madeira is now become essential to my health and reputation may your hogshead prove as good as the last may it not be intercepted by the rebels or the austrians what a scene again in that country happy england happy switzerland i again repeat adieu  lausanne january   th    0 your two last epistles of the  th and   th instant were somewhat delayed on the road they arrived within two days of each other the last this morning the   th so that i answer by the first or at least by the second post upon the whole your french method though sometimes more rapid appears to me less sure and steady than the old german highway etc etc                but enough of this a new and brighter prospect seems to be breaking upon us and few events of that kind have ever given me more pleasure than your successful negotiation and    s satisfactory answer the agreement is indeed equally convenient for both parties no time or expense will be wasted in scrutinizing the title of the estate the interest will be secured by the clause of five per cent and i lament with you that no larger sum than eight thousand pounds can be placed on beriton without asking what might be somewhat impudent a collateral security etc etc               but i wish you to choose and execute one or the other of these arrangements with sage discretion and absolute power i shorten my letter that i may dispatch it by this post i see the time and i shall rejoice to see it at the end of twenty years when my cares will be at an end and our friendly pages will be no longer sullied with the repetition of dirty land and vile money when we may expatiate on the politics of the world and our personal sentiments without expecting your answer of business i mean to write soon in a purer style and i wish to lay open to my friend the state of my mind which exclusive of all worldly concerns is not perfectly at ease in the mean while i must add two or three short articles   i am astonished at elmsleys silence and the immobility of your picture mine should have departed long since could i have found a sure opportunity etc etc adieu yours  lausanne may   th    0 since the first origin  ab ovo of our connection and correspondence so long an interval of silence has not intervened as far as i remember between us etc etc  from my silence you conclude that the moral complaint which i had insinuated in my last is either insignificant or fanciful the conclusion is rash but the complaint in question is of the nature of a slow lingering disease which is not attended with any immediate danger as i have not leisure to expatiate take the idea in three words since the loss of poor deyverdun i am alone and even in paradise solitude is painful to a social mind when i was a dozen years younger i scarcely felt the weight of a single existence amidst the crowds of london of parliament of clubs but it will press more heavily upon me in this tranquil land in the decline of life and with the increase of infirmities some expedient even the most desperate must be embraced to secure the domestic society of a male or female companion but i am not in a hurry there is time for reflection and advice during this winter such siner feelings have been suspended by the grosser evil of bodily pain on the ninth of february i was seized by such a fit of the gout as i had never known though i must be thankful that its dire effects have been confined to the feet and knees without ascending to the more noble parts with some vicissitudes of better and worse i have groaned between two and three months the debility has survived the pain and though now easy i am carried about in my chair without any power and with a very distant chance of supporting myself from the extreme weakness and contraction of the joints of my knees yet i am happy in a skilful physician and kind assiduous friends every evening during more than three months has been enlivened excepting when i have been forced to refuse them by some cheerful visits and very often by a chosen party of both sexes how different is such society from the solitary evenings which i have passed in the tumult of london it is not worth while fighting about a shadow but should i ever return to england bath not the metropolis would be my last retreat  your portrait is at last arrived in perfect condition and now occupies a conspicuous place over the chimneyglass in my library it is the object of general admiration good judges the few applaud the work the name of reynolds opens the eyes and mouths of the many and were not i afraid of making you vain i would inform you that the original is not allowed to be more than fiveandthirty in spite of private reluctance and public discontent i have honorably dismissed myself his portrait  i shall arrive at sir joshuas before the end of the month he will give me a look and perhaps a touch and you will be indebted to the president one guinea for the carriage do not be nervous i am not rolled up had i been so you might have gazed on my charms four months ago i want some account of yourself of my lady shall we never directly correspond of louisa and of maria how has the latter since her launch supported a quiet winter in sussex i so much rejoice in your divorce from that b  kitty coventry that i care not what marriage you contract a great city would suit your dignity and the duties which would kill me in the first session would supply your activity with a constant fund of amusement but tread softly and surely the ice is deceitful the water is deep and you may be soused over head and ears before you are aware why did not you or elmsley send me the african pamphlet observations on the project for abolishing the slave trade by lord sheffield by the post it would not have cost much you have such a knack of turning a nation that i am afraid you will triumph perhaps by the force of argument over justice and humanity but do you not expect to work at belzebubs sugar plantations in the infernal regions under the tender government of a negrodriver i should suppose both my lady and miss firth very angry with you  as to the bill for prints which has been too long neglected why will you not exercise the power which i have never revoked over all my cash at the goslings the severy family has passed a very favorable winter the young man is impatient to hear from a family which he places above all others yet he will generously write next week and send you a drawing of the alterations in the house do not raise your ideas you know i am satisfied with convenience in architecture and some elegance in furniture i admire the coolness with which you ask me to epistolize reynell and elmsley as if a letter were so easy and pleasant a task it appears less so to me every day     0  your indignation will melt into pity when you hear that for several weeks past i have been again confined to my chamber and my chair yet i must hasten generously hasten to exculpate the gout my old enemy from the curses which you already pour on his head he is not the cause of this disorder although the consequences have been somewhat similar i am satisfied that this effort of nature has saved me from a very dangerous perhaps a fatal crisis and i listen to the flattering hope that it may tend to keep the gout at a more respectful distance etc etc etc  the whole sheet has been filled with dry selfish business but i must and will reserve some lines of the cover for a little friendly conversation i passed four days at the castle of copet with necker and could have wished to have shown him as a warning to any aspiring youth possessed with the demon of ambition with all the means of private happiness in his power he is the most miserable of human beings the past the present and the future are equally odious to him when i suggested some domestic amusements of books building etc he answered with a deep tone of despair dans letat ou je suis je ne puis sentir que le coup de vent qui ma abbatu how different from the careless cheerfulness with which our poor friend lord north supported his fall madame necker maintains more external composure mais le diable ny perd rien it is true that necker wished to be carried into the closet like old pit on the shoulders of the people and that he has been ruined by the democracy which he had raised i believe him to be an able financier and know him to be an honest man too honest perhaps for a minister his rival calonne has passed through lausanne in his way from turin and was soon followed by the prince of conde with his son and grandson but i was too much indisposed to see them they have or have had some wild projects of a counterrevolution horses have been bought men levied such foolish attempts must end in the ruin of the party burkes book is a most admirable medicine against the french disease which has made too much progress even in this happy country i admire his eloquence i approve his politics i adore his chivalry and i can forgive even his superstition the primitive church which i have treated with some freedom was itself at that time an innovation and i was attached to the old pagan establishment the french spread so many lies about the sentiments of the english nation that i wish the most considerable men of all parties and descriptions would join in some public act declaring themselves satisfied and resolved to support our present constitution such a declaration would have a wonderful effect in europe and were i thought worthy i myself would be proud to subscribe it i have a great mind to send you something of a sketch such as all thinking men might adopt  i have intelligence of the approach of my madeira i accept with equal pleasure the second pipe now in the torrid zone send me some pleasant details of your domestic state of maria etc if my lady thinks that my silence is a mark of indifference my lady is a goose i must have you all at lausanne next summer  lausanne august      0 i answer at once your two letters and i should probably have taken earlier notice of the first had i not been in daily expectation of the second i must begin on the subject of what really interests me the most your glorious election for bristol most sincerely do i congratulate your exchange of a cursed expensive jilt who deserted you for a rich jew for an honorable connection with a chaste and virtuous matron who will probably be as constant as she is disinterested in the whole range of election from caithness to st ives i much doubt whether there be a single choice so truly honorable to the member and the constituents the second commercial city invites from a distant province an independent gentleman known only by his active spirit and his writings on the subject of trade and names him without intrigue or expense for her representative even the voice of party is silenced while factions strive which shall applaud the most  you are now sure for seven years to come of never wanting food i mean business what a crowd of suitors or complainants will besiege your door what a load of letters and memorials will be heaped on your table i much question whether even you will not sometimes exclaim ohe jam satis est but that is your affair of the excursion to coventry i cannot decide but i hear it is pretty generally blamed but however i love gratitude to an old friend and shall not be very angry if you damned them with a farewell to all eternity but i cannot repress my indignation at the use of those foolish obsolete odious words whig and tory in the american war they might have some meaning and then your lordship was a tory although you supposed yourself a whig since the coalition all general principles have been confounded and if there ever was an opposition to men not measures it is the present luckily both the leaders are great men and whatever happens the country must fall upon its legs what a strange mist of peace and war seems to hang over the ocean we can perceive nothing but secrecy and vigor but those are excellent qualities to perceive in a minister from yourself and politics i now return to my private concerns which i shall methodically consider under the three great articles of mind body and estate    i am not absolutely displeased at your firing so hastily at the hint a tremendous hint in my last letter but the danger is not so serious or imminent as you seem to suspect and i give you my word that before i take the slightest step which can bind me either in law conscience or honor i will faithfully communicate and we will freely discuss the whole state of the business but at present there is not any thing to communicate or discuss i do assure you that i have not any particular object in view i am not in love with any of the hyaenas of lausanne though there are some who keep their claws tolerably well pared sometimes in a solitary mood i have fancied myself married to one or another of those whose society and conversation are the most pleasing to me but when i have painted in my fancy all the probable consequences of such an union i have started from my dream rejoiced in my escape and ejaculated a thanksgiving that i was still in possession of my natural freedom yet i feel and shall continue to feel that domestic solitude however it may be alleviated by the world by study and even by friendship is a comfortless state which will grow more painful as i descend in the vale of years at present my situation is very tolerable and if at dinnertime or at my return home in the evening i sometimes sigh for a companion there are many hours and many occasions in which i enjoy the superior blessing of being sole master of my own house but your plan though less dangerous is still more absurd than mine such a couple as you describe could not be found and if found would not answer my purpose their rank and position would be awkward and ambiguous to myself and my acquaintance and the agreement of three persons of three characters would be still more impracticable my plan of charlotte porten is undoubtedly the most desirable and she might either remain a spinster the case is not without example or marry some swiss of my choice who would increase and enliven our society and both would have the strongest motives for kind and dutiful behavior but the mother has been indirectly sounded and will not hear of such a proposal for some years on my side i would not take her but as a piece of soft wax which i could model to the language and manners of the country i must therefore be patient  young severys letter which may be now in your hands and which for these three or four last posts has furnished my indolence with a new pretense for delay has already informed you of the means and circumstances of my resurrection tedious indeed was my confinement since i was not able to move from my house or chair from the ninth of february to the first of july very nearly five months the first weeks were accompanied with more pain than i have ever known in the gout with anxious days and sleepless nights and when that pain subsided it left a weakness in my knees which seemed to have no end my confinement was however softened by books by the possession of every comfort and convenience by a succession each evening of agreeable company and by a flow of equal spirits and general good health during the last weeks i descended to the ground floor poor deyverduns apartment and constructed a chair like merlins in which i could wheel myself in the house and on the terrace my patience has been universally admired yet how many thousands have passed those five months less easily than myself i remember making a remark perfectly simple and perfectly true at present i said to madame de severy i am not positively miserable and i may reasonably hope a daily or weekly improvement till sooner or later in the summer i shall recover new limbs and new pleasures which i do not now possess have any of you such a prospect the prediction has been accomplished and i have arrived to my present condition of strength or rather of feebleness i now can walk with tolerable ease in my garden and smooth places but on the rough pavement of the town i use and perhaps shall use a sedan chair the pyrmont waters have performed wonders and my physician not tissot but a very sensible man allows me to hope that the term of the interval will be in proportion to that of the fit  have you read in the english papers that the government of berne is overturned and that we are divided into three democratical leagues true as what i have read in the french papers that the english have cut off pitts head and abolished the house of lords the people of this country are happy and in spite of some miscreants and more foreign emissaries they are sensible of their happiness  finally  inform my lady that i am indignant at a false and heretical assertion in her last letter to severy that friends at a distance cannot love each other if they do not write i love her better than any woman in the world indeed i do and yet i do not write and she herself  but i am calm we have now nearly one hundred french exiles some of them worth being acquainted with particularly a count de schomberg who is become almost my friend he is a man of the world of letters and of sufficient age since in      he succeeded to marshal saxes regiment of dragoons as to the rest i entertain them and they flatter me but i wish we were reduced to our lausanne society poor france the state is dissolved the nation is mad adieu  lausanne april        first of my health it is now tolerably restored my legs are still weak but the animal in general is in a sound and lively condition and we have great hopes from the fine weather and the pyrmont waters i most sincerely wished for the presence of maria to embellish a ball which i gave the   th of last month to all the best company natives and foreigners of lausanne with the aid of the severys especially of the mother and son who directed the economy and performed the honors of the fete it opened about seven in the evening the assembly of men and women was pleased and pleasing the music good the illumination splendid the refreshments profuse at twelve one hundred and thirty persons sat down to a very good supper at two i stole away to bed in a snug corner and i was informed at breakfast that the remains of the veteran and young troops with severy and his sister at their head had concluded the last dance about a quarter before seven this magnificent entertainment has gained me great credit and the expense was more reasonable than you can easily imagine this was an extraordinary event but i give frequent dinners and in the summer i have an assembly every sunday evening what a wicked wretch says my lady  i cannot pity you for the accumulation of business as you ought not to pity me if i complained of the tranquillity of lausanne we suffer or enjoy the effects of our own choice perhaps you will mutter something of our not being born for ourselves of public spirit i have formerly read of such a thing of private friendship for which i give you full and ample credit etc but your parliamentary operations at least will probably expire in the month of june and i shall refuse to sign the newhaven conveyance unless i am satisfied that you will execute the lausanne visit this summer on the   th of june suppose lord lady maria and maid poor louisa in a post coach with elienne on horseback set out from downingstreet or sheffieldplace cross the channel from brighton to dieppe visit the national assembly buy caps at paris examine the ruins of versailles and arrive at lausanne without danger or fatigue the second week in july you will be lodged pleasantly and comfortably and will not perhaps despise my situation a couple of months will roll alas too hastily away you will all be amused by new scenes new people and whenever maria and you with severy mount on horseback to visit the country the glaciers etc my lady and myself shall form a very quiet teteatete at home in september if you are tired you may return by a direct or indirect way but i only desire that you will not make the plan impracticable by grasping at too much in return i promise you a visit of three or four months in the autumn of ninetytwo you and my booksellers are now my principal attractions in england you had some right to growl at hearing of my supplement in the papers but cadells indiscretion was founded on a hint which i had thrown out in a letter and which in all probability will never be executed yet i am not totally idle adieu  lausanne may         i write a short letter on small paper to inform you that the various deeds which arrived safe and in good condition have this morning been sealed signed and delivered in the presence of respectable and wellknown english witnesses to have read the aforesaid acts would have been difficult to have understood them impracticable i therefore signed them with my eyes shut and in that implicit confidence which we freemen and britons are humbly content to yield to our lawyers and ministers i hope however most seriously hope that every thing has been carefully examined and that i am not totally ruined it is not without much impatience that i expect an account of the payment and investment of the purchasemoney it was my intention to have added a new edition of my will but i hve an unexpected call to go to geneva tomorrow with the severys and must defer that business a few days till after my return on my return i may possibly find a letter from you and will write more fully in answer my posthumous work contained in a single sheet will not ruin you in postage in the mean while let me desire you either never to talk of lausanne or to execute the journey this summer after the dispatch of public and private business there can be no real obstacle but in yourself pray do not go to war with russia it is very foolish i am quite angry with pit adieu  lausanne may         at length i see a ray of sunshine breaking from a dark cloud your epistle of the   th arrived this morning the   th instant the day after my return from geneva it has been communicated to severy we now believe that you intend a visit to lausanne this summer and we hope that you will execute that intention if you are a man of honor you shall find me one and on the day of your arrival at lausanne i will ratify my engagement of visiting the british isle before the end of the year      excepting only the fair and foul exception of the gout you rejoice me by proposing the addition of dear louisa it was not without a bitter pang that i threw her overboard to lighten the vessel and secure the voyage i was fearful of the governess a second carriage and a long train of difficulty and expense which might have ended in blowing up the whole scheme but if you can bodkin the sweet creature into the coach she will find an easy welcome at lausanne the first arrangements which i must make before your arrival may be altered by your own taste on a survey of the premises and you will all be commodiously and pleasantly lodged you have heard a great deal of the beauty of my house garden and situation but such are their intrinsic value that unless i am much deceived they will bear the test even of exaggerated praise from my knowledge of your lordship i have always entertained some doubt how you would get through the society of a lausanne winter but i am satisfied that exclusive of friendship your summer visits to the banks of the leman lake will long be remembered as one of the most agreeable periods of your life and that you will scarcely regret the amusement of a sussex committee of navigation in the dog days you ask for details what details a map of france and a postbook are easy and infallible guides if the ladies are not afraid of the ocean you are not ignorant of the passage from brighton to dieppe paris will then be in your direct road and even allowing you to look at the pandaemonium the ruins of versailles etc a fortnight diligently employed will clear you from sheffield place to gibbon castle what can i say more  as little have i to say on the subject of my worldly matters which seem now jupiter be praised to be drawing toward a final conclusion since when people part with their money they are indeed serious i do not perfectly understand the ratio of the precise sum which you have poured into goslings reservoir but suppose it will be explained in a general account  you have been very dutiful in sending me what i have always desired a cut woodfall on a remarkable debate a debate indeed most remarkable poor      is the most eloquent and rational madman that i ever knew i love   s feelings but i detest the political principles of the man and of the party formerly you detested them more strongly during the american war than myself i am half afraid that you are corrupted by your unfortunate connections should you admire the national assembly we shall have many an altercation for i am as high an aristocrat as burke himself and he has truly observed that it is impossible to debate with temper on the subject of that cursed revolution in my last excursion to geneva i frequently saw the neckers who by this time are returned to their summer residence at copet he is much restored in health and spirits especially since the publication of his last book which has probably reached england both parties who agree in abusing him agree likewise that he is a man of virtue and genius but i much fear that the purest intentions have been productive of the most baneful consequences our military men i mean the french are leaving us every day for the camp of the princes at worms and support what is called representation their hopes are sanguine i will not answer for their being well grounded it is certain however that the emperor had an interview the   th instant with the count of artois at mantua and the aristocrats talk in mysterious language of spain sardinia the empire four or five armies etc they will doubtless strike a blow this summer may it not recoil on their own heads adieu embrace our female travelers a short delay  lausanne june         i now begin to see you all in real motion swimming from brighton to dieppe according to my scheme and afterward treading the direct road which you cannot well avoid to the turbulent capital of the late kingdom of france i know not what more to say or what further instructions to send they would indeed be useless as you are traveling through a country which has been sometimes visited by englishmen only this let me say that in the midst of anarchy the roads were never more secure than at present as you will wish to assist at the national assembly you will act prudently in obtaining from the french in london a good recommendation to some leading member cazales for instance or the abbe maury i soon expect from elmsley a cargo of books but you may bring me any new pamphlet of exquisite flavor particularly the last works of john lord sheffield which the dog has always neglected to send you will have time to write once more and you must endeavor as nearly as possible to mark the day of your arrival you may come either by lions and geneva by dijon and les rousses or by dole and pontarliere the post will fail you on the edge of switzerland and must be supplied by hired horses i wish you to make your last days journey easy so as to dine upon the road and arrive by teatime the pulse of the counterrevolution beats high but i cannot send you any certain facts adieu i want to hear my lady abusing me for never writing all the severys are very impatient  notwithstanding the high premium i do not absolutely wish you drowned besides all other cares i must marry and propagate which would give me a great deal of trouble  lausanne july  st      in obedience to your orders i direct a flying shot to paris though i have not any thing particular to add excepting that our impatience is increased in the inverse ratio of time and space yet i almost doubt whether you have passed the sea the news of the king of frances escape must have reached you before the   th the day of your departure and the prospect of strange unknown disorder may well have suspended your firmest resolves the royal animal is again caught and all may probably be quiet i was just going to exhort you to pass through brussels and the confines of germany a fair irishism since if you read this you are already at paris the only reasonable advice which now remains is to obtain by means of lord gower a sufficiency or even superfluity of forcible passports such as leave no room for cavil on a jealous frontier the frequent intercourse with paris has proved that the best and shortest road instead of besancon is by dijon dole les rousses and nyon adieu i warmly embrace the ladies it would be idle now to talk of business  it has appeared from the foregoing letters that a visit from myself and my family to mr gibbon at lausanne had been for some time in agitation this longpromised excursion took place in the month of june      and occasioned a considerable cessation of our correspondence i landed at dieppe immediately after the flight from and return to paris of the unfortunate lewis xvi during my stay in that capital i had an opportunity of seeing the extraordinary ferment of mens minds both in the national assembly in private societies and in my passage through france to lausanne where i recalled to my memory the interesting scenes i had witnessed by frequent conversations with my deceased friend i might have wished to record his opinions on the subject of the french revolution if he had not expressed them so well in the annexed letters he seemed to suppose as some of his letters hint that i had a tendency to the new french opinions never indeed i can with truth aver was suspicion more unfounded nor could it have been admitted into mr gibbons mind but that his extreme friendship for me and his utter abhorrence of these notions made him anxious and jealous even to an excess that i should not entertain them he was however soon undeceived he found that i was full as averse to them as himself i had from the first expressed an opinion that such a change as was aimed at in france must derange all the regular governments in europe hazard the internal quiet and dearest interests of this country and probably end in bringing on mankind a much greater portion of misery than the most sanguine reformer had ever promised to himself or others to produce of benefit by the visionary schemes of liberty and equality with which the ignorant and vulgar were misled and abused  mr gibbon at first like many others seemed pleased with the prospect of the reform of inveterate abuses but he very soon discovered the mischief which was intended the imbecility with which concessions were made and the ruin that must arise from the want of resolution or conduct in the administration of france he lived to reprobate in the strongest terms possible the folly of the first reformers and the something worse than extravagance and ferocity of their successors he saw the wild and mischievous tendency of those pretended reformers which while they professed nothing but amendment really meant destruction to all social order and so strongly was his opinion fixed as to the danger of hasty innovation that he became a warm and zealous advocate for every sort of old establishment which he marked in various ways sometimes rather ludicrously and i recollect in a circle where french affairs were the topic and some portuguese present he seemingly with seriousness argued in favor of the inquisition at lisbon and said he would not at the present moment give up even that old establishment  it may perhaps not be quite uninteresting to the readers of these memoirs to know that i found mr gibbon at lausanne in possession of an excellent house the view from which and from the terrace was so uncommonly beautiful that even his own pen would with difficulty describe the scene which it commanded this prospect comprehended every thing grand and magnificent which could be furnished by the finest mountains among the alps the most extensive view of the lake of geneva with a beautifully varied and cultivated country adorned by numerous villas and picturesque buildings intermixed with beautiful masses of stately trees here my friend received us with an hospitality and kindness which i can never forget the best apartments of the house were appropriated to our use the choicest society of the place was sought for to enliven our visit and render every day of it cheerful and agreeable it was impossible for any man to be more esteemed and admired than mr gibbon was at lausanne the preference he had given to that place in adopting it for a residence rather than his own country was felt and acknowledged by all the inhabitants and he may have been said almost to have given the law to a set of as willing subjects as any man ever presided over in return for the deference shown to him he mixed without any affectation in all the society i mean all the best society that lausanne afforded he could indeed command it and was perhaps for that reason the more partial to it for he often declared that he liked society more as a relaxation from study than as expecting to derive from it amusement or instruction that to books he looked for improvement not to living persons but this i considered partly as an answer to my expressions of wonder that a man who might choose the most various and most generally improved society in the world namely in england that he should prefer the very limited circle of lausanne which he never deserted but for an occasional visit to m and madame necker it must not however be understood that in choosing lausanne for his home he was insensible to the merits of a residence in england he was not in possession of an income which corresponded with his notions of ease and comfort in his own country in switzerland his fortune was ample to this consideration of fortune may be added another which also had its weight from early youth mr gibbon had contracted a partiality for foreign taste and foreign habits of life which made him less a stranger abroad than he was in some respects in his native country this arose perhaps from having been out of england from his sixteenth to his twentyfirst year yet when i came to lausanne i found him apparently without relish for french society during the stay i made with him he renewed his intercourse with the principal french who were at lausanne of whom there happened to be a considerable number distinguished for rank or talents many indeed respectable for both marshal de castries and several branches of his family duc de guignes and daughters duc and duchess de guiche madame de grammont princess dhenin princess de bouillon duchess de biron prince de salms comte de schomberg m lally tolendal m de mounier madame daguesseau and family m de malherbes etc etc  during my stay in switzerland i was not absent from my friends house except during a short excursion that we made together to mr neckers at copet and a tour to geneva chamouny over the col de balm to martigny st maurice and round the lake by vevay to lausanne in the social and singularly pleasant months that i passed with mr gibbon he enjoyed his usual cheerfulness with good health since he left england in      he had had a severe attack mentioned in one of the foregoing letters of an erysipelas which at last settled in one of his legs and left something of a dropsical tendency for at this time i first perceived a considerable degree of swelling about the ancle  in the beginning of october i left this delightful residence and some time after my return to england our correspondence recommenced  letters from edward gibbon esquire to lord sheffield and others edward gibbon esquire to the hon miss holroyd lausanne  th nov      gulliver is made to say in presenting his interpreter my tongue is in the mouth of my friend allow me to say with proper expressions and excuses my pen is in the hand of my friend and the aforesaid friend begs leave thus to continue the remainder of the letter was dictated by mr gibbon and written by m with de severy   i remember to have read somewhere in rousseau of a lover quitting very often his mistress to have the pleasure of corresponding with her though not absolutely your lover i am very much your admirer and should be extremely tempted to follow the same example the spirit and reason which prevail in your conversation appear to great advantage in your letters the three which i have received from berne coblentz and brussels have given me much real pleasure first as a proof that you are often thinking of me secondly as an evidence that you are capable of keeping a resolution and thirdly from their own intrinsic merit and entertainment the style without any allowance for haste or hurry is perfectly correct the manner is neither too light nor too grave the dimensions neither too long nor too short they are such in a word as i should like to receive from the daughter of my best friend i attend your lively journal through bad roads and worse inns your description of men and manners conveys very satisfactory information and i am particularly delighted with your remark concerning the irregular behavior of the rhine but the rhine alas after some temporary wanderings will be content to flow in his old channel while man  man is the greatest fool of the whole creation  i direct this letter to sheffieldplace where i suppose you arrived in health and safety i congratulate my lady on her quiet establishment by her fireside and hope you will be able after all your excursions to support the climate and manners of old england before this epistle reaches you i hope to have received the two promised letters from dover and sheffieldplace if they should not meet with a proper return you will pity and forgive me i have not yet heard from lord sheffield who seems to have devolved on his daughter the task which she has so gloriously executed i shall probably not write to him till i have received his first letter of business from england but with regard to my lady i have most excellent intentions  i never could understand how two persons of such superior merit as miss holroyd and miss lausanne could have so little relish for one another as they appeared to have in the beginning and it was with great pleasure that i observed the degrees of their growing intimacy and the mutual regret of their separation whatever you may imagine your friends at lausanne have been thinking as frequently of yourself and company as you could possibly think of them and you will be very ungrateful if you do not seriously resolve to make them a second visit under such name and title as you may judge most agreeable none of the severy family except perhaps my secretary are inclined to forget you and i am continually asked for some account of your health motions and amusements since your departure no great events have occurred i have made a short excursion to geneva and copet and found mr necker in much better spirits than when you saw him they pressed me to pass some weeks this winter in their house at geneva and i may possibly comply at least in part with their invitation the aspect of lausanne is peaceful and placid and you have no hopes of a revolution driving me out of this country we hear nothing of the proceedings of the commission a commission at the head of which was monsieur fischer one of the principal members of the government of berne a very active and intelligent man who would have distinguished himself in the administration of any country this commission which was accompanied by two or three thousand of the best of the german militia of the canton of berne was sent for the purpose of examining into some attempts to introduce the french revolutionary principles into the pays de vaud several persons were seized the greater part were released the examination was secret but rosset and la motte were confined in the castle of chillon and being afterward condemned for correspondence with the french to a long imprisonment were transferred to the castle of arbourg s  except by playing at cards every evening with monsieur fischer who often speaks of lord sheffield with esteem and respect there is no appearance of rosset and la motte being brought to a speedy trial and they still remain in the castle of chillon which according to the geography of the national assembly is washed by the sea our winter begins with great severity and we shall not probably have many balls which as you may imagine i lament much angletine does not consider two french words as a letter montrond sighs and blushes whenever louisas name is mentioned philippine wishes to converse with her on men and manners the french ladies are settled in town for the winter and they form with mrs trevor a very agreeable addition to our society it is now enlivened by a visit of the chevalier de boufflers one of the most accomplished men in the ci devant kingdom of france  as mrs wood madame de silva  who has miscarried is about to leave us i must either cure or die and upon the whole i believe the former will be most expedient you will see her in london with dear corea next winter my rival magnificently presents me with an hogshead of madeira so that in honor i could not supplant him yet i do assure you from my heart that another departure is much more painful to me the apartment below the apartment principally inhabited during the residence of my family at lausanne s is shut up and i know not when i shall again visit it with pleasure adieu believe me one and all most affectionately yours  edward gibbon esquire to the right hon lord sheffield lausanne december         alas alas the demon of procrastination has again possessed me three months have nearly rolled away since your departure and seven letters five from the most valuable maria and two from yourself have extorted from me only a single epistle which perhaps would never have been written had i not used the permission of employing my own tongue and the hand of a secretary shall i tell you that for these last six weeks the eve of every day has witnessed a firm resolution and the day itself has furnished some ingenious delay this morning for instance i determined to invade you as soon as the breakfast things should be removed they were removed but i had something to read to write to meditate and there was time enough before me hour after hour has stolen away and i finally begin my letter at two oclock evidently too late for the post as i must dress dine go abroad etc a foundation however shall be laid which will stare me in the face and next saturday i shall probably be roused by the awful reflection that it is the last day in the year  after realizing this summer an event which i had long considered as a dream of fancy i know not whether i should rejoice or grieve at your visit to lausanne while i possessed the family the sentiment of pleasure highly predominated when just as we had subsided in a regular easy comfortable plan of life the last trump sounded and without speaking of the pang of separation you left me to one of the most gloomy solitary months of october which i have ever passed for yourself and daughters however you have contrived to snatch some of the most interesting scenes of this world paris at such a moment switzerland and the rhine strasburg coblentz have suggested a train of lively images and useful ideas which will not be speedily erased the mind of the young damsel more especially will be enlarged and enlightened in every sense in four months she has lived many years and she will much deceive and displease me if she does not review and methodize her journal in such a manner as she is capable of performing for the amusement of her particular friends another benefit which will redound from your recent view is that every place person and object about lausanne are now become familiar and interesting to you in our future correspondence do i dare pronounce the word correspondence i can talk to you as freely of every circumstance as if it were actually before your eyes and first of my own improvements  all those venerable piles of ancient verdure which you admired have been eradicated in one fatal day your faithful substitutes william de severy and levade have never ceased to persecute me till i signed their death warrant their place is now supplied by a number of picturesque naked poles the fosterfathers of as many twigs of platanusses which may afford a grateful but distant shade to the founder or to his seris nepotibus in the mean while i must confess that the terrace appears broader and that i discover a much larger quantity of snow than i should otherwise do the workmen admire your ingenious plan for cutting out a new bedchamber and bookroom but on mature consideration we all unanimously prefer the old scheme of adding a third room on the terrace beyond the library with two spacious windows and a fireplace between it will be larger    feet by    and pleasanter and warmer the difference of expense will be much less considerable than i imagined the door of communication with the library will be artfully buried in the wainscot and unless it be opened by my own choice may always remain a profound secret such is the design but as it will not be executed before next summer you have time and liberty to state your objections i am much colder about the staircase but it may be finished according to your idea for thirty pounds and i feel they will persuade me am i not a very rich man when these alterations are completed few authors of six volumes in quarto will be more agreeably lodged than myself lausanne is now full and lively all our native families are returned from the country and praised be the lord we are infested with few foreigners either french or english even our democrats are more reasonable or more discreet it is agreed to wave the subject of politics and all seem happy and cordial i have a grand dinner this week a supper of thirty or forty people on twelfthday etc some concerts have taken place some balls are talked of and even maria would allow yet it is ungenerous to say even maria that the winter scene at lausanne is tolerably gay and active i say nothing of the severys as angletine has epistolized maria last post she has probably hinted that her brother meditates a short excursion to turin that worthy fellow trevor has given him a pressing invitation to his own house in the beginning of february i propose going to geneva for three or four weeks i shall lodge and eat with the neckers my mornings will be my own and i shall spend my evenings in the society of the place where i have many acquaintance this short absence will agitate my stagnant life and restore me with fresh appetite to my house my library and my friends before that time the end of february what events may happen or be ready to happen the national assembly compared to which the former was a senate of heroes and demigods seem resolved to attack germany avec quatre millions de bayonettes libres the army of the princes must soon either sight or starve or conquer will sweden draw his sword will russia draw her purse an empty purse all is darkness and anarchy neither party is strong enough to oppose a settlement and i cannot see a possibility of an amicable arrangement where there are no heads in any sense of the word who can answer for the multitude send me your ideas and those of lord guildford lord loughborough fox etc  before i conclude a word of my vexatious affairs  shall i never sail on the smooth stream of good security and halfyearly interest will every body refuse my money i had already written to darrel and gosling to obey your commands and was in hopes that you had already made large and salutary evacuations during your absence i never expected much effect from the cold indifference of agents but you are now in england  you will be speedily in london set all your settingdogs to beat the field hunt enquire why should you not advertise yet i am almost ashamed to complain of some stagnation of interest when i am witness to the natural and acquired philosophy of so many french who are reduced from riches not to indigence but to absolute want and beggary a count argout has just left us who possessed ten thousand a year in the island of st domingo he is utterly burnt and ruined and a brother whom he tenderly loved has been murdered by the negroes these are real misfortunes i have much revolved the plan of the memoirs i once mentioned and as you do not think it ridiculous i believe i shall make an attempt if i can please myself i am confident of not displeasing but let this be a profound secret between us people must not be prepared to laugh they must be taken by surprise have you looked over your or rather my letters surely in the course of the year you may find a safe and cheap occasion of sending me a parcel they may assist me adieu i embrace my lady send me a favorable account of her health i kiss the marmaille by an amazing push of remorse and diligence i have finished my letter three pages and a half this same day since dinner but i have not time to read it  ever yours half past six to the same lausanne december         tomorrow a new year multos et felices i now most sincerely repent of my late repentance and do almost swear never to renounce the amiable and useful practice of procrastination had i delayed as i was strongly tempted another post your missive of the   th which did not reach me till this morning three mails were due would have arrived in time and i might have avoided this second herculean labor it will be however no more than an infant hercules the topics of conversation have been fully discussed and i shall now confine myself to the needful of the new business felix faustumque sit may no untoward accident disarrange your yorkshire mortgage the conclusion of which will place me in a clear and easy state such as i have never known since the first hour of property      the three per cents are so high and the country is in such a damned state of prosperity under that fellow pit that it goes against me to purchase at such low interest in my visit to england next autumn or in the spring following alas you must acquiesce in the alternative i hope to be armed with sufficient materials to draw a sum which may be employed as taste or fancy shall dictate in the improvement of my library a service of plate etc i am not very sanguine but surely this is no uncomfortable prospect this pecuniary detail which has not indeed been so unpleasant as it used formerly to be has carried me farther than i expected let us now drink and be merry i flatter myself that your madeira improved by its travels will set forwards for messrs romberg at ostend early in the spring and i should be very well pleased if you could add a hogshead of excellent claret for which we should be entitled to the drawback they must halt at baste and send notice to me for a safeconduct have you had any intelligence from lord auckland about the wine which he was to order from bourdeaux by marseilles and the rhone the one need not impede the other i wish to have a large stock corea has promised me a hogshead of his native madeira for which i am to give him an order on cadell for a copy of the decline and fall he vanished without notice and is now at paris could you not fish out his direction by mrs wood who by this time is in england i rejoice in lallys prosperity have you reconsidered my proposal of a declaration of constitutional principles from the heads of the party i think a foolish address from a body of whigs to the national assembly renders it still more incumbent on you atchieve my worldly concerns et eris mihi magnus apollo adieu ever yours  to the same lausanne april  th      for fear you should abuse me as usual i will begin the attack and scold at you for not having yet sent me the longexpected intelligence of the completion of my mortgage you had positively assured me that the second of february would terminate my worldly cares by a consummation so devoutly to be wished the news therefore might reach me about the eighteenth and i argued with the gentle logic of laziness that it was perfectly idle to answer your letter till i could chaunt a thanksgiving song of gratitude and praise as every post disappointed my hopes the same argument was repeated for the next and twenty emptyhanded postilions have blown their insignificant horns till i am provoked at last to write by sheer impatience and vexation facit indignatio versum cospetto di baccho for i must ease myself by swearing a little what is the cause the meaning the pretense of this delay are the yorkshire mortgagers inconstant in their wishes are the london lawyers constant in their procrastination is a letter on the road to inform me that all is concluded or to tell me that all is broken to pieces had the money been placed in the three per cents last may besides the annual interest it would have gained by the rise of stock nearly twenty per cent your lordship is a wise man a successful writer and an useful senator you understand america and ireland corn and slaves but your prejudice against the funds it would be more correct if he had said my preference of land s  in which i am often tempted to join makes you a little blind to their increasing value in the hands of our virtuous and excellent minister but our regret is vain one pull more and we reach the shore and our future correspondence will be no longer tainted with business shall i then be more diligent and regular i hope and believe so for now that i have got over this article of worldly interest my letter seems to be almost finished a propos of letters am i not a sad dog to forget my lady and maria alas the dual number has been prejudicial to both how happy could i be with either were the other dear charmer away i am like the ass of famous memory i cannot tell which way to turn first and there i stand mute and immovable the baronial and maternal dignity of my lady supported by twenty years friendship may claim the preference but the sive incomparable letters of maria  next week however  am i not ashamed to talk of next week  i have most successfully and most agreeably executed my plan of spending the month of march at geneva in the neckerhouse and every circumstance that i had arranged turned out beyond my expectation the freedom of the morning the society of the table and drawing room from half an hour past two till six or seven an evening assembly and cardparty in a round of the best company and excepting one day in the week a private supper of free and friendly conversation you would like geneva better than lausanne there is much more information to be got among the men but though i found some agreeable women their manners and style of life are upon the whole less easy and pleasant than our own i was much pleased with neckers brother mr de germain a goodhumoured polite sensible man without the genius and fame of the statesman but much more adapted for private and ordinary happiness madame de stael is expected in a few weeks at copet where they receive her and where the pleasing anxious being she will have leisure to regret to dumb forgetfulness a prey which she enjoyed amidst the storms of paris but what can the poor creature do her husband is in sweden her lover is no longer secretary at war and her fathers house is the only place where she can reside with the least degree of prudence and decency of that father i have really a much higher idea than i ever had before in our domestic intimacy he cast away his gloom and reserve i saw a great deal of his mind and all that i saw is fair and worthy he was overwhelmed by the hurricane he mistook his way in the fog but in such a perilous situation i much doubt whether any mortal could have seen or stood in the meanwhile he is abused by all parties and none of the french in geneva will set their foot in his house he remembers lord sheffield with esteem his health is good and he would be tranquil in his private life were not his spirits continually wounded by the arrival of every letter and every newspaper his sympathy is deeply interested by the fatal consequences of a revolution in which he had acted so leading a part and he feels as a friend for the danger of m de lessart who may be guilty in the eyes of the jacobius or even of his judges by those very actions and dispatches which would be most approved by all the lovers of his country what a momentous event is the emperors death in the forms of a new reign and of the imperial election the democrats have at least gained time if they knew how to use it but the new monarch though of a weak complexion is of a martial temper he loves the soldiers and is beloved by them and the slow fluctuating politics of his uncle may be succeeded by a direct line of march to the gates of strasbourg and paris it is the opinion of the master movers in france i know it most certainly that their troops will not fight that the people have lost all sense of patriotism and that on the first discharge of an austrian cannon the game is up but what occasion for austrians or spaniards the french are themselves their greatest enemies four thousand marseillois are marched against arles and avignon the troops de ligne are divided between the two parties and the flame of civil war will soon extend over the southern provinces you have heard of the unworthy treatment of the swiss regiment of ernst the canton of berne has bravely recalled them with a stout letter to the king of france which must be inserted in all the papers i now come to the most unpleasant article our home politics bosset and la motte are condemned to fine and twenty years imprisonment in the fortress of arbourg we have not yet received their official sentence nor is it believed that the proofs and proceedings against them will be published an awkward circumstance which it does not seem easy to justify some though none of note are taken up several are fled many more are suspected and suspicious all are silent but it is the silence of fear and discontent and the secret hatred which rankled against government begins to point against the few who are known to be wellaffected i never knew any place so much changed as lausanne even since last year and though you will not be much obliged to me for the motive i begin very seriously to think of visiting sheffieldplace by the month of september next yet here again i am frightened by the dangers of a french and the difficulties of a german route you must send me an account of the passage from dieppe to brighton with an itinerary of the rhine distances expenses etc as usual i just save the post nor have i time to read my letter which after wasting the morning in deliberation has been struck off in a heat since dinner no news of the madeira your views of s p are just received they are admired and shall be framed severy has spent the carnival at turin trevor is only the best man in the world  to the same lausanne may  0th      after the receipt of your penultimate eight days ago i expected with much impatience the arrival of your nextpromised epistle it arrived this morning but has not completely answered my expectations i wanted and i hoped for a full and fair picture of the present and probable aspect of your political world with which at this distance i seem every day less satisfied in the slave question you triumphed last session in this you have been defeated what is the cause of this alteration if it proceeded only from an impulse of humanity i cannot be displeased even with an error since it is very likely that my own vote had i possessed one would have been added to the majority but in this rage against slavery in the numerous petitions against the slave trade was there no leaven of new democratical principles no wild ideas of the rights and natural equality of man it is these i fear some articles in newspapers some pamphlets of the year the jockey club have fallen into my hands i do not infer much from such publications yet i have never known them of so black and malignant a cast i shuddered at greys motion disliked the halfsupport of fox admired the firmness of pitts declaration and excused the usual intemperance of burke surely such men as                   have talents for mischief i see a club of reform which contains some respectable names inform me of the professions the principles the plans the resources of these reformers will they heat the minds of the people does the french democracy gain no ground will the bulk of your party stand firm to their own interest and that of their country will you not take some active measures to declare your sound opinions and separate yourselves from your rotten members if you allow them to perplex government if you trifle with this solemn business if you do not resist the spirit of innovation in the first attempt if you admit the smallest and most specious change in our parliamentary system you are lost you will be driven from one step to another from principles just in theory to consequences most pernicious in practice and your first concessions will be productive of every subsequent mischief for which you will be answerable to your country and to posterity do not suffer yourselves to be lulled into a false security remember the proud fabric of the french monarchy not four years ago it stood founded as it might seem on the rock of time force and opinion supported by the triple aristocracy of the church the nobility and the parliaments they are crumbled into dust they are vanished from the earth if this tremendous warning has no effect on the men of property in england if it does not open every eye and raise every arm you will deserve your fate if i am too precipitate enlighten if i am too desponding encourage me  my pen has run into this argument for as much a foreigner as you think me on this momentous subject i feel myself an englishman  the pleasure of residing at sheffieldplace is after all the first and the ultimate object of my visit to my native country but when or how will that visit be effected clouds and whirlwinds austrian croats and gallic cannibals seem one very side to impede my passage you seem to apprehend the perils or dfficulties of the german road and french peace is more sanguinary than civilized war i must pass through perhaps a thousand republics or municipalities which neither obey nor are obeyed the strictness of passports and the popular ferment are much increased since last summer aristocrate is in every mouth lanterns hang in every street and an hasty word or a casual resemblance may be fatal yet on the other hand it is probable that many english men women and children will traverse the country without any accident before next september and i am sensible that many things appear more formidable at a distance than on a nearer approach without any absolute determination we must see what the events of the next three or four months will produce in the mean while i shall expect with impatience your next letter let it be speedy my answer shall be prompt  you will be glad or sorry to learn that my gloomy apprehensions are much abated and that my departure whenever it takes place will be an act of choice rather than of necessity i do not pretend to affirm that secret discontent dark suspicion private animosity are very materially assuaged but we have not experienced nor do we now apprehend any dangerous acts of violence which may compel me to seek a refuge among the friendly bears berne  and to abandon my library to the mercy of the democrats the firmness and vigor of government have crushed at least for a time the spirit of innovation and i do not believe that the body of the people especially the peasants are disposed for a revolution from france praised be the demon of anarchy the insurgents of the pays de vaud could not at present have much to hope and should the gardes nationales of which there is little appearance attempt an incursion the country is armed and prepared and they would be resisted with equal numbers and superior discipline the gallic wolves that prowled round geneva are drawn away some to the south and some to the north and the late events in flanders seem to have diffused a general contempt as well as abhorrence for the lawless savages who fly before the enemy hang their prisoners and murder their officers the brave and patient regiment of ernest is expected home every day and as berne will take them into present pay that veteran and regular corpse will add to the security of our frontier  i rejoice that we have so little to say on the subject of worldly affairs     this summer we are threatened with an inundation besides many nameless english and irish but i am anxious for the duchess of devonshire and the lady elizabeth foster who are on their march lord malmsbury the audacieux harris will inform you that he has seen me him i would have consented to keep  one word more before we part call upon mr john nicholls bookseller and printer at ciceros head redlionpassage fleet street and ask him whether he did not about the beginning of march receive a very polite letter from mr gibbon of lausanne to which either as a man of business or a civil gentleman he should have returned an answer my application related to a domestic article in the gentlemans magazine of august      p     which had lately fallen into my hands and concerning which i requested some farther lights mrs moss delivered the letters his letters to me for a certain period which he desired me to send to assist him in writing his memoirs s into my hands but i doubt whether they will be of much service to me the work appears far more difficult in the execution than in the idea and as i am now taking my leave for some time of the library i shall not make much progress in the memoirs of p p till i am on english ground but is it indeed true that i shall eat any sussex pheasants this autumn the event is in the book of fate and i cannot unroll the leaves of september and october should i reach sheffieldplace i hope to find the whole family in a perfect state of existence except a certain maria holroyd my fair and generous correspondent whose annihilation on proper terms i most fervently desire i must receive a copious answer before the end of next month june and again call upon you for a map of your political world the chancellor roars does he break his chain valc  to the same lausanne august   d      when i inform you that the design of my english expedition is at last postponed till another year you will not be much surprised the public obstacles the danger of one road and the difficulties of another would alone be sufficient to arrest so unwieldy and inactive a being and these obstacles on the side of france are growing every day more insuperable on the other hand the terrors which might have driven me from hence have in a great measure subsided our stateprisoners are forgotten the country begins to recover its old good humor and unsuspecting confidence and the last revolution of paris appears to have convinced almost every body of the fatal consequences of democratical principles which lead by a path of flowers into the abyss of hell i may therefore wait with patience and tranquillity till the duke of brunswick shall have opened the french road but if i am not driven from lausanne you will ask i hope with some indignation whether i am not drawn to england and more especially to sheffieldplace the desire of embracing you and yours is now the strongest and must gradually become the sole inducement that can force me from my library and garden over seas and mountains the english world will forget and be forgotten and every year will deprive me of some acquaintance who by courtesy are styled friends lord guildford and sir joshua reynolds two of the men and two of the houses in london on whom i the most relied for the comforts of society  september   th      thus far had i written in the full confidence of finishing and sending my letter the next post but six postdays have unaccountably slipped away and were you not accustomed to my silence you would almost begin to think me on the road how dreadfully since my last date has the french road been polluted with blood and what horrid scenes may be acting at this moment and may still be aggravated till the duke of brunswick is master of paris on every rational principle of calculation he must succeed yet sometimes when my spirits are low i dread the blind efforts of mad and desperate multitudes fighting on their own ground a few days or weeks must decide the military operations of this year and perhaps for ever but on the fairest supposition i cannot look forwards to any firm settlement either of a legal or an absolute government i cannot pretend to give you any paris news should i inform you as we believe that lally is still among the cannibals you would possibly answer that he is now sitting in the library at sheffield madame de stael after miraculously escaping through pikes and poignards has reached the castle of copet where i shall see her before the end of the week if any thing can provoke the king of sardinia and the swiss it must be the foul destruction of his cousin madame de lamballe and of their regiment of guards an extraordinary council is summoned at berne but resentment may be checked by prudence in spite of marias laughter i applaud your moderation and sigh for a hearty union of all the sense and property of the country the times require it but your last political letter was a cordial to my spirits the duchess of d rather dislikes a coalition amiable creature the eliza we call her bess is furious against you for not writing we shall lose them in a few days but the motions of bess and the duchess for italy or england are doubtful ladies spencer and duncannon certainly pass the alps i live with them adieu since i do not appear in person i feel the absolute propriety of writing to my lady and maria but there is far from the knowledge to the performance of a duty ever yours  to the same lausanne october  th      as our english newspapers must have informed you of the invasion of savoy by the french and as it is possible that you may have some trifling apprehensions of my being killed and eaten by those cannibals it has appeared to me that a short extraordinary dispatch might not be unacceptable on this occasion it is indeed true that about ten days ago the french army of the south under the command of m de montesquieu if any french army can be said to be under any command has entered savoy and possessed themselves of chamberry montmelian and several other places it has always been the practice of the king of sardinia to abandon his transalpine dominions but on this occasion the court of turin appears to have been surprised by the strange excentric motions of a democracy which always acts from the passion of the moment and their inferior troops have retreated with some loss and disgrace into the passes of the alps mount cenis is now impervious and our english travelers who are bound for italy the duchess of devonshire ancaster etc will be forced to explore a long circuitous road through the tirol but the chablais is yet intact nor can our telescopes discover the tricolor banners on the other side of the lake our accounts of the french numbers seem to vary from fifteen to thirty thousand men the regulars are few but they are followed by a rabble rout which must soon however melt away as they will find no plunder and scanty subsistence in the poverty and barrenness of savoy n b i have just seen a letter from mr de montesquieu who boasts that at his first entrance into savoy he had only twelve battalions our intelligence is far from correct  the magistrates of geneva were alarmed by this dangerous neighborhood and more especially by the wellknown animosity of an exiled citizen claviere who is one of the six ministers of the french republic it was carried by a small majority in the general council to call in the succor of three thousand swiss which is stipulated by ancient treaty the strongest reason or pretense of the minority was founded on the danger of provoking the french and they seem to have been justified by the event since the complaint of the french resident amounts to a declaration of war the fortifications of geneva are not contemptible especially on the side of savoy and it is much doubted whether mr de montesquieu is prepared for a regular siege but the malcontents are numerous within the walls and i question whether the spirit of the citizens will hold out against a bombardment in the mean while the diet has declared that the first cannon fired against geneva will be considered as an act of hostility against the whole helvetic body berne as the nearest and most powerful canton has taken the lead with great vigor and vigilance the road is filled with the perpetual succession of troops and artillery and if some disaffection lurks in the towns the peasants especially the germans are inflamed with a strong desire of encountering the murderers of their countrymen mr de watteville with whom you dined at my house last year refused to accept the command of the swiss succor of geneva till it was made his first instruction that he should never in any case surrender himself prisoner of war  in this situation you may suppose that we have some fears i have great dependence however on the many chances in our favor the valor of the swiss the return of the piedmontese with their austrian allies eight or ten thousand men from the milanese a diversion from spain the great events how slowly they proceed on the side of paris the inconstancy and want of discipline of the french and the near approach of the winter season i am not nervous but i will not be rash it will be painful to abandon my house and library but if the danger should approach i will retreat before it first to berne and gradually to the north should i even be forced to take refuge in england a violent measure so late in the year you would perhaps receive me as kindly as you do the french priests  a noble act of hospitality could i have foreseen this storm i would have been there six weeks ago but who can foresee the wild measures of the savages of gaul we thought ourselves perfectly out of the hurricane latitudes adieu i am going to bed and must rise early to visit the neckers at roll whither they have retired from the frontier situation of copet severy is on horseback with his dragoons his poor father is dangerously ill it will be shocking if it should be found necessary to remove him while we are in this very awkward crisis i will write at least every week ever yours write instantly and remember all my commissions  to the same i will keep my promise of sending you a weekly journal of our troubles that when the piping times of peace are restored i may sleep in long and irreproachable silence but i shall use a smaller paper as our military exploits will seldom be sufficient to fill the ample size of our english quarto  october         since my last of the  th our attack is not more eminent and our defense is most assuredly stronger two very important circumstances at a time when every day is leading us though not so fast as our impatience could wish toward the unwarlike month of november and we observe with pleasure that the troops of mr de montesquieu which are chiefly from the southern provinces will not cheerfully entertain the rigor of an alpine winter the  th instant mr de chateauneuf the french resident took his leave with an haughty mandate commanding the genevois as they valued their safety and the friendship of the republic to dismiss their swiss allies and to punish the magistrates who had traitorously proposed the calling in these foreign troops it is precisely the fable of the wolves who offered to make peace with the sheep provided they would send away their dogs you know what became of the sheep this demand appears to have kindled a just and general indignation since it announced an edict of proscription and must lead to a democratical revolution which would probably renew the horrid scenes of paris and avignon a general assembly of the citizens was convened the message was read speeches were made oaths were taken and it was resolved with only three dissentient voices to live and die in the defense of their country the genevois muster above three thousand wellarmed citizens and the swiss who may easily be increased in a few hours to an equal number add spirit to the timorous and confidence to the wellaffected their arsenals are filled with arms their magazines with ammunition and their granaries with corn but their fortifications are extensive and imperfect they are commanded from two adjacent hills a french faction lurks in the city the character of the genevois is rather commercial than military and their behavior lofty promise and base surrender in the year      is fresh in our memories in the mean while  000 french at the most are arrived in the neighboring camp nor is there yet any appearance of mortars or heavy artillery perhaps an haughty menace may be repelled by a firm countenance if it were worth while talking of justice what a shameful attack of a feeble unoffending state on the news of their danger all switzerland from schassouse to the pays de vaud has risen in arms and a french resident who has passed through the country in his way from ratisbon declares his intention of informing and admonishing the national convention about eleven thousand bernois are already posted in the neighborhood of copet and nyon and new reinforcements of men artillery etc arrive every day another army is drawn together to oppose mr de ferrieres on the side of bienne and the bishopric of basle and the austrians in swabia would be easily persuaded to cross the rhine in our defense but we are yet ignorant whether our sovereigns mean to wage an offensive or defensive war if the latter which is more likely will the french begin the attack should genoa yield to fear or force this country is open to an invasion and though our men are brave we want generals and i despise the french much less than i did two months ago it should seem that our hopes from the king of sardinia and the austrians of milan are faint and distant spain sleeps and the duke of brunswick amazement seems to have failed in his great project for my part till geneva falls i do not think of a retreat but at all events i am provided with two strong horses and an hundred louis in gold zurich would be probably my winter quarters and the society of the neckers would make any place agreeable their situation is worse than mine i have no daughter ready to lie in nor do i fear the french aristocrats on the road adieu keep my letters excuse contradictions and repetitions the duchess of devonshire leaves us next week lady elizabeth abhors you ever yours  to the same october  0      since my last our affairs take a more pacific turn but i will not venture to affirm that our peace will be either safe or honorable mr de montesquieu and three commissioners of the convention who are at carrouge have had frequent conferences with the magistrates of geneva several expresses have been dispatched to and from paris and every step of the negotiation is communicated to the deputies of berne and zurich the french troops observe a very tolerable degree of order and discipline and no act of hostility has yet been committed on the territory of geneva  october    my usual temper very readily admitted the excuse that it would be better to wait another week till the final settlement of our affairs the treaty is signed between france and geneva and the ratification of the convention is looked upon as assured if any thing can be assured in that wild democracy on condition that the swiss garrison with the approbation of berne and zurich be recalled before the first of december it is stipulated that the independence of geneva shall be preserved inviolate that mr de montesquieu shall immediately send away his heavy artillery and that no french troops shall approach within ten leagues of the city as the swiss have acted only as auxiliaries they have no occasion for a direct treaty but they cannot prudently disarm till they are satisfied of the pacific intentions of france and no such satisfaction can be given till they have acknowledged the new republic which they will probably do in a few days with a deep groan of indignation and sorrow it has been cemented with the blood of their countrymen but when the emperor the king of prussia the first general and the first army in europe have failed less powerful states may acquiesce without dishonor in the determination of fortune do you understand this most unexpected failure i will allow an ample share to the badness of the roads and the weather to famine and disease to the skill of dumourier a heavenborn general and to the enthusiastic ardour of the new romans but still still there must be some secret and shameful cause at the bottom of this strange retreat we are now delivered from the impending terrors of siege and invasion the geneva emigres particularly the neckers are hastening to their homes and i shall not be reduced to the hard necessity of seeking a winter asylum at zurich or constance but i am not pleased with our future prospects it is much to be feared that the present government of geneva will be soon modelled after the french fashion the new republic of savoy is forming on the opposite bank of the lake the jacobin missionaries are powerful and zealous and the malcontents of this country who begin again to rear their heads will be surrounded with temptations and examples and allies i know not whether the pays de vaud will long adhere to the dominion of berne or whether i shall be permitted to end my days in this little paradise which i have so happily suited to my taste and circumstances  last monday only i received your letter which had strangely loitered on the road since its date of the   th of september there must surely be some disorder in the posts since the eliza departed indignant at never having heard from you  the case of my wine i think peculiarly hard to lose my madeira and to be scolded for losing it i am much indebted to mr nichols for his genealogical communications which i am impatient to receive but i do not understand why so civil a gentleman could not favor me in six months with an answer by the post since he entrusts me with these valuable papers you have not i presume informed him of my negligence and awkwardness in regard to manuscripts your reproach rather surprises me as i suppose i am much the same as i have been for these last twenty years should you hold your resolution of writing only such things as may be published at charing cross our future correspondence would not be very interesting but i expect and require at this important crisis a full and confidential account of your views concerning england ireland and france you have a strong and clear eye and your pen is perhaps the most useful quill that ever has been plucked from a goose your protection of the french resugees is highly applauded rosset and la motte have escaped from arbourg perhaps with connivance to avoid disagreeable demands from the republic adieu ever yours  to the same november  0      received this day november  th a most amiable dispatch from the too humble secretary miss holroyd of the family of espee meaning sheffieldplace  dated october   th which i answer the same day it will be acknowledged that i have fulfilled my engagements with as much accuracy as our uncertain state and the fragility of human nature would allow i resume my narrative at the time when we imagined that all was settled by an equal treaty between two such unequal powers as the geneva flea and the leviathan france we were thunderstruck with the intelligence that the ministers of the republic refused to ratify the conditions and they were indignant with some color of reason at the hard obligation of withdrawing their troops to the distance of ten leagues and of consequently leaving the pays de gez naked and exposed to the swiss who had assembled   000 men on the frontier and with whom they had not made any agreement the messenger who was sent last sunday from geneva is not yet returned and many persons are afraid of some design and danger in this delay montesquieu has acted with politeness moderation and apparent sincerity but he may resign he may be superseded his place may be occupied by an enrage by servan or prince charles of hesse who would aspire to imitate the predatory fame of custine in germany in the mean while the general holds a wolf by the ears an officer who has seen his troops about   000 men with a tremendous train of artillery represents them as a black daring desperate crew of buccaneers rather shocking than contemptible the officers scarcely a gentleman among them without servants or horses or baggage lying higgledy piggledy on the ground with the common men yet maintaining a rough kind of discipline over them they already begin to accuse and even to suspect their general and call aloud for blood and plunder could they have an opportunity of squeezing some of the rich citizens geneva would cut up as sat as most towns in europe during this suspension of hostilities they are permitted to visit the city without arms sometimes three or four hundred at a time and the magistrates as well as the swiss commander are by no means pleased with this dangerous intercourse which they dare not prohibit such are our fears yet it should seem on the other side that the french affect a kind of magnanimous justice toward their little neighbor and that they are not ambitious of an unprofitable contest with the poor and hardy swiss the swiss are not equal to a long and expensive war and as most of our militia have families and trades the country already sighs for their return whatever can be yielded without absolute danger or disgrace will doubtless be granted and the business will probably end in our owning the sovereignty and trusting to the good faith of the republic of france how that word would have sounded four years ago the measure is humiliating but after the retreat of the duke of brunswick and the failure of the austrians the smaller powers may acquiesce without dishonor every dog has his day and these gallic dogs have their day at least of most insolent prosperity after forcing or tempting the prussians to evacuate their country they conquer savoy pillage germany threaten spain the low countries are ere now invaded rome and italy tremble they scour the mediterranean and talk of sending a squadron into the south sea the whole horizon is so black that i begin to feel some anxiety for england the last refuge of liberty and law and the more so as i perceive from lord sheffields last epistle that his firm nerves are a little shaken but of this more in my next for i want to unburthen my conscience if england with the experience of our happiness and french calamities should now be seduced to eat the apple of false freedom we should indeed deserve to be driven from the paradise which we enjoy i turn aside from the horrid and improbable yet not impossible supposition that in three or four years time myself and my best friends may be reduced to the deplorable state of the french emigrants they thought it as impossible three or four years ago never did a revolution affect to such a degree the private existence of such numbers of the first people of a great country your examples of misery i could easily match with similar examples in this country and the neighborhood and our sympathy is the deeper as we do not possess like you the means of alleviating in some degree the misfortunes of the fugitives but i must have from the very excellent pen of the maria the tragedy of the archbishop of arles and the longer the better madame de biron has probably been tempted by some faint and i fear fallacious promises of clemency to the women and which have likewise engaged madame daguesseau and her two daughters to revisit france madame de bouillon stands her ground and her situation as a foreign princess is less exposed as lord s has assumed the glorious character of protector of the distressed his name is pronounced with gratitude and respect the d of richmond is praised on madame de birons account to the princess dhenin and lally i wish to be remembered the neckers cannot venture into geneva and madame de stael will probably lie in at roll he is printing a defense of the king etc against their republican judges but the name of necker is unpopular to all parties and i much fear that the guillotine will be more speedy than the press it will however be an eloquent performance and if i find an opportunity i am to send you one to you lord s by his particular desire he wishes likewise to convey some copies with speed to our principal people pit fox lord stormont etc but such is the rapid succession of events that it will appear like the pouvoir executif his best work after the whole scene has been totally changed ever yours  p s the revolution of france and my triple dispatch by the same post to sheffieldplace are in my opinion the two most singular events in the eighteenth century i found the task so easy and pleasant that i had some thoughts of adding a letter to the gentle louisa i am this moment informed that our troops on the frontier are beginning to move on their return home yet we hear nothing of the treatys being concluded    edward gibbon esquire to the hon miss holroyd lausanne nov  0      in dispatching the weekly political journal to lord s my conscience for i have some remains of conscience most powerfully urges me to salute with some lines of friendship and gratitude the amiable secretary who might save herself the trouble of a modest apology i have not yet forgotten our different behavior after the much lamented separation of october the  th      your meritorious punctuality and my unworthy silence i have still before me that entertaining narrative which would have interested me not only in the progress of the carissima familia but in the motions of a tartar camp or the march of a caravan of arabs the mixture of just observation and lively imagery the strong sense of a man expressed with the easy elegance of a female i still recollect with pleasure the happy comparison of the rhine who had heard so much of liberty on both his banks that he wandered with mischievous licentiousness over all the adjacent meadows mr gibbon alludes to letters written to him by miss holroyd when she was returning from switzerland along the rhine to england s  the inundation alas has now spread much wider and it is sadly to be feared that the elbe the po and the danube may imitate the vile example of the rhine i shall be content however if our own thames still preserves his fair character of  strong without rage without overflowing full these agreeable epistles of maria produced only some dumb intentions and some barren remorse nor have i designed except by a brief missive from my chancellor to express how much i loved the author and how much i was pleased with the composition that amiable author i have known and loved from the first dawning of her life and coquetry to the present maturity of her talents and as long as i remain on this planet i shall pursue with the same tender and even anxious concern the future steps of her establishment and life that establishment must be splendid that life must be happy she is endowed with every gift of nature and fortune but the advantage which she will derive from them depends almost entirely on herself you must not you shall not think yourself unworthy to write to any man there is none whom your correspondence would not amuse and satisfy i will not undertake a task which my taste would adopt and my indolence would too soon relinquish but i am really curious from the best motives to have a particular account of your own studies and daily occupation what books do you read and how do you employ your time and your pen except some professed scholars i have often observed that women in general read much more than men but for want of a plan a method a fixed object their reading is of little benefit to themselves or others if you will inform me of the species of reading to which you have the most propensity i shall be happy to contribute my share of advice or assistance i lament that you have not left me some monument of your pencil lady elizabeth foster has executed a very pretty drawing taken from the door of the greenhouse where we dined last summer and including the poor acacia now recovered from the cruel sheers of the gardener the end of the terrace the front of the pavilion and a distant view of the country lake and mountains i am almost reconciled to dapples house which is nearly finished instead of the monsters which lord hercules sheffield extirpated the terrace is already shaded with the new acacias and plantanes and although the uncertainty of possession restrains me from building i myself have planted a bosquet at the bottom of the garden with such admirable skill that it affords shade without intercepting prospect the society of the aforesaid eliza commonly called bess of the duchess of d etc has been very interesting but they are now flown beyond the alps and pass the winter at pisa the legards who have long since left this place should be at present in italy but i believe mrs grimstone and her daughter returned to england the leades are highly flattered by your remembrance since you still retain some attachment to this delightful country and it is indeed delightful why should you despair of seeing it once more the happy peer or commoner whose name you may assume is still concealed in the book of fate but whosoever he may be he will cheerfully obey your commands of leading you from  castle to lausanne and from lausanne to rome and naples before that this event takes place i may possibly see you in sussex and whether as a visitor or a fugitive i hope to be welcomed with a friendly embrace the delay of this year was truly painful but it was inevitable and individuals must submit to those storms which have overturned the thrones of the earth the tragic story of the archbishop of arles i have now somewhat a better right to require at your hands i wish to have it in all its horrid details the answer to mr gibbons letter is annexed as giving the best account i have seen of the barbarous transaction alluded to s  sheffieldplace november      your three letters received yesterday caused the most sincere pleasure to each individual of this family to none more than myself praise i fear beyond my deserts from one whose opinion i so highly value and whose esteem i so much wish to preserve is more pleasing than i can describe i had not neglected to make the collection of facts which you recommend and which the great variety of unfortunate persons whom we see or with whom we correspond enables me to make  as to that part of your letter which respects my studies i can only say the slightest hint on that subject is always received with the greatest gratitude and attended to with the utmost punctuality but i must decline that topic for the present to obey your commands which require from me the horrid account of the massacre aux carmes  eight respectable ecclesiastics landed about the beginning of october from an open boat at seaford wet as the waves the natives of the coast were endeavoring to get from them what they had not viz money when a gentleman of the neighborhood came to their protection and finding they had nothing showed his good sense by dispatching them to milord sheffield they had been pillaged and with great difficulty had escaped from paris the reception they met with at this house seemed to make the greatest impression on them they were in extacy on finding m de lally living they gradually became cheerful and enjoyed their dinner they were greatly affected as they recollected themselves and found us attending on them having dined and drank a glass of wine they began to discover the beauties of the dining room and of the chateau as they walked about they were overheard to express their admiration at the treatment they met and from protestants we then assembled in the library formed half a circle round the fire m de lally and milord occupying the hearth a langloise and questioning the priests concerning their escape thus we discovered that two of these unfortunate men were in the carmelite convent at the time of the massacre of the one hundred and twenty priests and had most miraculously escaped by climbing trees in the garden and from thence over the tops of the buildings one of them a man of superior appearance described in the most pathetic manner the death of the archbishop of arles and with such simplicity and feeling as to leave no doubt of the truth of all that he said to the following purport  on the second of september about five oclock in the evening at the time they were permitted to walk in the garden expecting every hour to be released they expressed their surprise at seeing several large pits which had been digging for two days past they said the day is almost spent and yet manuel told a person who interceded for us last thursday that on the sunday following not one should remain in captivity we are still prisoners soon after they heard shouts and some musquetshots an ensign of the national guard some commissaries of the sections and some marseillois rushed in the miserable victims who were dispersed in the garden assembled under the walls of the church not daring to go in lest it should be polluted with blood one man who was behind the rest was shot  point de coup de fusils cried one of the chiefs of the assassins thinking that kind of death too easy these welltrained fusileers went to the rear les piques les haches les poignards came forward they demanded the archbishop of arles he was immediately surrounded by all the priests the worthy prelate said to his friends let me pass if my blood will appease them what signifies it if i die is it not my duty to preserve your lives at the expense of my own he asked the eldest of the priests to give him absolution he knelt to receive it and when he arose forced himself from them advanced slowly and with his arms crossed upon his breast and his eyes raised to heaven said to the assassins  je suis celui que vous cherchez his appearance was so dignified and noble that during ten minutes not one of these wretches had courage to lift his hand against him they upbraided each other with cowardice and advanced one look from this venerable man struck them with awe and they retired at last one of the miscreants struck off the cap of the archbishop with a pike respect once violated their fury returned and another from behind cut him through the skull with a sabre he raised his right hand to his eyes with another stroke they cut off his hand the archbishop said o mon dieu and raised the other a third stroke across the face left him sitting the fourth extended him lifeless on the ground and then all pressed forward and buried their pikes and poignards in the body the priests all agreed that he had been one of the most amiable men in france and that his only crime was having since the revolution expended his private fortune to support the necessitous clergy of his diocese the second victim was the general des benedictins then the national guards obliged the priests to go into the church telling them they should appear one after another before the commissaires du section they had hardly entered before the people impatiently called for them upon which all kneeling before the altar the bishop of beauvais gave them absolution they were then obliged to go out two by two they passed before a commissaire who did not question but only counted his victims they had in their sight the heaps of dead to which they were going to add among the one hundred and twenty priests thus sacrificed were the bishops of zaintes and beauvais both of the rochefoucauld family i should not omit to remark that one of the priests observed they were assassinated because they would not swear to a constitution which their murderers had destroyed we had to comfort us for this melancholy story the most grateful expressions of gratitude toward the english nation from whom they did not do us the justice to expect such a reception  there can be no doubt that the whole business of the massacres was concerted at a meeting at the duke of orleanss house i shall make you as dismal as myself by this narration i must change the style               and as you are now so much mingled with the french exiles i am of opinion that were you to keep a journal of all the authentic facts which they relate it would be an agreeable exercise at present and a future source of entertainment and instruction  i should be obliged to you if you would make or find some excuse for my not answering a letter from your aunt which was presented to me by mr fowler i showed him some civilities but he is now a poor invalid confined to his room by her channel and yours i should be glad to have some information of the health spirits and situation of mrs gibbon of bath whose alarms if she has any you may dispel she is in my debt adieu most truly yours  edward gibbon esquire to the right hon lady sheffield lausanne november  0th      i could never forgive myself were i capable of writing by the same post a political epistle to the father and a friendly letter to the daughter without sending any token of remembrance to the respectable matron my dearest my lady whom i have now loved as a sister for something better or worse than twenty years no indeed the historian may be careless he may be indolent he may always intend and never execute but he is neither a monster nor a statue he has a memory a conscience a heart and that heart is sincerely devoted to lady s  he must even acknowledge the fallacy of a sophism which he has sometimes used and she has always and most truly denied that where the persons of a family are strictly united the writing to one is in fact writing to all and that consequently all his numerous letters to the husband may be considered as equally addressed to his wife he feels on the contrary that separate minds have their distinct ideas and sentiments and that each character either in speaking or writing has its peculiar tone of conversation he agrees with the maxim of rousseau that three friends who wish to disclose a common secret will impart it only deux a deux and he is satisfied that on the present memorable occasion each of the persons of the sheffield family will claim a peculiar share in this triple missive which will communicate however a triple satisfaction the experience of what may be effected by vigorous resolution encourages the historian to hope that he shall cast the skin of the old serpent and hereafter show himself as a new creature  i lament on all our accounts that the last years expedition to lausanne did not take place in a golden period of health and spirits but we must reflect that human felicity is seldom without alloy and if we cannot indulge the hope of your making a second visit to lausanne we must look forwards to my residence next summer at sheffieldplace where i must find you in the full bloom of health spirits and beauty i can perceive by all public and private intelligence that your house has been the open hospitable asylum of french fugitives and it is a sufficient proof of the firmness of your nerves that you have not been overwhelmed or agitated by such a concourse of strangers curiosity and compassion may in some degree have supported you every day has presented to your view some new scene of that strange tragical romance which occupies all europe so infinitely beyond any event that has happened in our time and you have the satisfaction of not being a mere spectator of the distress of so many victims of false liberty the benevolent fame of lord s is widely diffused  from angletines last letter to maria you have already some idea of the melancholy state of her poor father as long as mr de severy allowed our hopes and fears to fluctuate with the changes of his disorder i was unwilling to say any thing on so painful a subject and it is with the deepest concern that i now confess our absolute despair of his recovery all his particular complaints are now lost in a general dissolution of the whole frame every principle of life is exhausted and as often as i am admitted to his bedside though he still looks and smiles with the patience of an angel i have the heartfelt grief of seeing him each day drawing nearer to the term of his existence a few weeks possibly a few days will deprive me of a most excellent friend and break for ever the most perfect system of domestic happiness in which i had so large and intimate a share wilhelm who has obtained leave of absence from his military duty and his sister behave and feel like tender and dutiful children but they have a long gay prospect of life and new connections new families will make them forget in due time the common lot of mortality but it is madame de severy whom i truly pity i dread the effects of the first shock and i dread still more the deep perpetual consuming affliction for a loss which can never be retrieved you will not wonder that such reflections sadden my own mind nor can i forget how much my situation is altered since i retired nine years ago to the banks of the leman lake the death of poor deyverdun first deprived me of a domestic companion who can never be supplied and your visit has only served to remind me that man however amused and occupied in his closet was not made to live alone severy will soon be no more his widow for a long time perhaps for ever will be lost to herself and her friends the son will travel and i shall be left a stranger in the insipid circle of mere common acquaintance the revolution of france which first embittered and divided the society of lausanne has opposed a barrier to my sussex visit and may finally expel me from the paradise which i inhabit even that paradise the expensive and delightful establishment of my house library and garden almost becomes an encumbrance by rendering it more difficult for me to relinquish my hold or to form a new system of life in my native country for which my income though improved and improving would be probably insufficient but every complaint should be silenced by the contemplation of the french compared with whose cruel fate all misery is relative happiness i perfectly concur in your partiality for lally though nature might forget some meaner ingredients of prudence economy etc she never formed a purer heart or a brighter imagination if he be with you i beg my kindest salutations to him i am every day more closely united with the neckers should france break and this country be overrun they would be reduced in very humble circumstances to seek a refuge and where but in england adieu dear madam there is indeed much pleasure in discharging ones heart to a real friend ever yours  edward gibbon esquire to the right hon lord sheffield send me a list of these letters with their respective dates lausanne nov   th      after the triple labor of my last dispatch your experience of the creature might tempt you to suspect that it would again relapse into a long slumber but partly from the spirit of contradiction though i am not a lady and partly from the ease and pleasure which i now find in the task you see me again alive awake and almost faithful to my hebdomadal promise the last week has not however afforded any events deserving the notice of an historian our affairs are still floating on the waves of the convention and the ratification of a corrected treaty which had been fixed for the twentieth is not yet arrived but the report of the diplomatic committee has been favorable and it is generally understood that the leaders of the french republic do not wish to quarrel with the swiss we are gradually withdrawing and disbanding our militia geneva will be left to sink or swim according to the humor of the people and our last hope appears to be that by submission and good behavior we shall avert for some time the impending storm a few days ago an odd accident happened in the french army the defertion of the general as the neckers were sitting about eight oclock in the evening in their drawing room at roll a considerable town between lausanne and geneva  the door flew open and they were astounded by their servants announcing monsieur le general de montesquieu on the receipt of some secret intelligence of a decret daccusation and an order to arrest him he had only time to get on horseback to gallop through geneva to take boat for copet and to escape from his pursuers who were ordered to seize him alive or dead he left the neckers after supper passed through lausanne in the night and proceeded to berne and basle whence he intended to wind his way through germany amidst enemies of every description and to seek a refuge in england america or the moon he told necker that the sole remnant of his fortune consisted in a wretched sum of twenty thousand livres but the public report or suspicion bespeaks him in much better circumstances besides the reproach of acting with too much tameness and delay he is accused of making very foul and exorbitant contracts and it is certain that new sparta is infected with this vice beyond the example of the most corrupt monarchy kellerman is arrived to take the command and it is apprehended that on the first of december after the departure of the swiss the french may request the permission of using geneva a friendly city for their winter quarters in that case the democratical revolution which we all foresee will be very speedily effected  i would ask you whether you apprehend there was any treason in the duke of brunswicks retreat and whether you have totally withdrawn your confidence and esteem from that oncefamed general will it be possible for england to preserve her neutrality with any honor or safety we are bound as i understand by treaty to guarantee the dominions of the king of sardinia and the austrian provinces of the netherlands these countries are now invaded and overrun by the french can we refuse to fulfill our engagements without exposing ourselves to all europe as a perfidious or pusillanimous nation yet on the other hand can we assist those allies without plunging headlong into an abyss whose bottom no man can discover but my chief anxiety is for our domestic tranquillity for i must find a retreat in england should i be driven from lausanne the idea of firm and honorable union of parties pleases me much but you must frankly unfold what are the great difficulties that may impede so salutary a measure you write to a man discreet in speech and now careful of papers yet what can such a coalition avail where is the champion of the constitution alas lord guildford i am much pleased with the manchester ass the asses or wolves who sacrificed him have cast off the mask too soon and such a nonsensical act must open the eyes of many simple patriots who might have been led astray by the specious name of reform it should be made as notorious as possible next winter may be the crisis of our fate and if you begin to improve the constitution you may be driven step by step from the disfranchisement of old sarum to the king in newgate the lords voted useless the bishops abolished and a house of commons without articles  sans culottes necker has ordered you a copy of his royal defense which has met with and deserved universal success the pathetic and argumentative parts are in my opinion equally good and his mild eloquence may persuade without irritating i have applied to this gentler tone some verses of ovid metamorph l iii  0  etc qua tamen usque potest vires sibi demere tentat nec quo centimanum dejecerat igne typhoea nunc armatur eo nimium seritatis in illo est aliud levius fulmen cui dextra cyclopum saevitiae flammaeque minus minus addidit irae tela secunda vocant superi   which you may read madame de stael has produced a second son she talks wildly enough of visiting england this winter she is a pleasant little woman poor severys condition is hopeless should he drag through the winter madame de s would scarcely survive him she kills herself with grief and fatigue what a difference in lausanne i hope triple answers are on the road i must write soon the times will not allow me to read or think ever yours  to the same lausanne dec   th      our little storm has now completely subsided and we are again spectators though anxious spectators of the general tempest that invades or threatens almost every country of europe our troops are every day disbanding and returning home and the greatest part of the french have evacuated the neighborhood of geneva monsieur barthelemy whom you have seen secretary in london is most courteously entertained as ambassador by the helvetic body he is now at berne where a diet will speedily be convened the language on both sides is now pacific and even friendly and some hopes are given of a provision for the officers of the swiss guards who have survived the massacres of paris  january  st      with the return of peace i have relapsed into my former indolence but now awakening after a fortnights slumber i have little or nothing to add with regard to the internal state of this country only the revolution of geneva has already taken place as i announced but sooner than i expected the swiss troops had no sooner evacuated the place than the egaliseurs as they are called assembled in arms and as no resistance was made no blood was shed on the occasion they seized the gates disarmed the garrison imprisoned the magistrates imparted the rights of citizens to all the rabble of the town and country and proclaimed a national convention which has not yet met they are all for a pure and absolute democracy but some wish to remain a small independent state whilst others aspire to become a part of the republic of france and as the latter though less numerous are more violent and absurd than their adversaries it is highly probable that they will succeed the citizens of the best families and fortunes have retired from geneva into the pays de vaud but the french methods of recalling or proscribing emigrants will soon be adopted you must have observed that savoy is now become le department du mont blanc i cannot satisfy myself whether the mass of the people is pleased or displeased with the change but my noble scenery is clouded by the democratical aspect of twelve leagues of the opposite coast which every morning obtrude themselves on my view i here conclude the first part of the history of our alpine troubles and now consider myself as disengaged from all promises of periodical writing upon the whole i kept it beyond our expectation nor do i think that you have been sufficiently astonished by the wonderful effort of the triple dispatch  you must now succeed to my task and i shall expect during the winter a regular political journal of the events of your greater world you are on the theater and may often be behind the scenes you can always see and may sometimes foresee my own choice has indeed transported me into a foreign land but i am truly attached from interest and inclination to my native country and even as a citizen of the world i wish the stability of england the sole great refuge of mankind against the opposite mischiefs of despotism and democracy i was indeed alarmed and the more so as i saw that you were not without apprehension but i now glory in the triumph of reason and genuine patriotism which seems to pervade the country nor do i dislike some mixture of popular enthusiasm which may be requisite to encounter our mad or wicked enemies with equal arms the behavior of fox does not surprise me you may remember what i told you last year at lausanne when you attempted his defense that                                you have now crushed the daring subverters of the constitution but i now fear the moderate wellmeaners reformers do not i beseech you tamper with parliamentary representation the present house of commons forms in practice a body of gentlemen who must always sympathize with the interests and opinions of the people and the slightest innovation launches you without rudder or compass on a dark and dangerous ocean of theoretical experiment on this subject i am indeed serious  upon the whole i like the beginning of ninetythree better than the end of ninetytwo the illusion seems to break away throughout europe i think england and switzerland are safe brabant adheres to its old constitution the germans are disgusted with the rapine and insolence of their deliverers the pope is resolved to head his armies and the lazzaroni of naples have presented st januarius with a gold fuzee to fire on the brigands francois so much for politics which till now never had such possession of my mind next post i will write about myself and my own designs alas your poor eyes make the maria write i will speedily answer her my lady is still dumb the german posts are now slow and irregular you had better write by the way of france under cover direct to le citoien rebours a pontalier france adieu ever yours  to the same lausanne january  th      there was formerly a time when our correspondence was a painful discussion of my private affairs a vexatious repetition of losses of disappointments of sales etc these affairs are decently arranged but public cares have now succeeded to private anxiety and our whole attention is lately turned from lenborough and beriton to the political state of france and of europe from these politics however one letter shall be free while i talk of myself and of my own plans a subject most interesting to a friend and only to a friend  i know not whether i am sorry or glad that my expedition has been postponed to the present year it is true that i now wish myself in england and almost repent that i did not grasp the opportunity when the obstacles were comparatively smaller than they are now likely to prove yet had i reached you last summer before the month of august a considerable portion of my time would be now elapsed and i should already begin to think of my departure if the gout should spare me this winter and as yet i have not felt any symptom and if the spring should make a soft and early appearance it is my intention to be with you in downingstreet before the end of april and thus to enjoy six weeks or two months of the most agreeable season of london and the neighborhood after the hurry of parliament is subsided and before the great rural dispersion as the banks of the rhine and the belgic provinces are completely overspread with anarchy and war i have made up my mind to pass through the territories of the french republic from the best and most recent information i am satisfied that there is little or no real danger in the journey and i must arm myself with patience to support the vexatious insolence of democratical tyranny i have even a sort of curiosity to spend some days at paris to assist at the debates of the pandaemonium to seek an introduction to the principal devils and to contemplate a new form of public and private life which never existed before and which i devoutly hope will not long continue to exist should the obstacles of health or weather confine me at lausanne till the month of may i shall scarcely be able to resist the temptation of passing some part at least of the summer in my own little paradise but all these schemes must ultimately depend on the great question of peace and war which will indeed be speedily determined should france become impervious to an english traveller what must i do i shall not easily resolve to explore my way through the unknown language and abominable roads of the interior parts of germany to embark in holland or perhaps at hamburgh and to be finally intercepted by a french privateer my stay in england appears not less doubtful than the means of transporting myself should i arrive in the spring it is possible and barely possible that i should return here in the autumn it is much more probable that i shall pass the winter and there may be even a chance of my giving my own country a longer trial in my letter to my lady i fairly exposed the decline of lausanne but such an establishment as mine must not be lightly abandoned nor can i discover what adequate mode of life my private circumstances easy as they now are could afford me in england london and bath have doubtless their respective merits and i could wish to reside within a days journey of sheffieldplace but a state of perfect happiness is not to be found here below and in the possession of my library house and garden with the relics of our society and a frequent intercourse with the neckers i may still be tolerably content among the disastrous changes of lausanne i must principally reckon the approaching dissolution of poor severy and his family he is still alive but in such a hopeless and painful decay that we no longer conceal our wishes for his speedy release i never loved nor esteemed him so much as in this last mortal disease which he supports with a degree of energy patience and even cheerfulness beyond all belief his wife whose whole time and soul are devoted to him is almost sinking under her long anxiety the children are most amiably assiduous to both their parents and at all events his filial duties and worldly cares must detain the son some time at home  and now approach and let me drop into your most private ear a literary secret of the memoirs little has been done and with that little i am not satisfied they must be postponed till a mature season and i much doubt whether the book and the author can ever see the light at the same time but i have long revolved in my mind another scheme of biographical writing the lives or rather the characters of the most eminent persons in arts and arms in church and state who have flourished in britain from the reign of henry the eighth to the present age this work extensive as it may be would be an amusement rather than a toil the materials are accessible in our own language and for the most part ready to my hands but the subject which would afford a rich display of human nature and domestic history would powerfully address itself to the feelings of every englishman the taste or fashion of the times seems to delight in picturesque decorations and this series of british portraits might aptly be accompanied by the respective heads taken from originals and engraved by the best masters alderman boydell and his soninlaw mr george nicol bookseller in pallmall are the great undertakers in this line on my arrival in england i shall be free to consider whether it may suit me to proceed in a mere literary work without any other decorations than those which it may derive from the pen of the author it is a serious truth that i am no longer ambitious of fame or money that my habits of industry are much impaired and that i have reduced my studies to be the loose amusement of my morning hours the repetition of which will insensibly lead me to the last term of existence and for this very reason i shall not be sorry to bind myself by a liberal engagement from which i may not with honor recede  before i conclude we must say a word or two of parliamentary and pecuniary concerns   we all admire the generous spirit with which you damned the assassins   i hope that      the opinion of parliament in favor of louis was declared in a manner worthy of the representatives of a great and a wise nation it will certainly have a powerful effect and if the poor king be not already murdered i am satisfied that his life is in safety but in such a life worth his care our debates will now become every day more interesting and as i expect from you only opinions and anecdotes i most earnestly conjure you to send me woodfalls register as often and that must be very often as the occasion deserves it i now spare no expense for news  i want some account of mrs gs health will my lady never write how can people be so indolent i suppose this will find you at sheffieldplace during the recess and that the heavy baggage will not move till after the birthday shall i be with you by the first of may the gods only know i almost wish that i had accompanied madame de stael ever yours  to the same begun feb    ended feb         the struggle is at length over and poor de severy is no more he expired about ten days ago after every vital principle had been exhausted by a complication of disorders which had lasted above five months and a mortification in one of his legs that gradually rose to the more noble parts was the immediate cause of his death his patience and even cheerfulness supported him to the fatal moment and he enjoyed every comfort that could alleviate his situation the skill of his physicians the assiduous tenderness of his family and the kind sympathy not only of his particular friends but even of common acquaintance and generally of the whole town the stroke has been severely felt yet i have the satisfaction to perceive that madame de severys health is not affected and we may hope that in time she will recover a tolerable share of composure and happiness her firmness has checked the violent sallies of grief her gentleness has preserved her from the worst of symptoms a dry silent despair she loves to talk of her irreparable loss she descants with pleasure on his virtues her words are interrupted with tears but those tears are her best relief and her tender feelings will insensibly subside into an affectionate remembrance wilhelm is much more deeply wounded than i could imagine or than he expected himself nor have i ever seen the affliction of a son more lively and sincere severy was indeed a very valuable man without any shining qualifications he was endowed in a high degree with good sense honor and benevolence and few men have filled with more propriety their circle in private life for myself i have had the misfortune of knowing him too late and of losing him too soon  but enough of this melancholy subject  the affairs of this theater which must always be minute are now grown so tame and tranquil that they no longer deserve the historians pen the new constitution of geneva is slowly forming without much noise or any bloodshed and the patriots who have staid in hopes of guiding and restraining the multitude flatter themselves that they shall be able at least to prevent their mad countrymen from giving themselves to the french the only mischief that would be absolutely irretrievable the revolution of geneva is of less consequence to us however than that of savoy but our fate will depend on the general event rather than on these particular causes in the mean while we hope to be quiet spectators of the struggle of this year and we seem to have assurances that both the emperor and the french will compound for the neutrality of the swiss the helvetic body does not acknowledge the republic of france but barthelemy their ambassador resides at baden and steals like chauvelin into a kind of extraofficial negotiation all spirit of opposition is quelled in the canton of berne and the perpetual banishment of the  family has scarcely excited a murmur it will probably be followed by that of   the crime alleged in their sentence is the having assisted at the federationdinner at roll two years ago and as they are absent i could almost wish that they had been summoned to appear and heard in their own defense to the general supineness of the inhabitants of lausanne i must ascribe that the death of louis the sixteenth has been received with less horror and indignation than i could have wished i was much tempted to go into mourning and probably should had the duchess been still here but as the only englishman of any mark i was afraid of being singular more especially as our french emigrants either from prudence or poverty do not wear black nor do even the neckers have you read his discourse for the king it might indeed supersede the necessity of mourning i should judge from your last letter and from the diary that the french declaration of war must have rather surprised you i wish although i know not how it could have been avoided that we might still have continued to enjoy our safe and prosperous neutrality you will not doubt my best wishes for the destruction of the miscreants but i love england still more than i hate france all reasonable chances are in favor of a confederacy such as was never opposed to the ambition of louis the fourteenth but after the experience of last year i distrust reason and confess myself fearful for the event the french are strong in numbers activity enthusiasm they are rich in rapine and although their strength may be only that of a phrenzy fever they may do infinite mischief to their neighbors before they can be reduced to a strait waistcoat i dread the effects that may be produced on the minds of the people by the increase of debt and taxes probable losses and possible mismanagement our trade must suffer and though projects of invasion have been always abortive i cannot forget that the fleets and armies of europe have failed before the towns in america which have been taken and plundered by a handful of buccaneers i know nothing of pit as a war minister but it affords me much satisfaction that the intrepid wisdom of the new chancellor lord loughborough is introduced into the cabinet i wish not merely on your own account that you were placed in an active useful station in government i should not dislike you secretary at war  i have little more to say of myself or of my journey to england you know my intentions and the great events of europe must determine whether they can be carried into execution this summer if  has warmly adopted your idea i shall speedily hear from him but in truth i know not what will be my answer i see difficulties which at first did not occur i doubt my own perseverance and my fancy begins to wander into new paths the amusement of reading and thinking may perhaps satisfy a man who has paid his debt to the public and there is more pleasure in building castles in the air than on the ground i shall contrive some small assistance for your eorrespondent though i cannot learn any thing that distinguishes him from many of his countrymen we have had our full share of poor emigrants but if you wish that any thing extraordinary should be done for this man you must send me a measure adieu i embrace my lady and maria as also louisa if with you perhaps i may soon write without expecting an answer ever yours  to the same lausanne april         my dearest friend for such you most truly are nor does there exist a person who obtains or shall ever obtain a superior place in my esteem and affection  after too long a silence i was sitting down to write when only yesterday morning such is now the irregular slowness of the english post i was suddenly struck indeed struck to the heart by the fatal intelligence the death of lady sheffield from sir henry clinton and mr de lally alas what is life and what are our hopes and projects when i embraced her at your deparure from lausanne could i imagine that it was for the last time when i postponed to another summer my journey to england could i apprehend that i never never should see her again i always hoped that she would spin her feeble thread to a long duration and that her delicate frame would survive as is often the case many constitutions of a stouter appearance in four days in your absence in that of her children but she is now at rest and if there be a future life her mild virtues have surely entitled her to the reward of pure and perfect felicity it is for you that i feel and i can judge of your sentiments by comparing them with my own i have lost it is true an amiable and affectionate friend whom i had known and loved above threeandtwenty years and whom i often styled by the endearing name of sister but you are deprived of the companion of your life the wife of your choice and the mother of your children poor children the liveliness of maria and the softness of louisa render them almost equally the objects of my tenderest compassion i do not wish to aggravate your grief but in the sincerity of friendship i cannot hold a different language i know the impotence of reason and i much fear that the strength of your character will serve to make a sharper and more lasting impression  the only consolation in these melancholy trials to which human life is exposed the only one at least in which i have any confidence is the presence of a real friend and of that as far as it depends on myself you shall not be destitute i regret the few days that must be lost in some necessary preparations but i trust that tomorrow sennight may the fifth i shall be able to set forwards on my journey to england and when this letter reaches you i shall be considerably advanced on my way as it is yet prudent to keep at a respectful distance from the banks of the french rhine i shall incline a little to the right and proceed by schaffouse and stutgard to frankfort and cologne the austrian netherlands are now open and safe and i am sure of being able at least to pass from ostend to dover whence without passing through london i shall pursue the direct road to sheffieldplace unless i should meet with some unforeseen accidents and delays i hope before the end of the month to share your solitude and sympathize with your grief all the difficulties of the journey which my indolence had probably magnified have now disappeared before a stronger passion and you will not be sorry to hear that as far as frankfort to cologne i shall enjoy the advantage of the society the conversation the german language and the active assistance of severy his attachment to me is the sole motive which prompts him to undertake this troublesome journey and as soon as he has seen me over the roughest ground he will immediately return to lausanne the poor young man loved lady s as a mother and the whole family is deeply affected by an event which reminds them too painfully of their own misfortune adieu i could write volumes and shall therefore break off abruptly i shall write on the road and hope to find a few lines a post restante at frankfort and brussels adieu ever yours  to the same lausanne may      my dear friend i must write a few lines before my departure though indeed i scarcely know what to say nearly a fortnight has now elapsed since the first melancholy tidings without my having received the slightest subsequent accounts of your health and situation your own silence announces too forcibly how much you are involved in your feelings and i can but too easily conceive that a letter to me would be more painful than to an indifferent person but that amiable man count lally might surely have written a second time but your sister who is probably with you but maria  alas poor maria i am left in a state of darkness to the workings of my own fancy which imagines every thing that is sad and shocking what can i think of for your relief and comfort i will not expatiate on those commonplace topics which have never dried a single tear but let me advise let me urge you to force yourself into business as i would try to force myself into study the mind must not be idle if it be not exercised on external objects it will prey on its own vitals a thousand little arrangements which must precede a long journey have postponed my departure three or four days beyond the term which i had first appointed but all is now in order and i set off tomorrow the ninth instant with my valet de chamber a courier on horseback and severy with his servant as far as frankfort i calculate my arrival at sheffieldplace how i dread and desire to see that mansion for the first week in june soon after this letter but i will try to send you some later intelligence i never found myself stronger or in better health the german road is now cleared both of enemies and allies and though i must expect fatigue i have not any apprehensions of danger it is scarcely possible that you should meet me at frankfort but i shall be much disappointed at not finding a line at brussels or ostend adieu if there be any invisible guardians may they watch over you and yours adieu  to the same frankfort may   th      and here i am in good health and spirits after one of the easiest safest and pleasantest journies which i ever performed in my whole life not the appearance of an enemy and hardly the appearance of a war yet i hear as i am writing the cannon of the siege of mayence at the distance of twenty miles and long very long will it be heard it is confessed on all sides that the french fight with a courage worthy of a better cause the town of mayence is strong their artillery admirable they are already reduced to horseflesh but they have still the resource of eating the inhabitants and at last of eating one another and if that repast could to extended to paris and the whole country it might essentially contribute to the relief of mankind our operations are carried on with more than german slowness and when the besieged are quiet the besiegers are perfectly satisfied with their progress a spirit of division undoubtedly prevails and the character of the prussians for courage and discipline is sunk lower than you can possibly imagine their glory has expired with frederick i am sorry to have missed lord elgin who is beyond the rhine with the king of prussia as i am impatient i propose setting forwards tomorrow afternoon and shall reach ostend in less than eight days the passage must depend on winds and packets and i hope to find at brussels or dover a letter which will direct me to sheffieldplace or downingstreet severy goes back from hence adieu i embrace the dear girls ever yours  from the same brussels may   th      this day between two and three oclock in the afternoon i am arrived at this place in excellent preservation my expedition which is now drawing to a close has been a journey of perseverance rather than speed of some labor since frankfort but without the smallest degree of difficulty or danger as i have every morning been seated in the chaise soon after sunrise i propose indulging tomorrow till eleven oclock and going that day no farther than ghent on wednesday the   th instant i shall reach ostend in good time just eight days according to my former reckoning from frankfort beyond that i can say nothing positive but should the winds be propitious it is possible that i may appear next saturday june first in downingstreet after that earliest date you will expect me day by day till i arrive adieu i embrace the dear girls and salute mrs holroyd i rejoice that you have anticipated my advice by plunging into business but i should now be sorry if that business however important detained us long in town i do not wish to make a public exhibition and only sigh to enjoy you and the precious remnant in the solitude of sheffieldplace ever yours  if i am successful i may outstrip or accompany this letter yours and marias waited for me here and overpaid the journey  the preceding letters intimate that in return for my visit to lausanne in      mr gibbon engaged to pass a year with me in england that the war having rendered traveling exceedingly inconvenient especially to a person who from his bodily infirmities required every accommodation prevented his undertaking so formidable a journey at the time he proposed  the call of friendship however was sufficient to make him overlook every personal consideration when he thought his presence might prove a consolation i must ever regard it as the most endearing proof of his sensibility and of his possessing the true spirit of friendship that after having relinquished the thought of his intended visit he hastened to england in spite of increasing impediments to soothe me by the most generous sympathy and to alleviate my domestic affliction neither his great corpulency nor his extraordinary bodily infirmities nor any other consideration could prevent him a moment from resolving on an undertaking that might have deterred the most active young man he almost immediately with alertness by no means natural to him undertook a great circuitous journey along the frontiers of an enemy worse than savage within the found of their cannon within the range of the light troops of the different armies and through roads ruined by the enormous machinery of war  the readiness with which he engaged in this kind office of friendship at a time when a selfish spirit might have pleaded a thousand reasons for declining so hazardous a journey conspired with the peculiar charms of his society to render his arrival a cordial to my mind i had the satisfaction of finding that his own delicate and precarious health had not suffered in the service of his friend a service in which he disregarded his own personal infirmities he arrived in the beginning of june at my house in downingstreet safe and in good health and after we had passed about a month together in london we settled at sheffieldplace for the summer where his wit learning and cheerful politeness delighted a great variety of characters  although he was inclined to represent his health as better than it really was his habitual dislike to motion appeared to increase his inaptness to exercise confined him to the library and dining room and there he joined my friend mr frederick north in pleasant arguments against exercise in general he ridiculed the unsettled and restless disposition that summer the most uncomfortable as he said of all seasons generally gives to those who have the free use of their limbs such arguments were little required to keep society within doors when his company was only there to be enjoyed for neither the fineness of the season nor the most promising parties of pleasure could tempt the company of either sex to desert him  those who have enjoyed the society of mr gibbon will agree with me that his conversation was still more captivating than his writings perhaps no man ever divided time more fairly between literary labor and social enjoyment and hence probably he derived his peculiar excellence of making his very extensive knowledge contribute in the highest degree to the use or pleasure of those with whom he conversed he united in the happiest manner imaginable two characters which are not often found in the same person the profound scholar and the fascinating companion  it would be superstuous to attempt a very minute delineation of a character which is so distinctly marked in the memoirs and letters he has described himself without reserve and with perfect sincerity the letters and especially the extracts from the journal which could not have been written with any purpose of being seen will make the reader perfectly acquainted with the man  excepting a visit to lord egremont and mr hayley whom he very particularly esteemed mr gibbon was not absent from sheffieldplace till the beginning of october when we were reluctantly obliged to part with him that he might perform his engagement to mrs gibbon at bath the widow of his father who had early deserved and invariably retained his affection from bath he proceeded to lord spensers at althorp a family which he always met with uncommon satisfaction he continued in good health during the whole summer and in excellent spirits i never knew him enjoy better and when he went from sheffieldplace little did i imagine it would be the last time i should have the inexpressible pleasure of seeing him there in full possession of health  the few following short letters though not important in themselves will fill up this part of the narrative better and more agreeably than any thing i can substitute in their place  edward gibbon esquire to the right hon lord sheffield october  d      the corkstreet hotel has answered its recommendation it is clean convenient and quiet my first evening was passed at home in a very agreeable teteatete with my friend elmsley yesterday i dined at craufurds with an excellent set in which were pelham and lord egremont i dine today with my portuguese friend madame de sylva at greniers most probably with lady webster whom i met last night at devonshirehouse a constant though late resort of society the duchess is as good and lady elizabeth as seducing as ever no news whatsoever you will see in the papers lord harveys memorial i love vigor but it is surely a strong measure to tell a gentleman you have resolved to pass the winter in his house london is not disagreeable yet i shall probably leave it saturday if any thing should occur i will write adieu ever yours  to the same sunday afternoon i left london and lay at reading and monday in very good time i reached this place after a very pleasant airing and am always so much delighted and improved with this union of case and motion that were not the expense enormous i would travel every year some hundred miles more especially in england i passed the day with mrs g yesterday i mind and conversation she is just the same as twenty years ago she has spirits appetite legs and eyes and talks of living till ninety she was then in her eightieth year  i can say from my heart amen we dine at two and remain together till nine but although we have much to say i am not sorry that she talks of introducing a third or fourth actor lord spenser expects me about the  0th but if i can do it without offense i shall steal away two or three days sooner and you shall have advice of my motions the troubles of bristol have been serious and bloody i know not who was in fault but i do not like appeasing the mob by the extinction of the toll and the removal of the hereford militia who had done their duty adieu the girls must dance at tunbridge what would dear little aunt say if i was to answer her letter ever yours etc  yorkhouse bath october  th      i still follow the old style though the convention has abolished the christian era with months weeks days etc  to the same yorkhouse bath october   th      i am as ignorant of bath in general as if i were still at sheffield my impatience to get away makes me think it better to devote my whole time to mrs g and dear little aunt whom i tenderly salute will excuse me to her two friends mrs hartley and preston if i make little or no use of her kind introduction a teteateete of eight or nine hours every day is rather difficult to support yet i do assure you that our conversation flows with more ease and spirit when we are alone than when any auxiliaries are summoned to our aid she is indeed a wonderful woman and i think all her faculties of the mind stronger and more active than i have ever known them i have settled that ten full days may be sufficient for all the purposes of our interview i should therefore depart next friday the eighteenth instant and am indeed expected at althorpe on the twentieth but i may possibly reckon without my host as i have not yet apprised mrs g of the term of my visit and will certainly not quarrel with her for a short delay adieu i must have some political speculations the campaign at least on our side seems to be at an end ever yours  to the same althorp library tuesday four oclock we have so completely exhausted this morning among the first editions of cicero that i can mention only my departure hence tomorrow the sixth instant i shall lie quietly at woburn and reach london in good time thursday by the following post i will write somewhat more largely my stay in london will depend partly on my amusement and your being fixed at sheffieldplace unless you think i can be comfortably arranged for a week or two with you at brighton the military remarks seem good but now to what purpose adieu i embrace and much rejoice in louisas improvement lord ossory was from home at farningwoods  to the same london friday nov  th four oclock walpole has just delivered yours and i hasten the direction that you may not be at a loss i will write tomorrow but i am now fatigued and rather unwell adieu i have not seen a soul except elmsley  to the same st jamessstreet nov  th      as i dropped yesterday the word unwell i flatter myself that the family would have been a little alarmed by my silence today i am still awkward though without any suspicions of gout and have some idea of having recourse to medical advice yet i creep out today in a chair to dine with lord lucan but as it will be literally my first going down stairs and as scarcely any one is apprized of my arrival i know nothing i have heard nothing i have nothing to say my present lodging a house of elmsleys is cheerful convenient somewhat dear but not so much as a hotel a species of habitation for which i have not conceived any great affection had you been stationary at sheffield you would have seen me before the twentieth for i am tired of rambling and pant for my home that is to say for your house but whether i shall have courage to brave  and a bleak down time only can discover adieu i wish you back to sheffieldplace the health of dear louisa is doubtless the first object but i did not expect brighton after tunbridge whenever dear little aunt is separate from you i shall certainly write to her but at present how is it possible ever yours  to the same at brighthelmstone st jamessstreet nov   th      i must at length withdraw the veil before my state of health though the naked truth may alarm you more than a fit of the gout have you never observed through my inexpressibles a large prominency circa genitalia which as it was not at all painful and very little troublesome i had strangely neglected for many years but since my departure from sheffieldplace it has increased most stupendously is increasing and ought to be diminished yesterday i sent for farquhar who is allowed to be a very skilful surgeon after viewing and palping he very seriously desired to call in assistance and has examined it again today with mr cline a surgeon as he says of the first eminence they both pronounce it a hydrocele a collection of water which must be let out by the operation of tapping but from its magnitude and long neglect they think it a most extraordinary case and wish to have another surgeon dr bayley present if the business should go off smoothly i shall be delivered from my burden it is almost as big as a small child and walk about in four or five days with a truss but the medical gentlemen who never speak quite plain insinuate to me the possibility of an inflammation of fever etc i am not appalled at the thoughts of the operations which is fixed for wednesday next twelve oclock but it has occurred to me that you might wish to be present before and afterward till the crisis was past and to give you that opportunity i shall solicit a delay till thursday or even friday in the mean while i crawl about with some labor and much indecency to devonshirehouse where i left all the fine ladies making flannel waistcoats lady lucans etc adieu varnish the business for the ladies yet i am afraid it will be public  the advantage of being notorious ever yours  immediately on receiving the last letter i went the same day from brighthelmstone to london and was agreeably surprised to find that mr gibbon had dined at lord lucans and did not return to his lodgings where i waited for him till eleven oclock at night those who have seen him within the last eight or ten years must be surprised to hear that he could doubt whether his disorder was apparent when he returned to england in      i was greatly alarmed by a prodigious increase which i always conceived to proceed from a rupture i did not understand why he who had talked with me on every other subject relative to himself and his affairs without reserve should never in any shape hint at a malady so troublesome but on speaking to his valet de chamber he told me mr gibbon could not bear the least allusion to that subject and never would suffer him to notice it i consulted some medical persons who with me supposing it to be a rupture were of opinion that nothing could be done and said that he surely must have had advice and of course had taken all necessary precautions he now talked freely with me about his disorder which he said began in the year      that he then consulted mr hawkins the surgeon who did not decide whether it was the beginning of a rupture or an hydrocele but he desired to see mr gibbon again when he came to town mr gibbon not feeling any pain nor suffering any inconvenience as he said never returned to mr hawkins and although the disorder continued to increase gradually and of late years very much indeed he never mentioned it to any person however incredible it may appear from      to november      i told him that i had always supposed there was no doubt of its being a rupture his answer was that he never thought so and that he and the surgeons who attended him were of opinion that it was an hydrocele it is now certain that it was originally a rupture and that an hydrocele had lately taken place in the same part and it is remarkable that his legs which had been swelled about the ankle particularly one of them since he had the erisipelas in    0 recovered their former shape as soon as the water appeared in another part which did not happen till between the time he left sheffieldplace in the beginning of october and his arrival at althorpe toward the latter end of that month on the thursday following the date of his last letter mr gibbon was tapped for the first time four quarts of a transparent watery fluid were discharged by that operation neither inflammation nor fever ensued the tumor was diminished to nearly half its size the remaining part was a soft irregular mass i had been with him two days before and i continued with him above a week after the first tapping during which time he enjoyed his usual spirits and the three medical gentlemen who attended him will recollect his pleasantry even during the operation he was abroad again in a few days but the water evidently collecting very fast it was agreed that a second puncture should be made a fortnight after the first knowing that i should be wanted at a meeting in the country he pressed me to attend it and promised that soon after the second operation was performed he would follow me to sheffieldplace but before he arrived i received the two following letters  mr gibbon to lord sheffield at brighton st jamess street nov   th      though farquhar has promised to write you a line i conceive you may not be sorry to hear directly from me the operation of yesterday was much longer more searching and more painful than the former but it has eased and lightened me to a much greater degree three quarts of the same fluid as before were discharged  no inflammation no fever a dilicious night leave to go abroad tomorrow and to go out of town when i please en attendant the future measures of a radical cure if you hold your intention of returning next saturday to sheffieldplace i shall probably join you about the tuesday following after having passed two nights at beckenham edenfarm  the devons are going to bath and the hospitable craufurd follows them i passed a delightful day with burke an odd one with monsignore erskine the popes nuncio of public news you and the papers know more than i do we seem to have strong sea and land hopes nor do i dislike the royalists having beaten the sans culottes and taken dol how many minutes will it take to guillotine the seventythree new members of the convention who are now arrested adieu ever yours  to the same st jamessstreet nov  0th      it will not be in my power to reach sheffieldplace quite so soon as i wished and expected lord auckland informs me that he shall be at lambeth next week tuesday wednesday and thursday i have therefore agreed to dine at beckenham on friday saturday will be spent there and unless some extraordinary temptation should detain me another day you will see me by four oclock sunday the ninth of december i dine tomorrow with the chancellor at hampstead and what i do not like at this time of the year without a proposal to stay all night yet i would not refuse more especially as i had denied him on a former day my health is good but i shall have a final interview with farquhar before i leave town we are still in darkness about lord how and the french ships but hope seems to preponderate adieu nothing that relates to louisa can be forgotten ever yours  mr gibbon generally took the opportunity of passing a night or two with his friend lord auckland at edenfarm ten miles from london on his passage to sheffieldplace and notwithstanding his indisposition he had lately made an excursion thither from london when he was much pleased by meeting the archbishop of canterbury of whom he expressed an high opinion he returned to london to dine with lord loughborough to meet mr burke mr windham and particularly mr pit with whom he was not acquainted and in his last journey to sussex he revisited edenfarm and was much gratified by the opportunity of again seeing during a whole day mr pit who passed the night there from lord aucklands mr gibbon proceeded to sheffieldplace and his discourse was never more brilliant nor more entertaining than on his arrival the parallels he drew and the comparisons he made between the leading men of this country were sketched in his best manner and were infinitely interesting however this last visit to sheffieldplace became far different from any he had ever made before that ready cheerful various and illuminating conversation which we had before admired in him was not now always to be found in the library or the dining room he moved with difficulty and retired from company sooner than he had been used to do on the twentythird of december his appetite began to fail him he observed to me that it was a very bad sign with him when he could not eat his breakfast which he had done at all times very heartily and this seems to have been the strongest expression of apprehension that the was ever observed to utter a considerable degree of fever now made its appearance inflammation arose from the weight and the bulk of the tumor water again collected very fast and when the sever went off he never entirely recovered his appetite even for breakfast i became very uneasy indeed at his situation toward the end of the month and thought it necessary to advise him to set out for london he had before settled his plan to arrive there about the middle of january i had company in the house and we expected one of his particular friends but he was obliged to sacrifice all social pleasure to the immediate attention which his health required he went to london on the seventh of january and the next day i received the following billet the last he ever wrote  edward gibbon esquire to lord sheffield st jamessstreet four oclock tuesday this date says every thing i was almost killed between sheffieldplace and eastgrinsted by hard frozen long and cross ruts that would disgrace the approach of an indian wigwam the rest was something less painful and i reached this place halfdead but not seriously feverish or ill i found a dinner invitation from lord lucan but what are dinners to me i wish they did not know of my departure i catch the flying post what an effort adieu till thursday or friday  by his own desire i did not follow him till thursday the ninth i then found him far from well the tumor more distended than before inflamed and ulcerated in several places remedies were applied to abate the inflammation but it was not thought proper to puncture the tumor for the third time till monday the   th of january when no less than six quarts of fluid were discharged he seemed much relieved by the evacuation his spirits continued good he talked as usual of passing his time at houses which he had often frequented with great pleasure the duke of devonshires mr craufurds lord spensers lord lucans sir ralph paynes and mr batts and when i told him that i should not return to the country as i had intended he pressed me to go knowing i had an engagement there on public business he said you may be back on saturday and i intend to go on thursday to devonshirehouse i had not any apprehension that his life was in danger although i began to fear that he might not be restored to a comfortable state and that motion would be very troublesome to him but he talked of a radical cure he said that it was fortunate the disorder had shown itself while he was in england where he might procure the best assistance and if a radical cure could not be obtained before his return to lausanne there was an able surgeon at geneva who could come to tap him when it should be necessary  on tuesday the fourteenth when the risk of inflammation and fever from the last operation was supposed to be over as the medical gentlemen who attended him expressed no fears for his life i went that afternoon part of the way to sussex and the following day reached sheffieldplace the next morning the sixteenth i received by the post a good account of mr gibbon which mentioned also that he hourly gained strength in the evening came a letter by express dated noon that day which acquainted me that mr gibbon had had a violent attack the preceding night and that it was not probable he should live till i could come to him i reached his lodgings in st jamessstreet about midnight and learned that my friend had expired a quarter before one oclock that day the sixteenth of january       after i left him on tuesday afternoon the fourteenth he saw some company lady lucan and lady spenser and thought himself well enough at night to omit the opium draught which he had been used to take for some time he slept very indifferently before nine the next morning he rose but could not eat his breakfast however he appeared tolerably well yet complained at times of a pain in his stomach at one oclock he received a visit of an hour from madame de sylva and at three his friend mr craufurd of auchinames whom he always mentioned with particular regard called and stayed with him till past five oclock they talked as usual on various subjects and twenty hours before his death mr gibbon happened to fall into a conversation not uncommon with him on the probable duration of his life he said that he thought himself a good life for ten twelve or perhaps twenty years about six he ate the wing of a chicken and drank three glasses of madeira after dinner he became very uneasy and impatient complained a good deal and appeared so weak that his servant was alarmed mr gibbon had sent to his friend and relation mr robert darell whose house was not far distant desiring to see him and adding that he had something particular to say but unfortunately this desired interview never took place  during the evening he complained much of his stomach and of a disposition to vomit soon after nine he took his opium draught and went to bed about ten he complained of much pain and desired that warm napkins might be applied to his stomach he almost incessantly expressed a sense of pain till about four oclock in the morning when he said he found his stomach much easier about seven the servant asked whether he should send for mr farquhar he answered no that he was as well as he had been the day before at about half past eight he got out of bed and said he was  plus adroit than he had been for three months past and got into bed again without assistance better than usual about nine he said that he would rise the servant however persuaded him to remain in bed till mr farquhar who was expected at eleven should come till about that hour he spoke with great facility mr farquhar came at the time appointed and he was then visibly dying when the valet de chamber returned after attending mr farquhar out of the room mr gibbon said  pourquoi est ce que vous me quittez this was about half past eleven at twelve he drank some brandy and water from a teapot and desired his favorite servant to stay with him these were the last words he pronounced articulately to the last he preserved his senses and when he could no longer speak his servant having asked a question he made a sign to show that he understood him he was quite tranquil and did not stir his eyes halfshut about a quarter before one he ceased to breathe the body was not opened till the fifth day after his death it was then sound except that a degree of mortification not very considerable had taken place on a part of the colon which with the whole of the omentum of a very enlarged size had descended into the scrotum forming a bag that hung down nearly as low as the knee since that part had been inflamed and ulcerated mr gibbon could not bear a trufs and when the last six quarts of fluid were discharged the colon and omentum descending lower they by their weight drew the lower mouth of the stomach downwards to the os pubis and this probably was the immediate cause of his death  the following is the account of the appearance of the body given by an eminent surgeon who opened it  aperto tumore qui ab inguine usque ad genu se extenderat observatum est partem ejus inferiorem constare ex tunica vaginati testis continenti duas quasi libras liquoris serosi tincti sanguine ea autem fuit sacci illius amplitudo ut portioni liquoris long majori capiendae susficeret in posteriori part hujus sacci testis situs fuit hunc omnino sanum invenimus  partem tumoris superiorem occupaverant integrum fere omentum et major pars intestini coli hae parts sacco sibi proprio inclusae sibi invicem et sacco suo adeo arcte adhaeserunt ut coivisse viderentur in massam unam solidam et irregularem cujus a tergo chorda spermatica sedem suam obtinuerat  in omento et in intestino colo haud dubia recentis inflammationis signa vidimus necnon maculas nonnullas lividi coloris hinc inde sparsas  aperto abdomine ventriculum invenimus a naturali suo situ detractum usque ad annulum masculi obliqui externi pylorum retrorsum et quasi sursum a duodeno retractum in hepate ingentem numerum parvorum tuberculorum vesica felleam bile admodum distentam in caeteris visceribus examini anatomico subjectis nulla morbi vestigia extiterunt     the valet de chamber observed that mr gibbon did not at any time show the least sign of alarm or apprehension of death and it does not appear that he ever thought himself in danger unless his desire to speak to mr darell may be considered in that light  perhaps i dwell too long on these minute and melancholy circumstances yet the close of such a life can hardly fail to interest every reader and i know that the public has received a different and erroneous account of my friends last hours  i can never cease to feel regret that i was not by his side at this awful period a regret so strong that i can express it only by borrowing as the eloquent mr mason has done on a similar occasion the forcible language of tacitus mihi praeter acerbitatem amici erepti auget moestitiam quod assidere valetudini fovere deficientem satiari vultu complexu non contigit it is some consolation to me that i have not like tacitus by a long absence anticipated the loss of my friend several years before his decease although i had not the mournful gratification of being near him on the day he expired yet during his illness i had not failed to attend him with that assiduity which his genius his virtues and above all our long uninterrupted and happy friendship demanded  postscript mr gibbons will is dated the  st of october      just before i left lausanne he distinguishes me as usual in the most flattering manner  i constitute and appoint the right honorable john lord sheffield edward darell esquire and john thomas batt esquire to be the executors of this my last will and testament and as the execution of this trust will not be attended with much difficulty or trouble i shall indulge these gentlemen in the pleasure of this last disinterested service without wronging my feelings or oppressing my heir by too light or too weighty a testimony of my gratitude my obligations to the long and active friendship of lord sheffield i could never sufficiently repay  he then observes that the right hon lady eliot of porteliot is his nearest relation on the fathers side but that her three sons are in such prosperous circumstances that he may well be excused for making the two children of his late uncle sir stanier porten his heirs they being in a very different situation he bequeaths annuities to two old servants three thousand pounds and his furniture plate etc at lausanne to mr wilhelme de severy one hundred guineas to the poor of lausanne and fifty guineas each to the following persons lady sheffield and daughters maria and louisa madame and mademoiselle de severy the count de schomberg mademoiselle la chanoinesse de polier and m le ministre le vade for the purchase of some token which may remind them of a sincere friend the remains of mr gibbon were deposited in lord sheffields family burialplace in sussex  appendix the letters of mr gibbon from the time of his return to switzerland in      are annexed to his memoirs as the best continuation of them among his letters of an earlier date i find several which he has alluded to and other which will illustrate the account he has given of himself these i flatter myself will please the generality of readers since when he touches on matters of private business even subjects of the driest nature become interesting from his mode of treating them many letters from distinguished persons to him will be introduced and some that he received at a very early period of life although we have not all his own letters to which these were answers yet we have enough to testify his ambition even in youth to be distinguished as a scholar  it has been sometimes thought necessary to offer to the public an apology for the publication of private letters i have no scruple to say that i publish these because i think they place my friend in an advantageous point of view he might not perhaps have expected that all his letters should be printed but i have no reason to believe that he would have been averse to the publication of any if i had they never would have been made public however highly i might have conceived of their excellence  letters to and from edward gibbon esquire no i m crevier a m gibbon monsieur paris   aout      je ne puis quetre tres sensible aux temoignages destime dont vous voulez bien me combler quoique je sois fort eloigne de les prendre a la lettre et de me regarder comme un oracle mais je suis homme vrai et par la meme qui aim a profiter des lumieres que lon a la bonte de me communiquer ainsi monsieur je recois avec toute la satisfaction possible lingenieuse conjecture que vous proposez pour leclaircissement dun passage de tite live sur lequel je mavois su quetre embarasse jadopte toutes vos observations tous vos raisonnemens par le changement dune seule lettre vous substituez a un sens louche et obscur une pensee claire convenable au caractere de celui qui parle et bien liee avec tout le rest du discourse je ne manquerai pas den fair une note et de me servir de cette judicieuse correction si loccasion sen present en prenant soin den fair honneur a celui a qui je la dois  jajouterai sculement une remarque de peu de consequence mais qui me paroit necessaire pour donner toute sa perfection a la phrase sur laquelle vous avez travaille si heureusement voici la phrase avec le changement que vous proposez nec esse in vos otio vestro consultum ab romany credatis or in vos ne me paroit point saccorder avec otio vestro lexpression in vos semble marquer quelque chose qui doit etre contraire au bien des carthaginois et qui par consequence sallie mal avec lidee de leur repos ainsi au lieu de ces mots in vos jaimerois mieux lire in his alors la phrase sera completement bonne nec esse in his otio vestro consultum ab romany credatis ne pensez pas que dans ces mesures que prennent les romans pour vous oter toutes vos forces et en vous interdisant la guerre avec letranger ils aient eu pour objet votre tranquillite et votre repos  il ne me rest plus monsieur qua vous remercier de la bonte que vous avez eu de me fair part dune idee aussi heureuse ce seroit une grande joie pour moi si je recevois souvent de pareils secours sur tout ce que jai done au public  jai lhonneur detre avec bien de la reconnoissance et de respect etc  crevier  translation mr crevier to mr gibbon sir paris  th august      i am extremely obliged by your expressions of esteem without taking them in the literal sense and believing myself an oracle but i am a lover of truth and sincerity and always ready to avail myself of the communications of my learned friends with the greatest pleasure therefore i received your ingenious conjecture illustrating a passage of livy by which i had been puzzled i adopt all your observations and reasonings by changing a single letter you substitute instead of an awkward and obscure meaning a thought perspicuous in itself suitable to the character of the speaker and connected with the purport of his discourse i shall not fail noticing this judicious correction when an opportunity occurs and mentioning the name of the person to whom i am indebted for it  i will add only one remark of small importance indeed but necessary for giving complete correctness to the passage with which your attention has been so successfully occupied with your emendation it runs thus nec esse in vos otio vestro consultum ab romany credatis the in vos does not appear to me to correspond well with otio vestro since it seems to indicate something adverse to the interest of the carthaginians and therefore does not accord well with the idea of their tranquillity instead of the words in vos i would read in his which would render the passage perfectly correct nec esse in his otio vestro consultum ab romany credatis do not believe that the romans when they deprive you of your forces and forbid you to make war on foreign nations mean thereby to promote your tranquillity  it remains only sir that i should thank you for your goodness in communicating to me so happy a thought it would give me the greatest pleasure to be frequently favored with such assistance in my literary labors  i have the honor to remain with much gratitude and respect  yours etc crevier  no ii m allamand a mr gibbon bex sept         monsieur a present queme voila echappe de lorage des fonctions publiques donc cette eglise est chargee en tems de fete je saisis avec joie quelques momens de repos pour mentretenir monsieur avec vous ce sera sil vous plait sans fair de trop grands efforts sur larticle des idees innees que vous me proposez outre que je risquerois de dire comme je ne sais quelle des interlocutrices de terence magno conatu magnas nugas il y a fort long tems que je nai relu m lock loracle modern sur cette matiere et il faudroit trop de tems et de papier pour tout eplucher ayez donc la bonte de vous contenter des premieres reflections qui se presenteront sur quelques endroits de son premier livre  je commence par le chap i   ou cet habile homme entreprend de prouver que ces deux principes ce qui est est il est impossible quune meme chose soit et en meme temps ne soit pas ne sont point innees puisquils netoient point dans lesprit pendant lenfance et la preuve quils ny etoient pas cest que lenfant ny pensoit point et que bien des gens meurent sans les avoir jamais appercus or dit m lock une idee ne sauroit etre dans lesprit sans que lesprit ne sen appercoive etc  il est clair monsieur que toute la force de ce raisonnement est dans cette derniere assertion mais cette assertion nest elle pas evidemment detruite par lexperience appercevez vous actuellement toutes les idees que vous avez dans lesprit ny en a til point auquelles vous ne prendrez peutetre guard de plusieurs annees et dans les efforts que lon fait souvent pour rappeller ce quon a confie a sa memoire ne sent on pas quil peut y avoir des connoissances si cachees dans ses replis que loin de les appercevoir sans cesse il faut bien de la peine pour les rattrapper je sais que m lock qui a senti la difficulte tache de la resoudre chapter iii  0 mais en verite la longueur et lembarras de cet article montre assez que m l netoit par a son aise en lecrivant et comment y auroit il ete voici autant que jen puis juger a quoi il se reduit il avoue que nous avons dans lesprit des idees que nous nappercevons point actuellement mais ditil cest dans la memoire quelles sont et cela est si vrai quon ne se les rappelle point sans se souvenir en meme temps quon les a deja appercues or tell nest point le cas des idees quon pretend innees quand on les appercoit pour la premiere fois ce nest point avec reminiscence comme on devroit si ces idees la avoient ete dans lesprit avaunt cette premiere apperception etc  de grace monsieur croyez vous que m lock sentendit bien lui meme quand il distinguoit etre dans lesprit et etre dans la memoire et quimporte a la question quon se souvienne davoir deja su ce que lon se rappelle sil nen est pas moins vrai quon la eu long temps dans lesprit sans sen appercevoir ce qui est le point dont il sagit au rest m lock auroit pu sentir que si lon ne se rappelle point les idees innees par reminiscence eest quelles ne sont point entrees dans lesprit dune maniere qui ait exige ou attire son attention et cest aussi le cas de plusieurs idees acquises car quoiquen dire m lock chacun se trouve au besoin nombre didees qui ne peuvent setre insinuees dans son esprit qua la presence de certains objets auquels il na point pris guard ou en general par des moyens inconnus qui lont enrichi sans quil sache comment et sans quil crut les avoir jusques au moment quelles se sont presentees  sur le fond meme de la question il me semble que m lock confond perpetuellement deux chooses tres differentes lidee elle meme qui est une connoissance dans lesprit et un principe de raisonnement et lenonce de cette idee en form de proposition ou de definition il se peut et il est meme tres probable que bien des gens nont jamais form ou envisage en eux memes cet enonce il est impossible quune chose soit et ne soit pas en meme tems voyez live   chapter i    mais suitil dela quils ne connoissent pas la verite quil exprime et quils nen ont pas lidee  nullement tout homme qui assure qui nie tout homme qui parle un enfant quand il demand quand il refuse quand il se plaint etc ne suppose til pas que des quune chose est il est impossible quen meme tems elle ne soit pas ne trouvez vous pas monsieur quon pourroit soutenir la realite des idees innees precisement sur ce que m lock allegue contre else que beaucoup de gens nont jamais pense aux propositions evidentes dont il parle car puisque sans y avoir pense ils sen servent ils batissent la dessus ils jugent de la verite ou de labsurdite dun discourse par ses rapports avec ces principes la etc dou leur vient cette familiarite avec des principes quils nont jamais apperccus distinctement si ce nest de ce quils en ont une connoissance ou si lon veut un sentiment naturel  aux    et    m lock nei que le consentement que lon done a certaines propositions des quon les entend prononcer soit une preuve que lidee quelles expriment soit innee et il se fond sur ce quil y a bien des propositions que lon recoit ainsi dabord qui certainement ne sont point innees et il en done diverse exemples viz deux and deux sont quotre etc mais ne vous paroitra til pas quil confond ici de simples definitions de mots avec des verites evidentes par else memes au moins est il certain que tous ses exemples sont de simples definitions des mots deux et deux sont quatre lidee quon exprime par deux et deux est la meme que celle quon exprime par quatre etc or person ne dit que la connoissance dune definition de mots soit innee puisquelle suppose celle du langage mais cette proposition le tout est plus grand que chacune de ses parties nest point dans ce cas et il est certain que le plus petit enfant suppose la verite de cette proposition toutes les fois que non content dune moitie de pomme il veut la pomme toute entiere  prenez la peine monsieur dexaminer le    ou m lock veut convaincre de faussete cette supposition quil y a des principes tellement innes que ceux qui en entendent pour la premiere fois et qui en comprennent lenonce napprennent rien de nouveau premierement ditil il est clair quils ont appris les terms de lenonce et la signification de ces terms mais qui ne voit que m lock sort de la question person na jamais dit que des terms qui ne sont que des signs arbitraires de nos idees fussent innes il ajoute que les idees renfermees dans de pareils enonces ne naissent pas plus avec nous que leurs expressions et quon acquiert ces idees dans la suite apres en avoir appris les noms mais   nest ce pas donner pour preuve de ce quon affirm cette affirmation meme il ny a point didees innees car il ny en a que dacquises m lock riroit bien dun pareil raisonnement sil le trouvoit dans ses adversaires   sil est vrai quon apprend les mots avaunt que davoir les idees quils expriment au moins sil est vrai que cela soit toujours ainsi comme m lock lentend je voudrois bien savoir comment la premiere langue a pu etre formee et meme comment il est possible quon fasse comprendre a quelquun le sens dun mot nouveau pour lui tout homme qui na nulle idee de lordre par exemple doit aussi peu etre capable dentendre ce mot order quun aveugle ne celui de couleur  au    m lock nie les idees innees parcequelles ne paroissent ni dans les enfans ni dans les imbecilles ou else devroient paroitre le plus mais   ceux qui admettent les idees innees ne les croyent pas plus naturelles a lame que ses facultes puis donc que letat et la constitution du corpse nuit a cellesci dans les imbecilles elle sera aussi cause quon ne leur remarque point les autres   le fait meme nest pas entierement vrai les enfans et les imbecilles ont lidee de leur existence de leur individualite de leur identite etc  dans le rest de ce m lock se divertit au depens de ceux qui croyent que les enonces des maxims abstraites sont innees mais les plus determines scholastiques nont jamais rien dit de semblable et il rit dune chimere quil sest faite lui meme  je ne sais monsieur comment il est arrive quau lieu de trois ou quatre courts reflections que jaurois du vous donner sur tout ceci je me suis engage dans une critique longue et ennuyeuse de quelques endroits dun seul chapitre cest apparemment un rest de lassitude jai trouve plus de facilite a suivre et a chicaner m lock qua penser tout seul prenez patience et pardonnez jentrevois bien des chooses a dire sur le second chapitre ou il sagit des principes innes de pratique mais je ne vous en fatiguerai quapres en avoir recu laveu de vous meme  on ecrit ici que le roi de prusse vient de battre les autrichiens et de leur tuer  0 mill hommes en ayant perdu    mill des siens voila donc ou il alloit en passant par leipsic si cette nouvelle est vraie la guerre ne fauroit manquer de devenir generale et de lair quelle commence elle sera terrible mais je crains bien que sa m p nait le sort de charles xii qui le soutiendra contre la france lautriche et peutetre la russie reunies  jai lhonneur detre avec une parfaite consideration monsieur etc  allamand  mr allamand to mr gibbon bex   th september      sir after escaping from the tumult of public functions in which the ministers of this church are employed during the holydays i sit down with much pleasure to converse with you a few minutes on paper without intending to make any very violent exertion in answering the questions concerning innate ideas which you propose for my consideration i am not willing to risk the being obliged to say with one of terences characters magno conatu magnas nugas besides it is long since i looked into lock the modern oracle on that subject and too much time and paper would be requisite completely to canvass so intricate a subject you will have the goodness therefore to be contented with the first reflections that occur to me on some passages of his first book  in chapter i   that able writer undertakes to prove that the axioms whatever is is and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be at the same time are not innate because children are totally ignorant of them as appears from their never taking notice of them and many persons die without ever perceiving the truth of these axioms but it is impossible mr lock observes for an idea to be in the mind which the mind never takes notice of it is plain that the whole weight of his reasoning rests on this last assertion which assertion itself seems to be manifestly contradicted by experience do you perceive sir at this moment all the ideas that are in your mind are there not some of them which you may not perhaps take notice of for many years in the efforts which we make to recall things to the memory are we not sensible that some ideas may be so deeply hidden in its recesses that instead of continually perceiving them we have no small trouble in bringing them back to our remembrance i know that mr lock c iii  0 endeavors to obviate these objections but the length and perplexity of that article shows that he was not at ease in writing it how indeed could he be so since as far as i am able to judge the following is the result of his argument i confess that we have ideas in the mind of which we are not conscious but then these ideas are in the memory as appears from this that we never recall them without remembering that they formerly were objects of our perception but this is not supposed to hold with regard to what are called innate ideas when these are perceived for the first time it is not with reminiscence which would certainly be the case if they had been in the mind before this first perception of them etc  be pleased to tell me sir whether you think that mr lock himself will understood the distinction which he makes between being in the mind and being in the memory and of what importance is it that we remember to have formerly had the recalled ideas provided it be allowed that we had them long without taking any notice of them which is the point in question besides mr lock ought to have known that innate ideas are not recalled with reminiscence because those ideas come originally into the mind in a way that neither excites nor requires our attention for whatever mr lock may say every one may be sensible from his own experience that many even of his acquired ideas could not have come into his mind independently of the presence of certain objects of which he had never taken any notice or in general independently of certain unknown causes which enriched him without his being sensible of it with ideas that he did not believe himself possessed of till they actually presented themselves to his understanding  as to the main question mr lock seems to me perpetually to confound two things extremely different the idea itself which is a perception of the mind and a principle of reasoning and the expression of that idea in the form of a proposition or definition it is possible nay very probable that many persons have never formed or thought of the proposition it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be at the same time see lock b i c      but does it follow from this that they are ignorant of the truth expressed by these words by no means every man who affirms denies or speaks a child who asks refuses or complains must know the truth of this proposition does it not appear to you sir that the doctrine of innate ideas may be defended on the same principle by which mr lock attacks it namely that many persons have never thought of the propositions or descriptions by which they are expressed for if without ever having thought of those propositions they make use of them in their reasonings and employ them in judging of the justness or absurdity of every discourse which they hear how could they be so familiar with principles which they never distinctly took notice of unless they had a natural knowledge or innate perception of them  in paragraphs    and    mr lock denies that our consenting to certain propositions at first hearing them is a proof that the ideas expressed by them are innate since many propositions thus assented to evidently express ideas that had been acquired for example two and two make four etc but does it not appear to you that he here confounds the definition of words with selfevident truths at least all the examples which he gives are mere definitions the idea expressed by two and two is precisely the same with the idea of four nobody says that our knowledge of the definitions of words is innate because that would imply language to be so but the knowledge of this truth that the whole is greater than its part does not imply that supposition since an infant shows itself acquainted with this principle when dissatisfied with the half of an apple it indicates its desire to possess the whole  take the trouble sir to examine    in which mr lock endeavors to disprove the assertion that there are some principles so truly innate that those who hear them expressed in words for the first time immediately comprehend them without learning any thing new first of all he observes it is clear they must have learned the terms of the expression and the meaning of those terms but here mr lock manifestly departs from the question nobody says that words which are merely arbitrary signs of our ideas are innate he adds that the ideas denoted by these expressions are no more born with us than the expressions themselves and that we acquire the ideas after first learning the terms by which they are expressed but   is not this to take for granted the thing to be proved there are no innate ideas for all ideas are acquired mr lock would laugh at his adversaries were they to make use of such an argument   if words are learned before ideas at least if that is always the case as mr lock understands it to be i would be glad to know how the first language could have been formed or how it could be possible to communicate to any one the meaning of a word altogether new to him a person who had no idea of order for example would be no more capable of understanding the word order than a man born blind could understand the word color  in paragraph    mr lock denies innate ideas because they are not found in children and idiots in whom we ought most to expect meeting with them i answer   those who admit innate ideas do not believe them more natural to the mind than its faculties and as the state and constitution of the body disturbs the faculties of idiots the same cause may hinder them from showing any signs of innate ideas   the fact is not strictly true even idiots and infants have the idea of their existence individuality identity etc  in the remainder of that paragraph mr lock diverts himself with the absurdity of those who believe the expressions of abstract maxims to be innate but the most determined scholastic never maintained any such opinion and he combats a chimera which is the work of his own fancy  i know not how it has happened that instead of a few general reflections which i intended i have sent you a long and tiresome criticism on some passages of a single chapter the remains of lassitude probably made it easier for me to follow and dispute with mr lock than to think and reason alone have patience and pardon me there are many remarks to make on the second chapter where he treats of innate practical principles but i will not tire you with that subject unless you desire it  our newspapers say that the king of prussia has beat the austrians and killed twenty thousand of their men with the loss of fifteen thousand of his own this was the object he had in view when he passed through leipsick if the news be true the war must become general and according to appearances it will be terrible but i much fear lest his prussian majesty meet with the fate of charles xii what are his resources for defense against the united strength of france and austria and perhaps of russia  i have the honor to be with the most perfect consideration yours etc  allamand  no iii m allamand a m gibbon bex le    octobre      monsieur je suis charm de lexactitude et de la penetration qui se disputent le terrein dans la derniere lettre que vous avez pris la peine de mecrire et comme vous monsieur je crois que la question touch a sa decision  vous avez sans doubt raison de dire que les propositions evidentes dont il sagit ne sont pas de simples idees mais des jugemens mais ayez aussi la complaisance de reconnoitre que m lock les alleguant en exemple didees qui passent pour innees et qui ne le sont pas selon lui sil y a ici de la meprise cest lui quil faut relever ladessus et non pas moi qui navois autre chose a fair qua refuter sa maniere de raisonner contre linneite de ces idees ou jugmens la dailleurs monsieur vous remarquerez sil vous plait que dans cette dispute il sagit en esset de savoir si certaines verites evidentes et communes et non pas seulement certaines idees simples sont innees ou non ceux qui affirment ne donnent guere pour exemple didees simples qui le soyent que celles de dieu de lunite et de lexistence les autres exemples sont pris de propositions completes que vous appellez jugemens  mais dites vous y aura til donc des jugemens innes le jugement est il autre chose quun act de nos facultes intellectuelles dans la comparaison des idees le jugement sur les verites evidentes nest il pas une simple vue de ces verites la un simple coup doeil que lesprit jette sur else jaccorde tout cela et de grace quest ce qu idee nest ce pas vue ou coup doeil si vous voulez ceux qui definissent lidee autrement ne seloignent ils pas visiblement du sens et de lintention du mot dire que les idees sont les especes des chooses imprimees dans lesprit comme limage de lobjet sensible tracee dans loeil nest ce pas jargonner plutot que definir or cest la fault quont fait tous les metaphysiciens et quoique m lock lait bien sentie il a mieux aim se facher contre eux et tirer contre les girouettes de la place que sappliquer a demeler ce galimatias que natil dit non seulement il ny a point didees innees dans le sens de ces messieurs mais il ny a point didees du tout dans ce sens la toute idee est un act une vue un coup doeil de lesprit des lors demander sil y a des idees innees cest demander sil y a certaines verites si evidentes et si communes que tout esprit non stupide puisse naturellement sans culture et sans maitre sans discussion sans raisonnement les reconnoitre dun coup doeil et souvent meme sans sappercevoir quon jette ce coup doeil laffirmative me paroit incontestable et selon moi le question est vuidee par la  maintenant prenez guard monsieur que cette maniere dentendre laffaire va au but des partisans des idees innees tout comme la leur et par la meme contredit m lock dans le sien car pourquoi voudroit on quil y eu des idees innees cest pour en opposer la certitude et levidence au doubt universel des sceptiques qui est ruin dun seul coup sil y a des verites dont la vue soit necessaire et naturelle a lhomme or vous sentez monsieur que je puis leur dire cela dans ma facon dexpliquer la chose tout aussi bien que les partisans ordinaires des idees innees dans la leur et voila ce qui semble incommoder un peu m lock qui sans se declarer pyrrhonien laisse appercevoir un peu trop de foible pour le pyrrhonisme et a beaucoup contribue a le nourrir dans ce siecle a force de vouloir marquer les bornes de nos connoissances ce qui etoit fort necessaire il a quelquefois tout mis en bornes  apres ces remarques generales sur le fond de la question il est peu necessaire de sarreter a quelques particulieres ou vous ne me croyez pas fond cependant vous me permettrez de vous fair observer sur celles que vous relevez   que dans ce   du chapter   il est bien vrai que m lock mele ces deux chooses etre actuellement dans lesprit sans que lesprit sen appercoive  et y etre sans quil sen soit jamais appercu  mais il est certain aussi qua la conclusion de ce il sen tient au premier incognito et done lieu a ma critique en sexprimant en ces terms je suis la traduction francoise nayant pas loriginal de sort ditil que soutenir quune chose soit dans lentendement et quelle nest pas concue par lentendement quelle est dans lesprit sans que lesprit lappercoive cest autant que si lon disoit quune chose est et nest pas dans lesprit ou dans lentendement nest il pas clair monsieur que ce grand philosophe ecrivant cela etoit dans lerreur ou la meprise de fait que je prends la liberte de lui reprocher cest que lesprit ne peut avoir aucune connoissance quil ne lappercoive actuellement je crois bien que si on lavoit dabord releve ladessus il auroit senti sa meprise mais il nen est pas moins vrai et quil y est tomb et quil sen fait un principe contre ses adversaires    vous voulez quon lui pass sa distinction enter les idees qui sont dans lesprit et celles qui sont dans la memoire a moi ne tienne pourvu que vous preniez le mot didee comme moi car en ce sens une idee est dans lesprit lorsque lesprit envisage actuellement la proposition qui est lobjet de son idee ou de son coup doeil et elle nest que dans la memoire lorsque lesprit ayant auparavant jette ce coup doeil sur elle en a plus de facilite a la reiterer et en le reiterant sent que ce nest pas la premiere fois quil envisage cette proposition la  mais si par idees vous entendez ces especes chimeriques supposees par les metaphysiciens et autant quil men souvient pas assez nettement congediees par m lock jen reviens sil vous plait a ma pretension quon ne sentend pas soi meme quand on distingue la memoire de lesprit  un violent mal de tete que jai apporte de notre venerable class ne me permet pas detendre davantage cette lettre et mempeche de la fair moins court et plus net je vous pry monsieur de lexcuser tell quelle est peut etre penetrant comme vous letes ne laisserez vous pas dy entrevoir dequoi

sols par jour il est de mauvaise humeur contre ce tout est bien mr allamand to mr gibbon bex october         sir i am delighted with your last letter equally distinguished by accuracy and penetration and with you sir i believe that the question approaches to its decision  you are right in saying that the selfevident propositions which i mentioned are not merely ideas but judgments yet you will have the goodness to observe that mr lock having given them as examples of ideas which pass for being innate but which he does not regard as such the mistake is chargeable on him and not on me who had nothing farther to do than to refute his manner of reasoning besides you will be pleased to remark that the real question is whether not only certain ideas but also certain common and selfevident propositions be innate the only examples produced of innate ideas are those of god unity and existence the other examples are of innate propositions which you call judgments  you ask whether it be possible that our judgments should be innate judgment being nothing else but the act of our intellectual faculties in comparing our ideas and our judgment concerning selfevident truths being merely the perception of those truths by a simple glance of the mind i grant all that but would ask what else is an idea but a glance of the mind those who define it otherwise widely depart from the original sense of the word and talk unintelligibly when they say that ideas are species that is appearances of things impressed on the mind as the images of corporeal objects are impressed on the eye all metaphysicians have committed this mistake and mr lock though sensible of it has chosen in his anger to direct his batteries against the weathercocks rather than against the building itself according to the meaning of these metaphysicians there are surely no innate ideas because in their sense of the word there are no ideas whatever an idea is merely an act or perception of the mind and the question concerning innate ideas is merely to determine whether certain truths be not so common and so evident that every mind not absolutely stupid must recognize them at a single glance without the assistance of any teacher and without the intervention of any discussion or reasoning and often without being sensible that this glance is cast on them the affirmative appears to me incontrovertible and the question thereby is solved  you will please to remark that this way of explaining the matter is as favorable to innate ideas and therefore as opposite to mr lockes doctrine as the unintelligible hypothesis above mentioned for what reason do we contend in favor of innate ideas to oppose evidence and certainty to universal skepticism whose cause is ruined by proving certain truths to be so necessary and so natural to man that they are universally recognized by a single glance this may be proved according to my meaning of the word idea as well as according to the sense in which this word is vulgarly taken and the proof would not have been very pleasing to mr lock who without professing himself a skeptic yet shows a leaning to the skeptical side and whose works have contributed much to the diffusion of skepticism in the present age his too eager desire of fixing the limits of human knowledge a thing highly necessary has made him leave nothing but limits  after these general observations on the main question it is not very necessary to descend to the particulars in which you think me mistaken yet you will permit me to answer your objections   it is true that mr lock   c   joins the two expressions being in the mind without being actually perceived by the mind and being in the mind without having ever been perceived by the mind but at the conclusion of the paragraph he lays himself open to my criticism by expressing himself as follows so that to be in the understanding and not to be understood to be in the mind and never to be perceived is all one as to say any thing is and is not in the mind or understanding it is clear sir that this great philosopher erred in writing this passage maintaining what i took the liberty to contradict that nothing could be in the understanding without being perceived to be there i doubt not that he would have corrected this mistake had it been pointed out to him but the certainly falls into it and employs it as a principle of reasoning against his adversaries    you think that we ought to admit his distinction between ideas in the mind and ideas in the memory i admit the distinction with all my heart provided you take the word idea in the same acceptance as i do in that sense an idea is in the mind when the mind actually considers the proposition which is the object of its idea that is of its glance or perception and an idea is in the memory when the mind having formerly cast that glance on it finds thereby a greater facility in recalling it remembering at the same time that it formerly was the object of its perception but if you understand by ideas these chimerical species the mere fictions of metaphysicians and as it seems to me not sufficiently disproved by mr lock i return to my assertion and maintain that the distinction is unintelligible between being in the mind and being in the memory  a violent headache which i brought with me from our venerable class hinders me from continuing this letter or rendering what i have already written shorter and more perspicuous i entreat you to excuse its imperfections your penetration will perhaps discern how all difficulties may be solved concerning innate practical principles mr lock treats this subject better than he does the others but in several parts he is somewhat puzzled  i rejoiced at the hopes of seeing you for a moment at vevay and was surprised at being disappointed if i rightly understand this word of your language it cannot be well translated into ours i met with mr pavillard only in the assembly  if the march of an hundred and twenty thousand russians is not a fable what must become of the king of prussia does it not appear to you that we are threatened with great revolutions i have long suspected a design of reducing the general system of europe to three great empires that of the french on the west of the rhine of austria on the east and of russia in the north yet we read of nothing of this kind in the revelation but let the world be divided as it may provided it be lawful for us to believe that whatever is is and that two contradictory propositions cannot both at the same time be true those three empires will be great only when measured on this earth viewed but from the moon they will be small enough and how far do philosophical eyes soar beyond that luminary  i have the honor to be with much consideration yours etc allamand  mr de n    writes to me that things go better and better now that his niece madame d is extremely ill and that  00000 men are ready to cut one anothers throats at the

cap    et  0 hoc esto nunc catone contentus vale et rem tuam ex voto gere  zurici helvetiorum ad d   martini episcopi professor breitinger to mr gibbon at lausanne october         though i am davus not oedipus i will give you my opinion concerning the difficulties in justin which you propose for my consideration    in the third chapter of his second book he says that asia was tributary fifteen centuries to the scythians and that ninus put an end to those contributions the number of years is so manifestly erroneous that it is astonishing such a reading should ever have been admitted into the text for it makes ninus later than sesostris by a period of fifteen hundred years orosius who abridged justin with the greatest fidelity speaks to the following purpose the scythians would have ravished the whole of egypt had they not been prevented by the marshes when they returned from that country they made a bloody conquest of asia and rendered it tributary having remained there fifteen restless years they at length returned home at the earnest entreaty of their wives who said that unless their husbands came home to them they would for the sake of having children cohabit with their neighbors orosius lib i c    there cannot be any doubt therefore that fifteen hundred has been substituted for fifteen you investigate very ingeniously the cause of the error but the emendation which you propose by changing per mill into permissa cannot be well founded if the number was expressed as is most probable by arithmetical marks in the ancient copies    in justin lib xii c   we read they the macedonians returned after beating the enemy with congratulations or thanksgivings into the same camp in this passage you seem to me needlessly to disturb the ancient reading you assume without proof that they did not venture to attack the cuphites orosius justins faithful interpreter declares the direct contrary when they came to the country of the chosides they fought with two hundred thousand of the enemys cavalry and having conquered them with much difficulty because they themselves were now worn out with years and fatigue and sunk in spirit they formed a camp more magnificent than usual to commemorate their exploit orosius lib iii c    they did not therefore return into their camp until they had combated and conquered the enemy justin himself gives us to understand as much when he says that alexander moved by such just prayers caused at the end of his victory a camp to be formed whose walls might inspire terror into the enemy if the macedonians therefore as you imagine had been frightened at the innumerable forces of the cuphites and therefore returned hastily into their camp i do not see why justin should say at the end of his victory inspire terror into the enemy or that they returned to their camp with thanksgivings it may here be remarked in opposition to sebisius emendation that the expression cum gratulatione if translated with thanksgivings will include the caesis hostiis  that is the sacrifice of thanks so that your alteration of caesis hostiis into omissis hostibus is equally inconsistent with historical truth and the words of justin    in justin lib xxiv c viii we read part of the mountain carried away by the earthquake overwhelmed the army of the gauls and its thick masses breaking in scattered pieces fell down with great force not without wounding the enemy you need not be offended with the harsh transposition of the word hostium which you think ought to be joined with confertissimi cunei as if that last word meant the military cunei or wedges of the gauls whereas it really means the thick masses detached from the rock or mountain which breaking into smaller fragments fell down and wounded the enemy that is the gauls there is no transposition therefore in the case the sentence flows in the most natural order and the confertissimi cunei ought not to be joined with hostium lest the ambiguity of the word cunei should make it be applied to the military cunei or wedges of men    in justin lib xxviii c   we read that the romans could not save their city from the gauls and when it was taken instead of defending it by the sword had ransomed it with money if this passage required or admitted emendation there is no correction i would adopt more willingly than yours which instead of captamque substitutes capitoliumque shefferus objects without reason that a city captam taken cannot properly be said defendi serro to be defended with the sword for the roman historians agree that their city when taken was defended though in a cowardly manner orosius among others says lib xi c    the gauls penetrated into the open city rome was now taken the rest of the youth were shut up and besieged in the citadel of the capitoline mount where they were a prey to hunger pestilence terror and despair you may perceive therefore that though the city was taken its defense was not entirely abandoned and if it had not been taken it needed not to have been ransomed it seems not to have occurred to you that your correction implies the capitol only to have been ransomed which is not historically true    in justin lib xxxi c   we read ambassadors were first sent by the roman senate to persuade antiochus king of syria that he should not make war on the cities of caelesyria which the egyptians had occupied in the former war and which were therefore subject to egypt using with him this argument that these cities belonged to a young prince their pupil who had been committed by his father to the protection of the romans this same author lib xxx c iii says m lepidus was sent into egypt to govern that kingdom with the title of tutor to the young king a second embassy was sent after antiochus had taken possession of these cities demanding that they should be restored and without making any mention of the pupil king merely on this ground that these cities belonged to the romans by the right of war justin lib xxxi c   what this right of war is in contradistinction both to war itself and to conquests made by war appears from the two following passages the first of which is part of quintus flamininuss speech to the tyrant nabis in livy lib xxxiv c    by what measures is the friendship between states violated principally by these two when you treat with hostility our allies and when you make alliance with our enemies are not you guilty of both since you through our ally have seized by arms and violence messene a city as much our ally as lacedemon itself and since you have entered into an alliance with philip our enemy the other passage is in florus lib iii c   the king mithridates did not consider asia as a country not belonging to him but as it had been formerly taken from him by violence he sought to recover it by the law of war i need not mention that the law of war in justin may have a reference to both the circumstances by which friendship between states is violated but principally to the attack made on the dominions of ptolemy an ally of the romans who desire him to be reinstated by antiochus in his possessions for the author immediately adds that when antiochus refused to comply war was denounced against him    in justin lib xxxi c   we read the senate therefore wrote to flamininus that if it seemed expedient to him as he had delivered macedon from philip so he should deliver greece from nabis the glory of flamininus the general in the macedonian war is sufficiently attested by the words of the senates decree in livy lib xxxiii c    the senate and roman people and l quintius the general having conquered king philip and the macedonians declare free and independent republics the corinthians etc florus lib ii c    says perseus succeeded his father philip and did not think it becoming the dignity of macedon that it should remain in subjection in consequence of being defeated in one war you ask whether quintius who conquered macedon can be said in any sense to have delivered it from philip although it appears that philip was really not deprived of that kingdom and whether if the roman general conquered nabis as he had already conquered philip he did not thereby free greece these difficulties are solved by justin lib xxx c   the fortune of the romans conquered the macedonians so that philip after his defeat having obtained peace from the consul flamininus preserved indeed the name of king but kept possession only of macedon having lost all those cities of greece which like scattered members of the macedonian kingdom lay beyond its ancient boundaries in the letters therefore of the roman senate to the consul flamininus marcedon signifies not the country strictly so called which alone was not taken from philip but that part of greece which lay beyond the original limits of macedon to which is opposed the rest of greece which was then harassed by nabis but which had never been subject to macedon hence the meaning of the senate appears to have been that quintius as he had delivered macedonia that is the part of greece belonging to macedon from philip so he should deliver the rest of greece from nabis who had actually made himself master nearly of the whole of that country  this is not merely a conjecture sage but truth as certain as the sibyls page november         those who apply themselves to criticism ought to be cautious in conjectural emendation and diligent in classical study that they may perceive what vast application this critical art requires and how rashly those behave who immediately alter a passage which they do not at first sight understand or which seems to them inconsistent with their rules of grammar or logic this rashness is justly reprehended by many and particularly by the illustrious burman in his valuable preface to phaedrus which as i have always made it the rule by which my own critical labors have been directed so i would warmly recommend it to all those who pursue the same walk of literature having made this preparatory observation i proceed to the difficulties in justin about which so much learning has been employed    the emendation of the manifestly corrupt passage in lib ii c      a corruption depending on numbers and therefore as natural as frequent which corrects the error by changing fifteen hundred into fifteen must be approved by all judicious critics the cause which introduced the faulty reading into the text is uncertain and the question that has been so industriously agitated concerning it appears to me more curious than useful since the error might have originated in a thousand different fources the corrupt reading runs thus asia was tributary to the scythians fifteen hundred years we agree that it should be corrected thus asia was tributary to the scythians fifteen years but in the corrupt text you think that obscure traces of the genuine reading may be discerned and imagine that per mill had crept into the text instead of permissa explaining the passage as if asia had been permitted to be tributary to the scythians for fifteen years i observed that this emendation for which i see not any necessity is rendered highly improbable because in ancient manuscripts the names of numbers are expressed not by words but by letters used as numeral marks and though they are sometimes expressed by words yet this is not frequent especially in works of history this assertion is confirmed by innumerable testimonies i shall be contented with referring to that of galen de antidot i  it is a subject indeed both of surprise and grief that this part of criticism which consists in ascertaining exactly the rules of numeral notation should not have met with due attention although thereby the rashness of wild conjecture would be greatly restrained and more certainty might be attained in determining the age and authenticity of manuscripts but let it be supposed that your correction were safe on this side yet it would be destroyed by the passage which you yourself quote from justin that sesostris being put to flight by the scythians left behind him his army and baggage the historian having observed in    that the scythians after returning from the pursuit of the king rendered asia which they had subdued tributary how is it possible that in    he should say that this happened not in consequence of their own military success but in consequence of the permission of sesostris we are not now inquiring what is historically true but what is justins report which must not be supposed inconsistent with itself    if we here consult arrian he tells us merely that alexander proceeded to the river hyphasis with a view to conquer the indians who lived beyond it but that the macedonians then perceiving there was no end to their labors refused to advance and finally prevailed on alexander through the earnest entreaty of coenus to prepare for his return since every thing seemed adverse to his farther progress then alexander erected twelve great altars as monuments of his conquests arrian says nothing about the cuphites the camp or the two hundred thousand horsemen who so much terrified the macedonians curtius lib ix c   and   relates that alexander when he came to the hyphasis discovered that the farther bank was inhabited by the gangaridae and pharrasii that their king with twenty thousand horse and two hundred thousand foot meant to obstruct his passage being furnished besides with two thousand chariots and three thousand elephants which last formed the most alarming part of his strength the macedonians then refused to follow the king farther and obtained through coenus entreaty that preparations should be made for their return home he subjoins alexander came forth on the third day and ordered twelve altars of square stone to be erected as a monument of his expedition and the fortifications of his camp to be enlarged and beds of a gigantic size to be constructed that by diffusing an air of vastness on every object around him he might excite the credulous wonder of posterity plutarch in his treatise concerning the fortune of alexander speaks to the same purpose by comparing these authors with justin the reader will perceive that he differs from them all in several essential circumstances and particularly in saying that alexander had two motives for enlarging the fortifications of his camp one of which regarded the enemy and the other had a relation to posterity moved by such just prayers he ordered a camp to be built more magnificent than usual as at the end of his victory that its fortifications might be an object of terror to the enemy and of admiration to posterity justin ibid    the other historians are totally silent as to what regards the enemy which is favorable to that reading of justin which on the faith of manuscripts stands in his text and extremely adverse to your emendation for the end of his victory must refer to some recent victory and not to his victories in general otherwise justin as you acknowledge would have said the end of his victories as in  0 above wearied not less by the number of his victories than by his toils as to alexanders second motive concerning which all other historians are silent that his fortifications might be an object of terror to the enemy there would not surely be any room for it on the supposition that he had determined to move his camp and leave the country without fighting a battle the cuphites could not be seized with alarm at seeing the monuments of the exploits of a man who had not ventured to engage with their army nor on that supposition would there be any mention of victory terror or sacrifices of thanks for that the word gratulatio refers to the solemn victims sacrificed in gratitude for success and frequently mentioned by arrian cannot be doubtful to those conversant with ancient writers besides the word omissis including the idea of something begun or neglected does not please me nor seem conformable with justins style your prolix discussion concerning the age design and character of orosius has but little connection with the present subject it is universally acknowledged that he so closely or rather superstitiously follows justins footsteps that he frequently expresses himself in the same words and phrases and it has long ago been proved by good critics that justins text such as it stood in the copy used by orosius may in innumerable places be restored by an attention to the latter writer he must be blind indeed who does not perceive that in the passage before us orosius must have copied justin whence could he otherwise have derived the name chosidum or cuphitum which is not mentioned by any other historian and if that be the case orosius must have found in his original not that the enemy were omitted but that they were beat in which sense justin ought to be interpreted    i grant that a town taken by a siege cannot be said to be defended by its own walls but may it not be defended by troops in the citadel when the enemy are obliged to raise the siege of the citadel the town may thereby be delivered from all danger the expression at least might be used by an author fond of antithesis and amplification    your new conjecture concerning the towns of syria which the romans acquired by the law of war would solve the difficulty were not that conjecture built on an anachronism for the league entered into with the ambassadors of antiochus who came to crave peace which you find in livy lib xxxviii c    was not prior but subsequent to antiochuss expedition into egypt mentioned in justin lib xxxi c   you may consider whether the following words of livy do not refer to this subject after this quintius and his ten lieutenants received the ambassadors of kings nations and cities those of king antiochus were first introduced they said the same things as formerly when at rome without gaining belief and they were now told not in the ambiguous language which the romans had used before the defeat of philip and while their own fortune was still doubtful but in express terms that antiochus must evacuate all the cities of asia which had belonged either to philip or to ptolemy livy lib xxxiii c    with which compare c    and  0 be satisfied with this authority farewell and prosper  zurich   th november no v m breitinger a m gibbon

studies yet it is not without pleasure that at the invitation of my friends i occasionally descend into the pleasing fields of literature never losing an opportunity to stimulate the diligence of those who delight in such pursuits and to serve as a whetstone to others though myself unfit for carving nothing therefore could have been more agreeable to my wish than to be called back to those studies formerly my delight by you anonymously at first but now in open war i cannot but commend your sagacity and genius which require rather the rein than the spur and i earnestly wish that you were accompanied in this literary walk by a scholar of more cultivated taste and more copious erudition than myself  you employ many arguments in defending your emendation of justin lib xii c      where instead of the enemy being bear you substitute the enemy being omitted i formerly gave you my reasons for rejecting this emendation and shall not repeat them here nor enter into a particular discussion of the answers which you make to my objections thus much only in general i will observe that the reading in the text which is approved by the consenting authority of the manuscripts must be acknowledged to contain a very natural meaning conveyed in good latin and in justins style this reading indeed makes mention of a battle with the cuphites concerning which the other historians of alexander are silent but ought this silence to make us alter justins text especially as none of those historians deny such a battle to have happened if such license be indulged to critics that they may expunge or alter the words of an historiam because he is the sole relater of a particular event we shall leave few materials for authentic history two reasons strongly militate against your correction the first that if it be admitted there will no longer be any consistency in justins narrative and the whole clause must be expunged which mentions the return of the macedonians into their camp which if they did not mean to fight it was not necessary for them to leave the second reason is that the phrase omittere hosts though frequently used by justin is never that i know applied by him in the sense which you give to it the generals entitled to direct military measures are said omittere hosts but never the soldiers whose duty it is to obey orders and who in the passage under consideration request that they may not be ordered to renew the engagement with the enemy to this may be added that wherever this phrase omissis hostibus occurs in justin it denotes not an end but only a change of the war turn to the passage which you formerly referred to lib xxvii c     they left off fighting against their foreign enemy and made war on each other to which you will find a parallel in lib xxix c     by this oration he prevailed with philip to leave off fighting against the etolians and to make war on the romans but it is sufficient that orosius read caesis hostibus in the copies of justin which he made use of if by saying omissis hostibus orosius confirmed your conjecture the reading in the text would be doubtful indeed  i have nothing farther to add to my observations concerning the cities of syria which the romans acquired by the right of war  that we may not harp on the old string but have new matter for our friendly contest you raise a difficulty concerning the first consulship of julius caesar which happened on the first of january in the six hundred and ninetyfifth year of rome and in the fortyfirst of his age although by the laws ascertaining the age of candidates no person was entitled to crave that honor before his fortythird year but this law which was proposed by villius appears not any more than other laws appertaining to the same object to have been of perpetual authority as we learn both from the roman historians and from the consular fasti livy lib viii c   says that in the consulship of c marius rutilus and q servilius ahala it was provided by a law of the people that no person should bear the same magistracy twice in the space of ten years but this law seems either not to have been confirmed or not to have remained in force for we afterward find both in the falti and in livy that t manlius torquatus was a second time consul in the space of four years m valerius corvus in eight and l papirius crassus in six l papirius cursor was four times consul in eight years which things are inconsistent with this law to this subject may be referred what dio cassius says concerning another law of the same kind in his fortieth book sect    pompey restored the law of the comitia which prohibited any person from being elected into any office of magistracy in his absence a law which had fallen into total disuse and confirmed another which had been a short time before enacted by the senate forbidding any man who had been a magistrate in the city to command in any foreign province before the expiration of five years yet pompey who had just past these laws was not ashamed to accept his command in spain for five years longer and to grant by the same decree to caesar whose friends impatiently brooked such regulations the permission of being candidate for the consulship in his absence etc that the law proposed by villius was not uniformly observed appears from ciceros oration against rullus where the orator boasts that he was the first man not graced by ancient nobilty who had obtained the consulship in the year that he was entitled to solicit it but this passage does not inform us what was the force of villiuss law when the candidates were patricians of ancient family or men of consular dignity dolabella certainly after caesars murder seized the consulship when only twentyfive years old as we are informed by appian on which subject dio cassius lib xliv    says that dolabella intruded himself into the consulship though in nowise belonging to him and suetone insinuates that julius obtained something to which he was not by law entitled as the comitia were already proclaimed his demand could not be attended to unless he entered the city as a private person and many opposing his being indulged with any favor to which he was not legally entitled he chose to postpone his claim to a triumph lest he should be excluded from the consulship sueton lib i c    nearly to the same purpose anthony in caesars funeral oration in the fortyfourth book of dio cassius says for this reason his success in spain you granted to him a triumph and immediately appointed

deferring his claim to a triumph he obtained the consulship though a year younger than the age required for holding that office had the romans intended to enforce against him the villian law there

mais parmi un assez grand nombre de personnages du siecle dauguste qui portoient ce nom je voudrois quon maidat a trouver celui sur qui les soupcons peuvent tomber avec quelque vraisemblance    vous savez combein les critiques se sont donnes de peine pour rechercher le vrai but quavoit horace dans la troisieme ode du troisieme livre la grandeur des idees et la noblesse des expressions y font

apres avoir admire cette ode par parties on ne peut gueres sempecher den condamner lensemble taneguy le fevre lavoit expliquee par un systeme que m dacier trouve meriter autant deloges que lode elle meme et qui en effet me paroit des plus jolis vous savez quil le fond sur la crainte quil prete au peuple romain de voir transferer a ilium le siege de lempire et quil suppose quhorace composa cette ode dans la vue de detourner auguste de ce dessein en lui rappellant tout la part que les dieux avoient eu a la destruction de cette ville et combien le mortel qui oseroit la rebatir sexposeroit a tout le courroux de ces memes dieux le peuple pouvoit dautant plus facilement supposer ce dessein a ce prince que son pere adoptif en avoit ete soupcconne sueton l i c     mais je doubt que ce fysteme puisse se soutenir et on ne sauroit jamais prouver ces craintes pretendues du peuple romain qui son memes sans vraisemblance auguste se distingua toujours par les soins particuliers quil donna a la ville de rome qui devoient rassurer le peuple contre toutes les craintes dune pareille espece on peut en voir le detail dans la vie dauguste par suetone c        0 je nen marquerai que deux il engagea

fevre jen suis fache et je ne serai tout a fait content que lorsque vous maurez fourni une autre explication de cette ode plus solid sans doubt et qui en applanira egalement les difficultes    antiochus roi de syrie avoit pris plusieurs villes de la coelesyrie et de la palestine au jeune ptolemee alors sous la tutelle des romans ceux ci prennent la defense de leur eleve et ordonnent au roi

le peuple romain avoit acquises par le droit de la guerre civitates jure belli factas populi romani ce sont la les terms de justin justin l xxx c    qui nous jettent dans une difficulte embarassante on ne concoit pas comment les romans pouvoient avoir acquis des villes dans la syrie et dans legypte puisque bien loin dy avoir fait des conquetes ils ne porterent leurs arms en asie que plusieurs

ne parle nulle part de ce droit de la guerre en virtue duquel les romans les demandoient le savant m breitinger professeur en langue grec a zurich a qui jai communique cette difficulte apres avoir tente en vain de la resoudre a ete oblige ensin de la laisser sans explication  mais  nil desperandum teucro duce et auspice teucro   un different que scaliger et isaac vossius ont eu ensemble sur la veritable epoque de la mort du poet catulle a fait beaucoup de bruit dans la republique des lettres je nai point eu en main les pieces du process savoir les editions de catulle de ces deux hommes celebres mais bail bail dictionnaire critique art catulle nous a done un extrait fort detaille de leur dispute y ajoutant ses propres reflexiens je suis fache de ne pouvoir pas remonter aux sources mais dans la necessite de me servir de rapporteur je nen connois point de meilleur que bail  quoique deux habiles litterateurs se soient exerces sur cette question je suis bien loin de la regarder comme parfaitement eclaircie vossius me paroit avoir trop avance le mort du poet scaliger la certainement trop reculee catulle ne mourut pas bien surement a u c     mais il ne vecut pas non plus jusquaux jeux seculaires dauguste a u c     prouvons ce que nous avons avance et cherchons lepoque en question qui doit se trouver enter ces deux annees  catulle parle de la grande bretagne et de ses habitans vid catull carm xi etc  or caesar fut le premier qui fit connoitre cette isle aux romans tacit in vit agricol c     et caesar y fit sa premiere expedition en     caesar comm l iv dion hist l xxxix p     aussi bien catulle parle til du second consulat de pompee qui tomb sur la meme annee catull carm cxi il vivoit meme encore en  0  puisquil parle aussi du consulat de vatinius idem lii  je ne veux pas me servir des argumens de scaliger pour prouver quil fut spectateur des triomphes de caesar parceque je ne les crois pas de bon alloi je me dispenserai dexaminer en detail si les paroles paterna prima lancinata sunt bona etc idem xxvii ver    conviennent mieux aux premieres victoires de caesar quaux dernieres parceque je crois quil ny est question ni des unes ni des autres il ny a qua lire cette epigramme avec quelque attention pour voir que catulle saddresse toujours a caesar dans la second person  cinoede romule haec videbis et feres es impudicus et vorax et helluo pendantque mamurra y paroit toujours dans la troisieme person ce qui est le cas dans les lignes  parum expatravit an parvum helluatus est paterna prima lancinata sunt bona il ny est donc nullement question des dissipations de caesar mais de celle de mamurra et toutes les consequences quon en peut tirer par rapport aux triomphes de celui la sont illegitimes cependant si lon avoit la curiosite de rechercher lepoque precise de la composition de cette epigramme un passage de ciceron nous conduiroit a la fixer verse lan  0  car quoiquen dise bail on ne peut gueres entendre ce passage que dune piece satyrique faite contre mamurra aussi bien le savant dr middleton a til embrasse cette opinion il est inutile de dire que catulle nauroit jamais ose composer cette epigramme contre caesar alors tout puissant le clemence de caesar envers ses ennemis etoit assez connue la facon meme dont les anciens parlent de la moderation dont caesar usa envers le satyrique semble supposer quil avoit alors la puissance en main puisquauparavant sa clemence auroit eu peu de merit tacit annal l iv c    qui en parle la fait considerer sur le meme pied que celle de bibalculus or on ne peut pas douter quauguste ne fut souverain alors   dun autre cote catulle ne vecut pas jusquaux jeux seculaires dauguste puisquil mourut avaunt tibulle ovide dans lelegie quil sit expres sur la mort de ce dernier met catulle parmi les poets que son ami devoit recontrer a sa descente dans les champs elysees  si tamen a nobis aliquid nisi nomen et umbra restat in elysia valle tibullus erit obvius huic venias hedera juvenilia cinctus tempora cum calvo docte catulle tuo ovid eleg l iii    mais dans quel tems tibulle mourut il une petite epigramme de domitius marius nous lapprend le meme jour ou du moins la meme annee que virgile  te quoque virgilio comitem non aequa tibulle mors juvenem campos misit ad elysios v tibull carm l iv c     or person nignore que virgile mourut le    septembre     donat in vit virgil  il est donc clair que catulle deja mort dans ce tems la ne vit point les jeux seculaires qui ne se celebrerent quen      avancons plus loin et disons que catulle etoit deja mort avaunt     je me fond sur le temoignage dun historien contemporain ami de ciceron sueton l i c    voss de hist latin l i c    et de catulle lui meme catull carm i  en un mot de cornelius nepos il faut le developper ce temoignage dans la vie datticus que cet ecrivain nous a laissee parlant dun certain l julius calidius a qui atticus rendit de grands services il ajoute pour le fair mieux connoitre quem post lucretii catullique mortem multo clegantissimum poetam nostram tulisse aetatem vere videor posse contendere cornel nepos in vit attici c     catulle etoit donc mort lorsque nepos ecrivit ce passage mais ne pourroit on pas fixer le tems de sa composition tres facilement de vingt deux chapitres qui composent cette vie datticus dix huit furent publies de son vivant hactenus attico vivo haec a nobis edita sunt idem c    le passage ou il est parle de la mort de catulle se trouve dans le douzieme chapitre dou il sensuit que catulle mourut avaunt atticus mais celui ci finit sa vie sous le consulat de cn domitius et de c sosius idem o     si lon vouloit pousser lexactitude encore plus loin et quon eut envy de determiner lannee precise de la mort de notre poet on ne se tromperoit pas de beaucoup en prenant lannee moyenne enter a u c  0  et     ce qui nous donnera     epoque qui quadre fort bien avec tout ce que nous en savons dailleurs  le seul argument de scaliger qui pourroit embarrasser est celui quil tire du poem seculaire que catulle doit avoir compose la conjecture de vossius quon celebra des jeux au commencement du vii siecle de rome nest pas soutenable je doubt que celle de bail vaille mieux le commencement de ce siecle etoit marque par tant de desordres on negligeoit tellement les anciennes ceremoines sueton l ii c     quil ny pas dapparence quon ait concu le dessein de celebrer de pareils jeux ni que le peuple sy attendit mais quel besoin de supposer que ce poem avoit ete compose pour les seculaires nest il pas bien plus naturel de le croire destine pour la fete de diane qui se celebroit tous les ans au mois daout bentley avoit deja fait cette conjecture bentl in praefat edit horatian  on peut la cofirmer par la comparaison du poem seculaire dhorace avec ce morceau de catulle dans celui ci les garcons et les filles ne font quun choeur pour saddresser en commun a diane  dianae sumus in fide puellae et pueri integri catull carm xxxiv ver    au lieu que dans horace les garcons saddressent a apollon les silles a diane  supplices audi pueros apollo siderum regina bicornis audi luna puellas horat carm secular ver     cette distinction leur avoit ete

gibbon to mr gesner sir among the romans that generous people who had so many institutions worthy of being admired and imitated the most respectable old lawyers whose long labors had rendered them the oracles of the bar did not think their time useless to the community when it was employed in forming the talents of youth and in providing for themselves worthy successors this excellent custom ought to be adopted and extended to other sciences whoever is acquainted with your reputation and your works will not deny you the title of one of the most learned men of the age and i hope that my foolish presumption does not deceive me when i ascribe to myself some natural aptitude for succeeding in the pursuits of literature your correspondence would be highly useful to me on this ground only i request it in the hope that it will not be refused i proceed to beg your explanation of some difficulties that i have met with and your opinion of some conjectures that have occurred to my mind    who was that piso the father to whom horace addresses his art of poetry mr dacier supposes him to have been the high priest who obtained a triumph for his exploits in thrace and who died prefect of the city in the seven hundred and eightyfifth year of rome tacit annal vi c  0 flor hist romans l iv c    t live epitom l c  but that could not be the man for horaces art of poetry was written before the year seven hundred and thirtyfour since it makes mention of virgil who died that year in terms which show that he was still alive horat art poet v     and in another part of the poem ibid v      horace addresses the eldest of pisos sons as a young man of cultivated talents which implies that he was not less than eighteen or twenty years of age but l piso the high priest could not surely have a son so old he himself died at the age of fourscore tacit ubi supra  in the seven hundred and eightyfifth year of rome he was born then in seven hundred and five and was not above thirty when the art of poetry was written it is clear therefore that he is not the person to whom horace writes but among the number of other men who bore that name i wish that you would help me to discover the piso to whom that poem was most probably addressed    you know how much trouble it has cost the critics to find out horaces true design in the third ode of his third book this masterly performance is distinguished by greatness of thought and dignity of expression but we are surprised and grieved to find that the end does not correspond with the beginning and that junos speech is totally unconnected with what precedes or follows it so that after admiring the detached parts of this ode we are forced to condemn it as a whole taneguy le fevre explained it by a conjecture which dacier thinks deserving of as high encomiums as the ode itself and which is doubtless very ingenious you know that his explanation turns on the supposed dread of the romans lest the seat of their empire should be removed to troy and that he fancies the ode to have been written with a view to divert augustus from such a design by showing him how earnestly the gods had cooperated toward the destruction of troy and how much their refentment would be provoked by an attempt to rebuild that illfated city the people might the more naturally suspect augustus of such an intention because it was thought to have been entertained by his adoptive father sueton l i c     but this conjecture i fear will not bear examination it is impossible to prove those pretended fears of the romans which are rendered highly improbable when we consider that augustus was remarkable for his affectionate partiality toward rome as may be seen in his life by suetonius c        0 i shall mention but two examples of it he encouraged almost all the great men of rome to adorn the city by superb edifices vell paterculus l ii c     and himself erected a temple to mars the avenger where the senate was ordered to assemble during its deliberations concerning wars and triumphs sueton l ii c     these are not the actions of a man who wished to found a new capital the example of his uncle is not applicable that project was formed by him toward the end of his life when he was intoxicated by prosperity and engaged in a thousand wild enterprises which the prudence of augustus carefully avoided the cautious firmness with which the latter prince always refused the office of dictator confirms my remark sueton l ii c    vell patercul l ii c     such are the reasons which hinder me from acquiescing in le fevres explanation i am sorry for it and will not be easy till you supply me with another more solidly founded and equally well fitted to remove all difficulties    antiochus king of syria had taken possession of several cities in coelesyria and judaea belonging to young ptolemy then under the protection of the romans that people undertake the defense of their pupil and order antiochus to restore his towns he despises their orders and keeps those towns in his possession in consequence of which the romans send to him a second embassy which without making any mention of young ptolemys pretensions claim those towns as belonging to the romans by the right of war these are justins words justin l xxx c    which present us with a very perplexing difficulty because we do not perceive how the romans could have acquired those places by the right of war since they were so far from having made conquests in asia then that they did not carry their arms into that country till a later era a treaty indeed subsisted between them and the kings of egypt tit live epitom l iv eutrop l ii valor maxim l iv c    but it was a treaty merely of friendship and alliance neither preceded nor followed by any war i thought that an examination of the other historians who relate the same transactions might throw light on this obscure passage of justin but livy who mentions several times tit live l xxxiii c        0 the negociations by which the romans endeavored to recover for ptolemy the places taken from him by antiochus is altogether silent with regard to this right of war in virtue of which they were demanded i acquainted the learned mr breitinger professor of greek at zurich with my difficulty on this subject which after attempting in vain to resolve he was obliged to leave unexplained but  nil desperandum teucro duce et auspice teucro   a difference of opinion between scaliger and isaac vossius concerning the time of catullus death made great noise in the republic of letters i have not at hand the original arguments of those learned men which are contained in their respective editions of catullus but bail bail dictionnaire critique art catulle has given us a particular account of their dispute with his own reflections on the subject i am sorry that i cannot draw from the fountain head but bayles accuracy as a compiler will not be disputed  notwithstanding the labors of these great scholars i am far from thinking the question decided vossius seems to me to place catullus death too early and scaliger certainly fixes it at too late an era that poet surely did not die in the year of the city six hundred and ninetysix but neither did he live to see the secular games of augustus celebrated in seven hundred and thirtysix let us prove these assertions and endeavor to find out the true era in question which must have been at an intermediate time between the years just mentioned  catullus speaks of great britain and its inhabitants vid catull carm xi etc  with which caesar first made the romans acquainted tacit in vit agricol c     by his expedition thither in the year of rome six hundred and ninetyeight caesar comm l iv dion hist l xxxix p      catullus also mentions the second consulship of pompey which happened on that same year catull carm cxi  he lived so late as the year seven hundred and six since he speaks of the consulship of vatinius idem lii  i will not make use of scaligers arguments to prove that the poet witnessed caesars triumphs because i do not believe them wellfounded i will not particularly examine whether the words paterna prima lancinata sunt bona idem xxvii ver     best apply to the first or last victories of caesar because i do not believe them to have any reference to the one or the other we need only to read the epigram attentively to perceive that catullus always addresses caesar in the second person and mamurra in the third  the poet alludes therefore not to caesars dissipation but to that of mamurra and all the consequences deduced from his applying his words to the former are built on a false hypothesis were we curious to ascertain exactly the date of this epigram a passage of cicero would lead us to fix it at the year  0  for notwithstanding bayles reasonings we cannot regard it in any other light than that of a satire written against mamurra an opinion embraced by the learned dr middleton there is no weight in the observation that catullus would not have ventured to write this epigram against caesar in the plenitude of his power caesars clemency toward his enemies is well known and the terms in which historians speak of his lenity shown to this satirist implies that he was then possessed of power to punish him otherwise his moderation would have been of little value tacitus annal l iv c    speaks of this affair as a parallel to that of bibalculus who satirised augustus when the latter was certainly invested with sovereign dominion   catullus on the other hand did not live to see the secular games celebrated by augustus since he died before tibullus ovid in an elegy written on the death of the latter places catullus among the poets whom his friend will meet with in the elysian fields ovid eleg l iii     but when did tibullus die a little epigram of domitius marius informs us that he died the same day or at least in the same year with virgil v tibull carm l iv c     now it is well known that virgil died the twentysecond of september seven hundred and thirtyfour donat in vit virgil  catullus then could not see the secular games which were not celebrated till seven hundred and thirtysix  we may go farther and affirm that catullus was dead before the year seven hundred and twentyone this is proved by a contemporary historian the friend of cicero sueton l i c    voss de hist latin l i c    and of catullus catull carm i  i mean cornelius nepos in his life of atticus speaking of a certain julius calidius to whom atticus had rendered very important services he distinguishes him as the most elegant poet of that age since the death of lucretius and catullus cornel nepos in vit attici c     the latter therefore was dead before nepos wrote this passage of which it is not difficult to fix the date nepos life of atticus consists of twentytwo chapters the first eighteen of which were as he tells us written while the subject of them still lived idem c     the passage mentioning the death of catullus is in the twelfth chapter from whence it follows that atticus survived catullus but atticus died during the consulship of cn domitius and c sosius idem o     did we wish to ascertain still more accurately the precise year of catullus death we should not be much mistaken in fixing it at the middle term between the years of rome seven hundred and six and seven hundred and twentyone which will give us the year seven hundred and fourteen which very well agrees with all other particulars known concerning him  the only argument adduced by scaliger that can occasion any difficulty is that catullus composed a secular poem vossius conjecture that the secular games were celebrated at the commencement of the seventh century of rome is altogether unwarranted that of bail i fear rests not on much better authority the beginning of that century was deformed by so many disorders and by such a marked neglect of ancient ceremonies sueton l ii c     that there is not any probability that such games should then have been either exhibited or expected but it is not necessary to suppose that catullus poem was written for the secular games it might have been intended merely for dianas festival which was celebrated yearly in the month of august as bentley conjectured bentl in praefat edit horatian  this is confirmed by comparing this poem with horaces carmen seculare in the former both the boys and girls form but one chorus which addresses itself to diana catull carm xxxiv ver    in horace the boys address themselves to apollo and the girls to diana horat carm secular ver     this distinction had been established by the oracle who commanded the celebration of the games v dissertat cl turretin de ludis secular p      but i have done this

were the pisos of whom horace speaks in such honorable terms in his art of poetry dacier and sanadon would probably most learned sir have obtained more credit with you had they cited the authority on which their opinion rests and independently of which it seems no better than a guess which a slight argument is sufficient to overturn this authority is that of porphyrio an ancient writer who treats of the names mentioned in horace and who here perhaps copies from some author more ancient than himself in his corrected edition porphyrio says horaces work entitled the art of poetry is addressed to l piso who was afterward governor of rome for piso was himself a poet and a patron of literary pursuits but chronology you say does not warrant this explanation it does for tacitus tells us in his annals lib vi c  0 that piso died u c     at the age of eighty he held his office twenty years and therefore entered on it u c     before which period horace must have sent to him the art of poetry which i suspect once stood at the third epistle of the second book because porphyrio says who was afterward governor of rome let us suppose that pisos son was born when the father was thirty years old and that the son was sixteen when horace addressed him o major juvenum the art of poetry will then have been written in the fiftysecond year of horaces age which well agrees with bentleys computation a subject which i remember to have examined and approved when about the same time of life i published my edition of horace if we think sixteen years too young for the praises bestowed by the poet we may add to them five or even ten years more but to this mode of reckoning it is objected that virgil was alive when horace wrote his art of poetry and as the latter died in the year of rome seven hundred and thirtyfive piso who was then but thirty years old himself could not have a son above ten or twelve at the utmost but some critics do not disapprove of the application of juvenis to a boy of ten years and of a forward genius grotius and others were poets at that age and the roman courtiers would naturally i think be prodigal in using the term juvenis after cicero gave so much offense by applying the term puer to augustus  but i see not any convincing argument to prove that virgil was alive when the art of poetry was written for in the passage alluded to horace does not contrast living poets with those that were dead but ancient poets with the modern and according to the critics whom he mentions not death alone but the being dead a certain number of years was necessary for the attainment of poetical same  est vetus atque probus centum qui perficit annos see the first epistle of the second book   concerning the third ode of the third book i formerly gave my opinion in the observations accompanying my edition which as you have not seen them i shall here repeat and explain augustus sometimes represented in sport the suppers of the gods we know from suetone lib ii c  0 that he was blamed for his imitation of the supper of the twelve gods which used to take place in the capitol where pallets were spread for them of which we see an example in livy lib xxii c  0 is it not possible that horace either with or without the orders of augustus might think proper to write verses adapted to such a representation might he not endeavor to remove the blame attached to it by exhibiting an example in which it was not only innocent but conformable with the institutions and inclinations of the romans at the same time his ode would be a compliment to the julian family which had long boasted its descent from aeneas and iulus for entering on this subject the poet ingeniously prepares the way by showing that men had attained divinity through justice and fortitude augustus is entitled to our admiration and praise and as he sung in another ode written nearly about the same time presens divus habebitur being not less worthy of divinity than bacchus and romulus the latter of whom was not without difficulty admitted to that honor till juno made her most pleasing and acceptable speech in the council of the gods this speech is of the same purport with that in the aeneid lib xii v     and seq and might have been pronounced with propriety without supposing that augustus ever seriously thought of changing the seat of his empire that prince also must have been pleased with an attempt to persuade the people that he condemned a design said to have been entertained by julius caesar but which was so much detested by the romans and would if carried into execution have been so calamitous to rome the speech indeed is longer and more pathetic than might be expected from the beginning of the ode but he must be ignorant of the nature of lyric poetry as illustrated in the writings of the ancients who finds fault with the length of this real or apparent digression    the knot must be hard indeed which not only baffles the exertions of a learned and ingenious youth but resists the strength of breitinger a veteran in the literary field whose name i never pronounce but with the highest respect how could roman ambassadors require that the cities taken by antiochus in asia should be restored according to the law of war to rome when the senate shortly before had declared those cities to belong to its pupil ptolemy or how could the romans claim those cities by the law of war when scipio a few years afterward was the first roman general that passed into asia with an army livy lib xxxvii the knot however may be untied without having recourse to alexanders sword provided we follow the series of those transactions as related by justin and livy the latter historian lib xxxi c    relates that philips courage was increased by his league with antiochus king of syria with whom as soon as he learned ptolemys death he purposed according to the tenor of that agreement dividing the spoils of egypt justin again lib xxx c   tells us that the alexandrians sent ambassadors to rome requesting the senate to defend the cause of their pupil threatened with the partition of his dominions in consequence of a treaty for that purpose between philip and antiochus this treaty indeed soon began to be carried into effect for according to livy lib xxxii c    antiochus while his ally was occupied in the war with rome conquered all the cities belonging to ptolemy in coelesyria purposing next to invade the coast of caria and cilicia and at the same time to assist philip with a fleet and army meanwhile philip is conquered by the roman consul quintius who then openly declared to antiochus ambassadors that their master must evacuate supply according to the law of war all those cities to which either philip or ptolemy had any claims livy lib xxxiii c    justins narrative therefore though obscured by brevity is yet consistent with truth  do you not repent learned sir the having written to an indolent old man who could delay two months sending an answer to a letter so obliging and so honorable to himself i will not throw the blame on my advanced age though i begin to feel my former powers of exertion somewhat slacken and abate under the weight of sixtyseven years at this time of life most old men are indulged with a diminution of labor whereas i on the contrary am continually burdened with an increase of occupations and cares i belong to several academies particularly that of berlin and this here of gottingen which last i am appointed to direct six months in the year i also preside weekly in the german society of this place and frequently correspond with the latin society of jena i am entrusted with the care of the public library consisting at least of fifty thousand volumes with the inspection of the colleges in his majestys german dominions and with the superintendance of about twenty youths who are educated at the public expense the task also falls on me of writing whatever is inserted in the archives of the university in the name of the rector and senate and it is my duty to give daily three four and sometimes more prelections to these public offices must be added the avocations of private company and of a very extensive correspondence besides i have always some work in hand which requires nicer attention to render it worthy of the public eye at present i am employed about an edition of claudian which god willing shall be published in the course of this summer thus circumstanced i confess that i laid aside your letter which seemed as if it would require more pains to answer than were afterward found necessary until i should enjoy a few hours of uninterrupted leisure this opportunity occurred only yesterday of which you see i made use  it remains that i request you to receive favorably this attempt and if it does not fully answer your expectation to ascribe the failure to any other cause rather than my want of inclination to oblige you brevity was my aim because it seemed unnecessary to repeat what you had so well said on the subject i write in latin a language familiar to me lest i should commit a mistake similar to that of which you though wellskilled in french are guilty when you say un different que scaliger and is vossius ont eu ensemble from which words it might be concluded that a difference had subsisted between these learned men of whom the one died nine years before the other was born i remain sincerely with much consideration etc  matthew gesner gottingen   th february        as to the question concerning the age of catullus i am entirely of your opinion and lest you should think that i agree with you merely because through laziness i am unwilling to enter into an argument i shall transcribe the words of a thesis which i defended in my youth forty years ago p    weimar      concerning the secular years and games of the romans there is nothing in the poem which might not have been said had it been written for any other festival in honor of diana etc i assure you that within this hour i have compared what is said in your learned dissertation with is vossius remarks on catullus edit       to p    and seq and those of jos scaliger whom he refutes i also examined the passage of cicero concerning mamurra with middletons observations on it and having examined and well weighed the whole matter i pronounce sentence most excellent gibbon clearly in your favor  p s your letters will find me without any farther direction than that of my name and place of abode or addressed to mr professor gesner counselor of the court of his britannic majesty gottingen but if you wish to see my titles expanded at full length after the german fashion here they are copied from the french and german titlebook printed at nordhausen       vo fifth edition p     to mr gesner counselor of the court of his britannic majesty professor in the university of gottingen inspector general of the schools of the electorate of hanover librarian of the university director of the philological seminary president of the royal society of german eloquence member of the royal society of sciences at gottingen etc there is not one of these titles but deprives me of some part of my time the only reason for which i here subjoin them which i shall think you believe if your letter to me has as short a direction as possible    no viii mr gibbon a m gesner monsieur la multitude de

virgile prouvent que ce poet fut encore vivant et que lopposition est plutot des anciens aux modernes que des mots aux vivans jai relu lendroit mais cette nouvelle lecture et les reflections aux quelles elle a done lieu nont fait que me confirmer dans ma premiere opinion horace trouvoit la langue latin pauvre et trop sterile pour exprimer les idees abstraites que les compagnons de romulus les patres et les brigands ne connoissoient point plusieurs de ses compatriotes lui avoient trouve le meme defaut horace souhaite de lenrichir il propose pour cet effet aux virgile aux varius de travailler dans ce dessein et demprunter du grec quantite de terms energiques dont ils avoient besoin il leur offer son secours cest un projet quil form et non une chose deja faite quil justify par consequent lavenir quil envisage ne peut regarder que ceux dentre les ecrivains qui vivoient encore par consequent lart poetique fut compose avaunt lan     le point de vue sous lequel je considere ce

gesner sir the multitude of your employments affords at once the proof of your own merit of the justice done to it by the public of my presumption and of your goodness how enviable is the lot of that small number of superior minds whose talents are equally adapted to promote the purposes either of pleasure or utility the discernment surely of those princes is worthy of much applause who having ventured to dissipate the clouds of envy calumny and frivolity that usually surround thrones render to the truly great men among their subjects a justice which had been long done to them by the impartial public and reward their talents by affording them new opportunities to display them these are but a small part of the reflections occasioned by your letter and which were i to consult my inclination only would extend to a great length but my reason tells me that i must be contented with assuring you that you have filled with gratitude a man who will always be proud of being called your scholar i go shortly to england where perhaps i may find an opportunity of proving to you the sincerity of my sentiments at least of rendering my correspondence less tiresome my residence in london will give me a sort of local merit i will send you early intelligence of the labors and discoveries of our learned men whose example i am unable to imitate and will expect to learn in return what is so proper an object of curiosity the occupations and studies of your colleagues and disciples at gottingen at my return to london i propose to myself a new pleasure in collecting all your works which i will make it my first business to procure and for assisting me in this matter must request that you would give me the titles of all the curious pieces with which you have enriched the republic of letters my ignorance of many of them causes both joy and shame it can only be excused in consideration of my youth and the place from which this letter is dated  if i venture to propose some new doubts it is because you know better than any one that absolute submission is due only to reason either real or apparent you will believe that my only motive for discussing your lessons is to render myself worthy of them  non ita certandi cupidus quam propter amorem lucret de rer nature l iii ver   et seq  after this apology i must confess that i have still some remaining doubts concerning the piso to whom horace addresses his art of poetry you think that the manner in which that poet speaks of virgil does not prove the latter to be still alive because horace does not oppose the dead to the living but the ancients to the moderns i examined the passage again and that new perusal excited reflections which confirmed me more strongly in my former opinion horace thought the latin tongue too poor and barren and deficient in words expressive of abstract ideas which were unknown to romulus companions consisting of shepherds and robbers this imperfection had been remarked by others horace wishing to remedy it proposes to the virgils and variuses to cooperate with him in this design by borrowing from the greek many energetic terms and phrases which were wanting in latin he does not justify a thing already done but proposes a new enterprise the futurity which he looks to can only have a reference to authors still alive the art of poetry was therefore written before the year of rome seven hundred and thirtyfive this explanation agrees so well with the poets thought that his opposition between the dead and living poets concludes with one of the justest and liveliest images that i ever remember to have met with    licuit semperque licebit signatum praesenti nota producere nomen horat de art poet ver     the licuit has a reference to the terences and the ceciliuses who were long dead the licebit in the future to the variuses and virgils who were still alive and might avail themselves of the maxim this explanation is the more probable because virgil appears in his works to value himself rather on reviving old words than on borrowing new ones from the greek i doubt whether a single passage can be pointed out in which he followed horaces advice   you say that pisos eldest son might be ten years old when the art of poetry was published an age at which grotius wrote verses grotius did so but how few boys of that age have not only the fire to write but the judgment to criticize poetry it is not likely that piso the father should have children at the age of twenty you well know the paucity of marriages under augustus which rendered the conjugal felicity of germanicus an example so much admired suet l ii c     pride poverty tacit annal ii c     and debauchery deterred the roman nobles from marriage especially amidst the civil wars which during pisos youth desolated the earth augustus laws on that subject only prove the greatness of the evil dion hist romans l lvi p   0  and piso was thirty years old before the first of those laws was enacted horat carm secular v    etc torrent de lege julia ad calc horat p    etc  if an ordinary generation is computed at thirtythree years herodot l ii newton chronol emendat p     the generations under the first emperors ought rather to be extended to forty than reduced to twenty years these i acknowledge are but probabilities but in the science of criticism probabilities destroy possibilities and are themselves destroyed by proofs this principle is not to be controverted the authority of porphyrio is of too little weight among the learned to be the foundation of an argument it might at best help to prop an argument otherwise well supported the ancients do not assign to him the first rank among horaces commentators vid vitam horat sine nomine autoris  and the moderns particularly mr dacier find in him many errors i do not see any ground for your first hypothesis if piso had a son when he was thirty years old this son might be sixteen when horace wrote his art of poetry an age which you think agrees with every quality required in him did you not forget in writing this sentence that horace died in seven hundred and fortyfive when piso himself was only forty years old    i think it certain that horace in the third ode of his third book meant to show the romans that if their prince aspired to divine honors viamque affectat olympo he well merited them by his exploits which rivalled those of the greatest heroes bacchus hercules and romulus who after trampling on their human enemies and appeasing the jealousy of the gods had opened for themselves a road to the palace of the immortals but did the poet also intend by this ode to resist and destroy the clamours of the people concerning the infamous supper of the twelve gods i think he did not   this design does not agree with chronology suetonius does not tell us the date of this supper but since mark antony mentioned it in his letters to augustus suet l ii c  0  it must have happened before the last quarrel of the triumvirs according to bentley bentley in praefat ad horat  whose opinion you adopt horace wrote the third book of his odes in the fortysecond and fortythird years of his age that is in the seven hundred and twentyeighth and seven hundred and twentyninth years of rome an apology for augustus debaucheries written seven years after they happened could have only served to revive the memory of enormities which the policy of that prince and the gratitude of the romans had long consigned to oblivion   augustus supped with eleven men and women who as well as himself were adorned with the emblems of divinities the poet seated augustus at the table of the gods purpureo bibit ore nectar but can we reasonably suppose that he meant to place there the companions of his feast this would have been no render the honor too common and his panegyric would have degenerated into a satire i agree with you that it is rather desirable than necessary to discover the plan of an ode the writers of lyric poetry having always enjoyed the privilege of soaring to heights which if admired by fancy must not be criticized by reason this fault if it be one is compensated by great beauties the two first stanzas prove the wonderful efficacy of poetry when combined with philosophy the justum and tenacem propositi virum is the sage of the stoics their king horat sermon l i sermon iii ver      and only happy man all whose designs are just and inflexibly pursued cicero pro murenae c    de la mothe le vayer tom i p  0  etc de la virtue des payens  such a being exempt from passions and prejudices never casts his eyes on the tumults of human life without exclaiming o curas hominum o quantum in rebus inane to the disgrace of mankind such a character never existed but it is not a small honor for the species that such perfect virtue has been described and relished the climax is beautiful the sage would resist the clamorous fury of a mad multitude but this popular rage is often appeased as easily as it is kindled he would despise the threats of a furious tyrant but the hearts of tyrant sometimes relent with compassion he would hear without terror the raging tempest which overpowers the cries of the wretched but fortune has often rescued victims from the boisterous waves he would not dread the thunder of jupiter here the trembling imagination pauses fearing left the poet should either sink into meanness or swell into bombast because it seems impossible to conceive a bolder image than the enraged master of gods and men but our fear is converted into admiration when we read he would sustain unterrified the crashing shock of the universe by which the elements men and gods are involved in one common ruin plin l vi epist  0  i stop here lest my reflections should tire you which if they do it must be my fault i shall have attained however my purpose which was to show the point of view under which i consider the most profound erudition regarded as a mean or instrument it merits our highest admiration but considered as an ultimate end it is entitled to nothing but contempt    you remember sir that famous passage of velleius paterculus vell patere l ii c     which has given so much trouble to the learned it is as follows     it seems unsusceptible of any meaning and must be supposed either defective or corrupt all the critics therefore who have examined it endeavor to restore the text burerius acidalius gruter boeclerus heinsius burman have all of them given conjectures more or less probable which i shall not here discuss i shall rather submit an emendation of my own to your judgment instead of the common reading i would substitute prisa antiquaque severitate fusus ancipitia sibi tam re quam exemplo perniciosa we see at once that this small alteration produces a clear and distinct sense and the correction may be proved to be equally conformable to the analogy of the latin tongue and agreeable to the truth of history the best grammarians acknowledge that the latin not having a middle voice admits of a passive participle in an active signification v burman ad vell paterc l ii c    perizon ad sanct minerv l i c    n    thus juratus punitus sometimes denote qui juravit qui punivit we find peragratus used in this meaning by velleius himself vell paterc l ii c     fusus may therefore without impropriety denote the action of drusus history also favors this correction according to tacitus when drusus arrived in the camp of the rebels his orders were disobeyed his offers suspected the soldiers made him prisoner they insulted his friends and waited only for a pretense to begin the slaughter such were the dangers that threatened his person sibi ancipitia tam re the severity of the roman discipline is well known the generals were the gods of the soldiers and their orders received as oracles but ancient maxims were now overturned and the sedition of the pannonian legions created an tacit annal i c    etc example most pernicious to posterity superstition which does so much evil here did good an eclipse of the moon frightened the soldiers and saved the life of the general  i read with much pleasure your solution of the difficulty in justin and admire your skill in extracting a regular narrative by bringing the scattered lights in authors to one focus if any uncertainty still remains it must be ascribed to the darkness of antiquity and justins brevity  your suffrage removes all fear about the solidity of my conjecture concerning the death of catullus i formerly thought it probable but begin now to regard it as certain i have the honor to remain with the highest consideration and most perfect esteem yours etc  edward gibbon  no ix this letter in the early handwriting of mr gibbon probably about the time of his first leaving lausanne seems to be under the assumed character of a swedish traveller writing to a swiss friend delineating the defects he discovered in the government of berne in pointing out those defects he seems to have had the intention of suggesting remedies but as he is entering on this topic the manuscript ends abruptly the excellence of this curious paper will apologize for its great length  non mon cher ami je ne veux point etre cosmopolite loin de moi ce titre fastueux sous lequel nos philosophes cachent une egale indifference pour tout le genre humain je veux aimer ma patrie et pour aimer il me faut des preferences mais ou je me trompe ou mon coeur est susceptible de plus dune quand jaurois tout sacrifie pour la suede mon pays natal je ne me serois point encore acquitte envers elle je lui dois la vie et la fortune mais que cette vie seroit triste que cette fortune me seroit a charge si expatrie des ma tender jeunesse votre pays neut pas form mon gout et ma raison a des moeurs moins grossieres que les notres je me montrerois indigne de ces bienfaits sil ne mavoient pas inspire la plus vive reconnoissance aujourdhui que la suede tranquille a labri des loix nexige de ses enfans que de sentir leur bonheur je puis sans loffenser jetter un regard sur le pays de vaud mon autre patrie me rejouir avec vous de ses avantages et compatir a ses maux  votre climat est beau votre terroir fertile vous avez pour le commerce interieur des facilites dont il ne tient qua vous de prositer mais je considere plutot les habitans que lhabitation on va chercher les philosophes a londres paris attire dans son sein tous ceux qui naiment que la douceur de la societe votre pays le cede a ces deux capitales la ou else brillent mais cependant il reunit tous leurs avantages respectifs il est le seul ou tout a la fois on ose penser et on sache vivre que vous manque til la liberte et prives delle tout vous manque  cette verite vous surprend elle vous bless pouvoir dire que nous ne sommes pas libres me repondez vous prouve que nous le sommes il le prouveroit peut etre si jecrivois a lausanne ou plutot la meme il ne prouveroit rien vos maitres connoissent la maxim du cardinal mazarin de vous laisser parler pourvu que vous les laissiez agir ainsi le process nest point encore juge  si jecrivois pour le peuple je maddresserois a ses passions je le ferois souvenir de cette maxim de tous les tems que dans les republiques ceux qui sont libres sont plus libres et ceux qui sont esclaves plus esclaves que partout ailleurs mais avec un ami tell que vous je ne dois chercher que la verite et nemployer que la raison quand je compare votre etat avec celui de vos voisins cest avec plaisir que je le prononce heureux traversez votre lac et vos montagnes vous trouverez partout un peuple digne dun meilleur sort sa raison abrutie par la superstition le patrimoine de ses peers et le fruit de son industry en proye au partisan ou au hussard sa vie sacrifiee a tout moment au caprice dun seul homme qui lorsquil entend parler de vingt milles de ses semblables morts dans le service de son ambition dira froidement quils ont fait leur devoir  vous au contraire professez un christianisme ramene a la divine purete de son institution enseigne par de dignes pasteurs a qui on permet de se fair aimer de se fair respecter mais non de se fair craindre votre union avec le corpse helvetique vous a assure depuis deux siecles une paix unique dans lhistoire vos impots sont petits ladministration douce on nentend point parler parmi vous de ces sentences sans process sans crime sans accusateur qui arrachent un citoyen du milieu de sa famille lon ne voit jamais le souverain on le sent rarement cependant si la liberte consiste a netre soumis qua de loix dont lobjet est le bien commun de la societe vous netes point libre  quand la violence des uns et la foiblesse des autres ont rendu necessaires les societes civiles il a fallu renoncer a cette independance si chere et si pernicieuse il a fallu que toutes les volontes particulieres se fondissent dans une volonte generale a laquelle des punitions reglees obligeassent chaque citoyen de conformer ses actions quil est delicat ce pouvoir de fixer la volonte generale en quelles mains doit on le remettre serace a un monarque deslors absolu je sais que linteret bien entendu du prince ne se peut separer davec celui de son peuple et quen travaillant pour lui il travaille pour soi meme tell est le langage de la philosophy mais ce langage nest pas un de ceux que les precepteurs font etudier aux rois et si un heureux naturel leur en done quelque idee leurs passions ou celles dun ministre dun confesseur dune maitresse l effacent bientot le peuple gemit mais il faut quil ait gemi long tems avaunt que son maitre sappercoive quil est de linteret dun berger de conserver son troupeau il faut donc que le pouvoir legislatif soit partage un conseil dont les members seclairent et se contiennent les uns les autres paroit en etre un depositaire bien choisi mais la liberte attache a ce conseil une condition fondamentale elle veut que chaque order des citoyens chaque party de letat y ait ses representans interesses a sopposer a toute loi qui seroit nuisible a ses droits ou contraire a son bonheur puisqueux memes en sentiroient les premiers les mauvais effets une tell assemblee fera rarement des fautes grossieres et si elle pay quelquefois le tribut a lhumanite elle peut rougir de ses erreurs et les reparer aussi tot ce portrait est il le votre jentre dans votre pays je vois deux nations distinguees par leurs droits leurs occupations et leurs moeurs lune composee de trois cens familles est nee pour commander lautre de cent mill nest formee que pour obeir toutes les pretensions humiliantes des monarques hereditaires se renouvellent a votre egard et deviennent encore plus humiliantes de la part de vos egaux la comparaison de vos deux etats vous est trop facile rien ne vous aid a leloigner  un conseil de trois cens persons decide de tous vos interets en dernier ressort et si ses interets et les votres ne sont pas daccord qui doit lemporter non seulement ce senate est legislateur mais il execute ses propres loix cette union de deux puissances quon ne devoit jamais reunir les rend chacune plus formidables quand else sont separees la puissance legislative redoute les resolutions violentes else seroient inutiles si lon narmoit pas les mains de la puissance qui les doit executer et cette puissance est toujours sa rivale et son contrepoids mais ce nest pas assez que cette union aiguise le glaive de de lautorite public elle le remet encore dans un plus petit nombre de mains dans le dernier siecle le grand conseil de berne se renouvelloit lui meme cetoit deja un pas verse loligarchie pourquoi exclure des elections le corpse de la bourgeoisie alors meme le gouvernement sappuyoit sur un fondement assez etroit bientot des inconveniens se firent sentir la brigue la venalite la debauche signaloient lentree des citoyens dans le conseil souverain et les riches ambitieux donnoient tout pour pouvoir tout invahir une deputation revocable de vingt six conseillers etablie des lenfance de la republique pour veiller a lexecution des loix devint chargee du soin de remplir les places de ce grand conseil dont ellememe tiroit son origin on y ajoutoit seize senateurs choisis de la maniere la plus favorable aux factieux ils possedoient dabord leur pouvoir collectivement mais peu a peu linteret particulier leur sit entendre quil valoit mieux permettre a chacun de nommer son fills son gendre et son parent les familles puissantes qui dominoient alors dans le senate y dominent encore les de wattevilles et les steiguers y remplissent une trentaine de places le commerce interesse de bienfaits ou lon pass dans le petit conseil par les suffrages de ses parens pour fair entrer de nouveaux parens dans le grand conseil a deja reduit le nombre dans familles qui siegent dans celuici a environ quatre vingt ces maisons souveraines ont un egal mepris pour ceux que le droit naturel auroit du render leurs concitoyens et pour ceux qui le sont par la constitution de letat il manque meme aux premiers une ressource que les monarques les plus absolus nont pas ose oter a leurs sujets je veux parler de ces tribunaux reconnus du souverain et reveres du peuple pour etre lorgane de la patrie et les depositaires des loix toutes les volontes du prince qui doivent etre obeies le sont plus facilement quand les sujets voyent combien else sont raisonnables puisquelles ont pass par lexamen de ces magistrates quon ne peut ni tromper ni seduire ni intimider aussi repondent ils a cette consideration par une resistance respectueuse mais determinee contre loppression ou ils etalent tout ce que la raison la liberte et leloquence peuvent inspirer a des citoyens zeles cest principalement dans ces tribunaux paisibles que je trouve ces qualites prives darmes ils ne doivent leur pouvoir qua leur probite et a leur eloquence est il etonnant que ceux qui nont que cette instrument sappliquent le plus a le cultiver quelles lecons pour les rois que les remontrances du parliament de paris quels modeles pour le peuple que la conduite des mandarins de la chine frappe par un tribunal de cette espece le monarque ne peut meconnoitre les gemissemens de la patrie les citoyens y apprennent quils ont une patrie ils attachent a laimer a etudier ses loix a se former a toutes les vertus publiques else murissent dans le silence loccasion les developpe ou else se font loccasion les etats du pays de vaud respectables sous les rois de bourgogne et sous les ducs de savoye etoient ce tribunal composes de la noblesse du clerge et des deputes des villes principales ils sassembloient tous les ans a moudon cetoit le conseil perpetuel du prince sans leur consentement il ne pouvoit ni fair de nouvelles loix ni etablir de nouveaux impots si jetois sur les lieux jetablirais ces droits par vos monumens les plus authentiques tout eloigne que jen suis je ne erains pas dappeller a leur temoignage il me rest toujours une preuve moins sensible pour le peuple mais aussi decisive pour les gens de lettres cest lanalogie les barbares du cinquieme siecle jetterent par toute leurope les racines de ce gouvernement que charlemagne etablit dans les pays bas la france litalie la suisse et lallemagne quelques evenemens les degres et les tems ou les arrierefiefs se formerent des fiefs ou le clerge acquit des terres seigneuriales ou les villes acheterent leurs affranchissemens y apporterent de legeres differences mais le fond de cette constitution est demeure dans toutes les revolutions et rien de plus libre que ce fonds ces etats leurs members et leurs droits se conserverent toujours et partout ils etoient les memes  je vous entends mon ami qui minterrompez je vous ai ecoute me dites vous avec patience mais que voulez vous conclure de ce tableau de notre gouvernement bien ou mal construit nous nen ressentons que des effets salutaires et vos conseils vos etats auroient de la peine a nous degouter de nos magistrates anciens pour nous fair essayer des nouveautes  arretez monsieur je vous ai parle en homme libre et vous me repondez dans le langage de la servitude arretez en convenant pour un moment de votre bonheur de qui le tenez vous de la constitution vous nosez pas le dire cest done du prince les romans en devoient un plus grand a titus ils etoient cependant de vils esclaves brutus vous auroit appris que dans un etat despotique le prince peut quelquefois vouloir de bien mais que dans les etats libres il ne peut que le vouloir la felicite actuelle du citoyen et de lesclave est souvent egale mais celle du dernier est precaire puisquelle est fondee sur les passions des hommes pendant que celle du premier est assuree elle est liee avec les loix qui contiennent egalement ces memes passions dans le souverain et dans le paysan  mais malheureusement on ne trouve que trop de chooses a reprendre dans votre administration politic je vais detailler des sautes des negligences des oppressions vous vous recrierez sur ma malignite mais en secret votre esprit grossira le catalogue de cent articles que jaurai ou ignores ou oublies il est du devoir du souverain de fair jouir son peuple de tous les avantages de la societe civil des guerres entreprises pour sa defense len detourneront quelquefois mais desque le calm renait dans ses etats des etablissemens utiles et de sages loix la religion les moeurs les sciences le commerce les manufactures lagriculture et la police meritent toute son attention et len recompenseront avec usure sur ces principes jugeons le senate de berne il a ete maitre du pays de vaud depuis lan      quand je considere ce quetoient alors la france langleterre la hollande ou lallemagne jai de la peine a me persuader quelles etoient les memes pays que ceux qui portent aujourdhui ces noms de barbares ils sont devenus civilizes dignorans eclaires et de pauvres riches je vois des villes ou il y avoit des deserts et les forets defrichees se sont converties en champs fertiles leurs princes et leurs ministres un henri quatre un sully un colbert une elizabeth un de wit un fredericguillaume ont opere ces merveilles la perspective du pays de vaud nest point aussi riante les arts languissent fault de ces recompenses que le prince seul peut donner null commerce nulles manufactures nuls projets utiles pour le pays un engourdissement general qui regne partout cependant les princes dont je viens de parler navoient que des momens pour ces objets ou les bernois ont eu des siecles que nauroient ils pas fait ces grands hommes rarement tranquilles sur le trone si pendant deux cens douze ans ils neussent eu que des voisins pacifiques et des peuples soumis je men rapporte a vous meme indiquez moi quelque etablissement vraiment utile que vous deviez au souverain mais ne mindiquez pas lacademie de lausanne fondee par des vues de devotion dans la chaleur dune reformation negligee depuis et toujours academie quoique un digne magistrate de cette ville proposat de leriger en universite  non ce nest point une politic peu eclairee qui fait agir vos maitres je connois trop leur habilete mais un monarque aim egalement tous ses sujets les citoyens dune ville capitale voyent au contraire dun oeil jaloux lagrandissement des provinces si else selevent disent ils nous tombons nos egales pour les lumieres et les richesses else voudroient bientot letre en pouvoir rappellez vous lan      la mauvaise politic de louis xiv expatria la party la plus industrieuse de ses sujets une multitude se refugia dans le pays de vaud il etoit prochain il etoit francois ils nedemandoient quun azile et lauroient pay au poids de lor par les richesses et les arts plus precieux que les richesses quils vous apportoient mais ici la politic partiale des bernois sepouvanta si nous faisons participer ces fugitifs a notre droit de bourgeoisie la fortune nous sera commune mais comment elever des mortels au rang des dieux si nous les laissons confondus parmi nos sujets nos sujets recueilleront le fruit de leur industry ils conclurent enfin avec lambassadeur de porsenna     quil vaut mieux quun roi sur le trone affermi command a des sujets malheureux mais soumis que davoir a dompter au sein de labondance dun peuple trop heureux lindocile arrogance ces exiles las dessuyer des refus ou ils devoient sattendre a des prieres passerent en hollande en prusse et en angleterre ou les souverains savoient mieux profiter de cette occasion unique il en resta une party dans le pays de vaud mais cetoit la party la plus pauvre et la plus faineante qui navoit ni le moyen ni la volonte daller plus loin  a peine ces malheureux commencoient ils a oublier leurs souffrances passees que lexperience leur sit sentir que pour fuir les persecutions il faut fuir les hommes la party souveraine de letat avoit succe avec le lait toute la durete du systeme de calvin theologien atrabilaire qui aimoit trop la liberte pour souffrir que les chretiens portassent dautres fers que les siens dailleurs sa conformite avec les idees dun celebre philosophe interessoit lhonneur du nom allemand a le soutenir comme les sentimens setoient adoucis dans le pays de vaud en proportion avec les moeurs il falloit y envoyer des formulaires et des inquisiteurs destines a fair autant dhypocrites quils pourroient non a la verite par le fer et le feu mais par les menaces et les privations demploi  en soutenant les droits de lhumanite je noutre point les maxims de la tolerance je veux bien que le magistrate ne distribue les recompenses du public qua ceux qui enseignent la religion du public je ne lui defens pas meme de contenir dans le silence ces novateurs trop hardis qui voudroient eclairer le peuple sur certains objets ou lerreur fait son bonheur mais que le souverain se pretant avec chaleur aux minuties theologiques decide des questions quon ne peut decider assurement il est absurd quimposant des confessions de foi il ne laisse a des pasteurs vieillis dans le ministere et qui ne demandoient qua se taire que le choix du mensonge ou de la mendicite assurement il est injuste mais la persecution cessa  qui la fit cesser un sentiment de honte les larmes des sujets ou bien la crainte quinspira lentreprise dun davel enthousiaste il est vrai mais enthousiaste pour le bien public encore meme il regne a lausanne une inquisition sourde les noms darminien et de socinien remplissent encore ces lettres ou de tres honnetes gens rendent compte a leurs protecteurs des sentimens de leurs concitoyens et cest suivant ces indices que les places se distribuent  je viens non pas depuiser mais dindiquer quelques defauts qui se trouvent dans votre puissance legislative passons a lexecutrice celleci est la force public comme lautre est la volonte public mais un seul corpse un seul homme peut deliberer et decider pour toute une nation il ne peut tout seul agir pour elle ladministration politic composee dun nombre infini de branches veut quun grand nombre dofficiers soumis les uns aux autres semployent a fair jouer la machine a laquelle le maitre ne peut que donner le mouvement general les honneurs et les avantages que les loix attachent a ces emplois doivent etre ouverts a tous les citoyens que leurs talens et leur education ont mis en etat de les remplir les fardeaux leur sont communs a tous les recompenses doivent letre aussi un gouvernement monarchique satisfait aisement a ces justes pretensions alexception de quelques courtisans qui approchent la person du prince dassez pres pour substituer la flattery aux services tous ses sujets lui sont egaux desquun homme a du merit ou si lon veut de la faveur on ne lui demand point sil est normand ou provencal depernon etoit gascon richelieu champenois mazarin romain mais dans les republiques aristocratiques les souverains composes de toute une ville veulent etre legislateurs en corpse et partager enter eux en detail tous les emplois considerables les talens les lumieres dans votre pays sont inutiles pour quiconque nest pas ne bernois et dans un autre sens ils sont egalement inutiles pour qui lest le sujet se voit condamne par sa naissance a ramper dans un honteuse obscurite le desespoir le saisit il neglige ce qui ne le peut mener a rien et le grand homme ne devient quun homme agreeable si je parlais de fair participer les sujets aux bailliages les bernois crieroient au sacrilege les bailliages sont le patrimoine de letat et nous sommes letat il est vrai quon vous laisse les lieutenances baillivales mais vous savez assez quon y mele certaines stipulations de facon que si le nouveau magistrate ne vit pas quelque tems sa famille perd au march  prives de ressources que rest il aux gentilhommes du pays de vaud le service etranger mais on na pas manque de leur render cette carriere des plus epineuses et de leur y fermer lacces des grades un peu eleves je ne dirai rien du brilliant service de france les depenses sont inevitables et la pay si modique que lenseigne seruine le captain vit a peine et meme le colonel ne peut amasser ainsi vous devez benir le soin paternel du souverain qui a dress toutes les capitulations de maniere a ne vous point introduire en tentation ne parlons que du service des etats generaux service plus utile que riant ou lon sennuye et senrichit par le traite de      le canton de berne accorda vingt quatre compagnies a leurs hautes puissances et promit de permettre quon en sit toujours des recrues dans leurs etats seize compagnies etoient destinees aux bernois et les souverains partageoient avec leurs sujets les huit autres compagnies dont on daignoit laisser lentree ouverte a ceux ci ainsi a ne supposer le credit des bernois quegal a celui des sujets pour parvenir a ces huit dernieres compagnies ce peuple roi en possederoit toujours vingt sur vingt quatre la proportion est honnete si lon fait attention quil y a dans le canton pres de cent mill hommes en etat de porter les arms dont il ny en a pas huit cens bourgeois de berne dailleurs les petits bourgeois a qui ce nom seul inspire de la fierte aiment mieux croupir dans la misere a berne que de se fair par leur travail un etat vraiment respectable ainsi dans toutes ces troops je doubt quon puisse trouver cinquante bernois qui ne soient par officiers  ces malheurs me dites vous ne sont que pour les gentilhommes cest a dire pour la party la plus respectable mais la moins nombreuse des citoyens ils sevanouissent dans ces maxims generales et egales que vous venez detablir la tyranny de vos baillis sy evanouit elle aussi le peuple nom si cher a lhumanite en sent tout le joug je ne vous conterai point des histoires de leurs oppressions vous me chicaneriez sur la verite des faits et puis vous me diriez quil ne faut jamais conclure du particulier au general et vous auriez raison il vaut mieux fair sentir letendue de leur pouvoir et laisser a votre connoissance du coeur humain a juger de lusage quils en font chaque bailli est a la fois chef de la justice de la milice des finances et de la religion comme juge il decide sans appel jusqua la sum de cent francs sum tres modique pour vous mais qui fait la fortune dun paysan et il decide seul car ses assesseurs nont pas voix ponderative il done ou plutot il vend presque tous les emplois dans son bailliage si lon veut appeller de ses sentences il ny a plus de tribunal a moudon il faut aller a berne et quel paysan veut se ruiner a la poursuite de la justice sil cherche encore a fair punir son tyran il demand lentree en conseil lavoyer laccorde peut etre avec beaucoup de difficulte et a force de fatigues et de depenses il parvient a pouvoir plaider devant un tribunal lie avec son baillif par le sang et plus encore par une conformite de forfaits ou dinterets  votre pays est epuise par les impots tout modiques quils sont developons cette idee pendant que les pays le plus riches de leurope sabyment de depenses et de dettes et mettent en oeuvre des moyens qui feroient trembler le plus hardi dissipateur le canton de berne est le seul qui amasse des tresors le secret de letat est si bien guard quil est difficile de le deviner stanian ambassadeur dangleterre a berne qui avoit un esprit dobservation et de grandes facilites pour se bien informer estimoit il y a quarante ans les sommes quil avoit dans les fonds publics de londres a trois cens milles livres sterling ou sept millions et tout ce qui etoit rest dans le tresor de berne ou disperse dans les autres banques de l europe a dix huit cens mill livres sterling ou quarante trois millions on peut croire que ces tresors nont pas diminues depuis lan      le moyen que le canton employe pour senrichir est tres simple il depense beaucoup moins quil ne recoit mais que recoit il je lignore mais je vais tacher de le deviner les douze bailliages du pays de vaud rendent dans leurs six ans a peu pres cinq cens mill livres de suisse les uns portant les autres le revenu de douze peut donc monter a un million de livres de rent jai toujours entendu dire que les baillis prennent le dix pour cent sur les revenus du souverain le voila donc ce revenu dun million par annee en rabattant les cent mill livres des baillis je compterais encore cent mill ecus pour les charges de letat ce qui nest point une supposition batie en lair les autres deux cens mill ecus qui dans un autre pays fourniroient a lentretien dune cour et dune armee dont les depenses feroient retomber sur la terre la rosee qui en etoit tiree vont ici senfouir dans les coffres du souverain ou se disperser dans les banques publiques et precaires de leurope pour etre un jour une proye a linfidelite dun commis ou a lambition dun conquerant cette peste continuelle des especes eteint lindustrie empeche tout effort qui ne se peut fair sans argent et appauvrit insensiblement le pays  tells sont vos maux monsieur eh bien me repondez vous navez vous sonde nos plays que pour en aigrir la douleur quel conseil nous donnez vous aucun si vous ne mavez pas deja prevenu il y a une voye que je puis vous conseiller cest celle de la remontrance mais il y a des maux tellement enracines dans la constitution dun etat que platon lui meme neut pas espere du succes pour une pareille deputation ne tiendront ils pas contre les remontrances eux qui ont pu tenir contre deux cens and de fidelite et de services il y a un autre remede plus prompt plus entier plus glorieux guillaume tell vous leut conseille mais je ne vous le conseille point je sais que lesprit du citoyen comme celui de la charity souffre beaucoup et espere longtems il a raison il connoit les malheurs attaches a la soumission il ignore ceux que la resistance pourroit entrainer vous qui me connoissez monsieur vous savez combien je respect ces principes amiss de la paix et des hommes tribun seditieux je ne chercherai jamais a fair secouer au peuple le joug de lautorite pour le conduire du murmr a la sedition de la sedition a lanarchie et de lanarchie peut etre au despotisme  cependant avec la franchise qui a partout conduit ma plume je vais detruire quelques monstres de romans qui vous peuvent effrayer que vous preferiez le parti de lentreprise ou celui du repos je voudrois que ce fut la raison et non le prejuge qui vous dictat ce parti  les bernois ont les droits sur votre obeissance vous craignez de leur fair une injustice en la retirant   no my dear friend i will not be a citizen of the world i reject with scorn that proud title under which our philosophers conceal an equal indifference for the whole human race i will love my country and to love it above all others there must be reasons for my preference but if i am not mistaken my heart is susceptible of affection for more countries than one did i sacrifice all to sweden i should only pay my debt of gratitude to the land in which i was born and to which i owe my life and fortune yet life and fortune would have been but melancholy burdens if after my banishment from home in early youth your country had not formed my taste and reason and taught me more refined morals than our own i should prove myself unworthy of this goodness did it not inspire me with the liveliest gratitude and now that sweden enjoying tranquillity under the protection of laws requires nothing from its subjects but a just sense of their happiness i may direct my attention without offense to the pais de vaud my second country rejoicing with you in its advantages or commiserating its misfortunes  you enjoy a fine climate a fertile soil and have conveniences for internal commerce from which great benefit might be derived but i consider the people rather than their territory philosophy flourishes in london paris is the center of those attracted by the allurements of polished society your country though inferior to those capitals yet unites in some measure their respective advantages since it is the only country whose inhabitants while they think freely and boldly live politely and elegantly what then is wanting liberty and deprived of it you have lost your all  this truth surprises and offends you the right of complaining you answer that we are not free is a proof of our liberty if i wrote at lausanne the argument would have weight yet even there it would not be convincing for your masters are not ignorant of cardinal mazarines maxim and are willing to allow you to talk provided you allow them to act so that the process is not yet determined  if i wrote for the people i would speak to their passions and hold a language repeated in all ages that under republics those who are free are more free and those who are enslaved more enslaved than under any other form of government but with a friend like you i would seek only the maxims of truth and employ only the arguments of reason when i compare your condition with that of surrounding nations i can sincerely congratulate you on your happiness whenever we quit the neighborhood of your lake and mountains we find men who though worthy of a better fate are plunged in the most abject superstition whose property and industry are the spoils of a licentious soldiery and whose lives are ready every moment to be sacrificed to the caprice of one man who when he hears that twenty thousand of his fellow creatures have fallen sacrifices to his ambition is contented with saying coldly they have done their duty  you on the contrary enjoy a christianity brought back to the purity of its original principles taught publicly by worthy ministers who are loved and respected but who have it not in their power to become the objects of fear your connection with the swiss cantons has preserved to you the blessings of peace two centuries a thing unexampled in history your taxes are moderate and the public administration is gentle you have not to complain of those arbitrary sentences which without any form of legal procedure without an accuser and without a crime have been known to tear citizens from the bosoms of their families the sovereign is never seen the weight of his authority is rarely felt yet if liberty consists in being subject to laws which impartially consult the interests of all the members of the community you do not enjoy that blessing  when the injustice of some and the weakness of others showed the necessity for civil society individuals were obliged to renounce their beloved but pernicious independence all particular wills were melted down into the general will of the public by which under the sanction of definite punishments men became bound to regulate their conduct but it is a matter of the utmost delicacy to determine with whom that general will ought to be deposited shall it reside in the breast of a prince who thereby becomes absolute i know that the true interests of a prince can never be separated from those of his people and that in exerting himself for their benefit he labors for his own this is the language of philosophy but it is seldom spoken by the preceptors of princes and if the latter sometimes read it in their own hearts the impression is speedily effaced by contrary passions in themselves their confessors their ministers or mistresses the groans of the people are not soon heard and their master learns only by a fatal experience that it is the interest of a shepherd to preserve his flock the legislative power therefore cannot safely be entrusted to a single person a council whose members mutually instruct and mutually check each other appears to be its proper depository but in this council one condition is essentially requisite it must consist of deputies from every order in the state interested by their own safety in opposing every regulation inconsistent with the happiness of that order to which they belong such a council will rarely be guilty of gross errors and should this sometimes happen it will soon blush for and repair them is this the picture of your legislature when i survey your country i behold two nations distinctly characterised by their rights employments and manners the one consisting of three hundred families born to command the other consisting of an hundred thousand doomed to submission the former are invested as a body with all the prerogatives of hereditary monarchs which are the more humiliating to you their subjects because they belong to men apparently your equals the comparison between yourselves and them is made every moment no circumstance tends to conceal it from your fancy  a council of three hundred persons is the sovereign umpire of your dearest interests which will always be sacrificed when they clash with their own this council is invested with the executive as well as the legislative power two branches of authority which can never be united without rendering each of them too formidable to the subject when they belong to different persons or assemblies the legislature will not venture to form violent resolutions because these would be of no avail unless they were carried into execution by another power always its rival and often its antagonist the sword of authority is not only sharpened by this union but is thereby confined to a smaller number of hands in the last century the great council of bern began to elect its own members which was a great step toward oligarchy since it excluded from elections the citizens at large and thereby narrowed the basis of the government but this arrangement was liable to other inconveniences intrigue venality and debauchery signalised the admission of citizens into the sovereign council and ambitious men squandered their wealth that they might purchase a right to indulge their rapacity a committee of six counselors established in the infancy of the republic to watch the execution of the laws and whose offices were held at pleasure became entrusted with the power of naming the members of the grand council by which this committee itself was appointed its number was augmented by sixteen senators chosen in the manner most favorable to the designs of faction they exercised their power at first collectively but by degrees they came to understand that their particular interests would be better promoted by each naming his son soninlaw or kinsman the powerful families which then commanded the senate still rule in it at present thirty places are filled by the wattevilles and steiguers this selfish traffic by which the members of the little council are elected by the great council consisting of their own relations that they may name other relations to seats in the great council has reduced the number of families which have a right to sit in the latter to nearly fourscore these princely families look down with equal contempt on those who are their fellowcitizens by the law of nature and those who were rendered such by the constitution of their country the former class is deprived of a resources which the most absolute princes have seldom ventured to wrest from their subjects i mean those courts of justice acknowledged by the prince and revered by the people as the organs of public opinion and the depositories of the laws the commands of the sovereign are obeyed with cheerfulness only when their propriety is confirmed by the approbation of those tribunals whose members it has been found difficult either to deceive to seduce or to intimidate their resistance to oppression is respectful but firm and in exerting it they display that warmth of eloquence with which reason and liberty inspire good citizens in the members of those peaceful tribunals such qualities appear in their greatest luster destitute of arms their whole strength lies in their talents and their probity what noble lessons to kings have been given by the parliament of paris what excellent examples to subjects are set by the mandarines of china monarchs must hear the groans of their people when such respectable bodies of men are their organs the people too learn that they have a country which they will begin to love to study its laws and to form themselves to public virtues these virtues ripen silently they are exerted when an opportunity offers and sometimes they will make an opportunity for their own exhibition in the pais de vaud which was equally respectable under the kings of burgundy and the dukes of savoy the states formed such a tribunal they were composed of the nobility clergy and deputies from the principal cities which annually assembled at moudon and formed the perpetual council of the prince without whose consent he could neither enact new laws nor impose new taxes were i on the spot i could prove the existence of those rights by your most authentic records at a distance i can only appeal to their testimony and employ an analogical proof which will be sufficiently convincing to men of letters the barbarians who overflowed europe in the fifth century every where laid the foundation of that form of government which charlemagne established in the low countries france italy switzerland and germany the different modes of tenure which were at different times introduced the various degrees of dependence which one fief came to have on another the acquisition of lordships by the clergy and the purchase of franchises by cities all these circumstances occasioned but slight differences in the groundwork of the constitution which remained unalterably founded on a firm basis of liberty the states their members and their rights were invariably maintained remaining uniformly the same at all times and in all places  i think that i hear you my friend interrupting me hitherto you say i have listened to you with patience but what is your conclusion from this picture of our government whatever defects there may be in its principles we have experienced its salutary consequences and the states and assemblies which you so much commend will not easily make us abolish our ancient magistracies in order to try innovations  it is time sir to pause i spoke to you as became a freeman and you answer me in the language of slavery let us admit for a moment your prosperity to whom do you owe it you will not answer to the constitution it is due then to your rulers the romans owed a prosperity yet greater to titus but still remained the basest of slaves brutus would have taught you that a despot may sometimes choose to promote the public happiness but that the magistrates of a free people can have no other wish the advantages actually enjoyed by a citizen and a slave may be the same but those of the latter are precarious having no other foundation than the changeable passions of men whereas those of the former are secure being solidly supported on those laws which curb guilty passions in the prince as well as in the peasant  but unfortunately too many faults may be sound in your public administration i shall give you the black list of omissions and oppressions which notwithstanding that you will exclaim against my malignity your own memory will augment by an hundred articles which i may be either ignorant of or forget to mention it is the duty of a sovereign to procure for his people all the happiness of which their condition is susceptible his public spirited exertions may be suspended by the exigencies of defensive war but as soon as peace is restored he will be continually and usefully occupied with the interests of religion laws morals sciences police commerce and agriculture let us try the merits of the senate of bern by these maxims the members of this senate have been masters of the pais de vaud since the year one thousand five hundred and thirtysix when we consider the deplorable condition in those days of france england holland and germany we can scarcely imagine that they were the same countries with those respectively known at present by the same names their barbarism has been civilized their ignorance enlightened their poverty enriched their deserts have become cities and their forests now wave with yellow harvests these wonders have been effected by their princes and ministers a henry the fourth a sully a colbert an elizabeth a de wit and a frederick william the comparative condition of the pais de vaud at those two remote aeras does not present so pleasing a picture there the arts still languish for want of those encouragements which princes only can bestow the country is still destitute of commerce and manufactures we hear not of any projects for promoting the public prosperity we see nothing but the marks of an universal lethargy yet the princes above mentioned had but moments for executing their great designs the senators of bern have had ages what benefits might not those patriotic kings have conferred on their subjects if instead of having their thrones continually shaken by war and sedition they had enjoyed during two centuries the advantage of having loyal subjects and pacific neighbors i appeal to yourself point out a single useful establishment which the pais de vaud owes to the sovereignty of bern but do not tell me of the academy of lausanne founded on motives of religion during the zeal of reformation but since totally neglected though a worthy magistrate of that city proposed the laudable design of erecting it into an university  your masters err not through ignorance they are not deficient i know in political abilities but while a prince treats with impartial bounty all his subjects the citizens of an aristocratical capital are apt to behold with jealousy the improvement of the provinces their elevation they think must pave the way for their own downfall and if they become their equals in point of knowledge and riches they will soon be tempted they imagine to aspire at an equality with themselves in power recall to memory the year one thousand six hundred and eightyfive when the wretched policy of louis the fourteenth drove from their country the most industrious portion of his subjects many of whom sought refuge in the pais de vaud a neighboring district and speaking their own language they requested only an asylum the benefits of which they would richly have repaid by the wealth which they carried with them and their skill in manufactures still more valuable but the narrow policy of bern took the alarm if we make these men citizens of bern their interests will coincide with our own but is it fit that mortals should be raised to the rank of gods if they are mixed with the mass of our subjects our subjects will be enriched by their industry they concluded therefore with the ambassadors of porsenna  that it was more desirable for a prince to govern a poor but submissive people than to contend with the unruly passions of men pampered by prosperity  the emigrants disgusted at being repeatedly refused what they ought to have been requested to accept traveled to holland prussia and england whose rulers had the good sense to avail themselves of an emergency as favorable as it was singular a part of them indeed remained in the pais de vaud but the poorest and the idlest who had neither money nor spirit to travel farther  these unhappy fugitives had no sooner begun to forget their past sufferings than they learned by fatal experience that in order to avoid persecution it was necessary to fly from the society of men the sovereigns of the country in which they had settled had imbibed the severe system of calvin a stern theologian who loved liberty too well to endure that christians should wear any other chains than those imposed by himself his near conformity in opinion with a celebrated german philosopher interested the honor of the german name in supporting his doctrines but in the pais de vaud the asperity of religious opinions had softened with the improvement of society it became necessary therefore to send thither formulas and inquisitors designed to make as many hypocrites as possible not indeed by fire and sword but by threats and deposition from office  in supporting the rights of man i would not carry too far the maxims of toleration it is just that public rewards should be bestowed only on those who teach the religion of the public and those bold innovators who would impart a dangerous light to the people may very properly be restrained by the arm of the magistrate but it surely is absurd that the sovereign should interfere in theological minutiae and take part warmly in questions which are incapable of being decided it is particularly unjust that he should impose confessions of says on old ministers who wish to avoid disputation leaving them the miserable alternative of falsehood or beggary but this persecution has now ceased what put an end to it it was not shame nor the tears of the people but the boldness of davel that meritorious enthusiast even to the present day a secret inquisition still reigns at lausanne where the names of arminian and socinian are often mentioned in the letters written by very honest people to their patrons of bern and offices are often given or withheld according to the reports made of the religious tenets of the candidates  having made these strictures on your legislature which by no means exhaust the subject i proceed to consider the defects of your executive power which is the public force as the legislature ought to be the public will but a single council or a single man may deliberate and resolve for a whole nation the executive power on the contrary requires the exertions of many as it is composed of a great variety of branches many officers subordinate one to the other must actuate the different parts of the machine to which the chief magistrate can only communicate the first general movement the honors and emoluments legally attached to such offices ought to be open to all those citizens who are properly qualified for discharging them each individual as he bears a share of the public burdens is entitled also to a share of the public rewards this just arrangement is easily maintained in monarchies where with the exception of a few courtiers who by being continually about the princes person have an opportunity of substituting flattery instead of real services all the inhabitants of the kingdom are treated with comparative equity in france provided a man has courtfavour or merit the question is never asked whether he comes from provence or normandy depernon was born in gascony richelieu in champagne mazarine in rome but in aristocratical republics the citizens of one town are not contented with being sovereigns collectively unless they individually appropriate all offices of honor or emolument in the canton of bern talents and information are not of the smallest use to any one who is not born in the capital and in another sense they are useless to those born there because they must make their way without them their subjects in the pais de vaud are condemned by the circumstances of their birth to a condition of shameful obscurity they naturally become therefore a prey to despair and neglecting to cultivate talents which they can never enjoy an opportunity to display those who had capacities for becoming great men are contented with making themselves agreeable companions should i propose that the subjects obtained a right to hold the lucrative employments of baillis or governors of districts the aristocratical families of bern would think me guilty of a crime little less than sacrilege the emoluments of these offices form the patrimony of the state and we are the state it is true that you in the pais de vaud may be deputies to the baillis but the advantages belonging to that subordinate magistracy are obtained on certain conditions which unless the holder of the office lives a certain number of years renders his bargain a very bad one for his family  what encouragement is then left for the gentlemen of the pais de vaud that of foreign service but to them even this road to preferment is extremely difficult and to attain the higher ranks is impossible i speak not of the brilliant service of france in that country expense is unavoidable the ensign is ruined the captain can scarcely live and the colonel cannot save money you are therefore obliged to the paternal care of the magistrates of bern whose treaties for supplying troops to france do not lead you into temptation let us only consider the service of holland a service more profitable than showy where officers have nothing to do but to grow rich by the treaty of      the canton of bern granted the use of twentyfour companies to their high mightinesses and promised that they should always be allowed to recruit them in their territories but the command of sixteen of those companies was appropriated by the citizens of bern and the remaining eight were left common between them and their subjects in the pais de vaud on the supposition then that the interest of both classes of candidates for those companies is equal the sovereign people will obtain four out of the eight and twenty out of the whole twentyfour this proportion appears the more unreasonable when it is considered that in the canton there are above an hundred thousand men sit to bear arms of whom scarcely eight hundred are citizens of bern besides the poorer classes of citizens proud merely of this title prefer living in idleness at bern to honorable exertions abroad by which they might better their condition i doubt therefore whether fifty citizens of bern who are not officers will be found in the whole of the swiss dutch troops  these inconveniences you will tell me are only felt by men of family that is to say by the most respectable but least numerous portion of the community and they disappear amidst the general equity and impartiality of the public administration but does the tyranny of the bailiffs disappear also the people a name so dear to humanity feel the full weight of their oppression i will not have recourse to particular examples because you might call in question the authenticity of facts or object with reason that general conclusions are not to be drawn from particular principles i shall be contented with pointing out the extent of their power and leave to your own knowledge of human nature to infer the abuses with which it must be accompanied in his own district every bailiff is at the head of religion of the law the army and the finances as judge he decides without appeal all causes to the amount of an hundred franks a sum of little importance to a gentleman but which often makes the whole fortune of a peasant and he decides alone for the voice of his assessors has not any weight in the scale he confers or rather he sells all the employments in his district when the injured party wishes to appeal from his sentence as there is no court of justice at moudon he is obliged to remove the cause to bern and how few peasants can bear this expense but if his eagerness to punish his tyrant carries him thither it is not without many difficulties on his part that the avoyer or chief magistrate grants him admission into the council where after all his trouble and expense he is finally allowed to plead his cause before a tribunal the members of which are connected with his oppressor by the ties of blood and still more by a conformity of interests and crimes  your taxes moderate as they are exhaust the country this observation requires to be explained while the great kingdoms of europe loaded with expenses and debts are driven to expedients which would alarm the wildest prodigal bern is the only state which has amassed a large treasure the secret has been so well kept that it is not easy to ascertain its amount stanyan the british envoy at bern a man inquisitive and possessed of good means of information estimated forty years ago the money belonging to that republic in the english funds at three hundred thousand pounds or seven millions of swiss livres and the sums remaining in the treasury of bern or dispersed through the other funds or banks of europe at eighteen hundred thousand pounds sterling or fortythree millions swiss these treasures have not probably diminished since the year      the canton enriches itself by the simple means of receiving much and expending little but what is the amount of its receipts i know not but i will try to discover it the twelve bailiwics or districts of the pais de vaud pay one with another during the six years that they are governed by the same magistrate five hundred thousand swiss livres the contributions therefore of all the twelve amount to a million of livres annually i have always been told that the bailiffs or governors retain ten per cent on the revenues raised within their respective jurisdictions the million of revenue diminished by an hundred thousand livres consumed in the appointments of the bailiffs is reduced to three hundred thousand crowns of which one hundred thousand may be allowed for the expenses of the state a sum not chosen at random and the other two hundred thousand crowns which in other countries would be employed in the maintenance of a court and army whose incomes would circulate through the general mass of the people on whom they had been raised are here buried in the coffers of the sovereignty or dispersed through the precarious banks of europe to become one day a prey to the knavery of a clerk or the ambition of a conqueror this continual absorption of specie extinguishes industry deadens every enterprise that requires the aid of money and gradually impoverishes the country  these sir are your hardships but i think you will say to me have you thus probed our wounds merely to make us feel their smart what advice do you give us none unless you have already anticipated it i would indeed advise you to remonstrate but there are evils so deeply rooted in governments that plato himself would despair of curing them what could you expect to obtain from those masters by remonstrances who have remained during two centuries insensible to the merit of your faithful service there is another remedy more prompt more perfect and more glorious william tell would have prescribed it i do not i know that the spirit of a good citizen is like that of charity longsuffering and hoping all things the citizen is in the right since he knows the evils resulting from his submission but knows not the greater evils which might be produced by his resistance you know me too well to be ignorant how much i respect those principles so friendly to the interests of peace and of human kind i will never in the language of a seditious tribune persuade the people to shake off the yoke of authority that they may proceed from murmur to sedition from sedition to anarchy and from anarchy perhaps to despotism  yet with the freedom which has hitherto guided my pen i will endeavor to destroy some giants of romance which might otherwise inspire you with vain terror whether you prefer the road of bold enterprise or cautious repose i wish that reason not prejudice should dictate your choice  the magistrates of bern have a right to expect your obedience you fear to do them wrong in withholding it  no x mr gibbon to mrs porten lausanne      dear madam fear no reproaches for your negligence however great for your silence however long i love you too well to make you any nothing in my opinion is so ridiculous as some kind of friends wives and lovers who look on no crime as so heinous as the letting slip a post without writing the charm of friendship is liberty and he that would destroy the one destroys without designing it the better half of the other i compare friendship to charity and letters to alms the last signifies nothing without the first and very often the first is very strong although it does not show itself by the other it is not good will which is wanting it is only opportunities or means however one month  two months  three months  four months  i began not to be angry but to be uneasy for fear some accident had happened to you i was often on the point of writing but was always stopped by the hopes of hearing from you the next post besides not to flatter you your excuse is a very bad one you cannot entertain me by your letters i think i ought to know that better than you and i assure you that one of your plain sincere letters entertains me more than the most polished one of pliny or cicero it is your heart speaks and i look on your heart as much better in its way than either of their heads  out of pure politeness i ought to talk of   before myself i was some hours with him in this place that is to say almost all the time he was here i find him always   always goodnatured always amusing and always trifling i asked him some questions about italy he told me he hurried out of it as soon as he could because there was no french comedy and he did not love the italian opera i let slip some words of the pleasure he should have of seeing his native country again on account of the services he could render her in parliament yes says he i want vastly to be at london there are three years since i have seen garrick he spoke to me of you and indeed not only with consideration but with affection were there nothing else valuable in his character i should love him because he loves you he told me he intended to see you as soon as he should be in england i am glad he has kept his word i was so taken up with my old friend that i could not speak a word to    he appeared however a good sensible modest young man poor minorca indeed thus lost but poor englishmen who have lost it i think the second exclamation still stronger than the first poor lord torrington i cannot help pitying him what a shameful uncle he has i shall lose all my opinion of my countrymen if the whole nation whigs tories courtiers jacobites etc etc etc etc are not unanimous in detesting that man pray is there any truth in a story we had here of a brother of admiral byngs having killed himself out of rage and shame i did not think he had any brothers alive it is thought here that byng will be acquitted i hope not though i do not love rash judgments i cannot help thinking him guilty  you ask me when i shall come into england how should i know it the   th of june i wrote to my father and saying nothing of my return which i knew would have been to no purpose i desired him to give me a fixed allowance of  00l a year or at least to allow me a servant no answer about a fortnight ago i renewed my request and i cannot yet know what will be my success i design to make a virtue of necessity to keep quiet during this winter and to put in use all my machines next spring in order to come over this letter is a curious specimen of the degree in which mr gibbon had lost the english language in a short time  i shall write the strongest and at the same time the most dutiful letter i can imagine to my father if all that produces no effect i dont know what i can do  you talk to me of my cousin ellisons wedding but you dont say a word of who she is married to is it elliot though you have not seen my father yet i suppose you have heard of him how was he in town his wife was she with him has marriage produced any changement in his way of living is he to be always at beriton or will he come up to london in winter pray have you ever seen my motherinlaw or heard any thing more of her character compliments to every body that makes me compliments to the gilberts to the comarques to lord newnham etc when you see the comarques again ask them if they did not know at putney monsieur la vabre and his daughters perhaps you know them yourself i saw them lately in this country one of them very well married  the englishman who lodges in our house is little sociable at least for a reasonable person my health always good my studies pretty good i understand greek pretty well i have even some kind of correspondence with several learned men with mr crevier of paris with mr breitinger of zurick and with mr allamand a clergyman of this country the most reasonable divine i ever knew do you never read now i am a little piqued that you say nothing of sir charles grandison if you have not read it yet read it for my sake perhaps clarissa does not encourage you but in my opinion it is much superior to clarissa when you have read it read the letters of madame de sevigne to her daughter i dont doubt of their being translated into english they are properly what i called in the beginning of my letter letters of the heart the natural expressions of a mothers fondness regret at their being at a great distance from one another and continual schemes to get together again all that will not it please you there is scarce any thing else in six whole volumes and notwithstanding that few people read them without finding them too short adieu my paper is at an end i dont dare to tell you to write soon do it however if you can yours affectionately  e gibbon  no xi rev dr waldgrave tutor to mr gibbon when he first went to magdalen college oxford to edward gibbon esquire junior washington near storrington dec  th      dear sir i have read nothing for some time and i keep reading on still that has given me so much pleasure as your letter which i received by the last post i rejoice at your return to your country to your father and to the good principles of truth and reason had i in the least suspected your design of leaving us i should immediately have put you upon reading mr chillingworths religion of protestants any one page of which is worth a library of swiss divinity it will give me great pleasure to see you at washington where i am i thank god very well and very happy i desire my respects to mr gibbon and am with very great regard dear sir  your most affectionate humble servant tho waldgrave  no xii mr gibbon to his father    0 dear sir an address in writing from a person who has the pleasure of being with you every day may appear singular however i have preferred this method as upon paper i can speak without a blush and be heard without interruption if my letter displeases you impute it dear sir only to yourself you have treated me not like a son but like a friend can you be surprised that i should communicate to a friend all my thoughts and all my desires unless the friend approve them let the father never know them or at least let him know at the same time that however reasonable however eligible my scheme may appear to me i would rather forget it for ever than cause him the slightest uneasiness  when i first returned to england attentive to my future interest you were so good as to give me hopes of a seat in parliament this seat it was supposed would be an expense of fifteen hundred pounds this design flattered my vanity as it might enable me to shine in so august an assembly it flattered a nobler passion i promised myself that by the means of this seat i might be one day the instrument of some good to my country but i soon perceived how little a mere virtuous inclination unassisted by talents could contribute toward that great end and a very short examination discovered to me that those talents had not fallen to my lot do not dear sir impute this declaration to a false modesty the meanest species of pride whatever else i may be ignorant of i think i know myself and shall always endeavor to mention my good qualities without vanity and my defects without repugnance i shall say nothing of the most intimate acquaintance with his country and language so absolutely necessary to every senator since they may be acquired to allege my deficiency in them would seem only the plea of laziness but i shall say with great truth that i never possessed that gift of speech the first requisite of an orator which use and labor may improve but which nature alone can bestow that my temper quiet retired somewhat reserved could neither acquire popularity bear up against opposition nor mix with ease in the crowds of public life that even my genius if you will allow me any is better qualified for the deliberate compositions of the closet than for the extemporary discourses of the parliament an unexpected objection would disconcert me and as i am incapable of explaining to others what i do not thoroughly understand myself i should be meditating while i ought to be answering i even want necessary prejudices of party and of nation in popular assemblies it is often necessary to inspire them and never orator inspired well a passion which he did not feel himself suppose me even mistaken in my own character to set out with the repugnance such an opinion must produce offers but an indifferent prospect but i hear you say it is not necessary that every man should enter into parliament with such exalted hopes it is to acquire a title the most glorious of any in a free country and to employ the weight and consideration it gives in the service of ones friends such motives though not glorious yet are not dishonorable and if we had a borough in our command if you could bring me in without any great expense or if our fortune enabled us to despise that expense then indeed i should think them of the greatest strength but with our private fortune is it worth while to purchase at so high a rate a title honorable in itself but which i must share with every fellow that can lay out fifteen hundred pounds besides dear sir a merchandise is of little value to the owner when he is resolved not to sell it  i should affront your penetration did i not suppose you now see the drift of this letter it is to appropriate to another use the sum with which you destined to bring me into parliament to employ it not in making me great but in rendering me happy i have often heard you say yourself that the allowance you had been so indulgent as to grant me though very liberal in regard to your estate was yet but small when compared with the almost necessary extravagancies of the age i have indeed found it so notwithstanding a good deal of economy and an exemption from many of the common expenses of youth this dear sir would be a way of supplying these deficiencies without any additional expense to you  but i forbear  if you think my proposals reasonable you want no entreaties to engage you to comply with them if otherwise all will be without effect  all that i am afraid of dear sir is that i should seem not so much asking a favor as this really is as exacting a debt after all i can say you will still remain the best judge of my good and your own circumstances perhaps like most landed gentlemen an addition to my annuity would suit you better than a sum of money given at once perhaps the sum itself may be too considerable whatever you shall think proper to bestow upon me or in whatever manner will be received with equal gratitude  i intended to stop here but as i abhor the least appearance of art i think it will be better to lay open my whole scheme at once the unhappy war which now desolates europe will oblige me to defer seeing france till a peace but that reason can have no influence upon italy a country which every scholar must long to see should you grant my request and not disapprove of my manner of employing your bounty i would leave england this autumn and pass the winter at lausanne with m de voltaire and my old friends the armies no longer obstruct my passage and it must be indifferent to you whether i am at lausanne or at london during the winter since i shall not be at beriton in the spring i would cross the alps and after some stay in italy as the war must then be terminated return home through france to live happily with you and my dear mother i am now twoandtwenty a tour must take up a considerable time and though i believe you have no thoughts of settling me soon and i am sure i have not yet so many things may intervene that the man who does not travel early runs a great risk of not traveling at all but this part of my scheme as well as the whole i submit entirely to you  permit me dear sir to add that i do not know whether the complete compliance with my wishes could increase my love and gratitude but that i am very sure no refusal could diminish those sentiments with which i shall always remain dear sir  your most dutiful and obedient son and servant e gibbon junior  no xiii mr mallet to mr gibbon      dear sir i could not procure you a

la justesse des observations  caylus    i read with as much eagerness as pleasure the excellent and agreeable work with which the author presented me i speak as if mr gibbon had not praised me and that too warmly his work is that of a real man of letters who loves them for their own sake without exception or prejudice and who unites with much talent the more precious gift of good sense and an impartiality that displays his candor and justice in spite of the bias that he must have received from the innumerable authors whom he has read and studied i have therefore perused with the greatest avidity this little work and wish that it was more extensive and read universally  i would also express my thanks to lady hervey for making me acquainted with an author who proves in every page that learning is hostile only to ignorance and prejudice who deserves to have a maty for his friend and who adds honor and strength to our language by the use which he so ably makes of it were i more

now in the press appears i would have you study that book well in the mean time recapitulate clairaut and lhopital so far as you have gone and then go through the remainder of the marquiss books with care the fifth book will be an introduction to the analyze des infiniment petits to which i would advise you to proceed after finishing the conic sections the infiniment petits may want a comment crousaz has written one but it is a wretched performance he did not understand the first principles of the science he undertook to illustrate and his geometry shows that he did not understand the first principles of geometry there is a posthumous work of m varignons called eclaircissemens sur l analyze des infiniment petits paris       to this will be often of use to you however it must be owned that the notion of the infiniment petits or infinitesimals as we call them is too bold an assumption and too remote from the principles of the ancients our masters in geometry and has given a handle to an ingenious author berkeley late bishop of cloyne to attack the logic of modern mathematicians he has been answered by many but by none so clearly as by mr maclaurin in his fluxions   vols in  to where you will meet with a collection of the most valuable discoveries in the mathematical and physicomathematical sciences i recommend this author to you but whether you ought to read him immediately after m de lhopital may be a question i think you may be satisfied at first with reading his introduction and chap   book i of the grounds of the method of fluxions and then proceed to chap    of the same book     to  0  inclusive where he treats of the method of infinitesimals and of the limits of ratios you may then read chap   book ii     to     inclusive and this you may do immediately after reading the first section of the analyze des infiniment petits or if you please you may postpone a critical inquiry into the principles of infinitesimals and fluxions till you have seen the use and application of this doctrine in the drawing of tangents and in finding the maxima and minima of geometrical magnitudes annal des infin pet   and    when you have read the beginning of lhopitals  th sect to sect    inclusive you may read maclaurins chap     and   where he fully explains the nature of these higher orders of fluxions and applies the notion to geometrical figures your principles being then firmly established you may finish m de lhopital  your next step must be to the inverse method of fluxions called by the french calcul integral monsieur de bougainville has given us a treatise upon this subject paris       to under the title traite du calcul integral pour servir de suite a l analyze des infiniment petits you should have it but though he explains the methods hitherto found out for the determination of fluents from given fluxions or in the french style pour trouver les integrales des differences donnees yet as he has not shown the use and application of this doctrine as de lhopital did with respect to that part which he treats of m de bougainvilles book is for that reason not so well suited to beginners as could be wished you may therefore take carres book in  to printed at paris   00 and entitled method pour la mesure des surfaces etc par l application du calcul integral only i must caution you against depending upon him in his fourth section where he treats of the center of oscillation and percussion he having made several mistakes there as m de mairan has shown p     mem de l acad royale des sciences edit paris      after carre you may read bougainville  i have recommended french authors to you because you are a thorough master of that language and because by their studying style and clearness of expression they seem to me best adapted to beginners our authors are often profound and acute but their laconisms and neglect of expression often perplex beginners i except mr maclaurin who is very clear but then he has such a vast variety of matter that a great part of his book is on that account too difficult for a beginner i might recommend other authors to you as a course of elements for instance you might read mr thomas simpsons geometry algebra trigonometry and fluxions all which contain a great variety of good things in his geometry he departs from euclid without a sufficient reason however you may read him after dr robert simsons euclid or together with it and take notice of what is new in thomas simpson his algebra you may join with clairaut and the rather that clairaut has been sparing of particular problems and has besides omitted several useful applications of algebra simpsons fluxions may go hand in hand with lhopital maclaurin carre and bougainville if you come to have a competent knowledge of these authors you will be far advanced and you may proceed to the works of newton cotes the bernoullis dr moivre etc as your inclination and time will permit sir isaac newtons treatise of the quadrature of curves has been well commented by mr stewart and is of itself a good institution of fluxions sir isaacs algebra is commented in several places by clairaut and in more in maclaurins algebra and newtons famous principia are explained by the minims jacquirs et le seur geneva   vols  to cotes is explained by don walmesley in his analyze des mesures etc paris  to you see you may find work enough but my paper bids me subscribe myself dear sir  leicestersquare may        your most obedient servant geo lewis scott p s but i recollect a little late that the books i have mentioned excepting newtons principia and the occasional problems in the rest treat only of the abstract parts of the mathematics and you are no doubt willing to look into the concrete parts or what is called mixed mathematics and the physicomathematical sciences of these the principal are mechanics optics and astronomy as to the principles of mechanics m dalembert has recommended m trabauds principes du mouvement et de lequilibre to beginners and you cannot do better than to study this book in optics we have dr smiths complete system   vols  to i wish though we had a good institution short and clear the doctors book entering into too great details for beginners however you may consider his first book or popular treatise as an institution and you will from thence acquire a good deal of knowledge in astronomy i recommend m le monniers institutions astronomiques in  to paris      it is a translation from keils astronomical lectures but with considerable additions you should also have cassinis elemens d astronomy   vols  to as to the physical causes of the celestial motions after having read maclaurins account of sir isaac newtons philosophical discoveries and dr pembertons view of sir isaacs philosophy you may read the great author himself with the comment but if you read maclaurins fluxions throughout you will find many points of sir isaacs philosophy well explained there they theory of light and colors should be studied in sir isaac himself in the english edition of his optics  vo there is a branch of the optical sciences which i have not mentioned that is perspective dr brook taylors is the best system but his style and expression is embarrassed and obscure labbe de la caille has also given a good treatise of perspective at the end of his optique these are of use to painters but the theory of mathematical projection in general is more extensive and has been well treated of by old writers clavius aguillonius tacquet and de chules and lately m de la caille has given a memoir among those of the acad roy des sciences of paris anno      sur le calcul des projections en general this subject is necessary for the understanding of the theory of maps and planispheres mathematicians have also applied their art to the theory of sounds and music dr smiths harmonics is the principal book of the kind  thus have i given you some account of the principal elementary authors in the different branches of mathematical knowledge and it were much to be wished that we had a complete institution or course of all these things of a moderate size which might serve as an introduction to all the good original authors wolfius attempted this his intention was laudable but his book is so full of errors of the press besides some of his own that i cannot recommend him to a beginner he might be used occasionally for the signification of terms and for many historical facts relating to mathematics and besides may be considered as a collector of problems which is useful  besides the books i have mentioned it might be of use to you to have m montuclas histoire des mathematiques in  to   vols you will there find a history of the progress of the mathematical sciences and some account of the principal authors relating to this subject  i mentioned to you in conversation the superior elegance of the ancient method of demonstration if you incline to examine this point after being well versed in euclid you may proceed to dr simsons conic sections and to form an idea of the ancient analysis or method of investigating the solution of geometrical problems read euclids data which dr simson will publish together with his new edition of euclid and then read his loci plani in  to the elegance of the method of the ancients is confessed but it seems to require the remembrance of a great multitude of propositions and in complicated problems it does not seem probable that it can be extended so far as the algebraic method    no xv edward gibbon esquire to mrs gibbon beriton paris february the   th      dear madam you remember our agreement  short and frequent letters the first part of the treaty you have no doubt of my observing i think i ought not to leave you any of the second a propos of treaty our definitive one was signed here yesterday and this morning the duke of bridgewater and mr neville went for london with the news of it the plenipotentiaries sat up till ten oclock in the morning at the ambassador of spains ball and then went to sign this treaty which regulates the fate of europe  paris in most respects has fully answered my expectations i have a number of very good acquaintance which increase every day for nothing is so easy as the making them here instead of complaining of the want of them i begin already to think of making a choice next sunday for instance i have only three invitations to dinner either in the houses you are already acquainted you meet with people who ask you to come and see them or some of your friends offer themselves to introduce you when i speak of these connections i mean chiefly for dinner and the evening suppers as yet i am pretty much a stranger to and i fancy shall continue so for paris is divided into two species who have but little communication with each other the one who is chiefly connected with the men of letters dine very much at home are glad to see their friends and pass the evenings till about nine in agreeable and rational conversation the others are the most fashionable sup in numerous parties and always play or rather game both before and after supper you may easily guess which sort suits me best indeed madam we may say what we please of the frivolity of the french but i do assure you that in a fortnight passed at paris i have heard more conversation worth remembering and seen more men of letters among the people of fashion than i had done in two or three winters in london  amongst my acquaintance i cannot help mentioning m helvetius the author of the famous book de l esprit i met him at dinner at madame geoffrins where he took great notice of me made me a visit next day has ever since treated me not in a polite but a friendly manner besides being a sensible man an agreeable companion and the worthiest creature in the world he has a very pretty wife an hundred thousand livres a year and one of the best tables in paris the only thing i dislike in him is his great attachment to and admiration for     whose character is indeed at paris beyond any thing you can conceive to the great civility of this foreigner who was not obliged to take the least notice of me i must just contrast the behavior of        no xvi mr gibbon to his father paris february         dear sir i received your letter about twelve days after its date owing as i apprehend to mr foleys negligence my direction is a monsieur monsieur gibbon gentilhomme anglois a l hotel de londres rue de columbier fauxbourg st germains a paris you see i am still in that part of the town and indeed from all the intelligence i could collect i saw no reason to change either on account of cheapness or pleasantness madame bontems mrs mallets friend and a marquis de mirabeau i got acquainted with at her house have acted a very friendly part though all their endeavors have only served to convince me that paris is unavoidably a very dear place i am sorry to find my english clothes look very foreign the french are now excessively longwaisted at present we are in mourning for the bishop of liege the kings uncle and expect soon another of a singular nature for the old pretender who is very ill they mourn for him not as a crowned head but as a relation of the kings i am doubtful how the english here will behave indeed we can have no difficulties since we need only follow the example of the duke of bedford  i have now passed nearly a month in this place and i can say with truth that it has answered my most sanguine expectations the buildings of every kind the libraries the public diversions take up a great part of my time and i have already found several houses where it is both very easy and very agreeable to be acquainted lady harveys recommendation to madame geoffrin was a most excellent one her house is a very good one regular dinners there every wednesday and the best company of paris in men of letters and people of fashion it was at her house i connected myself with m helvetius who from his heart his head and his fortune is a most valuable man  at his house i was introduced to the baron dolbach who is a man of parts and fortune and has two dinners every week the other houses i am known in are the duchess d aiguillons madame la comtesse de froulays madame du bocage madame boyer m le marquis de mirabeau and m de foucemagn all these people have their different merit in some i meet with good dinners in others societies for the evening and in all good sense entertainment and civility which as i have no favors to ask or business to transact with them is sufficient for me their men of letters are as affable and communicative as i expected my letters to them did me no harm but were very little necessary my book had been of great service to me and the compliments i have received upon it would make me insufferably vain if i laid any stress on them when i take notice of the civilities i have received i must take notice too of what i have seen of a contrary behavior you know how much i always built upon the count de caylus he has not been of the least use to me with great difficulty i have seen him and that is all i do not however attribute his behavior to pride or dislike to me but solely to the mans general character which seems to be a very odd one de la motte mrs mallets friend has behaved very drily to me though i have dined with him twice but i can forgive him a great deal in consideration of his having introduced me to m daugny mrs mallets son her men are generally angels or devils but here i really think without being very prone to admiration that she has said very little too much of him as far as i can judge he has certainly an uncommon degree of understanding and knowledge and i believe a great fund of honor and probity we are very much together and i think our intimacy seems to be growing into a friendship next sunday we go to versailles the kings guard is done by a detachment from paris which is relieved every four days and as he goes upon this command it is a very good occasion for me to see the palace i shall not neglect at the same time the opportunity of informing myself of the french discipline  the great news at present is the arrival of a very extraordinary person from the isle of france in the east indies an obscure frenchman who was lately come into the island being very ill and given over said that before he died he must discharge his conscience of a great burden he had upon it and declared to several people he was the accomplice of damien and the very person who held the horses unluckily for him the man recovered after this declaration was immediately sent prisoner to paris and is just landed at port lorient from whence he is daily expected here to unravel the whole mystery of that dark affair this story which at first was laughed at has now gained entire credit and i apprehend must be founded on real fact  a lady of miss carylls acquaintance has desired me to convey the enclosed letter to her you will be so good as to send it over to ladyholt i hope i need say nothing of my sentiments toward our friends at beriton nor of my readiness to execute any of their commands here  i am dear sir most affectionately yours e gibbon  no xvii mr gibbon to mr holroyd at lausanne boromean islands may the   th      dear holroyd hurry of running about time taken up with seeing places etc etc etc are excellent excuses but i fancy you will guess that my laziness and aversion to writing to my best friend are the real motives and i am afraid you will have guessed right  we are at this minute in a most magnificent palace in the middle of a vast lake ranging about suites of rooms without a soul to interrupt us and secluded from the rest of the universe we shall sit down in a moment to supper attended by all the counts household this is the fine side of the medal turn to the reverse we are got here wet to the skin we have crawled about fine gardens which rain and fogs prevented our seeing and if tomorrow does not hold up a little better we shall be in some doubt whether we can say we have seen these famous islands guise says yes and i say no the count is not here we have our supper from a paultry hedge alehouse excuse the bull and the servants have offered us beds in the palace pursuant to their masters directions  i hardly think you will like turin the court is old and dull and in that country every one follows the example of the court the principal amusement seems to be driving about in your coach in the evening and bowing to the people you meet if you go while the royal family is there you have the additional pleasure of stopping to salute them every time they pass i had that advantage fifteen times one afternoon we were presented to a lady who keeps a public assembly and a very mournful one it is the few women that go to it are each taken up by their cicisbeo and a poor englishman who can neither talk piedmontois nor play at faro stands by himself without one of their haughty nobility doing him the honor of speaking to him you must not attribute this account to our not having staid long enough to form connections it is a general complaint of our countrymen except of lord  who has been engaged for about two years in the service of a lady whose long nose is her most distinguishing fine feature the most sociable women i have met with are the kings daughters i chatted for about a quarter of an hour with them talked about lausanne and grew so very free and easy that i drew my snuff box rapped it took snuff twice a crime never known before in the presence chamber and continued my discourse in my usual attitude of my body bent forwards and my fore singer stretched out this attitude continued to be characteristic of mr gibbon the engraving in the frontispiece of the memoirs is taken from the figure of mr gibbon cut with scissars by mrs brown thirty years after the date of this letter the extraordinary talents of this lady have furnished as complete a likeness of mr gibbon as to person face and manner as can be conceived yet it was done in his absence  as it might however have been difficult to keep up this acquaintance i chiefly employ my time in seeing places which fully repaid me in pleasure the trouble of my journey what entertained me the most was the museum and the citadel the first is under the care of a m bartoli who received us without any introduction in the politest manner in the world and was of the greatest service to us as i dare say he will be to you the citadel is a stupendous work and when you have seen the subterraneous part of it you will scarcely think it possible such a place can ever be taken as it is however a regular one it does not pique my curiosity so much as those irregular fortifications hewn out of the alps as exiles fenestrelles and the brunette would have done could we have spared the time necessary our next stage from turin has been milan where we were mere spectators as it was not worth while to endeavor at forming connections for so very few days i think you will be surprised at the great church but infinitely more so at the regiment of baden which is in the citadel such steadiness such alertness in the men and such exactness in the officers as exceeded all my expectations next friday i shall see the regiment reviewed by general serbelloni perhaps i may write a particular letter about it from milan we proceed to genoa and thence to florence you stare  but really we find it so inconvenient to travel like mutes and to lose a number of curious things for want of being able to assist our eyes with our tongues that we have resumed our original plan and leave venice for next year i think i should advise you to do the same  milan may   th      the next morning was not fair but however we were able to take a view of the islands which by the help of some imagination we conclude to be a very delightful though not an enchanted place i would certainly advise you to go there from milan which you may very well perform in a day and half upon our return we found lord tilney and some other english in their way to venice we heard a melancholy piece of news from them byng died at bologna a few days ago of a fever i am sure you will be all very sorry to hear it  we expect a volume of news from you in relation to lausanne and in particular to the alliance of the duchess with the frog is it already concluded how does the bride look after her great revolution pray embrace her and the adorable if you can in both our names and assure them as well as all the spring the society of young ladies mentioned in the memoirs  that we talk of them very often but particularly of a sunday and that we are so disconsolate that we have neither of us commenced cicisbeos as yet whatever we may do at florence we have drank the duchesss health not forgetting the little woman on the top of mount cenis in the middle of the lago maggiore etc etc i expect some account of the said little woman who is my successor i think  had began to supplant me before i went i expect your answer at florence and your person at rome which the lord grant amen  no xviii mr gibbon to mr holroyd at berlin beriton october   st      dear holroyd why did i not leave a letter for you at marseilles for a very plain reason because i did not go to marseilles but as you have most judiciously added why did not i send one humph i own that nonplusses me a little however hearken to my history after revolving a variety of plans and suiting them as well as possible to time and finances guise and i at last agreed to pass from venice to lions swim down the rhone wheel round the south of france and embark at bourdeaux alas at lions i received letters which convinced me that i ought no longer to deprive my country of one of her greatest ornaments unwillingly i obeyed left guise to execute alone the remainder of our plan passed about ten delicious days at paris and arrived in england about the end of june guise followed me about two months afterward as i was informed by an epistle from him which to his great astonishment i immediately answered you perceive there is still some virtue amongst men exempli gratia your letter is dated vienna october   th      it made its appearance at beriton wednesday evening october the   th i am at this present writing sitting in my library on thursday morning between the hours of twelve and one i have ventured to suppose you still at berlin if not i presume you take care that your letters should follow you this ideal march to berlin is the only one i can make at present i am under command and were i to talk of a third fally as yet i know some certain people who would think it just as ridiculous as the third sally of the renowned don quixote all i ever hoped for was to be able to take the field once more after lying quiet a couple of years i must own that your executing your tour in so complete a manner gives me a little selfish if i make a summers escape to berlin i cannot hope for the companion i flattered myself with i am sorry however i have said so much but as it is difficult to increase your honors proper notions of your own perfections i will even let it stand indeed i owed you something for your account of the favorable reception my book has met with i see there are people of taste at vienna and no longer wonder at your liking it since the court is so agreeable a thorough reformation must have taken place the stiffness of the austrian etiquette and the haughty magnificence of the hungarian princes must have given way to more civilized notions you have no doubt informed yourself of the forces and revenues of the empress i think however unfashionably we always esteemed her have you lost or improved that opinion princes like pictures to be admired must be seen in their proper point of view which is often a pretty distant one i am afraid you will find it peculiarly so at berlin  i need not desire you to pay a most minute attention to the austrian and prussian discipline you have been bit by a mad sergeant as well as myself and when we meet we shall run over every particular which we can approve blame or imitate since my arrival i have assumed the august character of major received returns issued orders etc etc etc i do not intend you shall have the honor of reviewing my troops next summer three fourths of the men will be recruits and during my pilgrimage discipline seems to have been relaxed but i summon you to fulfill another engagement make me a visit next summer you will find here a bad house a pleasant country in summer some books and very little strange company such a plan of life for two or three months must i should imagine suit a man who has been for as many years struck from one end of europe to the other like a tennisball at least i judge of you by myself i always loved a quiet studious indolent life but never enjoyed the charms of it so truly as since my return from an agreeable but fatiguing course of motion and hurry however i shall hear of your arrival which can scarcely be so soon as january      and shall probably have the misfortune of meeting you in town soon after we may then settle any plans for the ensuing campaign  en attendant admire me this is the only scrap of foreign lingo i have imported into this epistle  if you had seen that of guise to me let me tell you a piece of lausanne news nanette grand is married to lieutenant colonel prevot grand wrote to me and by the next post i congratulated both father and daughter there is exactness for you the curchod madame necker i saw at paris she was very fond of me and the husband particularly civil could they insult me more cruelly ask me every evening to supper go to bed and leave me alone with his wife  what an impertinent security it is making an old lover of mighty little consequence she is as handsome as ever and much genteeler seems pleased with her fortune rather than proud of it i was perhaps indiscreetly enough exalting nanette dillenss good luck and the fortune what fortune said she with an air of contempt  not above twenty thousand livres a year i smiled and she caught herself immediately  what airs i give myself in despising twenty thousand livres a year who a year ago looked upon eight hundred as the summit of my wishes  i must end this tedious scrawl let me hear from you i think i deserve it believe me dear holroyd i share in all your pleasures and feel all your misfortunes poor bolton i saw it in the newspaper is ridley with you i suspect not but if he is assure him i do not forget him though he does me adieu and believe me most affectionately yours  e gibbon junior  no xix edward gibbon esquire to j holroyd esquire beriton april         dear holroyd i happened tonight to stumble upon a very odd piece of intelligence in the st jamess chronicle it related to the marriage of a certain monsieur olroy the name was so spelt in the newspapers  formerly captain of hussars i do not know how it came into my head that this captain of hussars was not unknown to me and that he might possibly be an acquaintance of yours if i am not mistaken in my conjecture pray give my compliments to him and tell him from me that i am at least as well pleased that he is married as if i were so myself assure him however that though as a philosopher i may prefer celibacy yet as a politician i think it highly proper that the species should be propagated by the usual method assure him even that i am convinced that if celibacy is exposed to fewer miseries marriage can alone promise real happiness since domestic enjoyments are the source of every other good may such happiness which is bestowed on few be given to him the transient blessings of beauty and the more durable ones of fortune good sense and an amiable disposition  i can easily conceive and as easily excuse you if you have thought mighty little this winter of your poor rusticated friend i have been confined ever since christmas and confined by a succession of very melancholy occupations i had scarcely arrived at beriton where i proposed staying only about a fortnight when a brother of mrs gibbons died unexpectedly though after a very long and painful illness we were scarcely recovered from the confusion which such an event must produce in a family when my father was taken dangerously ill and with some intervals has continued so ever since i can assure you my dear holroyd that the same event appears in a very different light when the danger is serious and immediate or when in the gaiety of a tavern dinner we affect an insensibility that would do us no great honor were it real my father is now much better but i have since been assailed by a severe stroke  the loss of a friend you remember perhaps an officer of our militia whom i sometimes used to compare to yourself indeed the comparison would have done honor to any one his feelings were tender and noble and he was always guided by them his principles were just and generous and he acted up to them i shall say no more and you will excuse my having said so much of a man with whom you were unacquainted but my mind is just now so very full of him that i cannot easily talk or even think of any thing else if i know you right you will not be offended at my weakness  what rather adds to my uneasiness is the necessity i am under of joining our militia the day after tomorrow though the lively hurry of such a scene might contribute to divert my ideas yet every circumstance of it and the place itself which was that of his residence will give me many a painful moment i know nothing would better raise my spirits than a visit from you the request may appear unseasonable but i think i have heard you speak of an uncle you had near southampton at all events i hope you will snatch a moment to write to me and give me some account of your present situation and future designs as you are now fettered i should expect you will not be such a hic et ubique the motto of the regiment called royal foresters in which mr holroyd had been captain  as you have been since your arrival in england i stay at southampton from the first to the twentyeighth of may and then propose making a short visit to town if you are any where in the neighborhood of it you may depend upon seeing me i shall then concert measures for seeing a little more of you next winter than i have lately done as i hope to take a pretty long spell in town i suppose guise has often fallen in your way he has never once written to me nor i to him in the country we want materials and in london we want time i ought to recollect that you even want time to read my unmeaning scrawl believe however my dear holroyd that it is the sincere expression of a heart entirely yours  no xx edward gibbon esquire to j b holroyd esquire beriton october         dear holroyd i received your agreeable missive about two days ago and am glad to find that after all your errors you are at last a settled man i do most sincerely regret that it is not in my power to obey your immediate summons some very particular business will not at present permit me to be long absent from beriton the same business will carry me to town about the sixth of next month for some days on my return i do really hope and intend to storm your castle before christmas as i presume you will hardly remove sooner i should be glad to meet cambridge but the plain dish of friendship will satisfy me without the seasoning of attic wit do you know any thing of guise have you no inclination to look at the russians we have a bed at your service vale  present my sincere respects to those who are dear to you believe me they are so to me  no xxi the same to the same pall mall dec         dear holroyd some demon the enemy of friendship seems to have determined that we shall not meet at sheffieldplace i was fully resolved to make amends for my lazy scruples and to dine with you tomorrow when i received a letter this day from my father which irresistibly draws me to beriton for about ten days the abovementioned demon though he may defer my projects shall not however disappoint them since you intend to pass the winter in retirement it will be a far greater compliment to quit active gay political london than the drowsy desert london of the holidays but i retract what is both pleasing and sincere is above that prostituted word compliment believe me  most sincerely yours a propos i forgot the compliments of the season etc etc  no xxii the same to the same october        dear holroyd i sit down to answer your epistle after taking a very pleasant ride  a ride and upon what  upon a horse  you lie  i dont  i have got a droll little poney and intend to renew the long forgotten practice of equitation as it was known in the world before the second of june of the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and sixtythree as i used to reason against riding so i can now argue for it and indeed the principal use i know in human reason is when called upon to furnish arguments for what we have an inclination to do  what do you mean by presuming to affirm that i am of no use here farmer gibbon of no use last week i sold all my hops and i believe well at nine guineas a hundred to a very responsible man some people think i might have got more at weyhill fair but that would have been an additional expense and a great uncertainty our quantity has disappointed us very much but i think that besides hops for the family there will not be less than  00 l  no contemptible sum off thirteen small acres and two of them planted last year only this week i let a little farm in petersfield by auction and propose raising it from   l to   l per annum and farmer gibbon of no use  to be serious i have but one reason for resisting your invitation and my own wishes that is mrs gibbon i left nearly alone all last winter and shall do the same this she submits very cheerfully to that state of solitude but on sounding her i am convinced that she would think it unkind were i to leave her at present i know you so well that i am sure you will acquiesce in this reason and let me make my next visit to sheffieldplace from town which i think may be a little before christmas i should like to hear something of the precise time duration and extent of your intended tour into bucks adieu  no xxiii edward gibbon esquire to j b holroyd esquire beriton nov         most respectable south saxon it would ill become me to reproach a dilatory correspondent quis tulerit gracchos de seditione querentes especially when that correspondent had given me hopes of undertaking a very troublesome expedition for my sole advantage yet thus much i may say that i am obliged very soon to go to town upon other business which in that hope i have hitherto deferred if by next sunday i have no answer or if i hear that your journey to denham is put off sine die or to a long day i shall on monday set off for london and wait your future will with faith hope and charity adieu  no xxiv edward gibbon esquire to john baker holroyd esquire sheffieldplace london      dear holroyd the sudden change from the sobriety of sheffieldplace to the irregularities of this town and to the wicked company of wilbraham clarke damer etc having deranged me a good deal i am forced to employ one of my secretaries to acquaint you with a piece of news i know nothing about myself it is certain some extraordinary intelligence is arrived this morning from denmark and as

worcester to mr gibbon thurcaston august   th      your very elegant letter on the antiquity and authenticity of the book of daniel just now received finds me here if not without leisure yet without books and therefore in no condition to enter far into the depths of this controversy which indeed is the less necessary as every thing that relates to the subject will come of course to be considered by my learned successors in the new lecture for as the prophecies of daniel make an important link in that chain which as you say has been let down from heaven to earth but not by the author of the late sermons who brought into view only what he had not invented the grounds on which their authority rests will without doubt be carefully examined and as i suppose firmly established  but in the mean time and to make at least some small return for the civility of your address to me i beg leave to trouble you with two or three short remarks such as occur to me on reading your letter  your main difficulties are these two   that the author of the book of daniel is too clear for a prophet as appears from his prediction of the persian and macedonian affairs and   too fabulous for a contemporary historian as is evident you suppose from his mistakes particularly in the sixth chapter    the first of these difficulties is an extraordinary one for why may not prophecy if the inspirer think fit be as clear as history scriptural prophecy whence your idea of its obscurity is taken is occasionally thus clear i mean after the event and daniels prophecy of the revolutions in the grecian empire would have been obscure enough to porphyry himself before it  but your opinion after all when you come to explain yourself really is as one should expect that as a prophet daniel is not clear enough for you enforce the old objection of porphyry by observing that where a pretended prophecy is clear to a certain point of time and afterward obscure and shadowy there common sense leads one to conclude that the author of it was an impostor  this reasoning is plausible but not conclusive unless it be taken for granted that a prophecy must in all its parts be equally clear and precise whereas on the supposition of real inspiration it may be fit i mean it may suit with the views of the inspirer to predict some things with more perspicuity and in terms more obviously and directly applicable to the events in which they were fulfilled than others but further this reasoning whatever force it may have has no place here at least you evidently beg the question when you urge it because the persons you dispute against maintain that the subsequent prophecies of daniel are equally distinct with those preceding ones concerning the persian and macedonian empires at least so much of them as they take to have been fulfilled and that to judge of the rest we must wait for the conclusion of them  however you admit that the suspicion arising from the clearest prophecy may be removed by direct positive evidence that it was composed before the event but then you carry your notions of that evidence very far when you require that the existence of such a prophecy prior to its accomplishment should be proved by the knowledge of its being generally diffused amongst an enlightened nation previous to that period and its public existence attested by an unbroken chain of authentic writers  what you here claim as a matter of right is without question very desirable but should i think be accepted if it be given at all as a matter of favor for what you describe is the utmost evidence that the case admits but what right have we in this or any other subject whatever of natural or revealed religion to the utmost evidence is it not enough that the evidence be sufficient to induce a reasonable assent and is not that assent reasonable which is given to real evidence though of an inferior kind when uncontrolled by any greater and such evidence we clearly have for the authenticity of the book of daniel in the reception of it by the jewish nation down to the time of jesus whose appeal to it supposes and implies that reception to have been constant and general not to observe that the testimony of jesus is further supported by all the considerations that are alleged for his own divine character to this evidence which is positive so far as it goes you have nothing to oppose but surmise and conjectures that is nothing that deserves to be called evidence but i doubt sir you take for granted that the claim of inspiration is never to be allowed so long as there is a possibility of supposing that it was not given  ii in the second division of your letter which is longer and more elaborate than the first you endeavor to show that the historical part of the book of daniel chiefly that of the sixth chapter is false and fabulous and as such confutes and overthrows the prophetical what you advance on this head is contained under five articles    you think it strange that daniel or any other man should be promoted to a secret office of state for his skill in divination  but here first you forget that joseph was thus promoted for the same reason or if you object to this instance what should hinder the promotion either of joseph or daniel when their skill in divination had once brought them to the notice and favor of their sovereign for what you call mere human accomplishments for such assuredly both these great men possessed if we may believe the plain part of their story which asserts of joseph and indeed proves that he was in no common degree discreet and wise and of daniel that an excellent spirit was found in him nay that he had knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom over and above his understanding in all visions and dreams in short sir though princes of old might not make it a rule to choose their ministers out of their soothsayers yet neither would their being soothsayers if they were otherwise well accomplished prevent them from being ministers just as in modern times though churchmen have not often i will suppose been made officers of state even by bigotten princes because they were churchmen yet neither have they been always excluded from serving in those stations when they have been found eminently qualified for them    your next exception is that a combination could scarce have been formed in the court of babylon against the favorite minister though such factions are common in other courts because the courtiers of darius must have apprehended that the piety of daniel would be asserted by a miraculous interposition of which they had seen a recent instance and here sir you expatiate with a little too much complacency on the strange indifference which the ancient world showed to the gift of miracles you do not i dare say expect a serious answer to this charge or if you do it may be enough to observe what i am sure your own reading and experience must have rendered very familiar to you that the strongest belief or conviction of the mind perpetually gives way to the inflamed selfish passions and that when men have any scheme of interest or revenge much at heart they are not restrained from pursuing it though the scaffold and the axe stand before them in full view and have perhaps been streaming but the day before with the blood of other statecriminals i ask not whether miracles have ever actually existed but whether you do not think that multitudes have been firmly persuaded of their existence and yet their indifference about them is a fact which i readily concede to you    your third criticism is directed against what is said of the law of the medes and persians that it alters not where i find nothing to admire but the extreme rigor of asiatic despotism for i consider this irrevocability of the law when once promulgated by the sovereign not as contrived to be a check on his will but rather to show the irresistible and fatal course of it and this idea was so much cherished by the despots of persia that rather than revoke the iniquitous law obtained by surprise for exterminating the jews ahasuerus took the part as we read in the book of esther and as baron montesquieu i remember observes to permit the jews to defend themselves against the execution of it whence we see how consistent this law is with the determination of the judges quoted by you from herodotus that it was lawful for the king to do whatever he pleased for we understand that he did not please that this law when once declared by him should be altered  you add under this head may i not assert that the greek writers who have so copiously treated of the affairs of persia have not left us the smallest vestige of a restraint equally injurious to the monarch and prejudicial to the people i have not the greek writers by me to consult but a common book i chance to have at hand refers me to one such vestige in a very eminent greek historian diodorus siculus lowths comment in loc    a fourth objection to the historic truth of the book of daniel is taken with more plausibility from the matter of this law which as you truly observe was very strange for the kings counselor to advise and for any despot whatever to enact  but   i a little question whether prayer was so constant and considerable a part of pagan worship as is supposed and if it was not the prejudices of the people would not be so much shocked by this interdict as we are ready to think daniel indeed prayed three times a day but the idolaters might content themselves with praying now and then at a stated solemnity it is clear that when you speak of depriving men of the comforts and priests of the profits of religion you have christian and even modern principles and manners in your eye perhaps in the comforts you represented to yourself a company of poor inflamed huguenots under persecution and in the profits the lucrative trade of popish masses but be this as it may it should be considered   that this law could not in the nature of the thing suppress all prayer if the people had any great propensity to it it could not suppress mental prayer it could not even suppress bodily worship if performed as it easily might be in the night or in secret daniel it was well known was used to pray in open daylight and in a place exposed to inspection from his usual manner of praying which manner it was easily concluded so zealous a votary as he was would not change or discontinue on account of the edict lastly though the edict passed for thirty days to make sure work yet there was no doubt but the end proposed would be soon accomplished and then it was not likely that much care would be taken about the observance of it  all this put together i can very well conceive that extreme envy and malice in the courtiers might suggest the idea of such a law and that an impotent despot might be flattered by it certainly if what we read in the third chapter be admitted that one of these despots required all people nations and languages to worship his image on pain of death there is no great wonder that another of them should demand the exclusive worship of himself for a month nay perhaps he might think himself civil and even bounteous to his gods when he left them a share of the other eleven for as to the presumption nihil est quod credere de se non possit cum laudatur diis aequa potestas      a fifth and what you seem to think the strongest objection to the credit of the book of daniel is that no such person as darius the mede is to be found in the succession of the babylonish princes you mean as given in ptolemys canon and the greek writers between the time of nebuchadnezzar and that of cyrus in saying this you do not forget or disown what our ablest chronologers have said on the subject but then you object that xenophons cyaxares to serve a turn has been made to personate darius the mede and yet that xenophons book whether it be a romance or a true history overturns the use which they have made of this hypothesis  i permit myself perhaps to be too much flattered by your civility in referring me to my own taste rather than to the authority of cicero but the truth is i am much disposed to agree with you that if we unravel with any care the sine texture of the cyropoedia we shall discover in every thread the spartan discipline and the philosophy of socrates but then as the judicious author chose to make so recent a story as that of cyrus and one so well known the vehicle of his political and moral instructions he would be sure to keep up to the truth of the story as far as might be especially in the leading facts and in the principal persons as we may say of the drama this obvious rule of decorum such a writer as xenophon could not fail to observe and therefore on the supposition that his cyropoedia is a romance i should conclude certainly that the outline of it was genuine history but    if it be so you conclude that there is no ground for thinking that darius the mede ever reigned at babylon because cyaxares himself never reigned there  now on the idea of xenophons book being a romance there might be good reason for the authors taking no notice of the short reign of cyaxares which would break the unity of his work and divert the readers attention too much from the hero of it while yet the omission could hardly seem to violate historic truth since the luster of his heros fame and the real power which out of question he reserved to himself would make us forget or overlook cyaxares but as to the fact it seems no way incredible that cyrus should concede to his royal ally his uncle and his fatherinlaw for he was all these the nominal possession of the sovereignty or that he should share the sovereignty with him or at least that he should leave the administration as we say in his hands at babylon while he himself was prosecuting his other conquests at a distance any of these things is supposable enough and i would rather admit any of them than reject the express the repeated the circumstantial testimony of a not confessedly fabulous historian  after all sir i should forfeit i know your good opinion if i did not acknowledge that some at least of these circumstances are such as one should not perhaps expect at first sight but then such is the condition of things here and what is true in human life is not always i had almost said not often that which was previously to be expected whence an ordinary romance is they say more probable than the best history  but should any or all of these circumstances convince you perfectly that some degree of error or fiction is to be found in the book of daniel it would be too precipitate to conclude that therefore the whole book was of no authority for at most you could but infer that the historical part in which those circumstances are observed namely the  th chapter is not genuine just as you know has been judged of some other historical tracts which had formerly been inserted in the book of daniel for it is not with these collections which go under the names of the prophets as with some regularly connected system where a charge of falsehood if made good against one part shakes the credit of the whole fictitious histories may have been joined to true prophecies when all that bore the name of the same person or any way related to him came to be put together in the same volume but the detection of such misalliance could not affect the prophecies certainly not those of daniel which respect the latter times for these have an intrinsic evidence in themselves and assert their own authenticity in proportion as we see or have reason to admit the accomplishment of them  and now sir i have only to commit these hasty reflections to your candor a virtue which cannot be separated from the love of truth and of which i observe many traces in your agreeable letter and if you should indulge this quality still further so as to conceive the possibility of that being true and reasonable in matters of religion which may seem strange or to so lively a fancy as yours even ridiculous you would not hurt the credit of your excellent understanding and would thus remove one perhaps a principal occasion of those mists which as you complain hang over these nice and difficult subjects  i am with true respect sir yours etc signed r h the following fragment was found with the foregoing letter in mr gibbons handwriting your answers to my five objections against the  th chapter of daniel come next to be considered    with regard to daniels promotion i consent to withdraw my opposition and to allow the eases of ximenes wolsey and richlieu as parallel instances though there is surely some difference between a young foreign soothsayer being suddenly rewarded for the interpretation of a dream with the government of babylon and a priest of the established church rising gradually to the great offices of state    you apprehend sir that my second objection scarcely deserves a serious answer and that it is quite sufficient to appeal to my own reading and experience whether the strongest conviction of the mind does not perpetually give way to the inflamed and selfish passions since you appeal to me i shall fairly lay before you the result of my observations on that subject   it must be confessed that the drunkard often sinks into the grave and the prodigal into a gaol without a possibility of deceiving or of checking themselves but they sink by slow degrees and whilst they indulge the ruling passion attend only to the trifling moment of each guinea or of each bottle without calculating their accumulated weight till they feel themselves irretrievably crushed under it   in most of the hazardous interprizes of life there is a mixture of chance and good fortune what is called good fortune is often the effect of skill and as our vanity flatters us into an opinion of our superior merit we are neither surprised nor dismayed by the miscarriage of our rash predecessors the conspirator turns his eyes from the axe and scaffold perhaps still streaming with blood to the successful boldness of sylla of caesar and of cromwell and convinces himself that on such a golden pursuit it is even prudent to stake a precarious and insipid life we may add that the most daring flights of ambition are as often the effects of necessity as of choice the princes of hindostan must either reign or perish and when caesar passed the rubicon it was scarcely possibly for him to return to a private station   you think sir we may learn from our own experience that an indifference concerning miracles is very compatible with a full conviction of their truth and so it undoubtedly is with such a conviction as we have an opportunity of observing    no xxxv e gibbon esquire to j b holroyd esquire beriton oct         dear holroyd i am just arrived as well as yourself at my dii penates but with very different

new world many other men you have undoubtedly seen in the country where you are at present who must have commanded your esteem but when you return if you are not very honest you will possess great advantages over me in any dispute concerning caledonian merit  boodles and atwoods are now no more the last stragglers and godfrey clarke in the rear of all are moved away to their several castles and i now enjoy in the midst of london a delicious solitude my library kensington gardens and a few parties with new acquaintance who are chained to london among whom i reckon goldsmith and sir joshua reynolds fill up my time and the monster ennui preserves a very respectful distance by the bye your friends batt sir john russell and lascelles dined with me one day before they set off for i sometimes give the prettiest little dinner in the world but all this composure draws near its conclusion about the sixteenth of this month mr eliot carries me away and after picking up mrs gibbon at bath sets me down at port eliot there i shall certainly remain six weeks or in other words to the end of september my future motions whether to london derbyshire or a longer stay in cornwall pray is not motion to stay rather in the hibernian style will depend on the life of port eliot the time of the meeting of parliament and perhaps the impatience of mr  lord of lenborough one of my pleasures in town i forgot to mention the unexpected visit of deyverdun who accompanies his young lord very young indeed on a two months tour to england he took the opportunity of the earls going down to the duke of  to spend a fortnight nor do i recollect a more pleasant one in bentinckstreet they are now gone together into yorkshire and i think it doubtful whether i shall see him again before his return to leipsic it is a melancholy reflection that while one is plagued with acquaintance at the corner of every street real friends should be separated from each other by unsurmountable bars and obliged to catch at a few transient moments of interview i desire that you and my lady whom i most respectfully greet would take your share of that very new and acute observation not so large a share indeed as my swiss friend since nature and fortune give us more frequent opportunities of being together you cannot expect news from a desert and such is london at present the papers give you the full harvest of public intelligence and i imagine that the eloquent nymphs of twickenham miss cambridges communicate all the transactions of the polite the amorous and the marrying world the great pantomime of portsmouth was universally admired and i am angry at my own laziness in neglecting an excellent opportunity of seeing it foot has given us the bankrupt a serious and sentimental piece with very severe strictures on the license of scandal in attacking private characters adieu forgive and epistolize me i shall not believe you sincere in the former unless you make bentinckstreet your inn i fear i shall be gone but mrs ford his housekeeper and the parrot will be proud to receive you and my lady after your long peregrination from which i expect great improvements has she got the brogue upon the

have surely finished your tour touched at edinburgh where you found a letter which you have not answered and are now contemplating the beauties of the weald of sussex i shall demand a long and particular account of your peregrinations but will excuse it till we meet and for the present expect only a short memorandum of your health and situation together with that of my muchhonoured friend mrs abigail holroyd a word too if you please concerning father and sister to the latter i enclose a receipt from mrs g who is now with me at port eliot  blind as you accuse me of being to the beauties of nature i am wonderfully pleased with this country of her three dull notes ground plants and water cornwall possesses the first and last in very high perfection think of a hundred solitary streams peacefully gliding between amazing cliffs on one side and rich meadows on the other gradually swelling by the aid of the tide into noble rivers successively losing themselves in each other and all at length terminating in the harbor of plymouth whose broad expanse is irregularly dotted with twoandforty line of battle ships in plants indeed we are deficient and though all the gentlemen now attend to posterity the country will for a long time be very naked we have spent several days agreeably enough in little parties but in general our time rolls away in complete uniformity our landlord possesses neither a pack of hounds nor a stable of running horses nor a large farm nor a good library the last only could interest me but it is singular that a man of fortune who chooses to pass nine months of the year in the country should have none of them  according to our present design mrs g and myself return to bath about the beginning of next month i shall probably make but a short stay with her and defer my derbyshire journey till another year sufficient for the summer is the evil thereof viz one distant country excursion natural inclination the prosecution of my great work and the conclusion of my lenborough business plead strongly in favor of london however i desire and one always finds time for what one really desires to visit sheffieldplace before the end of october should

abstemious as a hermit was destroyed by a stroke of apoplexy in his coach as he was going to dinner he appeared perfectly well and only two days before had very goodnaturedly dined with us at a tavern a thing he had not done for many years before i am the only person clarke wishes to see except his own family and i pass a great part of the day with him a line from you would be kindly received

near farnham in which he has the happiness of having no neighborhood if my esteem and friendship for godfrey had been capable of any addition it would have been very much increased by the manner in which he felt and lamented his fathers death he is now in very different circumstances than before instead of an easy and ample allowance he has taken possession of a great estate with low rents and high encumbrances i hope the one may make amends for the other under your conduct i am sure they would and i have freely offered him your assistance in case he should wish to apply for it  in the mean time i must not forget my own affairs which seem to be covered with inextricable perplexity    as i mentioned about a century ago promised to see    and his attorney and to oil the wheels of the arbitration as yet i have not heard from him i have some thoughts of writing myself to the jockey stating the various steps of the affair and offering him with polite firmness the immediate choice of chancery or arbitration  for the time however i forgot all these difficulties in the present enjoyment of deyverduns company and i glory in thinking that although my house is small it is just of a sufficient size to hold my real friends male and female among the latter my lady holds the very first place  we are all quiet  american business is suspended and almost forgot the other day we had a brisk report of a spanish war it was said they had taken one of our leward islands it since turns out that we are the invaders but the invasion is trifling  bien oblige non at present for your

sinner besides the occasional obstructions of clarke and deyverdun i must entreat you to consider with your usual candor   the aversion to epistolary conversation which it has pleased the demon to implant in my nature   that i am a very fine gentleman a subscriber to the masquerade where you and my lady ought to come and am now writing at boodles in a fine velvet coat with ruffles of my ladys choosing etc   that the aforesaid fine gentleman is likewise an historian and in truth when i am writing a page i do not only think it a sufficient reason for delay but even consider myself as writing for you and that much more to the purpose than if i were sending you the little tattle of the town of which indeed there is none stirring with regard to america the minister seems moderate and the house obedient    s last letter by some unaccountable accident had never reached me so that yours in every instance amazed me i immediately dispatched to him groans and approbation    however gives me very little uneasiness i see that he is a bully and that i have a stick but the cursed business of lenborough in the midst of study dissipation and friendship at times almost distracts me i am surely in a worse situation than before i sold the estate and what distresses me is that  his ego nec metas rerum nec tempora pono  both deyverdun and clarke wish to be remembered to you the former who has more taste for the country than     could wish to visit you but he sets out in a few days for the continent with lord midleton  adieu no li edward gibbon esquire to j holroyd esquire may  th      dear

leaving behind it the fame of the most splendid and elegant fete that was perhaps ever given in a seat of the arts and opulence it would be as difficult to describe the magnificence of the scene as it would be easy to record the humor of the night the one was above the other below all relation i left the pantheon about five this morning rose at ten took a good walk and returned home to a more rational entertainment of batt sir john russell and lascelles who dined with me they have left me this moment and were i to enumerate the things said of sheffield it would form a much longer letter than i have any inclination to write let it suffice that sir john means to pass in sussex the interval of the two terms every thing in a word goes on very pleasantly except the terrestrial business of lenborough last saturday sennight i wrote to     to press him to see    and urge the arbitration he has not condescended to answer me all is a dead calm sometimes more fatal than a storm for gods sake

if the standard of writing and of affection were the same i am sure he would illdeserve it i do not wish to discover how many days i am afraid i ought to use another word have elapsed since the date of my last or even of your last letter and yet such is the sluggish nature of the beast that i am afraid nothing but the arrival of mrs bonfoy and the expectation of mr eliot could have roused me from my lethargy the lady gave me great satisfaction by her general account of your health and spirits but communicated some uneasiness by the mention of a little encounter in the style of one of don quixotes but which proved i hope as trifling as you at first imagined it for my own part i am well in mind and body busy with my books which may perhaps produce something next year either to tire or amuse the world and every day more satisfied with my present mode of life which i always believed was calculated to make me happy my only remaining uneasiness is lenborough which is not terminated by holroyds advice i rather try what may be obtained by a little more patience than rush at once into the horrors of chancery but let us talk of something else mrs porten grows younger every day you remember i think in newmanstreet an agreeable woman miss w  the undersecretary is seriously in love with her and seriously uneasy that his precarious situation precludes him from happiness we shall soon see which will get the better love or reason i bet three to two on love  guess my surprise when mrs gibbon of northamptonshire suddenly communicated her arrival i immediately went to surreystreet where she lodged but though it was no more than half an hour after nine the saint had finished her evening devotions and was already retired to rest yesterday morning by appointment i breakfasted with her at eight oclock dined with her today at two in newmanstreet and am just returned from setting her down she is in truth a very great curiosity her dress and figure exceed any thing we had at the masquerade her language and ideas belong to the last century however in point of religion she was rational that is to say silent i do not believe that she asked a single question or said the least thing concerning it to me she behaved with great cordiality and in her way expressed a great regard  mrs porten tells me that she has just written to you she ought to go to a masquerade once a year

afford in a case that most assuredly ought not to be trifled with do this as you value our good opinion the cantabs are strongly in the same sentiments there can be no apprehensions of late hours etc

melancholy circumstances we are now arrived at the decisive moment of preserving or of losing for ever both our trade and empire we expect next thursday or friday to be a very great day hitherto we have been chiefly employed in reading papers and rejecting petitions petitions were brought from london bristol norwich etc framed by party and designed to delay by the aid of some parliamentary quirks they have been all referred to a separate inactive committee which burke calls a committee of oblivion and are now considered as dead in law i could write you fifty little house of commons

the cause of government which in this instance i think the cause of england i passed about ten days as i designed at uppark i found lord    and fourscore foxhounds  the troubles of beriton are perfectly composed and the insurgents reduced to a state though not a temper of submission you may suppose i heard a great deal of petersfield l  means to convict your friend of bribery to transport

measures lord north rose six times to appease the storm but all in vain till at length sir gilbert declared for administration and the troops all rallied under their proper standard on wednesday we

imagined i should and now find i do like whether the house of commons may ever prove of benefit to myself or country is another question as yet i have been mute in the course of our american affairs i have sometimes had a wish to speak but though i felt tolerably prepared as to the matter i dreaded exposing myself in the manner and remained in my seat safe but inglorious upon the whole though i still believe i shall try i doubt whether nature not that in some instances i am ungrateful has given me the talents of an orator and i feel that i came into parliament much too late to exert them do

days with me on his way deyverdun had left me just before your letter arrived which i shall soon have an opportunity of conveying to him though i flatter myself he broke from me with some degree of uneasiness the engagement could not be declined at the end of four years he has an annuity of one hundred pounds for life and may for the remainder of his days enjoy a decent independence in that country which a philosopher would perhaps prefer to the rest of europe for my own part after the hurry of the town and of parliament i am now retired to my villa in bentinckstreet which i begin to

three times the second twice and all the others have undergone reviews corrections etc as to the tail it is perfectly formed and digested and were i so much given to selfcontent and haste it is almost all written the ecclesiastical part for instance is written out in fourteen sheets which i mean to refondre from beginning to end as to the friendly critic it is very difficult to find one who has leisure candor freedom and knowledge sufficient however batt and deyverdun have read and observed after all the public is the best critic i print no more than five hundred copies of the first edition and the second as it happens frequently to my betters may receive many improvements so much for rome we have nothing new from america but i can venture to assure you that administration is now as

auxiliaries but as mercenaries and that the russian general should be absolutely under the command of the british they daily and hourly expect a messenger and hope to hear that the business is concluded the worst of it is that the baltic will soon be frozen up and that it must be late next year before they can get to america   in the mean time we are not quite easy about canada and even if it should be safe from an attack we cannot flatter ourselves with the expectation of bringing down that martial people on the back settlements the priests are ours the gentlemen very prudently wait the event and are disposed to join the stronger party but the same lawless spirit and impatience of government which have infected our colonies are gone forth among the canadian peasants over whom since the conquest the noblesse have lost much of their ancient influence another thing which will please and surprise is the assurance which i received from a man who might tell me a lie but who could not be mistaken that no arts no management whatsoever have been used to procure the addresses which fill the gazette and that lord north was as much surprised at the first that came up as we could be at sheffield we shall have i suppose some brisk skirmishing in parliament but the business will soon be decided by our superior weight of fire  a propos i believe there has been some vague but serious conversation about calling out the militia the new levies go on very slowly in ireland the dissenters both there and here are violent and active adieu i embrace my lady and maria  no lxvi

i have found but few slips of the press or the pen  the style of the work is clear and every way agreeable and i dare say you will be thought to have written with all due moderation and decency with respect to received at least once received opinions the notes and quotations will add not a little to the value of the work the authority of french writers so familiar to you has not infected you however with the fault of superficial and careless quotations i find since i saw you that i must be in the chair at the excise office tomorrow which service will confine me too much for a week to

public you know we have got eighteen thousand germans from hesse brunswick and hesse darmstadt i think our meeting will be lively a spirited minority and a desponding majority the higher people are placed the more gloomy are their countenances the more melancholy their language you may call this cowardice but i fear it arises from their knowledge a late knowledge of the difficulty and magnitude of the business quebec is not yet taken i hear that carleton is determined never to capitulate with rebels a glorious resolution if it were supported with fifty thousand men adieu i embrace my lady

edinburgh college march             since my last i have read mr gibbons history with much attention and great pleasure it is a work of very high merit indeed he possesses that industry of research without which no man deserves the name of an historian his narrative is perspicuous and interesting his style is elegant and forcible though in some passages i think rather too labored and in others too quaint but these defects are amply compensated by the beauty of the general flow of language and a very peculiar happiness in many of his expressions i have traced him in many of his quotations for experience has taught me to suspect the accuracy of my brother penmen and i find he refers to no passage but what he has seen with his own eyes i hope the book will be as successful as it deserves to be i have not yet read the two last chapters but am sorry from what i have heard of them that he has taken such a tone in them as will give great offense and hurt the sale of the book  no lxxi mr ferguson to mr gibbon edinburgh march   th      dear sir i received about eight days ago after i had been reading your history the copy which you have been so good as to send me and for which i now trouble you with my thanks but even if i had not been thus called upon to offer you my respects i could not have refrained from congratulating you on the merit and undoubted success of this valuable performance the persons of this place whose judgment you will value most agree in opinion that you have made a great addition to the classical literature of england and given us what thucydides proposed leaving with his own countrymen a possession in perpetuity men of a certain modesty and merit always exceed the expectations of their friends and it is with very great pleasure i tell you that although you must have observed in me every mark of consideration and regard that this is nevertheless the case i receive your instruction and study your model with great deference and join with every one else in applauding the extent of your plan in hands so well able to execute it some of your readers i find were impatient to get at the fifteenth chapter and began at that place i have not heard much of their criticism but am told that many doubt of your orthodoxy i wish to be always of the charitable side while i own you have proved that the clearest stream may become foul when it comes to run over the muddy bottom of human nature i have not stayed to make any particular remarks if any should occur on the second reading i shall not fail to lay in my claim to a more needed and more useful admonition from you in case i ever produce any thing that merits your attention and am with the greatest respect dear sir  your most obliged and most humble servant adam ferguson  no lxxii extract of a letter from mr david hume to mr strahan dated edinburgh april  th       i am very much taken with mr gibbons roman history which came from your press and am glad to hear of its success there will no books of reputation now be printed in london but through your hands and mr cadells the author tells me that he is already preparing a second edition i resolved to have given him my advice with regard to the manner of printing it but as i am now writing to you it is the same thing he ought certainly to print the number of the chapter at the head of the margin and it would be better if something of the contents could also be added one is also plagued with his notes according to the present method of printing the book when a note is announced you turn to the end of the volume and there you often find nothing but a reference to an authority all these authorities ought only to be printed at the margin or the bottom of the page i desire a copy of my new edition should be sent to mr gibbon as wishing that gentleman whom i so highly value should peruse me in a form the least imperfect to which i can bring my work   dr smiths performance is another excellent work that has come from your press this winter but i have ventured to tell him that it requires too much thought to be as popular as mr gibbons  no lxxiii mr ferguson to mr gibbon edinburgh april   th      dear sir i should make some apology for not writing you sooner an answer to your obliging letter but if you should honor me frequently with such requests you will find that with very good intentions i am a very dilatory and irregular correspondent i am sorry to tell you that our respectable friend mr hume is still declining in his health he is greatly emaciated and loses strength he talks familiarly of his near prospect of dying his mother it seems died under the same symptoms and it appears so little necessary or proper to flatter him that no one attempts it i never observed his understanding more clear or his humor more pleasant and lively he has a great aversion to leave the tranquillity of his own house to go in search of health among inns and hostlers and his friends here gave way to him for some time but now think it necessary that he should make an effort to try what change of place and air or any thing else sir john pringle may advise can do for him i left him this morning in the mind to comply in this article and i hope that he will be prevailed on to set out in a few days he is just now sixtyfive  i am very glad that the pleasure you give us recoils a little on yourself through our feeble testimony i have as you suppose been employed at any intervals of leisure or rest i have had for some years in taking notes or collecting materials for a history of the distractions that broke down the roman republic and ended in the establishment of augustus and his immediate successors the compliment you are pleased to pay i cannot accept of even to my subject your subject now appears with advantages it was not supposed to have had and i suspect that the magnificence of the mouldering ruin will appear more striking than the same building when the view is perplexed with scaffolding workmen and disorderly lodgers and the ear is stunned with the noise of destructions and repairs and the alarms of fire the night which you begin to describe is solemn and there are gleams of light superior to what is to be found in any other time i comfort myself that as my trade is the study of human nature i could not fix on a more interesting corner of it than the end of the roman republic whether my compilations should ever deserve the attention of any one besides myself must remain to be determined after they are farther advanced i take the liberty to trouble you with the enclosed for mr smith whose uncertain stay in london makes me at a loss how to direct for him you have both such reason to be pleased with the world just now that i hope you are pleased with each other  i am with the greatest respect dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant adam ferguson  no lxxiv edward gibbon esquire to j holroyd esquire london may  0th      i am angry that you

intended visit to which i was not totally a stranger will do me honor and though it should delay my emigration till the end of july there will still remain the months of august september and october above all abstain from giving the least hint to any bath correspondent and perhaps if i am not provoked by opposition the thing may not be absolutely certain at all events you may depend on a previous visit at present i am very busy with the neckers i live with her just as i used to do twenty years ago laugh at her paris varnish and oblige her to become a simple reasonable suissesse the man who might read english husbands lessons of proper and dutiful behavior is a sensible goodnatured creature in about a fortnight i launch again into the world in the shape of a quarto volume cadell assures me that he never remembered so eager and impatient a demand for a second edition the town is beginning to break up the day after tomorrow we have our last day in the house of commons to inquire into the instructions of the commissioners i like the man and the motion appears plain adieu i dined with lord palmerstone today great dinner of catches  i embrace my lady and the maria no lxxv edward gibbon esquire to j holroyd esquire to tell you any thing of the change or rather changes of governors i must have known something of them myself but all is darkness confusion and uncertainty to such a degree that people do not even know what lies to invent the news from america have indeed diverted the public attention into another and far greater channel all that you see in the papers of the repulse at quebec as well as the capture of lee rests on the authority a very unexceptionable one of the provincial papers as they have been transmitted by governor tryon from new york how is well and eats plentifully and the weather seems to clear up so fast that according to the english custom we have passed from the lowest despondency to a full assurance of success my new birth happened last

last chapters  adieu june the  th      from almacks where i was chosen last week no lxxvi the same to the same almacks june   th      yes yes i am alive and well but what shall i say town grows empty and this house where i have passed very agreeable hours is the only place which still unites the flower of the english youth the style of living though somewhat expensive is exceedingly pleasant and notwithstanding the rage of play i have found more entertaining and even rational society here than in any other club to which i belong mrs gibbon still hangs in suspense and seems to consider a townexpedition with horror i think however that she will be soon in motion and when i have her in bentinckstreet we shall perhaps talk of a sheffield excursion i am now deeply engaged in the reign of constantine and from the specimens which i have already seen i can venture to promise that the second volume will not be less interesting than the first the fifteen hundred copies are moving off with decent speed and the obliging cadell begins to mutter something of a third edition for next year no news of deyverdun or his french translation what a lazy dog madame necker has been gone a great while i gave her en partant the most solemn assurances of following her paws in less than two months but the voice of indolence begins to whisper a thousand difficulties and unless your absurd policy should thoroughly provoke me the parisian journey may possibly be deferred i rejoice in the progress of  toward light we are in expectation of american news carleton is made a knight of the bath the old report of washingtons resignation and quarrel with the congress seems to revive  adieu no lxxvii extract of a letter from dr george campbell professor at aberdeen to mr strahan dated aberdeen june         i have lately read over one of your last winters publications with very great pleasure and i hope some instruction my expectations were indeed high when i began it but i assure you the entertainment i received greatly exceeded them what made me fall to it with the greater avidity was that it had in part a pretty close connection with a subject i had occasion to treat sometimes in my theological lectures to wit the rise and progress of the hierarchy and you will believe that i was not the less pleased to discover in an historian of so much learning and penetration so great a coincidence with my own sentiments in relation to some obscure points in the christian antiquities i suppose i need not now inform you that the book i mean is gibbons history of the fall of the roman empire which in respect of the style and manner as well as the matter is a most masterly performance  no lxxviii edward gibbon esquire to j holroyd esquire saturday august      we expect you at five oclock tuesday without a sore throat you have ere this heard of the shocking accident which takes up the attention of the town our old acquaintance    by his own indolence rather than extravagance his circumstances were embarrassed and he had frequently declared himself tired of life no public news nor any material expected till the end of this or the beginning of next month when how will probably have collected his whole force a tough business indeed you see by their declaration that they have now passed the rubicon and rendered the work of a treaty infinitely more difficult you will perhaps say so much the better but i do assure you that the thinking friends of government are by no means sanguine i take the opportunity of eating turtle with garrick at hampton  adieu no lxxix the same to the same saturday past eleven      for the present i am so deeply engaged that you must renounce the hasty apparition at sheffieldplace but if you should be very impatient i will try after the meeting to run down between the friday and monday and bring you the last editions of things at present naught but expectation the attack on me is begun an anonymous eighteenpenny pamphlet which will get the author more glory in the next world than in this the heavy troops watson and another are on their march  adieu no lxxx extract of a letter from mr wallace to mr strahan dated edinburgh august  0      alas for david hume mr hume died at edinburgh august          his friends have sustained a great loss in his death he was interred yesterday at a place he lately purchased in the buryingground on the calton  for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey this pleasing anxious being ever resigned left the warm precincts of the cheerful day nor cast one longing lingering look behind a monument on that airy elevated cemetery which on account of a magnificent terrace now carried round the hill is greatly frequented will be extremely conspicuous and must often call his name to remembrance it has been remarked that the same day on which lucretius died gave birth to virgil and amidst their late severe loss philosophy and literature will probably find themselves not wholly disconsolate on reflecting that the same year in which they were deprived of hume gibbon arose his superior in some respects this gentlemans history of the decline of the roman empire appears to me in point of composition incomparably the finest production in english without any exception i hardly thought the language capable of arriving at his correctness perspicuity and strength  no lxxxi edward gibbon esquire to j holroyd esquire      i hope you bark and growl at my silence growl and bark this is not a time for correspondence parliament visits dinners suppers and an hour or two stolen with difficulty for the decline leave but very little leisure i send you the gazette and have scarcely any thing to add except that about five hundred of them have deserted to us and that the new york incendiaries were immediately and very justifiably destined to the cord lord g g with whom i had a long conversation last night was in high spirits and hopes to reconquer germany in america on the side of canada he only fears carletons slowness but entertains great expectations that the light troops and indians under sir william johnson who are sent from oswego down the mohawk river to albany will oblige the provincials to give up the defense of the lakes for fear of being cut off the report of a foreign war subsides house of commons dull and opposition talk of suspending hostilities from despair  an anonymous pamphlet and dr watson out against me in my opinion the former feeble and very illiberal the latter uncommonly genteel at last i have had a letter from deyverdun wretched excuses nothing done vexatious enough tomorrow i write to suard a very skilful translator of paris who was here in the spring with the neckers to get him if not too late to undertake it  adieu no lxxxii mr gibbon to the reverend dr watson now bishop of landaff bentinckstreet november  d      mr gibbon takes the earliest opportunity of presenting his compliments and thanks to dr watson and of expressing his sense of the liberal treatment which he has received from so candid an adversary mr gibbon entirely coincides in opinion with dr watson that as their different sentiments on a very important period of history are now submitted to the public they both may employ their time in a manner much more useful as well as agreeable than they could possibly do by exhibiting a single combat in the amphitheatre of controversy mr gibbon is therefore determined to resist the temptation of justifying in a professed reply any passages of his history which might perhaps be easily cleared from censure and misapprehension but he still reserves to himself the privilege of inserting in a future edition some occasional remarks and explanations of his meaning if any calls of pleasure or business should bring dr watson to town mr gibbon would think himself happy in being permitted to solicit the honor of his acquaintance  no lxxxiii dr watson to mr gibbon cambridge november  th      dr watson accepts with pleasure mr gibbons polite invitation to a personal acquaintance if he comes to town this winter will certainly do himself the honor to wait upon him begs at the same time to assure mr gibbon that he will be very happy to have an opportunity of showing him every civility if curiosity or other motives should bring him to cambridge dr watson can have some faint idea of mr gibbons difficulty in resisting the temptation he speaks of from having been of late in a situation somewhat similar himself it would be very extraordinary if mr gibbon did not feel a parents partiality for an offspring which has justly excited the admiration of all who have seen it and dr watson would be the last person in the world to wish him to suppress any explanation which might tend to exalt its merits  no

regulars and a naval force superior to any possible opposition but the season was so far advanced that they expected only to occupy and strengthen ticonderoga and afterward to return and take up their winter quarters in canada yesterday we had a surprise in the house from a proclamation of the howes which made its first appearance in the morning post and which nobody seems to understand by this

presume my lady does not make a practice of tumbling down stairs every day after dinner by this time the colors must have faded and the high places i mean the temples are reduced to a proper level but what in the name of the great prince is the meaning of her declining the urban expedition is it the spontaneous result of her own proud spirit or does it proceed from the secret machinations of her domestic tyrant at all events i expect you will both remember your engagement of next saturday in bentinckstreet with donna catherina the mountaineer the honorable general simon fraser  etc things go on very prosperously in america how is himself in the jerseys and will push at least as far as the delawar river the continental perhaps now the rebel army is in a great measure dispersed and washington who wishes to cover philadelphia has not more than six or seven thousand men with him clinton designs to conquer rhode island in his way home but what i think of much greater confequence a province made its submission and desired to be reinstated in the peace of the king it is indeed only poor little georgia and the application was made to governor tonyn of florida some disgust at a violent step of the congress who removed the president of their provincial assembly a leading and popular man cooperated with the fear of the indians who began to amuse themselves with the exercise of scalping on their back settlements town fills and we are mighty agreeable last year on the queens birthday sir g warren had his diamond star cut off his coat this day the same accident happened to him

dr hunters anatomical lectures from two to four pleasant dinners from five to eight and afterward clubs with an occasional assembly or supper america affords nothing very satisfactory though we have many flying reports you may be assured that we are ignorant of the consequences of trenton etc charles fox is now at my elbow declaiming on the impossibility of keeping america since a victorious army

apprehend he is coming home we are not clear whether he behaved with courage or pusilanimity when he surrendered himself but colonel keen told me today that he had seen a letter from lee since his consinement he imputes his being taken to the alertness of harcourt and cowardice of his own guard hopes he shall meet his fate with fortitude but laments that freedom is not likely to find a resting

days had been fair paid me the compliment of changing on my arrival and though i immediately secured a vessel it has been impossible to make the least use of it during the whole of this tedious day it seems doubtful whether i shall get out tomorrow morning and the captian assures me that the passage will have the double advantage of being both cold and rough last night a small privateer fitted out at dunkirk with a commission from dr franklin attacked took and has carried into dunkirk road the harwich packet the kings messenger had just time to throw his dispatches overboard he passed through this town about four oclock this afternoon in his return to london as the alarm is now given our american friend will probably remain quiet or will be soon caught so that i have not much apprehension for my personal safety but if so daring an outrage is not followed by punishment and restitution it may become a very serious business and may possibly shorten my stay at paris  adieu i shall write by

early and hope to dine at paris saturday adieu i think i am a punctual correspondent but this beginning is too good to last  no xcv dr william robertson to mr gibbon college of edinburgh june  th      sir i have desired mr strahan to take the liberty of sending you in my name a copy of the history of america which i hope you will do me the honor of accepting as a testimony not only of my respect but of my gratitude for the instruction which i have received from your writings as well as the credit you have done me by the most obliging manner in which you have mentioned my name i wish the present work may not diminish sentiments so flattering to me i have taken much pains to obtain the approbation of those whose good opinion one ought to be solicitous to secure and i trust that my industry at least will be applauded  an unlucky indisposition prevented me from executing a scheme which i had formed of passing two months of last spring in london the honor of being made known to you was one of the pleasures with which i had flattered myself but i hope to be more fortunate next year and beg that you will believe that i am with great respect sir your most obedient and most humble servant  no xcvi mr gibbon to dr robertson paris      sir when i ventured to assume the character of historian the first the most natural but at the same time the most ambitious wish which i entertained was to obtain the approbation of dr robertson and of mr hume two names which friendship united and which posterity will never separate i shall not therefore attempt to dissemble though i cannot easily express the pleasure which i received from your obliging letter as well as from the intelligence of your most valuable present the satifaction which i should otherwise have enjoyed in common with the public will now be heightened by a sentiment of a more personal and flattering nature and i shall frequently whisper to myself that i have in some measure deserved the esteem of the writer whom i admire  a short excursion which i have made to this place during the summer months has occasioned some delay in my receiving your letter and will prevent my possessing till my return the copy of your history which you so politely desired mr strahan to send me but i have already gratified the eagerness of my impatience and although i was obliged to return the book much sooner than i could have wished i have seen enough to convince me that the present publication will support and if possible will extend the fame of the author that the materials are collected with diligence and arranged with skill that the first book contains a learned and satisfactory account of the progress of discovery that the achievements the dangers and the crimes of the spanish adventures are related with a temperate spirit and that the most original perhaps the most curious portion of the history of human manners is at length rescued from the hands of sophists and declaimers lord stormont and the few in this capital who have had an opportunity of perusing the history of america unanimously concur in the same sentiments your work is already become a favorite topic of public conversation and mr suard is repeatedly pressed in my hearing to fix the time when his translation will appear  i flatter myself you will not abandon your design of visiting london next winter as i already anticipate in my own mind the advantages which i shall derive from so pleasing and so honorable a connection in the mean while i should esteem myself happy if you could think of any literary commission in the execution of which i might be useful to you at paris where i propose to stay till very near the meeting of parliament let me for instance suggest an enquiry which cannot be indifferent to you and which might perhaps be within my reach a few days ago i dined with bagniousky the famous adventurer who escaped from his exile at kamschatska and returned into europe by japan and china his narrative was amusing though i know not how far his veracity in point of circumstances may safely be trusted it was his original design to penetrate through the north east passage and he actually followed the coast of asia as high as the latitude of       till his progress was stopped by the ice in a straight between the two continents which was only seven leagues broad thence he descended along the coast of america as low as cape mendocin but was repulsed by contrary winds in his attempts to reach the port of acapulco the journal of his voyage with his original charts is now at versailles in the depot des affairs etrangers and if you conceived that it would be of any use to you for a second edition i would try what might be obtained though i am not ignorant of that mean jealousy which you yourself have experienced and so deservedly stigmatized i am etc  no xcvii dr robertson to mr gibbon sir i had the honor of your obliging letter and i should be a very proud man indeed if i were not vain of the approbation which you are pleased to bestow upon me as you will now have had an opportunity to peruse the book which you had only seen when you wrote to me i indulge myself in the hopes that the favorable opinion you had formed of it is not diminished i am much pleased with your mentioning my friendship with mr hume i have always considered that as one of the most fortunate and honorable circumstances of my life it is a felicity of the age and country in which we live that men of letters can enter the same walk of science and go on successfully without feeling one sentiment of envy or rivalship in the intercourse between mr hume and me we always found something to blame as well as something to commend i have received frequently very valuable criticisms on my performances from him and i have sometimes ventured to offer him my strictures on his works permit me to hope for the same indulgence from you if in reading the history of america any thing either in the matter or style has occurred to you as reprehensible i will deem it a most obliging favor if you will communicate it freely to me i am certain of profiting by such a communication  i return you thanks for your frank offer of executing any literary commission for me i accept of it without ceremony and am flattered with the idea of receiving such aid from your hands i know nothing of bagniouskis adventures but what was published in some newspaper if one can rely on his veracity what he relates must be very interesting to me if you had been writing the history of america the question concerning the mode of peopling it might not perhaps have occupied your attention very much but it was proper for me to consider it more fully bagniouski if he may be credited has seen what it may be useful for me to know i can see no reason why the court of france should be shy about communicating his journal and the charts which illustrate it possibly my name may operate somewhat toward obtaining a copy of both your interposition i am confident will do a great deal it will be very illiberal indeed if such a communication were refused my lord stormont by whose attention i have been much honored would not decline to give his aid were that necessary but if your court resembles that of spain i am afraid every proposal from an ambassador is received with some degree of jealousy your own private application will i apprehend be more effectual as it is probable that a second edition may go to press early in the winter it will add to the favor if you can soon inform me concerning the success of your negotiation as this is something in the style of the corpse diplomatique allow me to recommend one of its members to you mr fullarton the new secretary of the embassy is a particular friend of mine he is a young man of such qualities both of head and heart that i am sure you will esteem and love him please remember me to him i have the honor to be with great respect  your obliged humble servant william robertson  no xcviii edward gibbon esquire to j holroyd esquire paris june         i told you what would infallibly happen and you know enough of the nature of the beast not to be surprised at it i have now been at paris exactly five weeks during which time i have not written to any person whatsoever within the british dominions except two lines of notification to mrs gibbon the demon of procrastination has at length yielded to the genius of friendship assisted indeed by the powers of fear and shame but when i have seated myself before a table and begin to revolve all that i have seen and tasted during this busy period i feel myself oppressed and confounded and i am very near throwing away the pen and resigning myself to indolent despair a complete history would require a volume at least as corpulent as the decline and fall and if i attempt to select and abridge besides the difficulty of the choice there occur so many things which cannot properly be entrusted to paper and so many others of too slight a texture to support the journey that i am almost tempted to reserve for our future conversations the detail of my pleasures and occupations but as i am sensible that you are rigid and impatient i will try to convey in a few words a general idea of my situation as a man of the world and as a man of letters you remember that the neckers were my principal dependence and the reception which i have met with from them very far surpassed my most sanguine expectations i do not indeed lodge in their house as it might incite the jealousy of the husband and procure me a lettre de cachet but i live very much with them and dine and sup whenever they have company which is almost every day and whenever i like it for they are not in the least exigeans mr walpole gave me an introduction to madame du deffand an agreeable young lady of eightytwo years of age who has constant suppers and the best company in paris when you see the duke of richmond he will give you an account of that house where i meet him almost every evening ask him about madame de cambis i have met the duke of choiseul at his particular request dined by accident with franklin conversed with the emperor been presented at court and gradually or rather rapidly i find my acquaintance spreading over the most valuable parts of paris they pretend to like me and whatever you may think of french professions i am convinced that some at least are sincere on the other hand i feel myself easy and happy in their company and only regret that i did not come over two or three months sooner though paris throughout the summer promises me a very agreeable society yet i am hurt every day by the departure of men and women whom i begin to know with some familiarity the departure of officers for their governments and garrisons of bishops for their dioceses and even of country gentlemen for their estates as a rural taste gains ground in this country so much for the general idea of my acquaintance details would be endless yet unsatisfactory you may add to the pleasures of society those of the spectacles and promenades and you will find that i lead a very agreeable life let me just condescend to observe that it is not extravagant after decking myself out with silks and silver the ordinary establishment of coach lodging servants eating and pocket expenses does not exceed sixty pounds per month yet i have two footmen in handsome liveries behind my coach and my apartment is hung with damask adieu for the present i have more to say but were i to attempt any farther progress you must wait another post and you have already waited long enough of all conscience  let me just in two words give you an idea of my day i am now going nine oclock to the kings library where i shall stay till twelve as soon as i am dressed i set out to dine with the duke de nivernois shall go from thence to the french comedy into the princess de beauveaus loge grillee and cannot quite determine whether i shall sup at madame du deffands madame neckers or the sardinian ambassadresss once more adieu  i embrace my lady and bambini i shall with cheerfulness execute any of her commissions  no xcix edward gibbon esquire to j holroyd esquire paris august         well and who is the culprit now  thus far had i written in the pride of my heart and fully determined to inflict an epistle upon you even before i received any answer to my former i was very near a bull but this forward half line lay ten days barren and inactive till its generative powers were excited by the missive which i received yesterday what a wretched piece of work do we seem to be making of it in america the greatest force which any european power ever ventured to transport into that continent is not strong enough even to attack the enemy the naval strength of great britain is not sufficient to prevent the americans they have almost lost the appellation of rebels from receiving every assistance that they wanted and in the mean time you are obliged to call out the militia to defend your own coasts against their privateers you possibly may expect from me some account of the designs and policy of the french court but i choose to decline that task for two reasons  st because you may find them laid open in every newspaper and  dly because i live too much with their courtiers and ministers to know any thing about them i shall only say that i am not under any immediate apprehensions of a war with france it is much more pleasant as well as profitable to view in safety the raging of the tempest occasionally to pick up some pieces of the wreck and to improve their trade their agriculture and their finances while the two countries are lento collisa duello far from taking any step to put a speedy end to this astonishing dispute i should not be surprised if next summer they were to lend their cordial assistance to england as to the weaker party as to my personal engagement with the d of r i recollect a few slight skirmishes but nothing that deserves the name of a general engagement the extravagance of some disputants both french and english who have espoused the cause of america sometimes inspires me with an extraordinary vigor upon the whole i find it much easier to defend the justice than the policy of our measures but there are certain cases where whatever is repugnant to sound policy ceases to be just  the more i see of paris the more i like it the regular course of the society in which i live is easy polite and entertaining and almost every day is marked by the acquisition of some new acquaintance who is worth cultivating or who at least is worth remembering to the great admiration of the french i regularly dine and regularly sup drink a dish of strong coffee after each meal and find my stomach a citizen of the world the spectacles particularly the italian and above all the french comedies which are open the whole summer afford me an agreeable relaxation from company and to show you that i frequent them from taste and not from idleness i have not yet seen the colisee the vauxhall the boulvards or any of those places of entertainment which constitute paris to most of our countrymen occasional trips to dine or sup in some of the thousand countryhouses which are scattered round the environs of paris serve to vary the scene in the mean while the summer insensibly glides away and the fatal month of october approaches when i must change the house of madame necker for the house of commons i regret that i could not choose the winter instead of the summer for this excursion i should have found many valuable persons and should have preserved others whom i have lost as i began to know them the duke de choiseul who deserves attention both for himself and for keeping the best house in paris passes seven months of the year in touraine and though i have been tempted i consider with horror a journey of sixty leagues into the country the princess of beauveau who is a most superior woman has been absent above six weeks and does not return till the   th of this month a large body of recruits will be assembled by the fontainbleau journey but in order to have a thorough knowledge of this splendid country i ought to stay till the month of january and if i could be sure that opposition would be as tranquil as they were last year  i think your life has been as animated or at least as tumultuous and i envy you lady pain etc much more than either the primate or the chief justice let not the generous breast of my lady be torn by the black serpents of envy she still possesses the first place in the sentiments of her slave but the adventure of the fan was a mere accident owing to lord carmarthen adieu i think you may be satisfied i say nothing of my terrestrial affairs  no c edward gibbon esquire to j holroyd esquire bentinckstreet saturday november      had you four horns as well as four eyes and four hands i should still maintain that you are the most unreasonable monster in the creation my pain is lively my weakness excessive the season cold and only twelve days remain to the meeting far from thinking of trips into the country i shall be well satisfied if i am on my legs the  0th in the medical sense of the word at present i am a corpse carried about by four arms which do not belong to me yet i try to smile i salute the hen and chickens adieu writing is really painful  no ci the same to the same friday november   th      i do not like this disorder on your eyes and when i consider your temperance and activity i cannot understand why any spring of the machine should ever be deranged with regard to myself the gout has behaved in a very honorable manner after a complete conquest and after making me feel his power for some days the generous enemy has disdained to abuse his victory or to torment any longer an unresisting victim he has already ceased to torture the lower extremities of your humble servant the swelling is so amazingly diminished that they are no longer above twice their ordinary size yesterday i moved about the room with the laborious majesty of crutches today i have exchanged them for a stick and by the beginning of next week i hope with due precaution to take the air and to inure myself for the interesting representation of thursday how cursedly unlucky i wanted to see you both a thousand things to say and to hear and every thing of that kind broken to pieces if you are not able to come to bentinckstreet i must contrive to steal three or four vacant days during the session and run down to sheffield the town fills and i begin to have numerous levees and couchees more properly the latter we are still in expectation but in the mean while we believe i mean ministers that the news of howes victory and the taking of philadelphia are true  adieu no cii the same to the same december  d      by the enclosed you will see that america is not yet conquered opposition are very lively and though in the house we keep our numbers there seems to be an universal desire of peace even on the most humble conditions are you still fierce  no ciii the same to the same monday night december      i congratulate your noble firmness as i suppose it must arise from the knowledge of some hidden resources which will enable us to open the next campaign with new armies of fifty or sixty thousand men

your journey gives me some hopes that you have not entirely lost your reason your bed shall be ready  no civ edward gibbon esquire to j b holroyd esquire house of commons thursday dec        dreadful news indeed you will see them partly in the papers and we have not yet any particulars an english army of nearly ten thousand men laid down their arms and surrendered prisoners of war on condition of being sent to england and of never serving against america they had fought bravely and were three days without eating bourgoyne is said to have received three wounds general fraser with two thousand men killed colonel ackland likewise killed a general cry for peace adieu we have constant late days  no cv the same to the same february          as to politics we should easily fill pages and

the same february   d      you do not readily believe in praeternatural miscarriages of letters nor i neither listen however to a plain and honest narrative this morning after breakfast as i was ruminating on your silence thomas my new footman with confusion in his looks and stammering on his tongue produced a letter reasonably soiled which he was to have brought me the day of his arrival and which had lain forgotten from that time in his pocket to shorten as much as possible the continuance i immediately enquired whether any method of conveyance could be devised more expeditious than the post and was fortunately informed of your coachmans intentions you probably know the heads of the plan an act of parliament to declare that we never had any intention of taxing america another act to empower the crown to name commissioners authorized to suspend hostilities by sea and land as well as all obnoxious acts and in short to grant every thing except independence opposition after expressing their doubts whether the lance of achilles could cure the wound which it had inflicted could not refuse their assent to the principles of conduct which they themselves had always recommended yet you must acknowledge that in a business of this magnitude there may arise several important questions which without a spirit of faction will deserve to be debated whether parliament ought not to name the commissioners whether it would not be better to repeal the obnoxious acts ourselves i do not find that the world that is a few people whom i happen to converse with are much inclined to praise lord ns ductility of temper in the service of next friday you will however take notice of the injunction given by the liturgy and all the people shall say after the minister turn us again o lord and so shall we be turned while we consider whether we shall negociate i fear the french have been more diligent it is positively asserted both in private and in parliament and not contradicted by the ministers that on the fifth of this month a treaty of commerce which naturally leads to a war was signed at paris with the independent states of america yet there still remains a hope that england may obtain the preference the two greatest countries in europe are fairly running a race for the favor of america  adieu no cvii edward gibbon esquire to j b holroyd esquire almacks

would fill pages not to say volumes and to confine myself to short authentic pieces of intelligence for which i may be able to afford moments and lines hear then  the french ambassador went off yesterday morning not without some slight expressions of illhumour from john bull lord stormont is probably arrived today no immediate declaration except on our side a report but vague of an action in the bay between la motte piquet and digby the former has five ships and three frigates with three large storeships under convoy the latter has eleven ships of the line if the frenchman should sail to the mouth of the delawar he may possibly be followed and shut up when franklin was received at versailles deane went in the same character to vienna and arthur lee to madrid notwithstanding the reports of an action in silesia they subside and i have seen a letter from eliot at berlin of the tenth instant without any mention of actual hostilities and even speaking of the impending war as not absolutely inevitable last tuesday the first payment of the loan of six hundred thousand pounds was certainly made and as it would otherwise be forfeited it is a security for the remainder i have not

literally a bull i have not a word to say since destaings fleet has passed through the gut i leave you to guess where it must have got out it has been totally forgotten and the most wonderful lethargy and oblivion of war and peace of europe and of america seems to prevail lord chathams funeral was meanly attended and government ingeniously contrived to secure the double odium of suffering the thing

the day and shall probably arrive after supper keppels return has occasioned infinite and inexpressible consternation which gradually changes into discontent against him he is ordered out again with three or four large ships two of ninety two of seventyfour and the fiftieth regiment as marines in the mean time the french with a superior fleet are masters of the sea and our outwardbound east and

through indolence as because i expected every post to hear from you the state of beriton is uncertain incomprehensible tremendous it would be endless to send you the folios of hugonin but i have enclosed you one of his most picturesque epistles on which you may meditate few offers one promising enough came from a gentleman at camberwell i detected him with masterly skill and diligence to be only an attorneys clerk without money credit or experience i have written as yet in vain to sir john shelley about hearsay perhaps you might get intelligence i much fear that the beriton expedition is necessary but it has occurred to me that if i met instead of accompanying you it would save me a journey of above one hundred miles that reflection led to another of a very impudent nature viz that if i did not accompany you i certainly could be of no use to you or myself on the spot that i had much rather while you examined the premises pass the time in a horsepond and that i had still rather pass it in my library with the decline and fall but that would be an effort of friendship worthy of theseus or perithous modern times would hardly credit much less imitate such exalted virtue no news from america yet there are people large ones too who talk of conquering it next summer with the help of twenty thousand russians i fancy you are better satisfied with private than public war the lisbon

is grounded on the truth of christianity i wish not to be deprived of this hope but i should be an apostate from the mild principle of the religion i profess if i could be actuated with the least animosity against those who do not think with me upon this of all others the most important subject i beg your pardon for this declaration of my belief but my temper is naturally open and it ought assuredly to be without disguise to a man whom i wish no longer to look upon as an antagonist but as a friend i have the honor to be with every sentiment of respect your obliged servant  rd watson  no

negociations changes of departments etc and i have some reason to believe that those reports are not entirely without foundation portsmouth is no longer an object of speculation the whole stream of all men and all parties runs one way sir hugh is disgraced ruined etc etc and as an old wound has broken out again they say he must have his leg cut off as soon as he has time in a night or two we

proceedings by your silence i suppose you admire davis and dislike my pamphlet yet such is the public folly that we have a second edition in the press the fashionable style of the clergy is to say they have not read it if maria does not take care i shall write a much sharper invective against her for not answering my diabolical book my lady carried it down with a solemn promise that i should

estimate kindness by punctuality in correspondence i read your little performance with much eagerness and some solicitude the latter soon ceased the tone you take with your adversary in this impar congressus appears to me perfectly proper and though i watched you with some attention i have not observed any expression which i should on your own account wish to be altered daviss book never reached us here our distance from the capital operates somewhat like time nothing but what has intrinsic value comes down to us we hear sometimes of the worthless and vile things that float for a day on the stream but we seldom see them i am satisfied however that it was necessary for you to animadvert on a man who had brought accusations against you which no gentleman can allow to be made without notice i am persuaded that the persons who instigated the man to such an illiberal attack will now be ashamed of him at the same time i applaud your resolution of not degrading yourself by a second conflict with such antagonists  i am ashamed to tell you how little i have done since i had the pleasure of seeing you i have been prevented partly by ill health partly by causes which i shall explain

longboat ministry are more crestfallen than i ever knew them with the last intelligence and i am sorry to say that i see a smile of triumph on some opposition faces though the business of the west indies may still produce something i am much afraid that we shall have a campaign of immense expense and little or no action the most busy scene is at present in the house of commons and we shall be involved during a great part of next month in tedious fruitless but in my opinion proper enquiries you see how difficult it would be for me to visit brighton and i fancy i must content myself with receiving you on your passage to ireland indeed i much want to have a very serious conversation with you another reason which must in a great measure pin me to bentinckstreet is the decline and fall i have resolved to bring out the suite in the course of next year and though i have been tolerably diligent so much remains to be done that i can hardly spare a single day from the shop i can guess but one reason which should prevent you from supposing that the picture in leicester fields was intended for the sheffield library viz my having told you some time ago that i was under a formal engagement to mr walpole the portrait one of the best of sir joshuas is in the library at sheffield place  probably i should not have been in any great hurry to execute my promise if mr cadell had not strenuously urged the curiosity of the public who may be willing to repay the exorbitant price of fifty guineas it is now finished and my friends say that in every sense of the word it is a good head next week it will be given to hall the engraver and i promise you a first impression adieu i embrace my lady and infants  no cxix the same to the same      when do you come to town you gave me hopes

the sussex militia of which mr holroyd was major  and i suppose nothing but truth can proceed from a pretty mouth  i have been and am still very diligent and though it is a huge beast the roman empire yet if i am not mistaken i see it move a little  you seem surprised that i was able to get off bath very easily the extreme shortness of our holidays was a fair excuse her recovery of health spirits etc made it less necessary and she accepted my apology which was however accompanied with an offer if she chose it in the prettiest manner possible a load of business in this house i write from it will be the amusement of the spring motions enquiries taxes etc etc we are now engaged in lord pigotts affair brought on by a motion from the admiral that the attorney general should prosecute mr stratton and council all the masters charles burke wedderburne are of the same side for it lord north seems to make a feeble stand for the pleasure of being in a minority the day is hot and dull will

most disagreeable of those which i have lately experienced i have only to add that it was effected by the firm and sincere friendship of the attorney general so many incidents have happened that i hardly know how to talk of news you will learn that the lords have strangely castrated the new militia bill the ferrol squadron eight or nine ships have joined the french the numbers stand on our side

letter and even as a sufficient excuse for a very long silence yet i really do intend to behave better and to prevent the abominable consequence of hours and days and posts stealing away till the sum total amounts to a formidable account i have a great mind to enter into an agreement of sending you regularly every month a miniature picture of my actual state and condition on the first day of the aforesaid month  i am glad to hear of the very beneficial effects you have derived from your recent friendship with the goats at abergavenny  and as i cannot discover in what respect this poor country is more prosperous or secure than it was last year i must consider your present confidence as a proof that you view the prospect through a purer medium and a glass of a more cheerful color i find myself so much more susceptible of private friendship than of public spirit that i am very well satisfied with that conclusion my summer has been passed in the town and neighborhood which i still maintain to be the best society and the best retirement the latter however has been sometimes interrupted by the colonel of dragoons colonel holroyd at that time was raising a regiment of light dragoons with a train of sergeants trumpets recruits etc etc my own time is much and agreeably employed in the prosecution of my business after doing much more than i expected to have done within the time i find myself much less advanced than i expected yet i begin to reckon and as well as i can calculate i believe that in twelve or fourteen months i shall be brought tobed perhaps of twins may they live and prove as healthy as their eldest brother with regard to the little foundling which so many friends or enemies chose to lay at my door i am perfectly innocent even of the knowledge of

embracing the bolder resolution you are indeed obliged to him for his real friendship which he feels and expresses warmly on this occasion i hope it will be successful and that in a few days you will find yourself among us at st stephens in the heat of the battle but you know that i am a dastardly pusillanimous spirit more inclined to fear than to hope and not very eager in the pursuit of expensive vanity on this vacancy the celerity of your motions may probably prevent opposition but at the general election your enemy the corporation will not be asleep and i wish if it be not too late to warn you against any promises or engagements which may terminate in a defeat or at least a contest of ten thousand pounds adieu i could believe without seeing it under her paw that my lady wishes to leave coventry no news foreign or domestic i did not forget to mention the companies but find people as i expected torpid burke makes his motion friday but i think the rumors of a civil war subside

madam when you awakened me with your pen it was my intention to have shown some signs of life by the next post but so uncertain are all human affairs that i found myself arrested by a mighty unrelenting tyrant called the gout and though my feet were the part on which he chose to exercise his cruelty he left me neither strength nor spirits to use my hand in relating the melancholy tale at present i have the pleasure of informing you that the fever and inflammation have subsided but the absolute weakness and monstrous swelling of my two feet confine me to my chair and flannels and this confinement most unluckily happens at a very nice and important moment of parliamentary affairs col h pursues those affairs with eager and persevering zeal and has the pleasure of undertaking more business than any three men could possibly execute he is much obliged to you for your kind congratulation mrs eliot is in town but i am quite ignorant not more so than they are themselves of their

any danger since the house of commons has adjourned to monday sennight as an individual i do not conceive myself to be obnoxious i am not apt without duty or necessity to thrust myself into a mob and our part of the town is as quiet as a country village so much for personal safety but i cannot give the same assurances of public tranquillity forty thousand puritans such as they might be in the time of cromwell have started out of their graves the tumult has been dreadful and even the remedy of military force and martial law is unpleasant but government with fifteen thousand regulars in town and every gentleman but one on their side must extinguish the flame the execution of last night was severe perhaps it must be repeated tonight yet upon the whole the tumult subsides colonel holroyd was all last night in holborn among the flames with the northumberland militia and performed very bold and able service i will write again in a post or two  i am dear madam ever yours  no cxxvi the same to the same june  0th    0 dear madam i should write with great pleasure to say that this audacious tumult is perfectly quelled that lord george gordon is sent to the tower and that instead of safety or danger we are now at leisure to think of justice but i am now alarmed on your account as we have just got a report that a similar disorder has broken out at bath i shall be impatient to hear from you but i flatter myself that your pretty town does not contain much of that scum which has boiled up to the surface in this huge cauldron i am dear madam most sincerely yours  no cxxvii the same to the same bentinckstreet june   th    0 dear madam i believe we may now rejoice in our common security all tumult has perfectly subsided and we only think of the justice which must be properly and severely inflicted on such flagitious criminals the measures of government have been seasonable and vigorous and even opposition has been forced to confess that the military power was applied and regulated with the utmost propriety our danger is at an end but our disgrace will be lasting and the month of june    0 will ever be marked by a dark and diabolical fanaticism which i had supposed to be extinct but which actually subsists in great britain perhaps beyond any other country in europe our parliamentary work draws to a conclusion and i am much more pleasingly though laboriously engaged in revising and correcting for the press the continuation of my history two volumes of which will certainly appear next winter this business fixes me to bentinckstreet more closely than any other part of my literary labor as it is absolutely necessary that i should be in the midst of all the books which i have at any time used during the composition but i feel a strong desire irritated like all other passions by repeated obstacles to escape to bath  dear madam most truly yours  no cxxviii edward gibbon esquire to colonel holroyd july   th    0 as your motions are spontaneous and the stations of the lord chief lord mansfield unalterably fixed i cannot perceive the necessity of your sending or receiving intelligence however your commands are obeyed you wish i would write as a sign of life i am alive but as i am immersed in the decline and fall i shall only make the sign it is made you may suppose that we are not pleased with the junction of the fleets nor can an ounce of west india loss be compensated by a pound of east india success but the circuit will roll down all the news and politics of london i rejoice to hear that the sussex regiment of dragoons commanded by colonel holroyd are such welldisciplined cannibals but i want to know when the chief cannibal will return to his den it would suit me better that it should happen soon  adieu no cxxix the same to the same brookess november   th    0 perhaps the sheriffs the sheriffs of coventry  the tools of your enemies may venture to make a false and hostile return on the presumption that they shall have a whole year of impunity and that the merits of your petition cannot be heard this session some of your most respectable friends in the house of commons are resolved if the return should be such to state it forcibly as a special and extraordinary case and to exert all proper strength for bringing on the trial of your petition without delay the knowledge of such a resolution may awe the sheriffs and it may be prudent to admonish them of the impending danger in the way that you judge most advisable adieu god send you a good deliverance  no cxxx mr gibbon to mrs gibbon belvedere bath bentinckstreet december   st    0 dear madam the constant attendance on the board of trade almost every day this week has obliged me to defer till next monday a visit of inclination and propriety to lord loughborough at mitcham in surry i shall not return till wednesday or thursday and instead of my christmas i shall eat my new years dinner at the belvedere bath may that new year prove fortunate to you to me and to this weary country which is this day involved in a new war i shall write again about the middle of next week with a precise account of my motions i think the gallant colonel who is now lord sheffield will succeed at coventry perhaps on the return certainly on the petition i am dear madam ever yours  no cxxxi edward gibbon esquire to mrs gibbon bath bentinckstreet february   th      dear madam as you have probably received my last letter of thirteen hundred pages second and third volumes of the decline and fall  i shall be very concise read judge pronounce and believe that i sincerely agree with my friend julian in esteeming the praise of those only who will freely censure my defects next thursday i shall be delivered to the world for whose inconstant and malicious levity i am coolly but firmly prepared excuse me to sarah i see more clearly than ever the absolute necessity of confining my presents to my own family that and that only is a determined line and lord s is the first to approve his exclusion he has a strong assurance of success and some hopes of a speedy decision how suddenly your friend general pierson disappeared you thought him happy what is happiness my dear madam ever yours  no cxxxii dr william robertson to mr gibbon college of edinburgh may   th      dear sir i am ashamed of having deferred so long to thank you for the agreeable presents of your two new volumes but just as i had finished the first reading of them i was taken ill and continued for two or three weeks nervous deaf and languid i have now recovered covered as much spirit as to tell you with what perfect satisfaction i have not only perused but studied this part of your work i knew enough of your talents and industry to expect a great deal but you have gone far beyond my expectations i can recollect no historical work from which i ever received so much instruction and when i consider in what a barren field you had to glean and pick up materials i am truly astonished at the connected and interesting story you have formed i like the style of these volumes better than that of the first there is the same beauty richness and perspicuity of language with less of that quaintness into which your admiration of tacitus sometimes seduced you i am highly pleased with the reign of julian i was a little afraid that you might lean with some partiality toward him but even bigots i should think must allow that you have delineated his most singular character with a more masterly hand than ever touched it before you set me a reading his works with which i was very slenderly acquainted and i am much struck with the felicity wherewith you have described that odd infusion of heathen fanaticism and philosophical coxcombry which mingled with the great qualities of a hero and a genius your chapter concerning the pastoral nations is admirable and though i hold myself to be a tolerably good general historian a great part of it was new to me as soon as i have leisure i purpose to trace you to your sources of information and i have no doubt of finding you as exact there as i have found you in other passages where i have made a scrutiny it was always my idea that an historian should feel himself a witness giving evidence upon oath i am glad to perceive by your minute scrupulosity that your notions are the same the last chapter in your work is the only one with which i am not entirely satisfied i imagine you rather anticipate in describing the jurisprudence and institutions of the franks and should think that the account of private war ordeals chivalry etc would have come in more in its place about the age of charlemagne or later but with respect to this and some other petty criticisms i will have an opportunity of talking fully to you soon as i propose setting our for london on monday i have indeed many things to say to you and as my stay in london is to be very short i shall hope to find your door at which i will be very often always open to me i cannot conclude without approving of the caution with which the new volumes are written i hope it will exempt you from the illiberal abuse the first volume drew upon you i ever am yours faithfully and affectionately  william robertson  no cxxxiii edward gibbon esquire to lady sheffield at sheffieldplace bentinckstreet friday evening  0 oclock      oh oh i have given you the slip saved thirty miles by proceeding this day directly from eartham to town and am now comfortably seated in my library in my own easy chair and before my own fire a style which you understand though it is unintelligible to your lord the town is empty but i am surrounded with a thousand old acquaintance of all ages and characters who are ready to answer a thousand questions which i am impatient to ask i shall not easily be tired of their company yet i still remember and will honorably execute my promise of visiting you at brighton about the middle of next month i have seen nobody nor learned any thing in four hours of a town life but i can inform you that lady  is now the declared mistress of prince henry of prussia whom she encountered at spa and that the emperor has invited the amiable couple to pass the winter at vienna sine encouragement for married women who behave themselves properly i spent a very pleasant day in the little paradise of eartham and the hermit expressed a desire no vulgar compliment to see and to know lord s adieu i cordially embrace etc  no cxxxiv sir william jones to mr gibbon lambsbuildings june  0th      dear sir i have more than once sought without having been so fortunate as to obtain a proper opportunity of thanking you very sincerely for the elegant compliment which you pay me in a work abounding in elegance of all kinds  my seven arabian poets will see the light before next winter and be proud to wait upon you in their english dress their wild productions will i flatter myself be thought interesting and not venerable merely on account of their antiquity  in the mean while let me request you to honor me with accepting a copy of a law tract which is not yet published the subject is so generally important that i make no apology for sending you a professional work  you must pardon my inveterate hatred of c octavianus basely surnamed augustus i feel myself unable to forgive the death of cicero which if he did not promote he might have prevented besides even mecaenas knew the cruelty of his disposition and ventured to reproach him with it in short i have not christian charity for him  with regard to asiatic letters a necessary attention to my profession will compel me wholly and eternally to abandon them unless lord north to whom i am already under no small obligation should think me worthy to concur in the improved administration of justice in bengal and should appoint me to supply the vacancy on the india bench were that appointment to take place this year i should probably travel for speed through part of egypt and arabia and should be able in my way to procure many eastern tracts of literature and jurisprudence i might become a good mahomedan lawyer before i reached calcutta and in my vacations should find leisure to explain in my native language whatever the arabs persians and turks have written on science history and the sine arts  my happiness by no means depends on obtaining this appointment as i am in easy circumstances without my profession and have flattering prospects in it but if the present summer and the ensuing antumn elapse without my receiving any answer favorable or unfavourable i shall be forced to consider that silence as a polite refusal and having given sincere thanks for past favors shall entirely drop all thoughts of asia and deep as ever plummet sounded shall drown my persian books if my politics have given offense it would be manly in ministers to tell me so i shall never be personally hostile to them nor enlist under partly banners of any color but i will never resign my opinions for interest though i would cheerfully abandon them on conviction my reason such as it is can only be controlled by better reason to which i am ever open as to my freedom of thought speech and action i shall ever say what charles xii wrote under the map of riga dieu me la donnee le diable ne me l otera pas but the fair answer to this objection is that my system is purely speculative and has no relation to my seat on the bench in india where i should hardly think of instructing the gentoos in the maxims of the athenians i believe i should not have troubled you with this letter if i did not fear that your attendance in parliament might deprive me of the pleasure of meeting you at the club next tuesday and i shall go to oxford a few days after at all times and in all places i shall ever be with undissembled regard dear sir your much obliged and faithful servant  no cxxxv lord hardwicke to mr gibbon wimple september  0th      sir as i have perused your history of the decline etc with the greatest pleasure and instruction i cannot help wishing that as health and leisure permit you would gratify your numerous readers and admirers by continuing it at least till the irruption of the arabs after mahomet from that period the history of the east is not very interesting and often disgusting i particularly wish to see the reigns of justin justinian and i think justin the second written by so masterly a hand there are striking facts and remarkable characters in all those reigns which have not yet met with an able and sagacious historian you seemed as well as i recollect to think the anecdotes of procopius spurious there are strange anecdotes in them and of a very different cast from his history can it be traced up when they first came to light  excuse this short interruption from much better employments or amusements and believe me sir with the greatest regard your most obedient humble servant  hardwicke p s it has occurred to me that a map of the progress and native seat of the northern hives would greatly elucidate and explain that part of your history it may be done in a second edition    no cxxxvi dr robertson to mr gibbon college of edinburgh november  th      dear sir soon after my return i had a long conversation with our friend mr smith in which i stated to him every particular you mentioned to me with respect to the propriety of going on with your great work i was happy to find that his opinion coincided perfectly with that which i had ventured to give you his decisions you know are both prompt and vigorous and he would not allow that you ought to hesitate a moment in your choice he promised to write his sentiments to you very fully but as he may have neglected to do this for it is not willingly that he puts pen to paper i thought it might be agreeable to you to know his opinion though i imagine you could hardly entertain any doubt concerning it i hope you have brought such a stock of health and spirits from brighthelmstone that you are set seriously at your desk and that in two winters or so you will display the crescent of mahomet on the dome of st sophia i met the other day in a work addressed to yourself a sensible passage from f paul which perfectly removes one of your chief difficulties as to the barrenness of some parts of your period hayleys essay on history p     by the bye who is this mr hayley his poetry has more merit than that of most of his contemporaries but his whiggism is so bigoted and his christianity so sierce that he almost disgusts one with two very good things  i have got quite well long ago and am perfectly free from deafness but i cannot yet place myself in any class but that of the multa et praeclara minantes be so kind as to remember me to lord loughborough and mr craufurd and believe me to be with most sincere respect and attachment yours very faithfully  william robertson  no cxxxvii edward gibbon esquire to mrs gibbon bath brighthelmstone nov  d      dear madam i returned to this place with lord and lady sheffield with the design of passing two or three weeks in a situation which had so highly delighted me but how vain are all sublunary hopes i had forgot that there is some difference between the sunshine of august and the cold fogs though we have uncommon good weather of november instead of my beautiful seashore i am confined to a dark lodging in the middle of the town for the place is still full and our time is now spent in the dull imitation of a london life to complete my misfortunes lord sheffield was hastily ordered to canterbury and deal to suppress some disturbances and i was left almost alone with my lady in the servile state of a married man but he returns today and i hope to be seated in my own library by the middle of next week however you will not be sorry to hear that i have refreshed myself by a very idle summer and indeed a much idler and more pleasant winter than the house of commons will ever allow me to enjoy again i had almost forgot mr hayley ungratefully enough since i really passed a very simple but entertaining day with him his place though small is elegant as his mind which i value much more highly mrs  wrote a melancholy story of an american mother a friend of her friend who in a short time had lost three sons one killed by the savages one run mad from the fright at that accident and the third taken at sea now in england a prisoner in forton hospital for him something might perhaps be done your humanity will prompt you to obtain from mrs  a more accurate account of names dates and circumstances but you will prudently suppress my request lest i should raise hopes which it may not be in my power to gratify lady s begs to send her kindest compliments to you  i am dear madam ever yours  no cxxxviii edward gibbon esquire to mrs gibbon bath july  d      i hope you have not had a moments uneasiness about the delay of my midsummer letter whatever may happen you may rest fully secure that the materials of it shall always be found but on this occasion i have missed four or five posts postponing as usual from morning to the evening bell which now rings till it has occurred to me that it might not be amiss to enclose the two essential lines if i only added that the influenza has been known to me only by the report of others lord rockingham is at last dead a good man whatever he might be a minister his successor is not yet named and divisions in the cabinet are suspected if lord shelburne should be the man as i think he will the friends of his predecessor will quarrel with him before christmas at all events i foresee much tumult and strong opposition from which i should be very glad to extricate myself by quitting the house of commons with honor whatever you may hear i believe there is not the least intention of dissolving parliament which would indeed be a rash and dangerous measure i hope you like mr hayleys poem he rises with his subject and since popes death i am satisfied that england has not seen so happy a mixture of strong sense and flowing numbers are you not delighted with his address to his mother i understand that she was in plain prose every thing that he speaks her in verse this summer i shall stay in town and work at my trade till i make some holidays for my bath excursion lady sheffield is at brighton and he is under tents like the wild arabs so that my country house is shut up i am dear madam ever yours  no cxxxix edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield camp coxheath bentinckstreet      i sympathise with your fatigues yet alexander hannibal etc have suffered hardships almost equal to yours at such a moment it is disagreeable besides laziness to write because every hour teems with a new lie as yet however only charles has formally resigned but lord john lord john cavendish  burke keppel lord althorpe etc certainly follow your lord lieutenant stays in short three months of prosperity has dissolved a phalanx which had stood ten years adversity next tuesday fox will give his reasons and possibly be encountered by pit the new secretary or chancellor chancellor of the exchequer  at threeandtwenty the day will be rare and curious and if i were a light draggon i would take a gallop on purpose to westminster adieu i hear the bell how could i write before i knew where you dwelt  no cxl edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield coxheath camp september   th      i should like to hear sometimes whether you survive the scenes of action and danger in which a dragoon is continually involved what a difference between the life of a dragoon and that of a philopher and i will freely own that i the philosopher am much better satisfied with my own independent and tranquil situation in which i have always something to do without ever being obliged to do any thing the hampton court villa has answered my expectation and proved no small addition to my comforts so that i am resolved next summer to hire borrow or steal either the same or something of the same kind every morning i walk a mile or more before breakfast read and write quantum sufficit mount my chaise and visit in the neighborhood accept some invitations and escape others use the lucans as my daily bread dine pleasantly at home or sociably abroad reserve for study an hour or two in the evening lie in town regularly once a week etc etc etc i have announced to mrs g my new arrangements the certainty that october will be fine and my increasing doubts whether i shall be able to reach bath before christmas do you intend but how can you intend any thing to pass the winter under canvass perhaps under the veil of hampton court i may lurk ten days or a fortnight at sheffield if the enraged lady does not shut the doors against me the warden lord north passed through in his way to dover he is not so fat and more cheerful than ever i had not any private conversation with him but he clearly holds the balance unless he lets it drop out of his hand the pandaemonium as i understand does not meet till the twentysixth of november town is more a desert than i ever knew it i arrived yesterday dined at sir joshuas with a tolerable party the chaise is now at the door i dine at richmond lie at hampton etc  adieu no cxli edward gibbon esquire to lord sheffield at coxheath camp bentinckstreet october   th      on the approach of winter my paper house at hampton becomes less comfortable my visits to bentinckstreet grow longer and more frequent and the end of next week will restore me to the town with a lively wish however to repeat the same or a similar experiment next summer i admire the assurance with which you propose a months residence at sheffield when you are not sure of being allowed three days here it is currently reported that camps will not separate till lord howes return from gibraltar and as yet we have no news of his arrival perhaps indeed you may have more intimate correspondence with your old friend lord shelburne and already know the hour of your deliverance i should like to be informed as lady s has entirely forgotten me i shall have the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance i have often thought of writing but it is now too late to repent  i am at a loss what to say or think about our parliamentary state a certain late secretary of ireland reckons the house of commons thus minister one hundred and forty reynard ninety boreas one hundred and twenty the rest unknown or uncertain the last of the three by self or agents talks too much of absence neutrality moderation i still think he will discard the game  i am not in such a fury with the letter of american independence but i think it seems illtimed and useless and i am much entertained with the metaphysical disputes between government and secessin about the meaning of it lord loughborough will be in town sunday sevennight i long to see him and co i think he will take a very decided part if he could throw aside his gown he would make a noble leader the east india news are excellent the french gone to the mauritius heyder desirous of peace the nizam and mahrattas our friends and seventy lacks of rupees in the bengal treasury while we were voting the recall of hastings  adieu write soon no cxlii edward gibbon esquire to lord sheffield      i have designed writing every post the air of london is admirable my complaints have vanished and the gout still respects me lord loughborough with whom i passed an entire day is very well satisfied with his irish expedition and found the barbarous people very kind to him the castle is strong but the volunteers are formidable london is dead and all intelligence so totally extinct that the loss of an army would be a favorable incident we have not even the advantage of shipwrecks which must soon with the society of you and gerard hamilton become the only pleasures of brighton my lady is precious and deserves to shine in london when she regains her palace the workmen are slow but i hear that the minister talks of hiring another house after christmas lord north while his house was repairing inhabited lord sheffields in downingstreet   adieu till monday sevennight no cxliii the same to the same january   th      as i arrived about seven oclock on wednesday last we were some time in town in mutual ignorance unluckly enough yet our loss will be speedily repaired your reason for not writing is worthy of an irish baron you thought sarah might be at bath because you directed letters to her at clifton near bristol where indeed i saw her in a delightful situation swept by the winter winds and scorched by the summer sun a nobler reason for your silence would be the care of the public papers to record your steps words and actions i was pleased with your coventry oration a panegyric on  is a subject entirely new and which no orator before yourself would have dared to undertake you have acted with prudence and dignity in casting away the military yoke this next summer you will sit down if you can sit in the long lost character of a country gentleman  for my own part my late journey has only confirmed me in the opinion that number seven in bentinckstreet is the best house in the world i find that peace and war alternately and daily take their turns of conversation and this friday is the pacific day next week we shall probably hear some questions on that head very strongly asked and very foolishly answered etc give me a line by return of post and probably i may visit downingstreet on monday evening late however as i am engaged to dinner and cards  adieu no cxliv although dr priestley may not be justified for publishing the following letters yet as he thought fit to print them with a volume of sermons soon after mr gibbons death it will not be improper to insert them in this collection  mr gibbon to dr priestley sir january   d      as a mark of your esteem i should have accepted with pleasure your history of the corruptions of christianity you have been careful to inform me that it is intended not as a gift but as a challenge and such a challenge you must permit me to decline at the same time you glory in outstripping the zeal of the mufti and the lama it may be proper to declare that i should equally refuse the defiance of those venerable divines once and once only the just defense of my own veracity provoked me to descend into the amphitheatre but as long as you attack opinions which i have never maintained or maintain principles which i have never denied you may safely exult in my silence and your own victory the difference between us on the credibility of miracles which you choose to suppose and wish to argue is a trite and ancient topic of controversy and from the opinion which you entertain of yourself and of me it does not appear probable that our dispute would either edify or enlighten the public  that public will decide to whom the invidious name of unbeliever more justly belongs to the historian who without interposing his own sentiments has delivered a simple narrative of authentic facts or to the disputant who proudly rejects all natural proofs of the immortality of the soul overthrows by circumscribing the inspiration of the evangelists and apostles and condemns the religion of every christian nation as a fable less innocent but not less absurd than mahomets journey to the third heaven  and now sir since you assume a right to determine the objects of my past and future studies give me leave to convey to your ear the almost unanimous and not offensive wish of the philosophic world  that you would confine your talents and industry to those sciences in which real and useful improvements can be made remember the end of your predecessor servetus not of his life the calvins of our days are restrained from the use of the same fiery arguments but i mean the end of his reputation his theological writings are lost in oblivion and if his book on the trinity be still preserved it is only because it contains the first rudiments of the discovery of the circulation of the blood  i am sir your obedient humble servant   no cxlv dr priestley to mr gibbon birmingham  d february      sir it would have been impertinent in me especially considering the object of my history to have sent you a copy of it as a mark of my esteem or friendship what i meant was to act the part of a fair and open adversary and i am truly sorry that you decline the discussion i proposed for though you are of a different opinion i do not think that either of us could be better employed and should the mufti and the lama whose challenge you say you would also decline become parties in the business i should rejoice the more i do not well know what you can mean by intimating that i am a greater unbeliever than yourself that i attack opinions which you never maintained and maintain principles which you never denied if you mean to assert that you are a believer in christianity and meant to recommend it i must say that your mode of writing has been very ill adapted to gain your purpose if there be any certain method of discovering a mans real object yours has been to discredit christianity in fact while in words you represent yourself as a friend to it a conduct which i scruple not to call highly unworthy and mean and insult on the common sense of the christian world as a method of screening you from the notice of the law which is as hostile to me as it is to you you must know that it could avail you nothing and though that mode of writing might be deemed ingenious and witty in the first inventor of it it has been too often repeated to deserve that appellation now  according to your own rule of conduct this charge ought to provoke you to descend into the amphitheatre once more as much as the accusation of mr davis for it is a call upon you to defend not your principles only but also your honor for what can reflect greater dishonor on a man than to say one thing and mean another you have certainly been very far from consining yourself as you pretend to a simple narrative of authentic facts without interposing your own sentiments i hold no opinions obnoxious as they are that i am not ready both to avow in the most explicit manner and also to defend with any person of competent judgment and ability had i not considered you in this light and also as fairly open by the strain of your writings to such a challenge i should not have called upon you as i have done the public will form its own judgment both of that and of your silence on the occasion and finally decide between you the humble historian and me the proud disputant  as to my reputation for which you are so very obligingly concerned give me leave to observe that as far as it is an object with any person and a thing to be enjoyed by himself it must depend upon his particular notions and feelings  now odd as it will appear to you the esteem of a very few rational christian friends though i know that it will ensure me the detestation of the greater part of the present nominally christian world that happen to hear me given me more real satisfaction than the applause of what you call the philosophic world i admire servetus by whose example you wish me to take warning more for his courage in dying for the cause of important truth than i should have done if besides the certain discovery of the circulation of the blood he had made any other the most celebrated discovery in philosophy  however i do not see what my philosophical friends of whom i have many and whom i think i value as i ought have to do with my metaphysical or theological writings they may if they please consider them as my particular whims or amusements and accordingly neglect them they have in fact interfered very little with my application to philosophy since i have had the means of doing it i was never more busy or more successfully so in my philosophical pursuits than during the time that i have been employed about the history of the corruptions of christianity i am at this very time totus in illis as my friends know and as the public will know in due time which with me is never long and if you had thought proper to enter into the discussion i proposed it would not have made me neglect my laboratory or omit a single experiment that i should otherwise have made  i am sir your very humble servant j priestley  no cxlvi mr gibbon to dr priestley bentinckstreet february  th      sir as i do not prented to judge of the sentiments or intentions of another i shall not enquire how far you are inclined to suffer or inflict martyrdom it only becomes me to say that the style and temper of your last letter have satisfied me of the propriety of declining all farther correspondence whether public or private with such an adversary i am sir your humble servant  no cxlvii dr priestley to mr gibbon birmingham  0th february      sir i neither requested nor wished to have any private correspondence with you all that my ms card required was a simple acknowledgment of the receipt of the copy of my work you chose however to to give me a specimen of your temper and feelings and also what i thought to be an opening to a further call upon you for a justification of yourself in public of this i was willing to take advantage and at the same time to satisfy you that my philosophical pursuits for which whether in earnest or not you were pleased to express some concern would not be interrupted in consequence of it  as this correspondence from the origin and nature of it cannot be deemed confidential i may especially if i resume my observations on your conduct as an historian give the public an opportunity of judging of the propriety of my answer to your first extraordinary letter and also to this last truly enigmatical one to interpret which requires much more sagacity than to discover your real intentions with respect to christianity though you might think you had carefully concealed them from all human inspection  wishing to hear from you just as little as you please in private and just as much as you please in public i am sir your humble servant  no cxlviii mr gibbon to dr priestley february   d      if dr priestley consults his friends he will probably learn that a single copy of a paper addressed under a seal to a single person and not relative to any public or official business must always be considered as private correspondence which a man of honor is not at liberty to print without the consent of the writer that consent in the present instance mr gibbon thinks proper to withold and as he desires to escape all further altercation he shall not trouble dr priestley or himself with explaining the motives of his refusal  no cxlix dr priestley to mr gibbon birmingham   th february      dr priestley is as unwilling to be guilty of any real impropriety as mr gibbon can wish him to be but as the correspondence between them relates not to any private but only to a public matter he apprehends that it may according to mr gibbons own distinction at the pleasure of either of the parties be laid before the public who in fact are interested to know at least the result of it dr priestleys conduct will always be open to animadversion that of mr gibbon or of any other person his appeal is to men of honor and even men of the world and he desires no favor  dr priestley has sent a single copy of the correspondence to a friend in london with leave to show it to any other common friends but with a prohibition to take any other copy but between this and printing there is no difference except in mode and extent in the eye of the law and of reason both are equally publications and has mr gibbon never thought himself at liberty to show a copy of a letter to a third person  mr gibbon may easily escape all further altercation by discontinuing this mutually disagreeable correspondence by leaving dr priestley to act as his own discretion or indiscretion may dictate and for this himself only and not mr gibbon is responsible  no cl m gibbon a mons deyverdun

train mais une raison qui mempecheroit de lui donner carriere cest lesperance de pouvoir bientot me servir avec vous dun instrument encore plus commode la langue que lhomme lhomme anglois lhomme gibbon est un sot animal je lespere je le desire je le puis mais je ne sais pas si je le veux encore moins si jexecuterai cette volonte voici mon histoire autant quelle pourra vous eclairer quelle pourra meclairer moimeme sur mes veritables intentions qui me paroissent tres obscures et tres equivoques et vous aurez la bonte de mapprendre quelle sera ma conduite future il vous souvient seigneur que mon grand pere a fait sa fortune que mon pere la mangee avec un peu trop dappetit et que je jouis actuellement du fruit ou plutet du rest de leurs travaux vous navez pas oublie que je suis enter au parliament sans patriotisme sans ambition et que toutes mes vues se bornoient a la place commode et honnete dun lord of trade cette place je lai obtenue enfin je lai possedee trois ans depuis      jusqu a      et le produit net qui se montoit a sept cens cinquante livres sterling augmentoit mon revenu au niveau de mes besoins et de mes desirs mais au printems de lannee precedente lorage a gronde sur nos tetes milord north a ete renverse votre serviteur chasse et le board meme dont jetois membre aboli et casse pour toujours par la reformation de m burke avec beaucoup dautres places de letat et de la maison du roi pour mon malheur je suis toujours rest membre de la chamber basse a la fin du dernier parliament en    0 m eliot a retire sa nomination mais la faveur de milord north a facilite ma rentree et la reconnoisance mimposoit le devoir de fair valoir pour son service les droits que je tenois en party de lui cet hyver nous avons combatu sous les etendards reunis vous savez notre histoire de milord north et de m fox nous avons triomphe de milord shelburne et de la paix et mon ami je naime pas a profaner ce nom a remonte sur sa beat en qualite de secretaire detat cest a present quil peut bien me dire cetoit beaucoup pour moi ce netoit rien pour vous et malgre les assurances les plus fortes jai trop de raison pour avoir de la foi avec beaucoup desprit et des qualites tres respectables il na plus ni le titre ni le credit de premier ministre des colleagues plus actifs lui enlevent les morceaux les plus friands qui sont aussitot devores par la voracite de leurs creatures nos malheurs et nos reformes ont diminue le nombre des graces par orgueil ou par paresse je solicit aussi mal et si je parviens enfin ce sera peut etre a la veille dune nouvelle revolution qui me fera perdre dans un instant ce qui maura coute tant de soins et de recherches si je ne consultois que mon coeur et ma raison je romprois sur le champ cette indigne chain de la dependence je quitterois le parliament londres langleterre je chercherois sous un ciel plus doux dans un pays plus tranquille le repos la liberte l aisance et une societe eclairee et aimable je coulerois quelques annees de ma vie sans esperance et sans crainte jacheverois mon histoire et je ne rentrerois dans ma patrie quen homme libre rich et respectable par sa position aussi bien que par son caractere mes amiss et surtout milord sheffield ne veulent pas me permettre detre heureux suivant mon gout et mes lumieres leur prudence exige que je fasse tous mes efforts pour obtenir un emploi tres sur a la verite qui me donneroit mill guinees de rent mais qui menleveroit cinq jours par semaine je me prete a leur zele et je leur ai promis de ne partir quen automne apres avoir consacre lete a cette derniere tentative le succes cependant est tres uncertain et je ne sais si je le desire de bonne foi  si je parviens a me voir exile mon choix ne sera pas douteux lausanne a eu mes premices elle me sera toujours chere par le doux souvenir de ma jeunesse au bout de trente ans je me rappelle les polissons qui sont aujourdhui juges les petites silles de la societe du printems qui sont devenues grandmeres votre pays est charmant et malgre le degout de jean jacques les moeurs et lesprit de ses habitants me paroissent tres assortis aux bords du lac leman mais un tresor que je ne trouverois qua lausanne cest un ami qui me convient egalement par les sentimens et les idees avec qui je nai jamais connu un instant dennui de secheresse ou de reserve autrefois dans nos libres epanchemens nous avons cent fois fait le projet de vivre ensemble et cent fois nous avons epluche tous les details du roman avec une chaleur qui nous etonnoit nous memes a present il demeure ou plutot vous demeurez car je me less de ce ton etudie dans une maison charmante et commode je vois dici mon appartement nos salles communes notre table et nos promenades mais ce marriage ne vaut rien sil ne convient pas egalement aux deux epoux et je sens combien des circonstances locales des gouts nouveaux de nouvelles liaisons peuvent sopposer aux desseins qui nous ont paru les plus agreables dans le lointain pour fixer mes idees et pour nous epargner des regrets il faut me devoiler avec la franchise dont je vous ai done lexemple le tableau exterieur et interieur de george deyverdun mon amor est trop delicat pour supporter lindifference et les egards et je rougirois dun bonheur dont je serois redevable non a linclination mais a la fidelite de mon ami pour marmer contre les malheurs possibles helas peut etre trop vraisemblables jai essaye de me detacher de la pensee de ce projet favori et de me representer a lausanne votre bon voisin sans etre precisement votre commensal si jy etois reduit je ne voudrois pas tenir maison autant par raison deconomie que pour eviter lennui de manger seul dun autre cote une pension ouverte fut elle montee sur lancien pied de celle de mesery ne conviendroit plus a mon age ni a mon caractere passerois je ma vie au milieu dune foul de jeunes anglois echappes du college moi qui aimerois lausanne cent fois davantage si jy pouvois etre le seul de ma nation il me faudroit donc une maison commode et riante un etat au dessus de la bourgeoisie un mari instruit une femme qui ne resembleroit pas a madame pavilliard et lassurance dy etre recu comme le fills unique ou plutot comme le friar de la famille pour nous arranger sans gene je meublerai tres volontiers un joli appartement sous le meme toit ou dans le voisinage et puisque le menage le plus foible laisse encore de letoffe pour une forte pension je ne serois pas oblige de chicaner sur les conditions pecuniaires si je me vois dechu de cette derniere esperance je renoncerois en soupirant a ma second patrie pour chercher un nouvel asyle non pas a geneve triste sejour du travail et de la discord mais auxbords du lac de neufchatel parmi les bons savoyards de chamberry ou sous le beau climat des provinces meridionales de la france je finis brusquement parceque jai mill chooses a vous dire je pense que nous nous ressemblons pour la correspondance pour le bavardage savant ou meme amical je suis de tous les hommes le plus paresseux mais des quil sagit dun objet reel dun service essentiel le premier courier emporte toujours ma reponse a la sin dun mois je commencerai a compter les semaines les jours les heures ne me les faites pas compter trop long tems vale  no cli m deyverdun a m gibbon strasbourg le  0 juin      je ne saurais vous exprimer monsieur et cher ami la variete et la vivacite des sensations que ma fait eprouver votre lettre tout cela a fini par un fond de plaisir et desperance qui resteront dans mon coeur jusqua ce que vous les en chassiez  un rapport singulier de circonstances contribue a me fair esperer que nous sommes destines a vivre quelque tems agreablement ensemble je ne suis pas degoute dune ambition que je ne connus jamais mais par dautres circonstances je me trouve dans la meme situation dembarras et dincertitude ou vous etes aussi a cette epoque il y a un an que votre lettre mon cher ami mauroit fait plaisir sans doubt mais en ce moment elle men fait bien davantage elle vient en quelque facon a mon secours  depuis mon retour ditalie ne pouvant me determiner a vendre ma maison mennuyant dy etre seul car je suis comme vous monsieur et je deteste de manger sans compagnie ne voulant pas louer a des etrangers jai pris le parti de marranger assez joliment au premier etage et de donner le second a une famille de mes amiss qui me nourrit et que je loge cet arrangement a paru pendant long tems contribuer au bonheur des deux parties mais tout est transitoire sur cette terre ma maison sera vuide selon tout appearance sur la sin de lete et je me vois davance tout aussi embarasse et uncertain que je letais il y a quelques annees ne sachant quelle nouvelle societe choisir et assez dispose a vendre enfin cette possession qui ma cause bien des plaisirs et bien des peines ma maison est donc a votre disposition pour cet automne et vous y arriveriez comme un dieu dans une machine qui finit lembroglio voila quant a moi parlons de vous maintenant avec la meme sincerite  un mot de preambule qulque interesse que je sois a votre resolution convaincu quil faut aimer ses amiss pour eux memes sentant dailleurs combien il seroit affreux pour moi de vous voir des regrets je vous done ici ma parole dhonneur que mon interet ninflue en rien sur ce que je vais ecrire et que je ne dirai pas un mot que je ne vous disse si lhermite de la grotte etoit un autre que moi vos amiss anglais vous aiment pour eux memes je ne veux moi que votre bonheur rappellez vous mon cher ami que je vis avec peine votre entree dans le parliament et je crois navoir ete que trop bon prophet je suis sur que cette carriere vous a fait eprouver plus de privations que de jouissances beaucoup plus de peines que de plaisirs jai cru toujours depuis que je vous ai connu que vous etiez destine a vivre heureux par les plaisirs du cabinet et de la societe que tout autre march etait un ecart de la route du bonheur et que ce netait que les qualites reunies dhomme de lettres et dhomme aimable de societe qui pouvoient vous procurer gloire honneur plaisirs et un suite continuelle de jouissances au bout de quelques tours dans votre salle vous sentirez parfaitement que javois bien vu et que levenement a justify mes idees lorsque jai appris que vous etiez lord of trade jen ai ete fache quand jai su que vous aviez perdu cette place je men suis rejouis pour vous quand on ma anonce que milord north etoit remonte sur sa beat jai cru vous voir tres mal a votre aise en croupe derriere lui et je men suis afflige pour vous je suis donc charm mon cher ami de vous savoir a pied et je vous conseille tres sincerement de rester dans cette position et bien loin de solliciter la place en question de la refuser si elle vous etait offerte mill guinees vous dedommageront else de cinq jours pris de la semaine je suppose ce que cependant jai peine a croire que vous me disiez que oui et la variete et linconstance continuelle de votre ministere vous promettent else den jouir long tems constamment et nest il pas plus desagreable mon cher monsieur de navoir plus  000 livres sterling de rent quil na ete agreeable den jouir dailleurs ne pourrez vous pas toujours rentrer dans la carriere si lambition ou lenvie de servir la patrie vous reprennent ne rentrerez vous pas avec plus dhonneur lorsque vos rentes etant augmentees naturellement vous serez libre et independent  en faisant cette retraite en suisse outre la beauty du pays et les agremens de la societe vous acquererez deux biens que vous avez perdus la liberte et la richesse vous ne serez dailleurs point inutile vos ouvrages continueront a nous eclairer et independamment de vos talens lhonnete homme le galant homme nest jamais inutile  il me rest a vous present le tableau que vous trouveriez vous aimiez ma maison et mon jardin cest bien autre chose a present au premier etage qui done sur la descente douchy je me suis arrange un appartement qui me suffit jai une chamber de domestique deux sallons et deux cabinets jai au plein pied de la terrasse deux autres sallons dont lun sert en ete de salle a manger et lautre de sallon de compagnie jai fait un nouvel appartement de trois pieces dans le vuide enter la maison et la remise en sort que jai a vous offrir tout le grand appartement qui consiste actuellement en onze pieces tant grandes que petites tournees au levant et au midi meublees sans magnificence deplacee mais avec une sort delegance dont jespere que vous seriez satisfait la terrasse a peu change mais elle est terminee par un grand cabinet mieux proportionne que le precedent garnie tout du long de caisses dorangers etc la treille qui ne vous est pas indifferente a embelli prospere et regne presquentierement jusquau bout parvenu a ce bout vous trouverez un petit chemin qui vous conduira a une chaumiere placee dans un coin et de ce coin en suivant le long dune autre route a langlaise le mur dun manege vous trouverez au bout un chalet avec ecurie vacherie petite port petit cabinet petite bibliotheque et une galerie de bois door dou lon voit tout ce qui sort et enter en ville par la port du chene et tout ce qui se pass dans ce faubourg jai acquis la vigne audessous du jardin jen ai arrache tout ce qui etoit devant la maison jen ai fait un tapis vert arrose par leau du jet deau et jai fait tout autour de ce petit parc une promenade tres variee par les differens points de vue et les objets meme interieurs tantot jardin potager tantot parterre tantot vigne tantot pres puis chalet chaumiere petite montagne bref les etrangers viennent le voir et ladmirent et malgre la description pompeuse que je vou en fais vous en serez content  n b jai plant une quantite dexcellens arbres fruitiers  venons a moi vous comprenez bien que jai vieilli except pour la sensibilite je suis a la mode mes nerfs sont attaques je suis plus melancolique mais je nai pas plus dhumeur vous ne souffrirez de mes maux que tout au plus negativement ensemble et separes par nos logemens nous jouirons visavis lun de lautre de la plus grande liberte nous prendrons une gouvernante douce et entendue plutot par commodite que par necessite car je me chargerois sans crainte de la surintendance jai fait un menage de quatre pendant quelque tems jai fait le mien et jai remarque que cela marchoit tout seul quand cetoit une fois en train les petites gens qui nont que ce merit font grand bruit pour rien mon jardin nous fournira avec abondance de bons fruits et dexcellens legumes pour la rest de la table et de la depense domestique je ne demanderais pas mieux que de vous recevoir chez moi comme vous mavez recu chez vous mais nos situations sont differentes a cet egard cependant si vous etiez plus ruin je vous loffrirois sans doubt et je devrois le fair mais avec les rentes que vous aviez quand jetois chez vous en les supposant meme diminuees vous vivrez tres agreablement ablement a lausanne enfin a cet egard nous nous arrangerons comme il vous sera le plus agreeable et en proportion de nos revenus toujours serez vous ainsi a ce qui jespere plus decemment et plus comfortablement que vous ne seriez par tout ailleurs au meme prix  quant a la societe quoique infiniment agreeable je commence ce chapitre par vous dire que jeviterois de vous y inviter si vous etiez entierement desoeuvre les jours sont longs alors et laissent bien du vuide mais homme de lettres comme vous etes je ne connois point de societe qui vous convienne mieux nous aurona autour de nous un cercle comme il seroit impossible den trouver ailleurs dans un aussi petit espace madame de corcelles mademoiselle sulens et m de montolieu madame est morte messrs polier et leurs femmes madame de severy et m et madame de nassau mademoiselle de chandieu madame de st cierge et m avec leurs deux filles jolies et aimables madames de crousaz polier de charrieres etc font un fonds de bonne compagnie dont on ne se less point et dont m de servan est si content quil regrette toujours detre oblige de retourner dans ses terres et ne respire que pour setablir tout a fait a lausanne il passa tout lhyver de      avec nous et il fut on ne peut plus agreeable vous trouverez les moeurs changees en bien et plus conformes a nos ages et a nos caracteres peu de grandes assemblees de grands repas mais beaucoup de petits soupers de petites assemblees ou lon fait ce qu on veut ou lon cause lit etc ct dont on ecarte avec soin les facheux de toute espece il y le dimanche un societe ou tout ce quil y a dun peu distingue en etrangeres et etrangers est invite cela fait des assemblees de  0 a  0 persons ou lon voit ce quon ne voit gueres le rest de la semaine et ces especes de rout font quelquefois plaisir nous sommes fort degoutes des etrangers surtout des jeunes gens et nous les ecartons avec soin de nos petits comites a moins quils nayent du merit ou quelques talens a cet egard un de nos petits travers cest lengouement mais vous en profiterez mon cher monsieur comme edward gibbon et comme mon ami vous ferez dabord lhomme a la mode et je vois dici que vous soutiendrez fort bien ce role sans vous en facher dut on un peu vous surfaire je sens que tu me flattes mais tu me fais plaisir est peut etre le meilleur verse de destouches voila donc lhyver letude le matin quelques conversations quand vous serez fatigue avec quelque homme de lettres ou amateur ou du moins qui aura vu quelque chose a lheure quil vous plaira un diner point de sermier general mais lhonnete epicurien avec un ou deux amiss quand vous voudrez puis quelques visites une soiree souvent un souper quant a lete vu votre maniere daimer la campaign on diroit que ma remise a ete faite pour vous pendant que vous vous y promenerez en senateur je serai souvent en bon paysan suisse devant mon chalet ou dans ma chaumiere puis nous nous rencontrerons tout a coup et tacherons de nous remettre au niveau lun de lautre nous fermerons nos ports a lordinaire except aux etrangers qui passent leur chemin mais quand nous voudrons nous y aurons tous ceux que nous aimerons a y voir car on ne demand pas mieux que dy venir se rejouir jai eu un beau jour davril ce printems un dejeuner qui ma coute quelques louis ou il y avait plus de  0 persons je ne sais combien de petites tables une bonne music au milieu du verger et une quantite de jeunes et jolies persons dansant des branles et formant des chifres en cadence jai vu bien des fetes jen ai peu vu de plus jolies quand mon pare vous ennuyera nous aurous ou nous louerons ensemble et ce sera ainsi un plaisir peu cher un cabriolet ledger avec deux chevaux gentiles et nous irons visiter nos amiss disperses dans les campagnes qui nous recevront a bras ouverts vous en serez content de nos campagnes toujours en proportion vous comprenez et vous trouverez en general un heureux changement pour les agremens de la societe et une sort de recherche simple mas elegante les bergeres du printems except madame de vanberg ne sont sans doubt plus presentables mais il y en a dautres assez gentilles et quoiquelles ne soyent pas en bien grand nombre il y en aura toujours assez pour vous mon cher monsieur peu a peu mon imagination ma emporte et mon style segaye comme cela nous arrivait quelquefois dans nos chateaux en espagne il est bien tems de finir cet article resumons nous plus serieusement  si vous executez le plan que vous avez imagine jaimerois meme a dire que vous embrassez surtout dapres ce que vous marquez vous meme si je ne consultatis que mon coeur et ma raison je romprois sur le champ cette indigne chain etc eh que voulez vous consulter si ce nest votre coeur et votre raison si disje vous executez ce plan vous retrouverez une liberte et une independance que vous nauriez jamais du perdre et dont vous meritez de jouir une aisance qui ne vous coutera quun voyage de quelques jours une tranquillite que vous ne pouvez avoir a londres et enfin un ami qui na peut etre pas ete un jour sans penser a vous et qui malgre ses defauts ses foiblesses et son inferiorite est encore un des compagnons qui vous convient le mieux  il me rest a vous apprendre pourquoi je vous reponds si tard vous savez deja actuellement que ce nest pas manque damitie et de zele pour la chose mais votre lettre ma ete renvoyee de lausanne ici a strasbourg et je nai pass quune post sans y repondre ce qui nest pas trop vous lavouerez pour un pareil bavardage je suis parti de lausanne la veille de paques pour venir voir un m bourcard de basle fort de mes amiss il est ici aupres du comte de cagliostro pour prositer de ses remedes vous aurez entendu parler peut etre de cet homme extraordinaire a tous egards comme jai ete assez malade tout lhyver je profit aussi de ses remedes mais comme le tems du sejour du comte ici nest rien moins que sur le mieux sera que vous mecriviez a m d chez m bourcard du kirshgarten a basle  vous comprenez combien a tous egards il est necessaire mecrire sans perte de tems desque vous aurez pris une resolution adieu mon cher ami  no clii m gibbon a m deyverdun je recois votre lettre du  0 juin le    de ce mois aujourdhui mardi   th je mets la main a la plume comme dit m freron pour y repondre quoique ma missive ne puisse partir par arrangement des posts que vendredi prochain    du courant o merveille de la grace efficace elle nagit pas moins puissamment sur vous et moyennant le secours toujours pret et toujours prompt de nos couriers un mois nous suffit pour la demand et la reponse je remercie mill fois le genie de lamitie qui ma pousse apres mill efforts inutiles a vous ecrire enfin au moment le plus critique et le plus favorable jamais demarche na repondu si parfaitement a tous mes voeux et a toutes mes esperances je comptois sans doubt sur la duree et la verite de vos sentimens mais jignorois tell est la foiblesse human jusqua quel point ils avoient pu etre attiedis par le tems et leloignement et je savois encore moins letat actuel de votre sante de votre fortune et de vos liaisons qui auroient pu opposer tant dobstacles a notre reunion vous mecrivez vous maimez toujours vous desirez avec zele avec ardeur de realiser nos anciens projets vous le pouvez vous le voulez vous mossrez des lautomne votre maison et quelle maison votre terrasse et quelle terrasse votre societe et quelle societe larrangement nous convient a tous les deux je retrouve a la fois le compagnon de ma jeunesse un sage conseiller et un peintre qui sait representer et exagerer meme les objets les plus rians ces exagerations me font pour le moins autant de plaisir que la simple verite si votre portrait etoit tout a fait ressemblant ces agremens nexisteroient que horse de nous memes et jaime encore mieux les trouver dans la vivacite de votre coeur et de votre imagination ce nest pas que je ne reconnoisse un grand fond de verite dans le tableau de lausanne je connois le lieu de la scene je me transporte en idee sur notre terrasse je vois ces coteaux ce lac ces montagnes ouvrages favoris de la nature et je concois sans peine les embellissemens que votre gout sest plu y ajouter je me rappelle depuis vingt ou trente ans les moeurs lesprit laisance de la societe et je comprends quece veritable ton de la bonne compagnie se perpetue et sepure de pere en fills ou plutot de mere en fille car il ma toujours paru qua lausanne aussi bien quen france les femmes sont tres superieures aux hommes dans un parcil sejour je craindrois la dissipation bien plus que lennui et le tourbillon de lausanne etonneroit un philosophe accoutume depuis tant dannees a la tranquillite de londres vous etes trop instruit pour regarder ce propos comme une mauvaise plaisanterie cest dans les detroits quon est entraine par la rapidite des courans il ny en a point en pleine mer desquon ne recherche plus les plaisirs bruyans et quon saffranchit volontiers des devoirs penibles la liberte dun simple particulier se fortify par limmensite de la ville quant a moi lapplication a mon grand ouvrage lhabitude et la recompense du travail mont rendu plus studieux plus sedentaire plus ami de la retraite la chamber des communes et les grands diners exigent beaucoup de tems et la temperance dun repas anglois vous permet de gouter de cinq ou six vins differens et vous ordonne de boire une bouteille de claret apres le desert mais enfin je ne soupe jamais je me couche de bonne heure je recois peu de visites les matinees sont longues les etes sont libres et desque je ferme ma port je suis oublie du monde entier dans une societe plus bornee et plus amicale les demarches sont publiques les droits sont reciproques lon dine de bonne heure on se gout trop pour ne pas passer lapresmidi ensemble on soupe on veille et les plaisirs de la soiree ne laissent pas de deranger le repos de la nuit et le travail du lendemain quel est cependant le resultat de ces plaintes cest seulement que la mariee est trop belle et que jose me servir de lexcuse honnete de la sante et du privilege dun homme de lettres il ne tiendra qua moi de moderer un peu lexces de mes jouissances pour cet engouement que vous mannoncez et qui a toujours ete le defaut des peuples les plus spirituels je lai deja eprouve sur un plus grand theater il y a six ans que lami de madame necker fut recu a paris comme celui de george deyverdum pourroit letre a lausanne je ne connois rien de plus flateur que cet accueil favorable dun public poli et eclaire mais cette faveur si douce pour letranger nestelle pas un peu dangereuse pour lhabitant expose a voir fletrir ses lauriers par sa fault ou par linconstance des ses juges non on se soutient toujours peut etre pas precisement au meme point delevation a labri de trois gros volumes in quarto en langue etrangere encore ce qui nest pas un petit avantage je conserverai toujours la reputation litteraire et cette reputation donnera du relief aux qualites sociales si lon trouve lhistorien sans travers sans affectation et sans pretensions je serai donc charm et content de votre societe et jaurois pu dire en deux mots ce qui jai bavarde en deux pages mais il y a tant de plaisir a bavarder avec un ami car ensin je possede a lausanne un veritable ami et les simples connoissances remplaceront sans beaucoup de peine tout ce qui sappelle liaison et meme amity dans ce vaste desert de londres mais au moment ou jecris je vois de tous cotes une foul dobjets dont la perte sera bien plus difficile a reparer vous connossiez ma bibliotheque mais je suis en etat de vous render le propos de votre maison cest bien autre chose a cette heure formee peu a peu mais avec beaucoup de soin et de depense elle peut se nommer aujourdhui un beau cabinet de particulier non content de remplir a rangs redoubles la meilleure piece qui lui etoit destinee elle sest debordee dans la chamber sur la rue dans votre ancienne chamber a coucher dans la mienne dans tous les recoins de la maison de bentinckstreet et jusques dans une chaumiere que je me suis donnee a hampton court  jai mill courtisans ranges autour de moi ma retraite est mon louvre et jy command en roi le fonds est de la meilleure compagnie grecque latin italienne francoise et angloise et les auteurs les moins chers a lhomme de gout des ecclesiastiques des byzantins des orientaux sont les plus necessaires a lhistorien de la decadence et de la chute etc vous ne sentez que trop bien le desagrement de laisser et limpossibilite de transporter cinq ou six milles volumes dautant plus que le ciel na pas voulu fair de la suisse un pays maritime cependant mon zele pour la reussite de nos projets communs me fait imaginer que ces obstacles pourront sapplanir et que je puis adoucir ou supporter ces privations douloureuses les bons auteurs classiques la bibliotheque des nations se retrouvent dans tous les pays lausanne nest pas depourvu de livres ni de politesse et jai dans lesprit quon pourroit acquerir pour un certain tems quelque bibliotheque dun vieillard ou dun mineur dont la famille ne voudroit pas se defaire entierement quant aux outils de mon travail nous commencerons par examiner letat de nos richesses apres quoi il faudroit fair un petit calcul du prix du poids et de la rarete de chaque ouvrage pour juger de ce quil seroit necessaire de transporter de londres et de ce quon acheteroit plus commodement en suisse a legard de ces frais on devroit les envisager comme les avances dune manufacture transplantee en pays etranger et dont on espere retirer dans la suite un profit raisonnable malheureusement votre bibliotheque public en y ajoutant meme celle de m de bochat est assez piteuse mais celles de berne et de basle sont tres nombreuses et je compterois assez sur la bonhommie helvetique pour esperer que moyennant des recommandations et des cautions il me seroit permis den tirer les livres dont jaurois essentiellement besoin vous etes tres bien place pour prendre les informations et pour fixer les demarches convenables mais vous voyez du moins combien je me return de tous les cotes pour esquiver la difficulte la plus formidable  venons a present a des objets moins releves mais tres importans a lexistence et au bien etre de lanimal le logement les domestiques et la table pour mon appartement particulier une chamber a coucher avec un grand cabinet et une antichambre auroient suffi a tous mes besoins mais si vous pouvez vous en passer je me promenerai avec plaisir dans limmensite de vos onze pieces qui saccommoderont sans doubt aux heures et aux saisons differentes larticle des domestiques renferme une assez forte difficulte sur la quelle je dois vous consulter vous connoissez et vous estimez caplin mon valet de chamber maitre dhotel etc qui a ete nourri dans notre maison et qui comptoit y finir ses jours depuis votre depart ses talens et ses vertus se sont developpes de plus en plus et je le considere bien moins sur le pied dun domestique que sur celui dun ami malheureusement il ne sait que langlois et jamais il napprendra de langue etrangere il maccompagna il y a six ans dans mon voyage a paris mais il rapporta fidelement a londres toute lignorance et tous les prejuges dun bon patriote a lausanne il me couteroit beaucoup et a lexception du service personel il ne nous seroit que dune tres petite utilite cependant je supporterois volontiers cette depense mais je suis tres persuade que si son attachement le portoit a me suivre il sennuyeroit a mourir dans un pays ou tout lui seroit etranger et desagreable il faudroit donc me detacher dun homme dont je connois le zele la fidelite rompre tout dun coup de petites habitudes qui sont liees avec le bien etre journalier et momentane et se resoudre a lui substituer un visage nouveau peut etre un mauvais sujet toujours quelque avanturier suisse pris sur le pave de londres vous rappellez vous un certain georges suisse qui a fait autrefois avec moi le voyage de france et ditalie je le crois marie et etabli a lausanne sil vit encore si vous pouvez lengager a se render ici pour me ramener en suisse la compagnie dun bon et ancien serviteur ne laisseroit pas dadoucir la chute et il resteroit peut etre aupres de moi jusqua ce que nous eussions choisi un jeune homme du pays adroit modeste et bien eleve a qui je ferois un parti avantageux les autres domestiques gouvernantes laquais cuisiniere etc se prennent et se renvoyent sans difficulte un article bien plus important cest notre table car enfin nous ne sommes pas assez hermites pour nous contenter des legumes et des fruits de votre jardin tout excellens quils sont mais je nai presque rien a ajouter a lhonnetete de vos propos qui me donnent beaucoup plus de plaisir que de surprise si je me trouvois sans fortune au lieu de rougir des bienfaits de lamitie jaccepterois vos offres aussi simplement que vous les faites mais nous ne sommes pas reduits a ce point et vous comprenez assez quune deconsiture angloise laisse encore une fortune fort decente au pays de vaud et pour vous dire quelque chose de plus precis je depenserois sans peine et sans inconvenient cinq ou six cens louis vous connoissez le resultat aussi bien que les details dun menage en supposant une petite table de deux philosophes epicuriens quatre cinq ou six domestiques des amiss assez souvent des repas assez rarement beaucoup de sensualite et peu de luxe a combien estimez vous en gros le depense dun mois et dune annee le partage que vous avez deja fait me paroit des plus raisonnables vous me logez et je vous nourris a votre calcul jajouterois mon entretien personnel habits plaisirs gages de domestiques etc et je verrois dune maniere assez net lensemble de mon petit etablissement  apres avoir essuye tant de details minutiex le cher lecteur simagine sans doubt que la resolution de me sixer pendant quelque tems aux bords du lac leman est parfaitement decidee helas rien nest moins vrai mais je me suis livre au charm delicieux de compter de sonder de palper ce bonheur dont je sens tout le prix qui est a ma portee et auquel jaurai peut etre la betise de renoncer vous avez raison de croire mais vous ignorez jusq a quel point vous lavez que ma carriere politic a ete plus semee epines que de roses eh quel objet quel mortel pourroit me conler de lennui des affairs et de la honte de la dependence la gre comme homme de lettres jen jouis comme orateur je ne l trai jamais et le nom des simples soldats est oublie dans les victoire aussi bien que dans les defaites le devoir dans ces combats a veugle ou les chefs ne cherchent que leur avantage particulier il y a toujours a parier que les subalternes feront plus de mal que de bien lattachement personnel les ministres sont rarement dignes de linspirer jusqua present lord north ma pas eu a se plaindre de moi et si je me retire du parliament il lui sera tres aise dy substituer un autre muet tout aussi affide que son ancien ferviteur je suis intimement convaincu et par la raison et par le sentiment quil ny a point de parti qui me convienne aussi bien que de vivre avec vous et aupres de vous a lausanne et si je parviens a la place  commissioner of the excise or customs ou je vise il y aura toutes les semaines cinq longues matinees qui mavertiront de la folly de mon choix vous vous trompez a la verite a legard de linstabilite de ces emplois ils sont presques les seuls qui ne se ressentent jamais des revolutions du ministere cependant si cette place soffroit bientot je naurois pas le bon sens et le courage de la refuser quels autres conseillers veux je prendre si non mon coeur et ma raison il en est de puissans et toujours ecoutes les egards la mauvaise honte tous mes amiss ou soi disant tells secrieront que je suis un homme perdu ruin un fou qui se derobe a ses protecteurs un misanthrope qui sexile au bout du monde et puis les exagerations sur tout ce qui seroit fait en ma faveur si surement si promptement si liberalement milord sheffield opinera a me fair

permettez que je vous en dispense encore et meme jusquau dernier jour je sens bien quun proceed contraire vous conviendroit mais certes il ne me convient pas du tout ceci comme vous le dites est une espece de marriage et pensez vous que malgre les engagemens les plus solemnels je neusse pas reconduit chez elle du pied des autels la femme la plus aimable qui meut temoigne des regrets jamais je ne me consolerois si je vous voyois mecontent dans la suite et dans le cas de me fair des reproaches cest a vous a fair si vous croyez necessaire des demarches de votre cote qui fortifient votre

esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield july  0th      you will read the following lines with more patience and attention than you would probably give to an hasty conference perpetually interrupted by the opening of the door and perhaps by the quickness of our own tempers i neither expect nor desire an answer on a subject of extreme importance to myself but which friendship alone can render interesting to you we shall soon meet at sheffield  it is needless to repeat the reflections which we have sometimes debated together and which i have often seriously weighed in my silent solitary walks notwithstanding your active and ardent spirit you must allow that there is some perplexity in my present situation and that my future prospects are distant and cloudy i have lived too long in the world to entertain a very sanguine idea of the friendship or zeal of ministerial patrons and we are all sensible how much the powers of patronage are reduced    at the end of the parliament or rather long before that time for their lives are not worth a years purchase our ministers are kicked down stairs and i am left their disinterested friend to fight through another opposition and to expect the fruits of another revolution but i will take a more favorable supposition and conceive myself in six months firmly seated at the board of customs before the end of the next six months i should infallibly hang myself instead of regretting my disappointment i rejoice in my escape as i am satisfied that no salary could pay me for the irksomeness of attendance and the drudgery of business so repugnant to my taste and i will dare to say so unworthy of my character without looking forwards to the possibility still more remote of exchanging that laborious office for a smaller annuity there is surely another plan more reasonable more simple and more pleasant a temporary retreat to a quiet and less expensive scene in a four years residence at lausanne i should live within my income save and even accumulate my ready money finish my history an object of profit as well as fame expect the contingencies of elderly lives and return to england at the age of fifty to form a lasting independent establishment without courting the smiles of a minister or apprehending the downfall of a party such have been my serious sober reflections yet i much question whether i should have found courage to follow my reason and my inclination if a friend had not stretched his hand to draw me out of the dirt the twentieth of last may i wrote to my friend deyverdun after a long interval of silence to expose my situation and to consult in what manner i might best arrange myself at lausanne from his answer which i received about a fortnight ago i have the pleasure to learn that his heart and his house are both open for my reception that a family which he had lodged for some years is about to leave him and that at no other time my company could have been so acceptable and convenient i shall step at my arrival into an excellent apartment and a delightful situation the fair division of our expenses will render them very moderate and i shall pass my time with the companion of my youth whose temper and studies have always been congenial to my own i have given him my word of honor to be at lausanne in the beginning of october and no power or persuasion can divert me from this irrevocable resolution which i am every day proceeding to execute  i wish but i scarcely hope to convince you of the propriety of my scheme but at least you will allow that when we are not able to prevent the follies of our friends we should strive to render them as easy and harmless as possible the arrangement of my house furniture and books will be left to meaner hands but it is to your zeal and judgment alone that i can trust the more important disposal of lenborough and    on these subjects we may go into a committee at sheffieldplace but you know it is the rule of a committee not to hear any arguments against the principle of the bill at present i shall only observe that neither of these negociations ought to detain me here the former may be dispatched as well the latter much better in my absence vale  no clvi m gibbon a m deyverdun sheffielplace le    juillet      votre papier sest furieusement rappetise vous avez si bien retranche le superflu que vous oubliez lessentiel et ce nest que par des conjectures sines et savantes que je devine la date du tems et du lieu quant a moi je suis actuellement au chateau de milord sheffield a quarante milles de londres ce qui ajoute deux jours pour larrivee et le depart du courier je recois votre lettre je ne sais du quantieme le  0 juillet de lan de grace      je reponds du    du dit mois et de la dite annee le zele ne se rallentit point pour la consummation du grand oeuvre je sens votre proceed delicat et genereux et quoique je neusse pas ete fache de trouver dans votre fermete un appui a la mienne mon inclination est si bien affermie sur la base inebranlable de linclination et de la raison que je ne crains plus les obstacles exterieurs ni interieurs desque jai ose sixer mon depart les nuages qui le couvroient se sont evanouis les montagnes saplanissoient devant moi et les dragons qui setoient presents sur ma route se sont apprivoises la semaine passee je frappai le grand coup par la cassation du bail de ma maison de bentinckstreet et apres le mois de septembre si je ne couche pas a lausanne je coucherai dans la rue mes differens bonnets de nuit sarrangent tous les jours avec beaucoup dordre et de facilite lord sheffield lui meme ce terrible st george vrai champion de langleterre sest rendu a mes raisons ou plutot aux votres il est charm du tableau de votre premiere lettre et malgre lactivite de son ame au lieu de me condamner il me port envy et nous disputons un peu en lair sur le projet dune visit que lui son amiable compagne et sa fille ainee se proposent de nous fair dans deux ans aux bords du lac leman bien loin de combattre mon dessein il me conseille il me second dans lexecution et je naurai pas besoin de recourir aux lumieres de votre ami louis teyssier dautant plus que pour les menus details de la correspondence etrangere je trouve dans le libraire elmsly un conseiller sage instruit et discret    votre calcul de la depense de la maison surpass non pas absolument mes moyens mais un peu mes esperances et mes conjectures la consummation en suisse nest point chargee dimpots le vin y coule comme leau de fontaine votre jardin produit des fruits et des legumes se peut il que vingt ou trente louis se depensent tous les mois pour le pain la viande le bois la chandelle quelque peu de vin etranger les domestiques de la cuisine etc je me flat que dans lincertitude vous avez cave au plus fort mais enfin tout ce detail se reglera suivant nos gouts et nos facultes et un mois dexperience sera plus instructif que cent pages de raisonnemens la comparaison que vous me demandez de mon menage de londres ne meneroit a rien a la riguerur je ne tiens pas maison je ne done presque jamais a manger en hyver je dine assez rarement chez moi je ne soupe jamais et une party assez considerable de la depense celle des clubs et des tavernes nentre point dans le compte de la maison ma nourriture domestique nexcede pas toutefois votre calcul lausannois mais je sens la difference enter le petit couvert triste et mesquin dun garcon et la table honnete et hospitaliere de deux amiss qui auront dautres amiss etc  votre idee de masquer mes grands operations est de la plus profonde politic mais les declarations et meme les demarches qui seront necessaires pour me retirer de la chamber des communes declareront un peu trop tot letendue de mes projets cependant on peut tirer quelque parti de cette honnete dissimulation pour calmer un peu les scrupules et les regrets des dames agees que vous connoissez et que vous ne connoissez pas mais le moyen le plus efficace pour arreter ou pour ne pas ecouter les mauvais discourse cest de sy derober par une prompte fuite et depuis que ma resolution a ete prise je compte les jours et les momens le  0 du mois prochain je retournerai a londres ou je travaillerai vivement a preparer ce grand changement detat jattends tous les jours la reponse de madame gibbon a qui jai tache de persuader quune entrevue de trois ou quatre jours a bath seroit moins douce quamere a tous les deux si elle se rend ou fait semblant de se render a mes raisons je compte que tout fini la premiere ou du moins la second semaine de septembre et comme je couperai droit par la champagne et la franchecomte je pourrois fort bien me trouver a lausanne verse le  0 ou le    de ce mois la suppose toujours que cette promptitude vous convienne que votre maison sera libre et que vous y serez rendu vous meme javois quelque idee de me detourner par strasbourg de vous prendre a basle et de passer avec vous par berne etc mais tout bien considere jaime mieux abreger le grand voyage et reserver cette promenade si nous avions envy de la fair pour une saison plus tranquille jattends votre reponse dans une trentaine de jours mais sans lattendre je vous ecrirai de londres pour continuer le fill de lhistoire et peut etre pour vous charger de quelques achats de livres qui se feront plus commodement a basle qua lausanne vous ne me donnez point de commissions cependant ce pays nest pas sans industry milord et milady sheffield vous embrassent tres amicalement ce sera pour mois la perte la plus sensible  no clvii edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield monday august   th      in the preparation of my journey i have not felt any circumstance more deeply than the kind concern of lady sheffield and the silent grief of mrs porten yet the age of my friends makes a very essential difference i can scarcely hope ever to see my aunt again but i flatter myself that in less than two years my sister will make me a visit and that in less than four i shall return it with a cheerful heart at sheffieldplace business advances this morning my books were shipped for rouen and will reach lausanne almost as soon as myself on thursday morning the bulk of the library moves from bentinckstreet to downingstreet i shall escape from the noise to hampton court and spend three or four days in taking leave i want

unpleasant days of my life will the day of our meeting again be accompanied with proportionable satisfaction the business of preparation will serve to agitate and divert my thoughts but i do not like your brooding over melancholy ideas in your solitude and i heartily wish that both you and my dear lady s would immediately go over and pass a week at brighton such is our imperfect nature that

and your sanguine unsuspecting spirit not dreaming of your arrival i thought it unnecessary to apprize you that i delayed hampton to this day on monday i shall return and will expect you tuesday evening either in bentinck or downingstreet as you like best you have seen the piles of learning accumulated in your parlour the transportation will be achieved today and bentinckstreet is already reduced to a light ignorant habitation which i shall inhabit till about the first of september four days must be allowed for clearing and packing these i shall spend in downingstreet and after seeing you a moment on your return i shall start about saturday the sixth london is a desert and life without books business or society will be somewhat tedious from this state you will judge that your plan coincides very well only i think you should give me the whole of wednesday in bentinckstreet with regard to bushy perhaps as a compliment to lord l you had better defer it till your return i admire gregory way and should envy him if i did not possess a disposition somewhat similar to his own my lady will be reposed and restored at brighton the torrent of lords judges etc a proper remedy for you

sheffieldplace i forgot my friend deyverdun and the fair prospect of quiet and happiness which awaits me at lausanne i lost sight of our almost certain meeting at the end of a term which at our age cannot appear very distant nor could i amuse my uneasiness with the hopes the more doubtful prospect of your visit to switzerland the agitation of preparing every thing for my departure has in some degree diverted these melancholy thoughts yet i still look forwards to the decisive day tomorrow sennight with an anxiety of which yourself and lord s have the principal share  surely never any thing was so unlucky as the unseasonable death of sir john russel on his passage to his friend at sheffieldplace which so strongly reminded us of the instability of human life and human expectations the inundation of the assizes must have distressed and overpowered you but i hope and i wish to hear from yourself that the air of your favorite brighton the bathing and the quiet society of two or three friends have composed and revived your spirits present my love to sarah and compliments to miss carter etc give me a speedy and satisfactory line i am most truly yours  no clxii edward gibbon esquire

flanders mails are due aeolus does not seem to approve of my designs and there is little merit in waiting till friday i should wait with more reluctance did i think there was much chance of success i dine with craufurd and if any thing is decided will send an extraordinary gazette you have obliged me beyond expression by your kindness to aunt kitty she will drink her afternoon tea at sheffield next friday for my sake lady s will be kind to the old lady who will not be troublesome and will vanish at the first idea of brighton has not that salubrious air already produced some effects peace will be proclaimed tomorrow odd as war was never declared the buyers of stock seem as indifferent as yourself about the definitive treaty tell maria that though you had forgotten the annals de la virtue i have directed them to be sent but know nothing of their plan on merit adieu when you see my lady say every thing tender and friendly to her i did not know how much i loved her she may depend

a letter from deyverdun no it is not wonderful since no flanders mail is arrived tomorrow three will be due i am therefore in a miserable state of doubt and anxiety in a much better house indeed than my own but without books or business or society i send or call two or three times each day to elmslys and cna only say that i shall fly the next day saturday sunday etc after i have got my quietus aunt kitty was delighted with my ladys letter at her age and in her situation every kind attention is pleasant i took my leave this morning and as i did not wish to repeat the scene and thought she

detained day after day by the caprice of the winds three flanders mails are now due i know not how to move without the final letter from deyverdun which i expected a fortnight ago and my fancy perfectly unreasonable begins to create strange phantoms a state of suspense is painful but it will be alleviated by the short notes which i mean to write and hope to receive every post a separation has some advantages though they are purchased with bitter pangs among them is the pleasure of knowing how dear we are to our friends and how dear they are to us it will be a kind office to sooth aunt

reflections i have finally resolved begin my journey on monday a heavy journey with much apprehension and much regret yet i consider first that if he is alive and well an unpleasant if scarcely any event can have happened to disappoint our mutual wishes and  dly that supposing the very worst even that worst would not overthrow my general plan of living abroad though it would derange my hopes of a quiet and delightful establishment with my friend upon the whole without giving way to melancholy fears my reason conjectures that his indolence thought it superfluous to write any more that it was my business to act and move and his duty to sit still and receive me with open arms at least he is well informed of my operations as i wrote to him since his last july thirtyfirst from sheffiieldplace august nineteenth and this week september ninth the two first have already reached him  as i shall not arrive ar or depart from dover till tuesday night alas i may be confined there a week you will

cope with one and would not have been much afraid of the other last night the wind was so high that the vessel could not stir from the harbor this day it is brisk and fair we are flattered with the hope of making calais harbor by the same tide in three hours and a half but any delay will leave the disagreeable option of a tottering boat or a tossing night what a cursed thing to live in an island this step is more awkward than the whole journey the triumvirate of this memorable embarkation will consist of the grand gibbon henry laurence esquire president of congress and mr secretary colonel admiral philosopher thompson attended by three horses who are not the most agreeable fellowpassengers if we survive i will finish and seal my letter at calais our salvation shall be ascribed to the prayers of my lady and aunt for i do believe they both pray  boulogne thursday morning ten oclock instead of calais the wind has driven us to boulogne where we landed in the evening without much noise

short exceptions of time and place i have enjoyed good weather and good roads and at the end of the ninth day i feel so little fatigued that the journey appears no more than a pleasant airing i have generally conversed with homer and lord clarendon often with caplin and muff his dog  sometimes with the french postillions of the abovementioned animals the least rational tomorrow i lie at besancon and according to the arrangement of post or hired horses shall either sup at lausanne on friday or dine there saturday i feel some suspense and uneasiness with regard to deyverdun but in the scale both of reason and constitution my hopes preponderate very much above my fears from lausanne i will immediately write i embrace my lady if aut kittys gratitude and goodbreeding have not driven her away upon the first whisper of brighton she will share this intelligence if she is gone a line from you would be humane and attentive monsieur les chevaux seront prets a cinq heurs adieu i am going into an excellent bed about six feet high from the ground  no clxix edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne september  0th      i arrived safe in harbor last saturday the   th instant about ten oclock in the morning but as the post only goes out twice a week it was not in my power to write before this day except one day between langres and besancon which was laborious enough i finished my easy and gentle airing without any fatigue either of mind or body i found deyverdum well and happy but much more happy at the sight of a friend and the accomplishment of a scheme which he had so long and impatiently desired his garden terrace and park have even exceeded the most sanguine of my expectations and remembrances and you yourself cannot have forgotten the charming prospect of the lake the mountains and the declivity of the pays de vaud but as human life is perpetually chequered with good and evil i have found some disappointments on my arrival the easy nature of deyverdun his indolence and his impatience had promted him to reckon too positively that his house would be vacant at michaelmas some unforeseen difficulties have arisen or have been discovered when it was already too late and the consummation of our hopes is i am much afraid postponed to next spring at first i was knocked down by the unexpected thunderbolt but i have gradually been reconciled to my fate and have granted a free and gracious pardon to my friend as his own apartment which afforded me a temporary shelter is much too narrow for a settled residence we hired for the winter a convenient readyfurnished apartment in the nearest part of the rue de bourg whose back door leads in three steps to the terrace and garden as often as a tolerable day shall tempt us to enjoy their beauties and this arrangement has even its advantage of giving us time to deliberate and provide before we enter on larger and more regular establishment but this is not the sum of my misfortunes hear and pity the day after my arrival sunday we had just finished a very temperate dinner and intended to begin a round of visits on foot chapeau sous le bras when most unfortunately deyverdun proposed to show me something in the court we boldly and successfully ascended a flight of stone steps but in the descent i missed my footing and strained or sprained my ancle in a painful manner my old latent enemy i do not mean the devil who is always on the watch has made an ungenerous use of his advantage and i much fear that my arrival at lausanne will be marked with a fit of the gout though it is quite unnecessary that the intelligence or suspicion should find its way to bath yesterday afternoon i lay or at least sat in state to receive visits and at the same moment my room was filled with four different nations the loudest of these nations was the single voice of the abbe raynal who like your friend has chosen this place for the asylum of freedom and history his conversation which might be very agreeable is intolerably loud peremptory and insolent and you would imagine that he alone was the monarch and legislator of the world adieu i embrace my lady and the infants with regard to the important transactions for which you are constituted plenipotentiary i expect with some impatience but with perfect confidence the result of your labors you may remember what i mentioned of my conversation with    about the place of minister at bern i have talked it over with deyverdun who does not dislike the idea provided this place was allowed to be my villa during at least twothirds of the year but for my part i am sure that    are worth more than ministerial friendship and gratitude so i am inclined to think that they are preferable to an office which would be procured with difficulty enjoyed with constraint and expense and lost perhaps next april in the annual revolutions of our domestic government again adieu  no clxx edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lady sheffield lausanne october   th      the progress of my gout is in general so regular and there is so much uniformity in the history of its decline and fall that i have hitherto indulged my laziness without much shame or remorse without supposing that you would be very anxious for my safety which has been sufficiently provided for by the triple care of my friend deyverdun my humbler friend caplin and a very conversable physician not the famous tissot whose ordinary fee is ten batz about fifteen pence english after the usual increase and decrease of the member for it has been confined to the injured part the gout has retired in good order and the remains of weakness which obliged me to move on the rugged pavement of lausanne with a stick or rather small crutch are to be ascribed to the sprain which might have been a much more serious business as i have now spent a month at lausanne you will enquire with much curiosity more kindness and some mixture of spite and malignity how far the place has answered my expectations and whether i do not repent of resolution which has appeared so rash and ridiculous to my ambitious friends to this question however natural and reasonable i shall not return an immediate answer for two reasons   i have not yet made a fair trial the disappointment and delay with regard to deyverduns house will consine us this winter to lodgings rather convenient than spacious or pleasant i am only beginning to recover my stength and liberty and to look about on persons and things the greatest part of those persons are in the country taken up with their vintage my books are not yet arrived and in short i cannot look upon myself as settled in that comfortable way which you and i understand and relish yet the weather has been heavenly and till this time the end of october we enjoy the brightness of the fun and somewhat gently complain of its immoderate heat   if i should be too sanguine in explaining my satisfaction in what i have done you would ascribe that satisfaction to the novelty of the scene and the inconstancy of man and i deem it far more safe and prudent to postpone any positive declaration till i am placed by experience beyond the danger of repentance and recantation yet of one thing i am sure that i possess in this country as well as in england the best cordial of life a sincere tender and sensible friend adorned with the most valuable and pleasant qualities both of the heart and head the inferior enjoyments of leisure and society are likewise in my power and in the short excursions which i have hitherto made i have commenced or renewed my acquaintance with a certain number of persons more especially women who at least in france and this country are undoubtedly superior to our prouder sex of rational minds and elegant manners i breakfast alone and have declared that i receive no visits in a morning which you will easily suppose is devoted to study i find it impossible without inconvenience to defer my dinner beyond two oclock we have got a very good woman cook deyverdun who is somewhat of an epicurean philosopher understands the management of a table and we frequently invite a guest or two to share our luxurious but not extravagant repasts the afternoons are and will be much more so hereafter devoted to society and i shall sind it necessary to play at cards much oftener than in london but i do not dislike that way of passing a couple of hours and i shall not be ruined at shilling whist as yet i have not supped but in the course of the winter i must sometimes sacrifice an evening abroad and in exchange i hope sometimes to steal a day at home without going into company    i have all this time been talking to lord sheffield i hope that he has dispatched my affairs and it would give me pleasure to hear that i am no longer member for lymington nor lord of lenborough adieu i feel every day that the distance only to make me think with more tenderness of the persons whom i love  no clxxi edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne november   th      last tuesday november eleventh after plaguing and vexing yourself all the morning about some business of your fertile creation you went to the house of commons and passed the afternoon the evening and perhaps the night without sleep or food stifled in a close room by the heated respiration of six hundred politicians inflamed by party and passion and tired of the repetition of dull nonsense which in that illustrious assembly so far outweighs the proportion of reason and eloquence on the same day after a studious morning a friendly dinner and a cheerful assembly of both sexes i retired to rest at eleven oclock satisfied with the past day and certain that the next would afford me the return of the same quiet and rational enjoyments which has the better bargain seriously i am every hour more grateful to my own judgment and resolution and only regret that i so long delayed the execution of a favorite plan which i am convinced is the best adapted to my character an inclinations you conjecture of the revolutions of my face when i heard that the house was for this winter inacessible is probable but false i bore my disappointment with the temper of a sage and only use it to render the prospect of next year still more pleasing to my imagination you are likewise mistaken in imputing my fall to the awkwardness of my limbs the same accident might have happened to slingsby himself or to any hero of the age the most distinguished for his bodily activity i have now resumed my entire strength and walk with caution yet with speed and safety through the streets of this mountainous city after a month of the finest autumn i ever saw the bise the north east wind made me feel my old acquaintance the weather is now milder and this present day is dark and rainy not much better than what you probably enjoy in england the town is comparatively empty but the noblesse are returning every day from their chateaux and i already perceive that i shall more reason to complain to complain of dissipation than of dullness as i told lady s i am afraid of being too rash and hasty in expressing my satisfaction but i must again repeat that appearances are extremely favorable i am sensible that general praise conveys no distinct ideas but it is very difficult to enter into particulars where the individuals are unknown or indifferent to our correspondent you have forgotten the old generation and in twenty years a new one is grown up death has swept many from the world and chance or choice has brought many to this place if you enquire after your old acquaintance catherine you must be told that she is solitary ugly blind and universally forgotten your later flame and our common goddess the eliza passed a month at the inn she came to consult tissot and was acquainted with cerjat and now to business    with regard to meaner cases these are two which you can and will undertake   as i have not renounced my country i should be glad to hear of your parliamentary squabbles which may be done with small trouble and expense after an interesting debate my lady in due time may cut the speeches from woodfall you will write or dictate any curious anecdote and the whole enclosed in a letter may be dispatched to lausanne   a set of wedgewood china which we talked of in london and which would be most acceptable here as you have a sort of a taste i leave to your own choice the color and the pattern but as i have the inclination and means to live very handsomely here i desire that the size and number of things may be adequate to a plentiful table if you see lord north assure him of my gratitude had he been a more successful friend i should now be drudging at the board of customs or vexed with business in the amiable society of  to lord loughborough present an affectionate sentiment i am satisfied of his intention to serve me if i had not been in such a fidget i am sure you will not fail while you are in town to visit and comfort poor aunt kitty i wrote to her on my first arrival and she may be assured that i will not neglect her to my lady i say nothing we have now our private correspondence into which the eye of an husband should not be permitted to intrude i am really satisfied with the success of the pamphlet observations on the commerce with the american states  not only because i have a sneaking kindness for the author but as it shows me that plain sense full information and warm spirit are still acceptable in the world you talk of lausanne as a place of retirement yet from the situation and freedom of the pays de vaud all nations and all extraordinary characters are astonished to meet each other the abbe raynal the grand gibbon and mercier author of the tableau de paris have been in the same room the other day the prince and princess de ligne the duke and duchess dursel etc came from brussels on purpose literally true to act a comedy at    in the country he was dying and could not appear but we had comedy ball and supper the event seems to have revived him for that great man is fallen from his ancient glory and his nearest relations refuse to see him i told you of poor catherines deplorable state but madame de mesery at the age of sixtynine is still handsome adieu  no clxxii edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne december  0th      i have received both your epistles and as any excuse will serve a man who is at the same time very busy and very idle i patiently expected the second before i entertained any thoughts of answering the first    i therefore conclude that on every principle of common sense before this moment your active zeal has already expelled me from the house to which without regret i bid an everlasting farewell the agreeable hour of five oclock in the morning at which you commonly retire does not tend to revive my attachment but if you add the soft hours of your morning committee a select committee for inquiring into frauds committed in respect to the revenue  in the discussion of taxes customs frauds smugglers etc i think i should beg to be released and quietly sent to the galleys as a place of leisure and freedom yet i do not depart from my general principles of toleration some animals are made to live in the water others on the earth many in the air and some as it is now believed even in fire your present hurry of parliament i perfectly understand when opposition make the attack  horae momento cita mors venit aut victoria laeta but when the minister brings forward any strong and decisive measure the at length prevails but his progress is retarded at every step and in every stage of the bill by a pertinacious though unsuccessful minority i am not sorry to hear of the splendor of fox i am proud in a foreign country of his fame and abilities and our little animosities are extinguished by my retreat from the english stage with regard to the substance of the business i scarcely know what to think the vices of the company east india company  both in their persons and their constitution were manifold and manifest the danger was imminent and such an empire with thirty millions of subjects was not to be lost for trifles yet on the other hand the faith of charters the rights of property i hesitate and tremble such an innovation would at least require that the remedy should be as certain as the evil and the proprietors may perhaps insinuate that they were as competent guardians of their own affairs as either    or    their acting without a salary seems childish and their not being removable by the crown is a strange and dangerous precedent but enough of politics which i now begin to view through a thin cold distant cloud yet not without a reasonable degree of curiosity and patriotism from the papers especially when you add an occasional slice of the chronicle i shall be amply informed of facts and debates from you i expect the causes rather than the events the true springs of action and those interesting ancedotes which seldom ascend the garret of a fleet street editor you say that many friends alias acquaintance have expressed curiosity and concern i should not wish to be immediately forgotten that others you once mentioned gerard hamilton condemn government for suffering the departure of a man who might have done them some credit and some service perhaps as much as    himself to you in the confidence of friendship and without either pride or resentment i will fairly own that i am somewhat of gerardss opinion and if i did not compare it with the rest of his character i should be astonished that    suffered me to depart without even a civil answer to my letter were i capable of hating a man whom it is not easy to hate i should sind myself amply revenged by    but the happy souls in paradise are susceptible only of love and pity and though lausanne is not a paradise more especially in winter i do assure you in sober proof that it has hitherto fulfilled and even surpassed my warmest expectation yet i often cast a look toward sheffieldplace where you now repose if you can repose during the christmas recess embrace my lady the young baroness and the gentle louisa and insinuate to your silent consort that separate letters require separate answers had i an air balloon the great topic of modern conversation i would call upon you till the meeting of parliament vale  no clxxiii edward gibbon esquire to mrs porten lausanne december   th      dear madam the unfortunate are loud and loquacious in their complaints but real happiness is content with its own silent enjoyment and if that happiness is of a quiet uniform kind we suffer days and weeks to elapse without communicating our sensations to a distant friend by you therefore whose temper and understanding have extracted from human life on every occasion the best and most comfortable ingredients my silence will always be interpreted as an evidence of content and you would only be alarmed the danger is not at hand by the too frequent repetition of my letters perhaps i should have continued to slumber i dont know how long had i not been awakened by the anxiety which you express in your last letter     from this base subject i ascend to one which more seriously and strongly engages your thoughts the consideration of my health and happiness and you will give me credit when i assure you with sincerity that i have not repented a single moment of the step which i have taken and that i only regret the not having executed the same design two or five or even ten years ago by this time i might have returned independent and rich to my native country i should have escaped many disagreeable events that have happened in the meanwhile and i should have avoided the parliamentary life which experience has proved to be neither suitable to my temper nor conducive to my fortune in speaking of the happiness which i enjoy you will agree with me in giving the preference to a sincere and sensible friend and though you cannot discern the full extent of his merit you will easily believe that deyverdun is the man perhaps two persons so perfectly fitted to live togethe were never ormed by nature and education we have both read and seen a great variety of objects the lights and shades of our different characters are happily blended and a friendship of thirty years has taught us to enjoy our mutual advantages and to support our unavoidable imperfections in love and marriage some harsh sounds will sometimes interrupt the harmony and in the course of time like our neighbors we must expect some disagreeable moments but confidence and freedom are the two pillars of our union and i am much mistaken if the building be not solid and comfortable one disappointment i have indeed experienced and patiently supported the family who were settled in deyverduns house started some unexpected difficulties and will not leave it till the spring so that you must not yet expect any poetical or even historical description of the beauties of my habitation during the dull months of winter we are satisfied with a very comfortable apartment in the middle of the town and even derive some advantage from this delay as it gives us time to arrange some plans of alteration and furniture which will embellish our future and more elegant dwelling in this season i rise not at four in the morning but a little before eight at nine i am called from my study to breakfast which i always perform alone in the english style and with the aid of caplin i perceive no difference between lausanne and bentinckstreet our mornings are usually passed in separate studies we never approach each others door without a previous message or thrice knocking and my apartment is already sacred and formidable to strangers i dress at half past one and at two an early hour to which i am not perfectly reconciled we sit down to dinner we have hired a female cook wellskilled in her profession and accustomed to the taste of every nation as for instance we had excellent mincepies yesterday after dinner and the departure of our company one two or three friends we read together some amusing book or play at chess or retire to our rooms or make visits or go to the coffeehouse between six and seven the assemblies begin and i am oppressed only with their number and variety whist at shillings or halfcrowns is the game i generally play and i play three rubbers with pleasure between nine and ten we withdraw to our bread and chief and friendly converse which sends us to bed at eleven but these sober hours are too often interrupted by private or numerous suppers which i have not the courage to resist though i practice a laudable abstinence at the best furnished tables such is the skeleton of my life it is impossible to communicate a perfect idea of the vital and substantial parts the characters of the men and women with whom i have very easily connected myself in looser and closer bonds according to their inclination and my own if i do not deceive myself and if deyverdun does not flatter me i am already a general favorite and as our likings and dislikes are commonly mutual i am equally satisfied with the freedom and elegance of manners and after proper allowances and exceptions with the worthy and amiable qualities of many individuals the autumn has been beautiful and the winter hitherto mild but in january we must expect some severe frost instead of rollings in a coach i walk the streets wrapped up in a fur cloak but this exercise is wholesome and except an accidental fit of the gout of a few days i never enjoyed better health i am no longer in pavillards house where i was almost starved with cold and hunger and you may be assured that i now enjoy every benefit of comfort plenty and even decent luxury you wish me happy acknowledge that such a life is more conducive to happiness than five nights in the week passed in the house of commons or five mornings spent at the customhouse send me in return a fair account of your own situation in mind and body i am satisfied your own good sense would have reconciled you to inevitable separation but there never was a more suitable diversion than your visit to sheffieldplace among the innumerable proofs of friendship which i have received from that family there are none which affect me more sensibly than their kind civilities to you though i am persuaded that they are at least as much on your account as on mine at length madame de    is delivered by her tyrants death her daughter a valuable woman of this place has made some enquiries and though her own circumstances are narrow she will not suffer her fathers widow to be left totally destitute i am glad you derived so much melancholy pleasure from the letters yet had i known it i should have withheld     no clxxiv edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne january   th      within two or three days after your last gracious epistle your complaints were silenced and your enquiries were satisfied by an ample dispatch of four pages which overflowed the inside of the cover and in which i exposed my opinions of things in general public as well as private as they existed in my mind in my state of ignorance and error about the eighteenth or twentieth of last month within a week after that date i epistolished in the same rich and copious strain the two venerable females of newmanstreet and bath whose murmurings must now be changed into songs of gratitude and applause my correspondence with the holy matron of northamptonshire has been less lively and loquacious you have not forgotten the authors vindication of himself from the foul calumnies of pretended christians within a fortnight after his arrival at lausanne he communicated the joyful event to mrs esther gibbon she answered per return of post both letters at the same time and in very dutiful language almost excusing her advice which was intended for my spiritual as well as temporal good and assuring me that nobody should be able to injure me with her unless the saint is an hypocrite such an expression must convey a favorable and important meaning at all events it is worth giving ourselves some trouble about her without indulging any sanguine expectations of inheritance so much for my females with regard to my male correspondents you are the only one to whom i have given any signs of my existence though i have formed many a generous resolution yet i am not insensible of the kind and friendly manner in which lord loughborough has distinguished me he could have no inducements of interest and now that i veiw the distant picture with impartial eyes i am convinced that for a statesman he was sincere in his wishes to serve me when you see him the pains eden crauford etc tell them that i am well happy and ashamed on your side the zeal and diligence of your pen has surprised and delighted me and your letters at this interesting moment are exactly such as i wished them to be  authentic anecdotes and rational speculations worthy of a man who acts a part in the great theater and who fills a seat not only in the general pandaemonium but in the private council of the princes of the infernal regions with regard to the detail of parliamentary operations i must repeat my request to you or rather to my lady who will now be on the spot that she will write not with her pen but with her scissars and that after every debate which deserves to pass the sea and mountains she will dissect the faithful narrative of woodfall and send it off by the next post as an agreeable supplement to the meagre accounts of our weekly papers the wonderful revolutions of last month have sounded to my ear more like the shifting scenes of a comedy or comicopera than like the sober events of real and modern history and the irregularity of our winter posts which sometimes retarded and sometimes hastened the arrival of the dispatches has increased the confusion of our ideas surely the lord has blinded the eyes of pharaoh and of his servants the obstinacy of last spring was nothings compared to the headstrong and headlong madness of this winter i expect with much impatience the first days of your meeting the purity and integrity of the coalition will suffer a fiery trial but if they are true to themselves and to each other a majority of the house of commons must prevail the rebellion of the young gentlemen will be crushed and the masters will resume the government of the school after the address and answer i have no conception that parliament can be dissolved during the session but if the present ministry can outlive the storm i think the deathwarrant will infallibly be signed in the summer here i blush for my country without confessing her shame fox acted like a man of honor yet surely his union with pit affords the only hope of salvation how miserably are we wasting the season of peace  i have written three pages before i come to my own business and feelings in the first place i most sincerely rejoice that i left the ship and swam ashore on a plank the daily and hourly agitation in which i must have lived would have made me truly miserable and if i had obtained a place during pleasure    for instance on the first news of the dissolution i considered my seat as so totally and irrecoverably gone that i have been less afflicted with   s obstinacy    on this occasion remember you are acting for a poor friend dismiss a little of the spirit of faction and patriotism and stoop to a prudential line of conduct which in your own case you might possibly disdain    perhaps you will abuse my prudence and patriotism when i inform you that i have already vested a part thirty thousand livres about one thousand three hundred puunds in the new loan of the king of france i get eight per cent on the joint lives of deyverdun and myself besides thirty tickets in a very advantageous lottery of which the highest prize is an annuity of forty thousand livres one thousand seven hundred pounds a year at this moment the beginning of a peace and probably a long peace i think and the world seems to think the french funds at least as solid as our own i have empowered my agent m de lessart a capital banker at paris to draw upon gosling for the money two months hence and to avoid all accidents that may result from untoward delays and mercantile churlishness i expect that you will support my credit in fleet street with you own more respectable name    what say you now am i not a wise man my letter is enormous and the post on the wing in a few days i will write to my lady herself and enter something more into the details of domestic life suffice it to say that the scene becomes each day more pleasant and comfortable and that i complain only of the dissipation of lausanne in the course of march or april we shall take possession of deyverduns house my books which by some strange neglect did not leave paris till the third of this month will arrive in a few weeks and i shall soon resume the continuation of my history which i shall prosecute with the more vigor as the completion affords me a distant prospect of a visit to england adieu ever yours  no clxxv edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne february  d      baron after my last enormous dispatch nothing can remain except some small gleanings or occasional hints and thus in order i am not conscious that any of your valuable mss have miscarried or that i have omitted to answer any essential particulars they stand in my bureau carefully arranged and docketed under the following dates september twentythree october twentythree november eighteen december two december fifteen december nineteen december twentythree december twentynine january sixteen which last i have received this day february  d for greater perspicuity it will not be amiss on either side to number our future epistles by a conspicuous roman character inscribed in the front to which we may at any time refer but instead of writing by ostend the shorter and surer way especially on all occasions that deserve celerity will be to enclose them to my banker m de lessart at paris who will forward them to me through germany the passage by sea is more uncertain the roads worse and the distance greater we often complain of delay and irregularity at this interesting moment by your last i find that you have boldly and generously opened a treaty with the enemy which i proposed with fear and hesitation i impatiently expect the result and again repeat that whatever you can obtain for    i shall consider it as so much saved out of the fire etc etc do you remember dunnings motion in the year    0 to address the crown against a dissolution of parliament a simple address we rejected as an infringement on the prerogative yet how far short of these strong democratical measures for which you have probably voted as i should probably have done such is the contagion of party fox drives most furiously yet i should not be surprised if pitts moderation and character should insensibly win the nation and even the house to espouse his cause    unless when i look back on england with a selfish or a tender regard my hours roll away very pleasantly and i can again repeat with truth that i have not regretted one single moment the step which i have taken we are now at the height of the winter dissipation and i am peculiarly happy when i can steal away from great assemblies and suppers of twenty or thirty people to a more private party of some of those persons whom i begin to call my friends till we are settled in our house little can be expected on our side yet i have already given two or three handsome dinners and though every thing is grown dearer i am not alarmed at the general view of my expense deyverdun salutes you and we are agreed that few married couples are better entitled to the flitch of bacon than we shall be at the end of the year when i had written about half this epistle my books arrived at our first meeting all was rapture and confusion and two or three posts from the second to this day the fourteenth have been suffered to depart unnoticed your letter of the twentyseventh of january which was not received till yesterday has again awakened me and i thought the surest way would be to send off this single sheet without any farther delay  i sincerely rejoice in the stability of parliament this supposition was founded on mr bankss declaration in the name of mr pit  and the first faint dawn of reconciliation which must however be effected by the equal balance of parties rather than by the wisdom of the country gentlemen at the st albans tavern   my lady  but it would be highly incongruous to begin my letter at the bottom of the page adieu therefore till next post  no clxxvi edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne may   th      alas alas alas we may now exchange our mutual condolence last christmas on the change of administration i was struck with the thunderbolt of the unexpected event and in the approaching dissolution i soresaw the loss of    the long continuance and various changes of the tempest rendered me by degrees callous and insensible when the art of the mariners was exhausted i felt that we were sinking i expected the ship to founder and when the fatal moment arrived i was even pleased to be delivered from hope and fear to the calmness of despair i now turn my eyes not on the past but on the present and the future what is lost i try to consider as if it never had existed and every day i congratulate my own good fortune let me say my prudence and resolution in migrating from your noisy stage to a scene of repose and content but even in this separate state i was still anxious for my friend upon english earth and at first was much delighted with your hint that you were setting off for coventry without any prospect of an opposition every post wednesdays and saturdays i eagerly looked for the intelligence of your victory and in spite of my misbehaviour which i do not deny i must abuse my lady rather than you for leaving me in so painful a situation each day raised and increased my apprehension the courier de l europe first announced the contest the english papers proclaimed your defeat and your last letter which i received four days ago showed me that you exerted first the spirit and at last the temper of an hero i am not much surprised that you should have been swept away in the general unpopularity since even in this quiet place your friends are considered as a factious crew acting in direct opposition both to the king and people for yourself i am at a loss what to say if this repulse should teach you to renounce all connection with kings and ministers and patriots and parties and parliaments for all of which you are by many degrees too honest i should exclaim with teague of respectable memory by my shoul dear joy you have gained a loss private life whether contemplative or active has surely more solid and independent charms you have some domestic comforts sheffieldplace is still susceptible of useful and ornamental improvements alas how much better might even the last    have been laid out and if these cares are not sufficient to occupy your leisure i can trust your restless and enterprising spirit to find new methods to preserve you from the insipidity of repose but i much fear your discontent and regret at being excluded from that pandaemonium which we have so often cursed as long as you were obliged to attend it the leaders of the party will flatter you with the opinion of their friendship and your own importance the warmith of your temper makes you credulous and unsuspicious and like the rest of our species male and female you are not absolutely deaf to the voice of praise some other place will be suggested easy honorable certain where nothing is wanted but a man of character and spirit to head a superior interest the opposition if any is contemptible and the expense cannot be large you will go down find almost every circumstance falsely stated repent that you had engaged yourself but you cannot desert those friends who are firmly attached to your cause besides the money you have already spent would have been thrown away another thousand will complete the business deeper and deeper will you plunge and the last evil will be worse than the first you see i am a freespoken counselor may i not be a true prophet did i consult my own wishes i should observe to you that as you are no longer a slave you might soon be transported as you seem to desire to one of the alpine hills the purity and calmness of the air is the best calculated to allay the heat of a political fever the education of the two princesses might be successfully conducted under your eye and that of my lady and if you had resolution to determine on a residence not a visit at lausanne your worldly affairs might repose themselves after their late fatigues but you know that i am a friend to toleration and am always disposed to make the largest allowance for the different natures of animals a lion and a lamb an eagle and a worm i am afraid we are too quiet for you here it would not be easy for you to create any business you have for some time neglected books and i doubt whether you would not think our suppers and assemblies somewhat trifling and insipid you are far more difficult than i am you are in search of knowledge and you are not content with your company unless you can derive from them information or extraordinary amusement for my part i like to draw information from books and i am satisfied with polite attention and easy manners finally i am happy to tell and you will be happy to hear that this place has in every respect exceeded my best and most sanguine hopes how often have you said as often as i expressed any illhumour against the hurry the expense and the precarious condition of my london life ay that is a nonsensical scheme of retiring to lausanne that you have got into your head a pretty fancy you remember how much you liked it in your youth but you have now seen more of the world and if you were to try it again you would find yourself woefully disappointed i had it in my head in my heart i have tried it i have not been disappointed and my knowledge of the world has served only to convince me that a capital and a crowd may contain much less real society than the small circle of this gentle retirement the winter has been longer but as far as i can learn less rigorous than in the rest of europe the spring is now bursting upon us and in our own garden it is displayed in all its glory i already occupy a temporary apartment and we live in the lower part of the house before you receive this we shall be in full possession we have much to enjoy and something to do which i take to be the happiest condition of human life now for business the kind of subject which i always undertake with the most reluctance and leave with the most pleasure    adieu  and now my lady  let me approach your gentle not grimalkin presence with deep remorse you have indirectly been informed of my state of mind and body the whole winter i have not had the slightest return of the gout or any other complaint whatsoever you have been apprised and are now apprised of my motions or rather of my perfect and agreeable repose yet i must confess and i feel that something of a direct and personal exchange of sentiment has been neglected on my side though i still persuade myself that when i am settled in my new house i shall have more subject as well as leisure to write such tricks of laziness your active spirit is a stranger to though mrs    complains that she has never had an answer to her last letters poor lady pembroke you will feel for her after a cruel alternative of hope and fear her only daughter lady charlotte died at aix en provence they have persuaded her to come to this place where she is intimately connected with the cerjat family she has taken an agreeable house about three miles from the town and lives retired i have seen her her behavior is calm but her affliction  i accept with gratitude your friendly proposal of wedgewoods ware and should be glad to have it bought and packed and sent without delay through germany and i shall only say that i wish to have a very complete service for two courses and a desert and that our suppers are numerous frequently fifteen or twenty persons adieu i do not mean this as your letter you are very good to poor kitty with you i do not condole about coventry  no clxxvii edward gibbon esquire to mrs gibbon bath lausanne may   th      dear madam i begin without preface or apology as if i had received your letter by the last post in my own defense i know not what to say but if i were disposed to recriminate i might observe that you yourself are not perfectly free from the sin of laziness and procrastination i have often wondered why we are not fonder of letterwriting we all delight to talk of ourselves and it is only in letters in writing to a friend that we can enjoy that conversation not only without reproach or interruption but with the highest propriety and mutual satisfaction sure that the person whom we address feels an equal or at least a strong and lively interest in the consideration of the pleasing subject on the subject therefore of self i will entertain a friend to whom none of my thoughts or actions none of my pains or pleasures can ever be indifferent when i first cherished the design of retiring to lausanne i was much more apprehensive of wounding your tender attachment than of offending lord sheffields manly and vehement friendship in the abolition of the board of trade the motives for my retreat became more urgent and forcible i wished to break loose yet i delayed above a year before i could take my final resolution and the letter in which i disclosed it to you cost me one of the most painful struggles of my life as soon as i had conquered that difficulty all meaner obstacles fell before me and in a few weeks i found myself at lausanne astonished at my firmness and my success perhaps you still blame or still lament the step which i have taken if on your own account i can only sympathize with your feelings the recollection of which often costs me a sigh if on mine let me fairly state what i have escaped in england and what i have found at lausanne recollect the tempests of this winter how many anxious days i should have passed how many noisy turbulent hot unwholesome nights while my political existence and that of my friends was at stake yet these feeble efforts would have been unavailing i should have lost my seat in parliament and after the extraordinary expense of another year i must still have pursued the road of switzerland unless i had been tempted by some selfish patron or by lord ss aspiring spirit to incur a most inconvenient expense for a new seat and once more at the beginning of an opposition to engage in new scenes of business as to the immediate prospect of any thing like a quiet and profitable retreat i should not know where to look my friends are no longer in power with    and his party i have no connection and were he disposed to favor a man of letters it is difficult to say what he could give or what i would accept the reign of pensions and sinecures is at an end and a commission in the excise or customs the summit of my hopes would give me income at the expense of leisure and liberty when i revolve these circumstances in my mind my only regret i repeat it again and again is that i did not embrace this salutary measure three five ten years ago thus much i thought it necessary to say and shall now dismiss this unpleasing part of the subject for my situation here health is the first consideration and on that head your tenderness had conceived some degree of anxiety i know not whether it has reached you that i had a sit of the gout the day after my arrival the deed is true but the cause was accidental carelessly stepping down a flight of stairs i sprained my ancle and my ungenerous enemy instantly took advantage of my weakness but since my breaking that double chain i have enjoyed a winter of the most perfect health that i have perhaps ever known without any mixture of the little flying incommodities which in my best days have sometimes disturbed the tranquillity of my english life you are not ignorant of dr tissots reputation and his merit is even above his reputation he assures me that in his opinion the moisture of england and holland is most pernicious the dry pure air of switzerland most favorable to a gouty constitution that experience justifies the theory and that there are fewer martyrs of that disorder in this than in any other country in europe this winter has every where been most uncommonly severe and you seem in england to have had your full share of the general hardship but in this corner surrounded by the alps it has rather been long than rigorous and its duration stole away our spring and left us no interval between furs and silks we now enjoy the genial influence of the climate and the season and no station was ever more calculated to enjoy them than deyverduns house and garden which are now become my own you will not expect that the pen should describe what the pencil would imperfectly delineate a few circumsta y however be mentioned my library is about the same size  in bentinckstreet with this difference however that instead of king on a paved court twelve feet square i command a boundles prospect of vale mountain and water from my three windows my apartment is completed by a spacious light closet or storeroom with a bedchamber and dressing room deyverduns habitation is pleasant and convenient though less extensive for our common use we have a very handsome winter apartment of four rooms and on the groundfloor two cool saloons for the summer with a sufficiency or rather superfluity of offices etc a terrace one hundred yards long extends beyond the front of the house and leads to a close impenetrable shrubbery and from thence the circuit of a long and various walk carries me round a meadow and vineyard the intervals afford abundant supply of fruit and every sort of vegetables and if you add that this villa which has been much ornamented by my friend touches the best and most sociable part of the town you will agree with me that few persons either princes or philosophers enjoy a more desirable residence deyverdun who is proud of his own works often walks me round pointing out with acknowledgment and enthusiasm the beauties that change with every step and with every variation of light i share or at least i sympathize with his pleasure he appears contented with my progress and has already told several people that he does not despair of making me a gardener be that as it may you will be glad to hear that i am by my own choice infinitely more in motion and in the open air than i ever have been formerly yet my perfect liberty and leisure leave me many studious hours and as the circle of our acquaintance retire into the country i shall be much less engaged in company and diversion i have seriously resumed the prosecution of my history each day and each month adds something to the completion of the great work the progress is slow the labor continual and the end remote and uncertain yet every day brings its amusement as well as labor and though i dare not fix a term even in my own fancy i advance with the pleasing reflection that the business of publication should i be detained here so long must enforce my return to england and restore me to the best of mothers and friends in the mean while with health and competence a full independence of mind and action a delightful habitation a true friend and many pleasant acquaintance you will allow that i am rather an object of envy than of pity and if you were more conversant with the use of the french language i would seriously propose to you to repose yourself with us in this fine country my indirect intelligence on which i sometimes depend with more implicit faith than on the kind dissimulation of your friendship gives me reason to hope that the last winter has been more favorable to your health than the preceding one assure me of it yourself honestly and truly and you will afford me one of the most lively pleasures  no clxxviii edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne june   th         in this glorious season i frequently give tea and supper to a dozen men and women with case and reputation and heartily wish you and my lady were among them in this corner of europe we enjoy or shall speedily enjoy besides threescore english with lady pembroke and forty french with the duchess de sivrac at their head m and madame necker the abbe raynal the hereditary prince of brunswick prince henry of prussia perhaps the duke of cumberland yet i am still more content with the humble natives than with most of these illustrious names adieu the post is on the wing and you owe me a long epistle i am as usual in the firm intention of writing next week to my lady  no clxxix the same to the same lausanne october   th      since my retreat to lausanne our correspondence has never received so long an interruption and as i have been equally taciturn with the rest of the english world it may now be a problem among that skeptical nation whether the historian of the decline and fall be a living substance or an empty name so tremendous is the sleepy power of laziness and habit that the silence of each post operated still more strongly to benumb the hand and to freeze the epistolary ink how or when i should have naturally awakened i cannot tell but the pressure of my affairs and the arrival of your last letter compel me to remember that you are entrusted with the final amputation of the best limb of my property the subject is in itself so painful that i have postponed it like a childs physic from day to day and losing whole mornings as i walked about my library in useless regret and impotent resolution you will be amazed to hear that after peeping to see if you are all well and returned from ireland i have not yet had the courage to peruse your letter for fear of meeting with some gloomy intelligence and i will now finish what i have to say of pecuniary matters before i know whether its contents will fortify or overthrow my unbiassed sentiments    to what purpose will you say are these tardy and useless repinings to arraign your manager no i am satisfied with the skill and firmness of the pilot and complain only of the untoward violence of the tempest to repent of your retreat into switzerland no surely every subsequent event has tended to make it as necessary as it has proved agreeable why then these lamentations hear and attend  it is to interest if possible more strongly your zeal and friendship to justify a sort of avarice a love of money very soreign to my character but with which i cling to these last fragments of my fortune    as far as i can judge from the experience of a year though i find lausanne much more expensive than i imagined yet my style of living and a very handsome style it is will be brought nearly within my ordinary revenues i wish our poor country could say as much but it was always my favorite and rational wish that at the winding up of my affairs i might possess a sum from one to two thousand pounds neither buried in land nor locked up in the funds but free light and ready to obey any call of interest or pleasure or virtue to defray any extraordinary expense support any delay or remove any obstacle for the attainment of this object i trust in your assistance    thus much for this money transaction to you i need add no other stimulative than to say that my ease and comfort very much depend on the success of this plan  as i thought every man of sense and fortune in ireland must be satisfied i did not conceive the cloud so dark as you represent it i will seriously peruse the  vo and in due time the  to edition of observations on the commerce with the american states  it would become a classic book if you could find leisure will you ever find it to introduce order and ornament you must negociate directly with deyverdun but the state will not hear of parting with their only reynolds alluding to his portrait i embrace my lady let her be angry provided she be well adieu yours  p s the care of ireland may have amused you in the summer but how do you mean to employ the winter do you not cast a longing lingering look at st stephens chapel with your fiery spirit and firm judgment i almost wish you there not for your benefit but for the public if you resolve to recover your seat do not listen to any fallacious and infinite projects of interest contest return petition etc but limit your expense  no clxxx edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lady sheffield lausanne october   d      a few weeks ago as i was walking on our terrace with m tissot the celebrated physician m mercier the author of the tableau de paris the abbe raynal monsieur madame and mademoiselle necker the abbe de bourbon a natural son of lewis the fifteenth the hereditary prince of brunswick prince henry of prussia and a dozen counts barons and extraordinary persons among whom was a natural son of the empress of russia  are you satisfied with this lift which i could enlarge and embellish without departing from truth and was not the baron of sheffield profound as he is on the subject of the american trade doubly mistaken with regard to gibbon and lausanne whenever i used to hint my design of retiring that illustrious baron after a proper effusion of d  d fools condescended to observe that such an obscure nook in switzerland might please me in the ignorance of youth but that after tasting for so many years the various society of paris and london i should soon be tired with the dull and uniform round of a provincial town in the winter lausanne is indeed reduced to its native powers but during the summer it is possibly after spa one of the most favorite places of general resort the tour of switzerland the alps and the glaciers is become a fashion tissot attracts the invalids especially from france and a colony of english have taken up the habit of spending their winters at nice and their summers in the pays de vaud such are the splendor and variety of our summer visitors and you will agree with me more readily than the baron when i say that this variety instead of being a merit is in my opinion one of the very few objections to the residence of lausanne after the dissipation of the winter i expected to have enjoyed with more freedom and solitude myself my friend my books and this delicious paradise but my position and character make me here a sort of a public character and oblige me to see and be seen however it is my firm resolution for next summer to assume the independence of a philosopher and to be visible only to the persons whom i like on the principle i should not most assuredly have avoided the neckers and prince henry the former have purchased the barony of copet near geneva and as the buildings were very much out of repair they passed this summer at a countryhouse at the gates of lausanne they afford a new example that persons who have tasted of greatness can seldom return with pleasure to a private station in the moments when we were alone he conversed with me freely and i believe truly on the subject of his administration and fall and has opened several passages of modern history which would make a very good figure in the american book observation on the commerce with the american states if they spent the summers at the castle of copet about nine leagues from hence a fortnight or three weeks visit would be a pleasant and healthful excursion but alas i fear there is little appearance of its being executed her health is impaired by the agitation of her mind instead of returning to paris she is ordered to pass the winter in the southern provinces of france and our last parting was solemn as i very much doubt whether i shall ever see her again they have now a very troublesome charge which you will exeprience in a few years the disposal of a baroness mademoiselle now madame de staal necker one of the greatest heiresses in europe is now about eighteen wild vain but goodnatured and with a much larger provision of wit than of beauty what increases their difficulties is their religious obstinacy of marrying her only to a protestant it would be an excellent opportunity for a young englishman of a great name and a fair reputation prince henry must be a man of sense for he took more notice and expressed more esteem for me than any body else he is certainly without touching his military character a very lively and entertaining companion he talked with freedom and generally with contempt of most of the princes of europe with respect of the empress of russia but never mentioned the name of his brother except once when he hinted that it was he himself that won the battle of rosbach his nephew and our nephew the hereditary prince of brunswick is here for his education of the english who live very much as a national colony you will like to hear of mrs fraser and one more donna catherian the honorable mrs fraser pleases every body by the perfect simplicity of her state of nature you know she has had resolution to return from england where she told me she saw you to lausanne for the sake of miss bristow who is in bad health and in a few days they set off for nice the other is the eliza she passed through lausanne in her road from italy to england poorly in health but still adorable nay do not frown and i enjoyed some delightful hours by her bedside she wrote me a line from paris but has not executed her promise of visiting lausanne in the month of october my pen has run much faster and much farther than i intended on the subject of other yet in describing them i have thrown some light over myself and my situation a year a very short one has now clapsed since my arrival at lausanne and after a cool review of my sentiments i can sincerely declare that i have never during a single moment repented of having executed my obsurd project of retiring to lausanne it is needless to dwell on the fatigue the hurry the vexation which i must have felt in the narrow and dirty circle of english politics my present life wants no foil and shines by its own native light the chosen part of my library is now arrived and arranged in a room full as good as that in bentinckstreet with this difference indeed that instead of looking on a stone court twelve feet square i command from three windows of plateglass an unbounded prospect of many a league of vineyard of fields of wood of lake and of mountains a scene which lord sheffield will tell you is superior to all you can imagine the climate though severe in winter has perfectly agreed with my constitution and the year is accomplished without any return of the gout an excellent house a good table a pleasant garden are no contemptible ingredients in human happiness the general style of society hits my sancy i have cultivated a large and agrecable circle of acquaintance and i am much deceived if i have not laid the foundations of two or three more intimate and valuable connections but their names would be indifferent and it would require pages or rather volumes to describe their persons and characters with regard to my standing dish my domestic friend i could not be much disappointed after an intimacy of eightandtwenty years his heart and his head are excellent he has the warmest attachment for me he is satisfied that i have the same for him some slight imperfections must be mutually supported two bachelors who have lived so long alone and independent have their peculiar fancies and humors and when the mask of form and ceremony is laid aside every moment in a familylife has not the sweetness of the honeymoon even between the husbands and wives who have the truest and most tender regard for each other should you be very much surprised to hear of my being married amazing as it may seem i do assure you that the event is less improbable than it would have appeared to myself a twelvemonth ago deyverdun and i have often agreed in jest and in earnest that a house like ours would be regulated and graced and enlivened by an agreeable female companion but each of us seems desirous that his friend should sacrifice himself for the public good since my residence here i have lived much in womens company and to your credit be it spoken i like you the better the more i see of you not that i am in love with any particular person i have discovered about halfadozen wives who would please me in different ways and by various merits one as a mistress a widow vastly like the eliza if she returns i am to bring them together a second a lively entertaining acquaintance a third a sincere goodnatured friend a fourth who would represent with grace and dignity at the head of my table and family a fifth an excellent oeconomist and housekeeper and a sixth a very useful nurse could i find all these qualities united in a single person i should dare to make my addresses and should deserve to be refused you hint in some of your letters or rather postscripts that you consider me as having renounced england and having sixed myself for the rest of my life in switzerland and that you suspect the sincerity of my vague or insidious schemes of purchase or return to remove as far as i can your doubts and suspicions i will tell you on that interesting subject fairly and simply as much as i know of my own intentions there is little appearance that i shall be suddenly recalled by the offer of a place or pension i have no claim to the friendship of your young minister and should he propose a commissioner of the customs or secretary at paris the supposed objects of my low ambition adam in paradise would refuse them with contempt here therefore i shall certainly live till i have finished the remainder of my history an arduous work which does not proceed so fast as i expected amidst the avocations of society and miscellaneous study as soon as it is completed most probably in three or four years i shall infallibly return to england about the month of may or june and the necessary labor of printing with care two or three quarto volumes will detain me till their publication in the ensuing spring lord sheffield and yourself will be the loadstone that most forcibly attracts me and as i shall be a vagabond on the face of the earth i shall be the better qualified to domesticate myself with you both in town and country here then at no very extravagant distance we have the certainty if we live of spending a year together in the peace and freedom of a friendly intercourse and a year is no very contemptible portion of this mortal existence beyond that period all is dark but not gloomy whether after the final completion of my history i shall return to lausanne or settle in england must depend on a thousand events which lie beyond the reach of human foresight the state of public and private affairs my own health the health and life of deyverdun the various changes which may have rendered lausanne more dear or less agreeable to me than at present but without losing ourselves in this distant futurity which perhaps we may never see and without giving any positive answer to marias parting question whether i shall be buried in england or switzerland let me seriously and earnestly ask you whether you do not mean to visit me next summer the defeat at coventry would i should think facilitate the project since the baron is no longer detained the whole winter from his domestic affairs nor is there any attendance on the house that keeps him till midsummer in dust and dispute i can send you a pleasant route through normandy paris and lions a visit to the glaciers and your return down the rhine which would be commodiously executed in three or four months at no very extravagant expense and would be productive of health and spirits to you of entertainment to you both and of instruction to the maria without the smallest inconvenience to myself i am able to lodge yourselves and family by arranging you in the winter apartment which in the summer season is not of any use to us i think you will be satisfied with your habitation and already see you in your dressing room a small pleasant room with a delightful prospect to the west and south if poor aunt kitty you oblige me beyond expression by your tender care of that excellent woman if she were only ten years younger i would desire you to take her with you but i much fear we shall never meet again you will not complain of the brevity of this epistle i expect in return a full and fair account of yourself your thoughts and actions soul and body present and future in the safe though unreserved confidence of friendship the baron in two words hinted but an indifferent account of your health you are a fine machine but as he was absent in ireland i hope i understand the cause and the remedy next to yourself i want to hear of the two baronesses you must give me a faithful picture and though a mother you can give it of their present external and internal forms for a year has now elapsed and in their lives a year is an age adieu ever yours  no clxxxi edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne march   th      my long silence and it has been long must not on this occasion be imputed to laziness though that little devil may likewise have been busy but you cannot forget how many weeks i remained in suspense expecting every post the final sentence and not knowing what to say in that passive uncertainty it is now something more than a fortnight since your last letter and that of gosling informed me of the event i have intended every day to write and every day i have started back with reluctance and disgust from the consideration of the wretched subject lenborough irrecoverably gone for threefourths of its real at least of its ancient value my seat in parliament sunk in the abyss of your cursed politics and a balance neatly cyphered and summed by gosling which shows me a very shallow purse in which others have a clearer right to dip than myself  march   st another week is now elapsed and though nothing is changed in this too faithful state of my affairs i feel myself able to encounter them with more spirit and resolution to look on the future rather than the past on the fair rather than on the foul side of the prospect i shall speak in the confidence of friendship and while you listen to the more doleful tale of my wants and wishes you will have the satisfaction of hearing some circumstances in my present situation of a less unpleasing nature   in the first place i most heartily rejoice in the sale however unfavourable of the bucks estate considering the dullness of the times and the high interest of money it is not a little to obtain even a tolerable price and i am sensible how much your patience and industry have been exercised to extort the payment   your resistance to my swiss expedition was more friendly than wise had i yielded after eighteen months of suspense and anxiety i should now a still poorer man be driven to embrace the same resource which has succeeded according to or even beyond my most sanguine expectations i do not pretend to have discovered the terrestrial paradise which has not been known in this world since the fall of adam but i can truly declare now the charms of novelty are long since faded that i have found the plan of life the best adapted to my temper and my situation i am now writing to you in a room as good as that in bentinckstreet which commands the country the lake and the mountains and the opening prospect of the spring the aforesaid room is furnished without magnificence but with every convenience for warmth ease and study and the walls are already covered with more than two thousand volumes the choice of a chosen library i have health friends an amusing society and perfect freedom a commissioner of the excise the idea makes me sick if you ask me what i have saved by my retreat to lausanne i will fairly tell you in the two great articles of a carriage and a house in town both which were indispensable and are now annihilated with the difference of clubs public places servants wages etc about four hundred pounds or guineas a year no inconsiderable sum when it must be annually found as addition to an expense which is somewhat larger than my present revenue   what is then you will ask my presentestablishment this is not by any means a cheap country and except in the article of wine i could give a dinner or make a coat perhaps for the same price in london as at lausanne my chief advantage arises from the things which i do not want and in some respects my style of living is enlarged by the increase of my relative importance an obscure bachelor in england the master of a considerable house at lausanne here i am expected to return entertainments to receive ladies etc and to perform many duties of society which though agreeable enough in themselves contribute to inflame the housekeepers bills from the disbursements of the first year i cannot form any just estimate the extraordinary expenses of the journey carriage of heavy goods from england the acquisition of many books which it was not expedient to transport the purchase of furniture wine fitting up my library and the irregularity of a new menage have consumed a pretty large sum but in a quiet prudent regular course of life i think i can support myself with comfort and honor for six or seven hundred pounds a year instead of a thousand or eleven hundred in england  besides these uncertainties uncertain at least as to the time i have a sure and honorable supply from my own pen i continue my history with pleasure and assiduity the way is long and laborious yet i see the end and i can almost promise to land in england next september twelvemonth with a manuscript of the current value of about four thousand pounds which will afford either a small income or a large capital   it is in the meanwhile that my situation is somewhat difficult    such are the services and revenues of the year proceed we now in the style of the budget to the ways and means of extraordinary supplies    i will not affront your friendship by observing that you will incur little or no risk on this occasion read consider act and write  it is the privilege of friendship to make our friend a patient hearer and active associate in our own affairs and i have now written five pages on my private affairs without saying a word either of the public or of yourself of the public i have little to say i never was a very warm patriot and i grow every day a citizen of the world the scramble for power or profit at westminster or st jamess and the names of pit and fox become less interesting to me than those of caesar and pompey you are not a friend of the young minister but he is a great favorite on the continent as he appears to be still and you must own that the fairness of his character his eloquence his application to business and even his youth must prepossess at least the ignorant in his favor of the merit or defects of his administration i cannot pretend to speak but i find from the complaints of some interested persons that his restraints on the smuggling of tea have already ruined the east india companies of antwerp and sweden and that even the dutch will scarcely find it worth their while to send any ships to china your irish friends appear to be more quiet at least the volunteers and national congress seem to subside how far that tranquillity must be purchased on our side by any pernicious sacrifices you will best decide and from some hint in your last letters i am inclined to think that you are less affected than might be supposed with national or local prejudice your introduction i have attentively read the matter though most important in itself is out of the line of my studies and habits and the subordinate beauties of style you disclaim yet i can say with truth that i never met with more curious and diligent investigation more strong sense more liberal spirit and more cool and impartial temper in the same number of pages by this time you have probably read neckers book on the finances perhaps for you there is too much french enthusiasm and paint but in many respects you must have gained a knowledge of his country and on the whole you must have been pleased with the picture of a great and benevolent mind in your attack on deyverdun for my picture i cannot promise you much success he seems resolved to maintain his right of possession and your only chance would be a personal assault the next summer how time slips away was fixed for your visit to lausanne we are prepared at all points to receive you my lady and a princess or two with their train and if you have a proper contempt for st stephens chapel you are perfectly free and at leisure can you ever be at leisure for the summer season as you are now in a great measure disengaged from any affairs you may find time to inform me of your proceedings and your projects at present i do not even know whether you pass the winter at sheffieldplace or in downingstreet my lady revenges herself of my long silence yet i embrace her and the infants adieu you have deranged the decline and fall this morning i have finished my epistle since dinner and am now going to a pleasant party and good supper  no clxxxii edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne september  th      extract from a weekly english paper september  th      it is reported but we hope without foundation that the celebrated mr gibbon who had retired to lausanne in switzerland to finish his valuable history lately died in that city  the hope of the newspaperwriter is very handsome and obliging to the historian yet there are several weighty reasons which would incline me to believe that the intelligence may be true primo it must one day be true and therefore may very probably be so at present secundo we may always depend on the impartiality accuracy and veracity of an english newspaper tertio which is indeed the strongest argument we are credibly informed that for a long time past the said celebrated historian has not written to any of his friends in england and as that respectable personage had always the reputation of a most exact and regular correspondent it may be fairly concluded from his silence that he either is or ought to be dead the only objection that i can foresee is the assurance that mr g  himself read the article as he was eating his breakfast and laughed very heartily at the mistake of his brother historian but as he might be desirous of concealing that unpleasant event we shall not insist on his apparent health and spirits which might be affected by that subtle politician he affirms however not only that he is alive and was so on the fifth of september but that his head his heart his stomach are in the most perfect state and that the climate of lausanne has been congenial both to his mind and body he confesses indeed that after the last severe winter the gout his old enemy from whom he hoped to have escaped pursued him to his retreat among the mountains of helvetia and that the siege was long though more languid than in his precedent attacks after some exercise of patience he began to creep and gradually to walk and though he can neither run nor fly nor dance he supports himself with firmness on his two legs and would willingly kick the impertinent gazetteer impertinent enough though more easily to be forgiven than the insolent courier du bas rhin who about three years ago amused himself and his readers with a fictitious epistle from mr gibbon to dr robertson  perhaps now you think baron that i shall apologize in humble style for my silence and neglect but on the contrary i do assure you that i am truly provoked at your lordships not condescending to be in a passion i might really have been dead i might have been sick if i were neither dead nor sick i deserved a volley of curses and reproaches for my infernal laziness and you have desrauded me of my just dues had i been silent till christmas till doomsday you would never have thought it worth your while to abuse me why then let me ask in your name did you not write before that is indeed a very curious question of natural and moral philosophy certainly i am not lazy elaborate quartos have proved and will abundantly prove my diligence i can write spare my modesty on that subject i like to converse with my friends by pen or tongue and as soon as i can set myself a going i know no moments that run off more pleasantly i am so well convinced of that truth so much ashamed of forcing people that i love to forget me that i have now resolved to set apart the first hour of each day for the discharge of my obligations beginning comme de raison with yourself and regularly proceeding to lord loughborough and the rest may heaven give me strength and grace to accomplish this laudable intention amen certainly yet i do not know whether it be so certain i should write much oftener to you if we were not linked in business and if my business had not always been of the unpleasant and mortifying kind even now i shove the ugly monster to the end of this epistle and will confine him to a page by himself that he may not infect the purer air of our correspondence of my situation here i have little new to say except a very comfortable and singular truth that my passion for my wife or mistress fanny lausanne is not palled by satiety and possession of two years i have seen her in all seasons and in all humors and though she is not without faults they are infinitely overbalanced by her good qualities her face is not handsome but her person and every thing about her has admirable grace and beauty she is of a very cheerful sociable temper without much learning she is endowed with taste and good sense and though not rich the simplicity of her education makes her a very good oeconomist she is forbid by her parents to wear any expensive finery and though her limbs are not much calculated for walking she has not yet asked me to keep her a coach last spring not to wear the metaphor to rags i saw lausanne in a new light during my long fit of the gout and must boldly declare that either in health or sickness i find it far more comfortable than your huge metropolis in london my confinement was sad and solitary the many forgot my existence when they saw me no longer at brookess and the few who sometimes cast a thought or an eye on their friend were detained by business or pleasure the distance of the way or the hours of the house of commons and i was proud and happy if i could prevail on elmsly to enliven the dullness of the evening here the objects are nearer and much more distinct and i myself am an object of much larger magnitude people are not kinder but they are more idle and it must be confessed that of all nations on the globe the english are the least attentive to the old and infirm i do not mean in acts of charity but in the offices of civil life during three months i have had round my chair a succession of agreeable men and women who came with a smile and vanished at a nod and as soon as it was agreeable i had a constant party at cards which was sometimes dismissed to their respective homes and sometimes detained by dyverdun to supper without the least trouble or inconvenience to myself in a word my plan has most completely answered and i solemnly protest after two years trial that i have never in a single moment repented of my transmigration the only disagreeable circumstance is the increase of a race of animals with which this country has been long infested and who are said to come from an island in the northern ocean i am told but it seems incredible that upwards of forty thousand english masters and servants are now absent on the continent and i am sure we have our full proportion both in town and country from the month of june to that of october the occupations of the closet indifferent health want of horses in some measure plead my excuse yet i do too much to please myself and probably too little to satisfy my countrymen what is still more unlucky is that a part of the colony of this present year are really good company people one knows etc the astons hales hampdens trevors lady clarges and miss carter lord northington etc i have seen trevor several times who talks of you and seems to be a more exact correspondent than myself his wife is much improved by her diplomatic life and shines in every company as a woman of fashion and elegance but those who have repaid me for the rest were lord and lady spencer i saw them almost every day at my house or their own during their stay of a month for they were hastening to italy that they might return to london next february he is a valuable man and where he is familiar a pleasant companion she a charming woman who with sense and spirit has the simplicity and playfulness of a child you are not ignorant of her talents of which she has left me an agreeable specimen a drawing of the historic muse sitting in a thoughtful posture to compose so much of self and co let us now talk a little of your house and your two countries does my lady ever join in the abuse which i have merited from you is she satisfied with her own behavior her unpardonable silence to one of the prettiest most obliging most entertaining most etc epistles that ever was penned since the epistles of    will she not mew one word of reply i want some account of her spirits health amusements of the elegant accomplishments of maria and the opening graces of louisa of yourself i wish to have some of those details which she is most likely to transmit are you patient in your exclusion from the house are you satisfied with legislating with your pen do you pass the whole winter in town have you resumed the pursuits of farming etc what new connections public or private have you formed a tour to the continent would be the best medicine for the shattered nerves of a soldier and politician by this expression you will perceive that your letter to deyverdun is received it landed last post after i had already written the two first pages of this composition on the whole my friend was pleased and flattered but instead of surrendering or capitulating he seems to be making preparations for an obstinate defense he already talks of the right of possession his portrait painted by sir joshua reynolds  of the duties of a good citizen of a writ ue exeat regnum and of a vote of the two hundred that whomsoever shall directly or indirectly etc is an enemy to his country between you be the strife while i sit with my scales in my hand like jupiter on mount ida i begin to view with the same indifference the combat of achilles pit and hector fox for such as it should now seem must be the comparison of the two warriors    at this distance i am much less angry with bills taxes and propositions than i am pleased with pit for making a friend and a deserving man happy for releasing batt from the shackles of the law and for enhancing the gift of a secure and honorable competency by the handsome manner in which it was conferred this i understand to be the case from the unsuspicious evidence of lord northington and chief baron skinner and if i can find time  resolution i will send him a hearty congratulation if i fail you may at least communicate my intentions of ireland i know nothing and while i am writing the decline of a great empire i have not leisure to attend to the affairs of a remote and petty province i see that your friend foster has been hooted by the mob and unanimously chosen speaker of the house of commons how could pit expose himself to the disgrace of withdrawing his propositions after a public attempt have ministers no way of computing beforehand the sense or nonsense of an irish parliament i am quite in the dark your pamphlet or book would probably have opened my eyes but whatever may have been the reason i give you my word of honor that i have never seen nor heard of it here we are much more engaged with continental politics in general we hate the emperor as the enemy of peace without daring to make war the old lion of prussia acts a much more glorious part as the champion of public tranquillity and the independence of the german states  and now for the bitter and nauseous pill of pecuniary business upon which i shall be as concise as possible in the two articles of my discourse land and money    it is impossible to hate more than i do this odious necessity of owing borrowing anticipating and i look forwards with impatience to the happy period when the supplies will always be raised within the year with a decent and useful surplus in the treasury i now trust to the conclusion of my history and it will hasten and secure the principal comforts of my life you will believe i am not lazy yet i fear the term is somewhat more distant than i thought my long gout lost me three months in the spring in every great work unforeseen dangers and difficulties and delays will arise and i should be rather sorry than surprised if next autumn was postponed to the ensuing spring if my lady a good creature should write to mrs porten she may convey news of my life and health without saying any thing of this possible delay adieu i embrace etc lausanne october  st       no clxxxiii edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne january   th      hear all ye nations an epistle from sheffieldplace received the seventeenth of january is answered the same day and to say the truth this method which is the best is at the same time the most easy and pleasant yet i do not allow that on the last past silence and delay you have any more reason to swear than myself our letters crossed each other our claims were equal and if both had been stiffly maintained our mutual silence must have continued till the day of judgment the balance was doubtless in my favor if you recollect the length the fullness the variety of pleasant and instructive matter of my last dispatch even at present of myself my occupations my designs i have little or nothing to add and can only speak dryly and briefly to very dry and disagreeable business    but we shall both agree that the true criminal is my lady and though i do suppose that a letter is on the road which will make some amends her obstinate contumacious dilatory silence so many months or years since my valuable letter is worthy a royal tigress    notwithstanding your gloomy politicians i do love the funds and were the next war to reduce them to half the remainder would be a better and pleasanter property than a similar value in your dirty acres we are now in the height of our winter amusements balls great suppers comedies etc and except st stephens i certainly lead a more gay and dissipated life here among the alps by the bye a most extraordinary mild winter than in the midst of london yet my mornings and sometimes an afternoon are diligently employed my work advances but much remains indeed much more than i imagined but a great book like a great house was never yet finished at the given time when i talk of the spring of eightyseven i suppose all my time well bestowed and what do you think of a fit of the gout that may disqualify me for two or three months you may growl but if you calmly reflect on my pecuniary and sentimental state you will believe that i most earnestly desire to complete my labor and visit england adieu  no clxxxiv edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne may  0th      by the difference i suppose of the posts of france and germany sir staniers letter though first written is still on the road and yours which i received yesterday morning brought me the first account of poor mrs portens departure there are few events that could afflict me more deeply and i have been ever since in a state of mind more deserving of your pity than of your reproaches i certainly am not ignorant that we have nothing better to wish for ourselves than the fate of that besthumoured woman as you very justly style her a good understanding and an excellent heart with health spirits and a competency to live in the midst of her friends till the age of fourscore and then to shut her eyes without pain or remorse death can have deprived her only of some years of weakness perhaps of misery and for myself it is surely less painful to lose her at present than to find her in my visit to england next year sinking under the weight of age and infirmities and perhaps forgetful of herself and of the persons once the dearest to her all this is perfectly true but all these reflections will not dispel a thousand sad and tender remembrances that rush upon my mind to her care i am indebted in earliest infancy for the preservation of my life and health i was a puny child neglected by my mother starved by my nurse and of whose being very little care or expectation was entertained without her maternal vigilance i should either have been in my grave or imperfectly lived a crooked ricketty monster a burden to myself and others to her instructions i owe the first rudiments of knowledge the first exercise of reason and a taste for books which is still the pleasure and glory of my life and though she taught me neither language nor science she was certainly the most useful preceptor i ever had as i grew up an intercourse of thirty years endeared her to me as the faithful friend and the agreeable companion you have seen with what freedom and confidence we lived together and have often admired her character and conversation which could alike please the young and the old all this is now lost finally irrecoverably lost i will agree with my lady that the immortality of the soul is at some times a very comfortable doctrine a thousand thanks to her for her constant kind attention to that poor woman who is no more i wish i had as much to applaud and as little to reproach in my own behavior toward mrs porten since i left england and when i reflect that my letters would have soothed and comforted her decline i feel more deeply than i can express the real neglect and seeming indifference of my silence to delay a letter from the wednesday to the saturday and then from the saturday to the wednesday appears a very slight offense yet in the repetition of such delay weeks months and years will clapse till the omission may become irretrievable and the consequence mischievous or fatal after a long lethargy i had rouzed myself last week and wrote to the three old ladies my letter for mrs porten went away last post saturday night and yours did not arrive till monday morning sir stanier will probably open it and read the true picture of my sentiments for a friend who when i wrote was already extinct there is something sad and awful in the thought yet on the whole i am not sorry that even this tardy epistle preceded my knowledge of her death but it did not precede you will observe the information of her dangerous and declining state which i conveyed in my last letter and her anxious concern that she should never see or hear from me again this idea and the hard thoughts which you must entertain of me press so much on my mind that i must frankly acknowledge a strange inexcusable supineness on which i desire you would make no comment and which in some measure may account for my delays in corresponding with you the unpleasant nature of business and the apprehension of finding something disagreeable tempted me to postpone from day to day not only the answering but even the opening your penultimate epistle and when i received your last yesterday morning the seal of the former was still unbroken oblige me so far as to make no reflections my own may be of service to me hereafter thus far except the last sentence i have run on with a sort of melancholy pleasure and find my heart much relieved by unfolding it to a friend and the subject so strongly holds me so much disqualifies me for other discourse either serious or pleasant that here i would willingly stop and reserve all miscellaneous matter for a second volunteer epistle but we both know how frail are promises how dangerous are delays and there are some pecuniary objects on which i think it necessary to give you an immediate though now tardy explanation  i do not return you any formal thanks for    i have really a hundred things to say of myself of you and co of your works of mine of my books in downingstreet of lausanne of politics etc etc after this some epistolary debts must and shall be paid and to proceed with order i have fixed this day fortnight may twentyfifth for the date and dispatch of your second epistle give me credit once more pray does my lady think herself absolved from all obligation of writing to me to her at least i am not in arrear adieu  no clxxxv edward gibbon esquire to sir stanier porten kensingtonpalace lausanne may   th      my dear sir the melancholy event which you have communicated in your last obliging letter of the twentyfourth of april might indeed be too naturally feared and expected if we consult our reason we can wish nothing better for ourselves than the lot of that dear and valuable friend whom we have now lost his aunt mrs catherine porten  a warm heart a strong and clear understanding a most invaluable happiness of temper which showed her the agreeable or comfortable side of every object and every situation an easy competency the reward of her own attention private friendship general esteem a mature age and a placid decline but these rational motives of consolation are insufficient to check a thousand soft and sad remembrances that rush into my mind the intimacy of a whole life of mine at least from the earliest dawn of my infancy the maternal and assiduous care of my health and afterward of my mind the freedom and frequency of our conversations the regret which i felt in our last separation and the hope however faint and precarious of seeing her again time alone can reconcile us to this irreparable loss and to his healing power i must recommend your grief as well as my own i sincerely applaud her very proper and natural disposal of her effects and am proud of the preeminence which she has allowed me in a list of dear and worthy relations  i am too full of a single idea to expatiate as i should otherwise do on indifferent matters yet not totally indifferent to my friends since they relate to my present situation my health is in general perfectly good and the only drawbacks some occasional visits of the gout which abate however in strength and are grown i think less frequent and lasting the life which i lead is temperate and tranquil and the distemper itself is not common in the purity and dryness of the climate after a long trial i can now approve my own choice of retiring to switzerland my delightful habitation at once in town and country my library and the society of agreeable men and women compose a very eligible plan of life which is shaded with very few and very slight exceptions i prosecute with ease and regular diligence the conclusion of my history and as far as i can judge i may hope to deliver it to the press in the course of next year that important business will recall me to england and detain me there some months and i shall rejoice in the opportunity of revisiting my country and my friends among them those of kensingtonpalace hold a high and distinguished place  i truly sympathize my dear sir in your paternal feelings in the health and progress of your very promising children may that and every other blessing attend both yourself and lady porten my friend m deyverdun desires to assure you of his respect and good wishes i am dear sir most affectionately yours  no clxxxvi edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne july   d         since i have another page and some leisure moments we may as well employ it in friendly converse the more so as the great letter to which i alluded is wonderfully precarious and uncertain the more so likewise as our correspondence for some time past has been of an abrupt and disagreeable cast let us first talk of sheffields works they are of two sorts primo two nymphs whom i much desire to see the sprightly maria and the gentle louisa i perfectly represent them both in the eye of fancy each of them accomplished according to her age and character yet totally different in their external and internal forms secundo three pamphlets pamphlets i cry you mercy three weighty treatises almost as useful as an inquiry into the state of the primitive church and here let me justify if i have not before my silence on a subject which we authors do not easily forgive the first whose first editions had seen the light before i left england followed me here in a more complete condition and that treatise on the american trade has been read judged approved and reported the second on ireland i have seen by accident the copy you sent to mr trevor who passed last summer eightyfive here the third and in my present situation the most interesting on the french commerce a mistake  lord sheffield did not publish any tract on french commerce  i have not yet seen by any means whatsoever and you who know what orders you have given to elmsly or others will best discern on whom should be laid the fault and the blame by the bye mrs trevor is now here without her husband and i am just going to see her about a mile out of town she is judged elegant and amiable but to return to your books all that i have seen must do you honor and might do the public service you are above the trifling decorations of style but your sense is strong your views impartial and your industry laudable i find that your american tract is just translated into german do you still correspond with    if he could establish a beneficial intercourse between the two first nations in the world i would excuse him some little political tergiversation at some distance of time and place those domestic squabbles loss much of their importance and though i should not forgive him any breach of private friendship or confidence i cannot much blame him if he chose rather to serve his family and his country than to persevere in a hopeless and as i suspect an unpopular opposition you have never told me clearly and correctly how you support your inactive retreat from the house of commons whether you have resumed your long forgotten taste for rural and domestic pleasures and whether you have never cast a look toward coventry or some other borough equally pure and respectable in the short space that is left i will only repeat more distinctly that in the present contemplation of my work june or july of next year is the earliest term at which i can hope to see england and if i have a fit of the gout i have indeed been free from the monster this last twelvemonth but he is most arbitrary and capricious of my own situation let me say with truth that it is tranquil easy and well adapted to my character all enthusiasm is now at an end i see things in their true light and i applaud the judgment and choice of my retirement i am well happy and diligent but your kind hint of the london house is perfectly superfluous as instead of the spring we must already read the summer of next year do not be childish or passionate trust me i wish to appear in england but it must be with my book in my hand and a book takes more time in making than a pudding adieu will my lady never write  you see why i have left a blank in the first page and when i begun i had no design of going beyond it and now unless i have some extraordinary fit of diligence and zeal shall probably wait till the return of your epistle a word before we part about the least unpleasant of my business my library in downingstreet excuse the accidental derangement i shall send for no more books and only beg you to give them shelter in your uninhabited parlour till my arrival two or three mornings will suffice for personal review and the subsequent steps of sale or travel will most properly be executed under my own eye once more adieu  no clxxxvii edward gibbon esquire to mr cadell bookseller london lausanne december   th      dear sir i received your letter this morning the   th instant and answer it the same day i am a sad correspondent but it has been my constant endeavor that my negligence should never affect the interest or happiness of my friends  the report you so kindly mention is somewhat incorrect i never could fix a particular day for dining with lord sheffield nor should i think of performing the journey in the winter month of february the last autumn was the term which i had fixed in my hopes and long since in my letters to him it has been changed to next spring and by the spring i must now understand the middle of the summer which i can at present ascertain with some confidence from a nearer prospect of the end of my work which i shall bring over for the press it will consist of three more quarto volumes somewhat thinner perhaps than their predecessors but as that difference cannot be enough to affect the price it will be so much saved on the authors pains and the printers expenses i am happy to understand the public entertain the same opinion of the past and the same impatience for the remainder and unless i am strangely deceived their expectation will not be disappointed the three last volumes are labored at least with equal diligence they contain a longer period of time and a far greater variety of events and the whole will comprise a general series of history from the reign of trajan and the antonines to the taking of constantinople by mahomet the second with a review of mahomet and his successors the crusades and the turks as far as in their utmost latitude they are connected with the fate of the eastern or western empire with regard to our pecuniary arrangements i persuade myself that we shall have no more difficulties now than heretofore that you will cheerfully assign the same value to the three younger as to the three elder brothers and that so important a transaction will have been concluded in the first instance by three minutes of conversation and in the second by three lines of a letter a memorable example in the annals of authors and booksellers if you agree with me on this subject you may provide paper etc as soon as you please in the spring in the full confidence of seeing me with my book in the summer and i should not be sorry to learn what time in using the utmost expedition would be sufficient for printing and how late you would consent to publish in the ensuing spring at this moment when i am straining every nerve to conclude my living labors i am illdisposed to lose any time in the dull dead work of correcting a new edition when i am in england quiet in the country there would be room and leisure for a complete revision and i should have no objection to place at the end of the sixth volume a string of amendments and improvements which hereafter might be inserted in their proper places we shall likewise have occasion for a good and general index to the whole  i sincerely condole with you in your various losses rose and strahan were indeed valuable men for myself you will rejoice to hear that i am satisfied with my swiss retirement and that except some mild and transient fits of the gout i enjoy as much health and happiness as is compatible with the lot of man i expect with much impatience dr robertsons improved edition there are three or four books which i should like to have without delay that work pennants arctic zoology whites sermons the arabic professor the annual registers since the year      with elmsleys assistance he is a sad dog but i will write to him soon could you not enclose them in a small box with any other recent publications of merit and dispatch them instantly by some more costly and expeditious mode of conveyance i am most faithfully yours  no clxxxviii edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne january  0th      after some sallies of wrath you seem at length to have subsided in sullen silence and i must confess not totally without reason yet if your mind be still open to truth you will confess that i am not so black as i appear   your lordship has shown much less activity and eloquence than formerly and your last letter was an answer to mine which i had expected some time with impatience bad examples are dangerous to young people   formerly i have neglected answering your epistles on essential though unpleasant business and the respublica or privata may have suffered by my neglect supposing therefore we had no transactions why should i write so often to exchange sentimental compliments or to relate the various and important transactions of the republic of lausanne as long as i do not inform you of my death you have good grounds to believe me alive and well you have a general and will soon have a more particular idea of my system and arrangement here one day glides away after another in tranquil uniformity every object must have sides and moments less luminous than others but upon the whole the life and the place which i have chosen are most happily adapted to my character and circumstances and i can now repeat at the end of three years what i soon and sincerely affirmed that never in a single instant have i repented of my scheme of retirement to lausanne a retirement which was judged by my best and wisest friend a project little short of insanity the place the people the climate have answered or exceeded my warmest expectations and though i truly rejoice in my approaching visit to england mr pit were he your friend and mine would not find it an easy task to prevent my return   and now let me add a third reason which often diverted me from writing namely my impatience to see you this next summer i am building a great book which besides the three stories already exposed to the public eye will have three stories more before we reach the roof and battlements you too have built or altered a great gothic castle with baronial battlements did you finish it within the time you intended as that time drew near did you not find a thousand nameless and unexpected works that must be performed each of them calling for a portion of time and labor and had you not despised nobly despised the minute diligence of finishing fitting up and furnishing the apartments you would have discovered a new train of indispensable business such at least has been my case a long while ago when i contemplated the distant prospect of my work i gave you and myself some hopes of landing in england last autumn but alas when autumn grew near hills began to rise on hills alps on alps and i found my journey far more tedious and toilsome than i had imagined when i look back on the length of the undertaking and the variety of materials i cannot accuse or suffer myself to be accused of idleness yet it appeared that unless i doubled my diligence another year and perhaps more would elapse before i could embark with my complete manuscript under these circumstances i took and am still executing a bold and meritorious resolution the mornings in winter and in a country of early dinners are very concise to them my usual period of study i now frequently add the evenings renounce cards and society refuse the most agreeable evenings or perhaps make my appearance at a late supper by this extraordinary industry which i never practiced before and to which i hope never to be again reduced i see the last part of my history growing apace under my hands all my materials are collected and arranged i can exactly compute by the square foot or the square page all that remains to be done and after concluding text and notes after a general review of my time and my ground i now can decisively ascertain the final period of the decline and fall and can boldly promise that i will dine with you at sheffieldplace in the month of august or perhaps of july in the present year within less than a twelvemonth of the term which i had loosely and originally fixed and perhaps it would not be easy to find a work of that size and importance in which the workman has so tolerably kept his word with himself and the public but in this situation oppressed with this particular object and stealing every hour from my amusement to the fatigue of the pen and the eyes you will conceive or you might conceive how little stomach i have for the epistolary style and that instead of idle though friendly correspondence i think it far more agreeable to employ my time in the effectual measures that may hasten and exhilarate our personal interview about a month ago i had a voluntary and not unpleasing epistle from cadell he informs me that he is going to print a new octavo edition the former being exhausted and that the public expect with impatience the conclusion of that excellent work whose reputation increases every day etc i answered him by the return of the post to inform him of the period and extent of my labors and to express a reasonable hope that he would set the same value on the three last as he had done on the three former volumes should we conclude in this easy manner a transaction so honorable to the author and bookseller my way is clear and open before me in pecuniary matters i think i am assured for the rest of my life of never troubling my friends or being troubled myself a state to which i aspire and which i indeed deserve if not by my management at least by moderation  in your last you talk more of the french treaty than of yourself and your wife and family a true english quid nunc for my part in this remote inland neutral country you will suppose that after a slight glance on the papers i have neither had the means nor the inclination to think very deeply about it as a citizen of the world a character to which i am every day rising or sinking i must rejoice in every agreement that diminishes the separation between neighboring countries which softens their prejudices unites their interests and industry and renders their future hostilities less frequent and less implacable with regard to the present treaty i hope both nations are gainers since otherwise it cannot be lasting and such double mutual gain is surely possible in fair trade though it could not easily happen in the mischievous amusements of war and gaming    what a delightful hand have these great statesmen made of it since my departure without power and as far as i can see without hope when we meet i shall advise you to digest all your political and commercial knowledge england ireland france america and with some attention to style and order to make the whole a classic book which may preserve your name and benefit your country i know not whether you have seen sir henry clinton since his return he passed a day with me and seemed pleased with my reception and place we talked over you and the american war i embrace the silent my lady and the two honorable misses whom i sigh to behold and admire adieu ever yours  though i can part with land you find i cannot part with books the remainder of my library has so long embarrassed your room that it may now await my presence and final judgment has my lady read a novel entitled caroline de litchfield of our home manufacture i may say of ours since deyverdun and myself were the judges and patrons of the manuscript the author who is since married a second time madame de crousaz now montolieu is a charming woman i was in some danger once more bar a long fit of the gout and the historian will land at dover before the end of july adieu  no clxxxix edward gibbon esquire to mr cadell london lausanne february   th      dear sir i am perfectly satisfied with yours and mr strahans cheerful and liberal assent to my proposal and am glad to find that your partner has not degenerated from his worthy father whose loss i sincerely lament the sole remaining difficulty of the volumes falling below the guinea price it is unnecessary for the present to discuss as i think it unlikely to happen as i am resolved to finish and revise the work before i leave lausanne it will depend on yourself to arrange your preparations of paper etc in such a manner that we may lose no time but go to press the first week after my arrival but in the mean while i wish you to reflect and inquire  st in how many months the impression of the three volumes may be completed either with ordinary or extraordinary diligence and  dly how late in next year you would be desirous or willing to publish on my revisal i may find more alterations and improvements to make than i at present foresee i may be disabled by a fit of the gout and your speedy answer will inform me of the utmost latitude in which i may be indulged without totally disconcerting our common interest you probably agree with me in the necessity of a good general index for the six volumes if you are posssessed of an intelligent workman he might without delay take in hand the first three volumes but in that case i must desire him to send me as soon as possible a short specimen by the post i have thought on the subject of indexmaking and can give him some advice which will abridge the size without impairing the use and value of his alphabetical table by a letter of the thirteenth instant elmsley informs me that he is on the point of sending the books and i hope to have them here before the end of next month i propose writing to him very soon but as the events of life are uncertain it may be safer to answer his question through your channel the author of caroline madame de crousaz is now become madame la baronne de montolieu by second marriage and has other cares and pleasures besides those of writing her pen is not idle but her new schemes of romance are not in any degree of forwardness or maturity perhaps an handsome proposal from an english bookseller might stimulate her diligence i am sincerely yours  in our style of negotiation it is almost superfluous to say that i reserve about a score of copies for myself and my friends  no cxc edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne june  d      i begin to discover that if i wait till i could atchieve a just and satisfactory epistle equally pleasant and instructive you would have a poor chance of hearing from me i will therefore content myself with a simple answer to a question which i love to believe you repeat with some impatience when may we expect you in england my great building is as it were completed and some slight ornaments the painting and glazing of the last finished rooms may be dispatched without inconvenience in the autumnal residence of sheffieldplace it is therefore my sincere and peremptory intention to depart from lausanne about the twentieth of july and to find myself  me trouver in london on or before the glorious first of august i know of nothing that can prevent it but a fit of the gout the capricious tyrant who obeys no laws either of time or place and so unfortunately are we circumstanced that such a fit if it came late and lasted long would effectually disable me from coming till next spring since thereby i should lose the season the monsoon for the impression of three quarto volumes which will require nine months a regular parturition and cannot advantageously appear after the beginning or middle of may at the same time do not be apprehensive that i mean to play you a dogs trick from a thousand motives it is my wish to come over this year the desire of seeing you and the silent sullen my lady the family arrangements discharge of servants which i have already made the strong wish of settling my three youngest children in a manner honorable to them and beneficial to their parents much miscellaneous matter rises to my pen but i will not be tempted to turn the leaf expect me therefore at sheffieldplace with strong probability about the fifteenth of august adieu yours  no cxci edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield lausanne july   st      the twentieth of july is past and i am still at lausanne but the march of heavy bodies such as armies and historians can seldom be foreseen or fixed to a precise day some particular reasons have engaged me to allow myself another week and the day of my departure is now  i believe determined for sunday the twentyninth instant you know the road and the distance i am no rapid english traveller and my servant is not accustomed to ride post i was never fond of deeds of darkness and if the weather be hot we must repose in the middle of the day yet the roads are in general good between sun and sun the interval is long and barring the accidents of winds and waves i think it possible to reach london in ten or twelve days viz on or before the ninth of august with your active spirit you will scarce understand how i can look on this easy journey with some degree of reluctance and apprehension but after a tranquil sedentary life of four years having lain but a single night out of my own bed i see mountains and monsters in the way and so happy do i feel myself at home that nothing but the strongest calls of friendship and interest could drag me from hence you ingeniously propose that i should turn off at sittingbourn and seem to wonder what business i can find or make for an immediate residence in the capital have you totally forgot that i bring over three quarto voumes for the press and are you ignorant that not a moment must be lost if we are desirous of appearing at a proper season and that i must set the machine in motion before i can secede to sheffieldplace with an easy mind and for a reasonable term of this be assured that i shall not be less impatient than yourself and that of human twolegged animals yourself and yours are the first whom i shall wish to see in england for myself i do not regret the occupancy of downingstreet in my first visit to london a lodging or hotel in the adelphi will be more convenient but i have some anxiety about my books and must try whether i can approach those holy relics without offending the delicacy of an amiable duchess our interview is so near that i have little more to add except a caution about my own concerns in which you will confess that from  and  to  i have been generally unlucky if any thing remains present or future it must be agitated and decided but all retrospects are useless and painful and we have so many pleasant subjects of conversation that all such odious matters may be buried in oblivion adieu i embrace my lady and louisa but i no longer presume even on paper to embrace the blooming maria ever yours  no cxcii edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield adeephi hotel august  th      intelligence extraordinary this day august the seventh the celebrated e g arrived with a numerous retinue one servant we hear that he has brought over from lausanne the remainder of his history for immediate publication the post had left town before my arrival i am pleased but indeed astonished to find myself in london after a journey of six hundred miles and hardly yet conceive how i had resolution to undertake it i find myself not a little fatigued and have devoted this hot day to privacy and repose without having seen any body except cadell and elmsley and my neighbor batt whose civility amounts to kindness and real friendship but you may depend on it that instead of sauntering in town or giving way to every temptation i will dispatch my necessary work and hasten with impatience to the groves of sheffieldplace a project somewhat more rational than the hasty turbulent visit which your vigor had imagined if you come up to quicken my diligence we shall meet the sooner but i see no appearance of my leaving town before the end of next week i embrace etc adieu  no cxciii the same to the same monday afternoon      i precipitate i inconvenience alas alas i am a poor miserable cripple confined to my chair last wednesday evening i felt some flying symptoms of the gout for two succeeding days i struggled bravely and went in a chair to dine with batt and lord loughborough but on saturday i yielded to my conqueror i have now passed three wearisome days without amusement and three miserable nights without sleep yet my acquaintance are charitable and as virtue should never be made too difficult i feel that a man has more friends in pall mall than in bentinckstreet this fit is remarkably painful the enemy is possessed of the left foot and knee and how far he may carry the war god only knows of futurity it is impossible to speak but it will be fortunate if i am able to leave town by the end not of this but of the ensuing week what may be the future progress whether slow or rapid fluctuating or steady time alone will determine and to that master of human knowledge i must leave our bath journey pity me magnanimous baron pity me tender females pity me swiss exile m wilhel de severy  and believe me it is far better to be learning english at uckfield i write with difficulty as the least motion or constraint in my attitude is repeated by all the nerves and sinews in my knee but you shall find each day a note or bulletin of my health tomorrow i must give pain to mrs g  adieu ever yours  no cxciv edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lady sheffield bath december   th      alas alas alas how vain and fallacious are all the designs of man this is now the eighteenth of december precisely one month since my departure from sheffieldplace and it was firmly my wish my hope my resolution that after dispatching some needful business in london and accomplishing a pious duty at bath i should by this day be restored to the tranquil leisure and friendly society of sheffieldplace a cruel tyrant has disconcerted all my plans my business in town has been neglected my attendance at bath is just begun and my return is yet distant i was not a little edified to hear of some expressions of regret and discontent on my departure and though i am not able to produce as good evidence you will perhaps believe that in the solitude of a london lodging i often railed at the gout for maliciously delaying his attack till i was removed from a place where my sufferings would have been alleviated by every kind and comfortable attention i grew at last so desperately impatient as to resolve on immediate flight without waiting till i had totally expelled the foe and recovered my strength i performed the journey with tolerable ease but the motion has agitated the remains of the humor i am very lame and a second fit may possibly be the punishment of my rashness  as yet i have seen nothing of bath except mrs g  and weakness as well as propriety will confine me very closely to her lord sheffield with mrs holroyd and maria dined with us yesterday we begin to throw out hints of the shortness of our stay and indispensable business and unless i should be confined by the gout it is resolved in our cabinet to leave bath on thursday the twentysixth and passing through lord loughboroughs and town to settle at sheffieldplace most assuredly before the end of the year for my own part i can say with truth that did not the press loudly demand my presence i could without a sigh allow the duchess to reign in downingstreet the greatest part of the winter and should be happy in the society of two persons no common blessing whom i love and by whom i am beloved  adieu dear madam and believe me with the affection of a friend and a brother ever yours  no cxcv dr william robertson to mr gibbon college of edinburgh february   th      my dear sir though you have now been some time in london yet as i heard of your welfare by different channels and as i know from experience how much a man has to do who is printing three quartos even after he thinks they are altogether ready for the press i have hitherto forborne to interrupt you by any letter or inquiry of mine but there is such a general impatience to see your new publication among people of letters here and as your friend i am so frequently interrogated about the length it has advanced and the time when it will appear that i begin to be ashamed of knowing nothing more about it than other people i must request of you then to furnish me with such information as may both preserve my credit and gratify my own curiosity my expectations from this part of your work are indeed very high your materials begin to improve and are certainly much more copious than during a great part of the period you have gone through you have three or four events as great and splendid and singular as the heart of an historian could wish to delineate the contemporary writers will furnish you with all the necessary facts to adorn them as elegant writers or to account for them as philosophers never entered into their heads this they have left to you  since you went to the continent i have not done so much as i wished my health until lately has been more shattered and as i advance in life i am now sixtysix though my faculties i imagine are still entire yet i find my mind less active and ardent i have however finished a very careful revise of all my works and have given them the last polish they will receive from my hand i have made some additions to each of them and in the history of scotland pretty considerable ones i have desired mr strahan to send to you a copy of them uniformly bound and hope you will accept of them as a memorial of my esteem and affection you will see that i have got in mr whitaker an adversary so bigoted and zealous that though i have denied no article of faith and am at least as orthodox as he himself yet he rails against me with all the asperity of theological hatred i shall adhere to my fixed maxim of making no reply may i hope that when you see lord loughborough you will remember me to him with kindness and respect our friend mr smith whom we were in great danger of losing is now almost perfectly reestablished i have the honor to be with great truth your most faithful humble servant  william robertson  no cxcvi edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield downingstreet june   st      instead of the historian you receive a short letter in your eyes an indispensable tribute this day at length after long delay and frequent expostulation i have received the writings which i am now in the act of signing sealing and delivering according to the lawyers directions    i long to be at sheffieldplace you see my departure is not postponed a moment by idleness or pleasure but the precise day still hangs on contingencies and we must all be patient if our wishes should be thwarted i say our wishes for i sincerely desire to be with you i have had many dinners some splendid and memorable with hastings last thursday with the prince of wales next tuesday at craufurds but the town empties texier is silent and in an evening i desiderate the resources of a family or a club caplin has finished the herculean labor and seven majestic boxes will abdicate on monday your hall severy has likewise dispatched his affairs and secured his companion clarke who is arrived in town but his schemes are abridged by the inexorable rigor of lord how who has assured our great and fair intercessors that by the kings order the dockyards are shut against all strangers we therefore give up portsmouth and content ourselves with two short trips one to stowe and oxford the other to chatham and if we can catch a launch and review encore vit on he severy not lord how salutes with me the family adieu yours  no cxcvii edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lord sheffield downingstreet saturday according to your imperious law i write a line to postpone my arrival till friday or perhaps saturday but i hope friday and i promise you that not a moment shall be wasted and now let me add a cool word as to my final departure which is irrevocably fixed between the tenth and fifteenth of july after a full and free enjoyment of each others society let us submit without a struggle to reason and fate it would be idle to pretend business at lausanne but a complete year will elapse before my return severy and myself are now expected with some impatience i am thankful for your hospitable entertainment but i wish you to remember homers admirable precept welcome the coming speed the parting guest spare me therefore spare yourself the trouble of a fruitless contest in which according to a great author i foresee a certain loss of time and a probable loss of temper i believe we shall have both craufurd and hugonin at sheffieldplace adieu  no cxcviii the same to the same downingstreet saturday june      i have but a moment between my return home and my dressing and heartily tired i am for i am now involved in the horrors of shopping packing etc yet i must write four lines to prevent a growl which might salute the arrival of an emptyhanded post on sunday i hope the whole caravan christians and pagans arrived in good health at the castle that the turrets begin to rise to the third heaven that each has found a proper occupation and that tuft lady sheffields lapdog enjoys the freedom and felicity of the lawn yesterday the august scene was closed for this year sheridan surpassed himself and though i am far from considering him as a perfect orator there were many beautiful passages in his speech on justice filial love etc one of the closest chains of argument i ever heard to prove that hastings was responsible for the acts of middleton and a compliment much admired to a certain historian of your acquaintance sheridan in the close of his speech sunk into burkes arms but i called this morning he is perfectly well i fear that i shall not be able to dine at home a single day tomorrow severy and myself go to bushy i hope to be with you by sunday the twentysecond instant the easing of my books is a prodigiousoperation adieu  no cxcix dr william robertson to mr gibbon college of edinburgh july  0th      dear sir long before this i should have acknowledged the receipt of your most acceptable present but for several weeks i have been afflicted with a violent fit of deafness and that unsocial malady is always accompanied with such a degree of languor as renders even the writing of a letter an effort during my solitude the perusal of your book has been my chief amusement and consolation i have gone through it once with great attention and am now advanced to the last volume in my second reading i ventured to predict the superior excellence of the volumes lately published and i have not been a false prophet indeed when i consider the extent of your undertaking and the immense labor of historical and philosophic research requisite toward executing every part of it i am astonished that all this should have been accomplished by one man i know no example in any age or nation of such a vast body of valuable and elegant information communicated by any individual i feel however some degree of mortification mingled with my astonishment before you began your historic career i used to pride myself in being at least the most industrious historian of the age but now alas i can pretend no longer even to that praise and must say as pliny did of his uncle si comparer illi sum desidiosissimus your style appears to me improved in these new volumes by the habit of writing you write with greater ease i am sorry to find that our ideas on the effects of the crusades do not altogether coincide i considered that point with great care and cannot help thinking still that my opinion was well founded i shall consult the authorities to which i refer for when my sentiments differ from yours i have some reason to distrust them and i may possibly trouble you with a letter on the subject i am much flattered with the manner in which you have so often mentioned my name laetus sum laudari a te landato viro i feel much satisfaction in having been distinguished by the two historians of my own times whose favorable opinion i was most ambitious of obtaining  i hope this letter may find you still in england when you return to lausanne permit me to recommend to your good office my youngest son who is now at yverdun on account of his health and lives with m herman a clergyman there you will find the young man if you can rely on the partial testimony of a father sensible modest and wellbred and though no great scholar he has seen much having returned from india where he served last war by bassora bagdat moussul and aleppo he is now a captain in the twentythird regiment if you have any friend at yverdun be so good as to recommend him it will do him credit to have your countenance i have desired him to pay his respects to you at lausanne farewell my dear sir i ever am yours most faithfully  william robertson  no cc dr adam smith to mr gibbon edinburgh december  0th      my dear friend i have ten thousand apologies to make for not having long ago returned you my best thanks for the very agreeable present you made me of the three last volumes of your history i cannot express to you the pleasure it gives me to find that by the universal assent of every man of taste and learning whom i either know or correspond with it sets you at the very head of the whole literary tribe at present existing in europe i ever am my dear friend most affectionately yours  adam smith  no cci mr gibbon to mr cadell bookseller london lausanne february   th      i should be much more ashamed of my silence were i not satisfied that you have received a recent and favorable account of me from some of our friends who have visited this place since my return but i should be inexcusable did i not thank you for your kind and seasonable wishes which i can return with equal sincerity i do not propose making any improvements or corrections in the octavo edition which you meditate some slight alterations would give me more trouble than pleasure a thorough revision of the whole work would be the labor of many months it may be the amusement of my old age and will be a valuable legacy to renew your copyright at the expiration of the last fourteen years in the mean while some expedition may be useful to guard your property from the unexpected invasion of foreign pirates eight volumes in octavo are already printed at basil and the remainder is expected every day i am both glad and sorry to inform you that the type is neat the paper tolerable and the text wonderfully correct i hear of another english edition in saxony and of two french translations advancing with speed and emulation at paris of the success of the work at home you are best qualified and most interested to judge and i am happy to find that you express yourself with some reserve satisfied with the sale from some reports of angry criticisms and from the use and abuse of my name in the papers i perceive that i am not forgotten before a year has elapsed from the time of publication my history will have been perused by some thousand readers of various characters and understandings each will probably find something to blame and i hope something to commend and the balance of their private judgments will fix the public estimate of its merit and reputation since my return i have been as i promise in the preface very busy an very idle in my library several ideal works have been embraced and thrown aside but if the warm weather should ripen any project to form and maturity you may depend on the earliest intelligence i have received a very friendly and flattering letter from dr robertson and have had the pleasure of showing some civilities to his son during his residence in this place if you can send me a good account of adam smith there is no man more sincerely interested in his welfare than myself i beg you will present my compliments to all our friends particularly to mr strahan and dr gillies tell elmsley that i have received with due contrition his third letter unless you are speedy my answer will anticipate your information i am most faithfully yours  no ccii edward gibbon esquire to lady porten kensingtonpalace lausanne june   th      dear madam i received with more concern than surprise your kind notification of my poor uncles departure my own knowledge of his many valuable qualities teaches me to sympathize in your loss but his long infirmities and gradual decay must have prepared you for the melancholy event and your own reason will suggest the best and strongest motives of consolation among these is your regard for the amiable children whom he has left behind your labors for their future happiness will be assisted by all your friends who are attached to his memory and for my own part i beg leave to assure you that on every occasion i shall consider them as my near and dear relations when i had last the pleasure of seeing charlotte at kensington i was delighted with her innocent cheerfulness with her assiduous care of her poor father and with an appearance of sense and discretion far beyond her years how happy should i think myself if i had a daughter of her age and disposition who in a short time would be qualified to govern my family and to be my companion and comfort in the decline of life  you will i am sure be pleased to hear that my situation at laufanne continues almost in every respect as agreeable as i could wish the only circumstance which embitters my happiness is the declining health of my friend mons deyverdun i cannot long flatter myself with the hope of possessing him i am dear madam etc  no cciii mr gibbon to mr cadell lausanne november   th    0 dear sir i should indeed be inexcusable for my long neglect of your last obliging letter had it not reached me in a moment of pain and weakness in a sit of the gout the longest and most severe that i have ever known a letter with me is no trifling enterprise and before i could find strength and time and resolution the occasion on which you so handsomely consulted me was already past i suppose that the abridgment of my history is now freely circulated either with or without your name nor can i foresee any possible mischief either for my reputation or your interest a translation an abridgment or even a criticism always proves the success and consequently extends the sale of any popular work  as i am inclined to flatter myself that you have no reason to be displeased with your purchase i now wish to ask you whether you feel yourself disposed to add a seventh or supplemental volume to my history the materials of which it will be composed will naturally be classed under the three following heads   a series of fragments disquisitions digressions etc more or less connected with the principal subject   several tables of geography chronology coins weights and measures etc nor should i despair of obtaining from a gentleman at paris some accurate and welladapted maps   a critical review of all the authors whom i have used and quoted mr gibbon soon became tired of this plan and expressed a wish it had not been mentioned he said his history was a critical review of the authors he had used s  i am convinced such a supplement might be rendered entertaining as well as useful and that few purchasers would refuse to complete their decline and fall but as the writer could not derive either fame or amusement from these obscure labors he must be encouraged by other motives and in plain english i should expect the same reward for the seventh as for any of the preceding volumes you think and act with too much liberality to confound such a large original supplement with the occasional improvements of a new edition which are already your property by the terms of our former convenant but as i am jealous of standing clear not only in law and equity but in your esteem and my own i shall instantly renounce the undertaking if it appears by your answer that you have the shadow of an objection should you tempt me to proceed this supplement will be only the employment of my leisure hours and i foresee that full two years will elapse before i can deliver it into the hands of the printer  our friend elmsley who possibly thinks me dead and buried will be or will not be surprised when you inform him that i have now a letter of two pages in my bureau addressed to him dated the twentysixth of may and not yet finished hunger literary hunger will soon however compel me to write as i have many questions to ask and many commissions to give in the mean while i thirst for mr burkes reflections on the revolutions of france entreat elmsley in my name to dispatch it to lausanne with care and speed by any mode of conveyance less expensive than the post he may add to the parcel the new edition of adam smiths theory of moral sentiments i heard of his death with more concern than surprise what a loss to letters philosophy and mankind  i beg you would remember me to mr strahan and all our friends in my happy exile my public and private affections remind me that i am an englishman pray thank dr moore in my name for the pleasure which i have received from zeluco the best philosophical romance of the age if he cultivates his talents by any similar publications i only wish that he would place the scene at home we may describe the characters but we can never paint the manners of foreigners and the quarrel of the two scotchmen is doubtless the best chapter in the book i am dear sir most faithfully yours  no cciv mr gibbon to mr cadell lausanne april   th      dear sir too many posts have slipped away since my receipt of your last letter without my assuring you that every shadow of misapprehension has vanished from my mind and that i am perfectly satisfied with the liberality of your sentiments and conduct but i am every day more inclined to believe that on the present occasion they will not be put to the trial on a closer inspection i discover more difficulty and less advantage than i had at first imagined in the plan of a supplement and i feel the objection which you so handsomely decline against increasing the weight and price of so voluminous a work perhaps it would have been better if my crude idea had not been so hastily announced to the public but even this venial indiscretion is a proof of your zeal and regard the intelligence of any new designs shall be delayed till they are ripe for execution but you may be assured that i am now awake  i am very happy to hear that our respectable friend dr robertson is not asleep and much do i expect from the subject and the pen i had once a design not totally unconnected with his own but it is now in far abler hands boswells book will be curious or at least whimsical his hero who can so long detain the public curiosity must be no common animal i see you now advertise an octavo edition of dr henrys history of england is not the author dead his plan is excellent and i wish you could engage some diligent and sensible man to undertake the continuation alas if dr campbell were still alive i have desired elmsley to ask you for three octavo copies of my own work whenever he sends me a box of books i should be glad if you would enrich it with any of your own valuable publications your name is a recommendation but the chastity of that name cannot be too religiously preserved my health and spirits are now remarkably good and it will give me great pleasure to receive as favorable an account of yourself i am most faithfully yours  no ccv edward gibbon esquire to mrs gibbon belvidere bath lausanne may   th      dear madam as much as i am accustomed to my own sins i am shocked really shocked when i think of my long and most inexcusable silence nor do i dare to compute how many months i have suffered to elapse without sending a single line oh shame shame to the best and dearest of my friends who indeed has been very seldom out of my thoughts i have sometimes imagined that if the opportunities of writing occurred less frequently they would be seized with more diligence but the unfortunate departure of the post twice every week encourages procrastination and each short successive delay is indulged without seruple till the whole has swelled to a tremendous account i will try alas to reform and although i am afraid that writing grows painful to you i have the confidence to solicit a speedy line to say that you love and forgive me after a long experience of the unfeeling doubts and delays of the law you will probably soon hear from lord sheffield that the beriton transaction is at last concluded and i hope that you will be satisfied with the full and firm security of your annuity that you may long continue to enjoy it is the first and most sincere wish of my heart  in the placid course of our lives at lausanne and bath we have few events to relate and fewer changes to describe but i indulge myself in the pleasing belief that we are both as well and as happy as the common order of nature will allow us to expect i should be satisfied had i received from time to time some indirect but agreeable information of your health for myself i have no complaint except the gout and though the visits of my old enemy are somewhat longer and more enfeebling they are consined to my feet and knees the pain is moderate and my imprisonment to my chamber or my chair is much alleviated by the daily kindness of my friends i wish it were in my power to give you an adequate idea of the convenience of my house and the beauty of my garden both of which i have improved at a considerable expense since the death of poor deyverdun but the loss of a friend is indeed irreparable were i ten years younger i might possibly think of a female companion but the choice is difficult the success doubtful the engagement perpetual and at fiftyfour a man should never think of altering the whole system of his life and habits the disposal of beriton and the death of my aunt hester who has left me her estate in sussex makes me very easy in my worldly affairs my income is equal to my expense and my expense is adequate to my wishes you may possibly have heard of literary projects which are ascribed to me by the public without my knowledge but it is much more probable that i have closed the account and though i shall never lay aside the pleasing occupations of study you may be assured that i have no serious settled thoughts of a new work next year i shall meditate and i trust shall execute a visit to england in which the belvidere is one of my powerful loadstones i often reflect with a painful emotion on the imperious circumstances which have thrown us at such a distance from each other  in the moving picture of the world you cannot be indifferent to the strange revolution which has humbled all that was high and exalted all that was low in france the irregular and lively spirit of the nation has disgraced their liberty and instead of building a free constitution they have only exchanged despotism for anarchy this town and country are crowded with noble exiles and we sometimes count in an assembly a dozen princesses and duchesses burke if i remember right is no favorite of yours but there is surely much eloquence and much sense in his book the prosperity of england forms a proud contrast with the disorders of france but i hope we shall avoid the folly of a russian war pit in this instance seems too like his father mr helrard a sensible man and his pupil have left us they found as your friends will always find the weight of your recommendation with me i am dearest madam ever most affectionately yours  no ccvi dr william robertson to mr gibbon lennelhouse august   th      dear sir some time before the publication of my historical disquisition concerning india i desired our friend mr cadell to send a copy of it to you in my name i hope you received it long ago and will allow it to remain in your library as a memorial of my respect and friendship no man had formed a more decided resolution of retreating early from public view and of spending the eve of life in the tranquillity of professional and domestic occupations but directly in the face of that purposs i step forth with a new work when just on the brink of threescore and ten the preface of the book gives a fair and simple account how this happened hitherto i have no cause to repent of a step which i took with hesitation and anxiety my book has met with a reception beyond what the spe lenius pavidusque futuri dared to expect i find however like other parents that i have a partial fondness for this child of my old age and cannot set my heart quite at ease until i know your opinion of it i need not say with what perfect confidence i rest upon your judgment and how happy it will make me to find that this production meets with your approbation nothing will add so much to that pleasure as your communicating to me any remarks that occurred to you in perusing it while i was engaged in composing the disquisition it often occurred to me that i was more upon your ground than in any of my former works and i often wished that i had been so near to you as to profit by your advice and information next to that will be the benefit i may derive from your friendly strictures be so kind then as to mention to me any error or omission you have observed every criticism of yours will be instructive  permit me to request another favor you allowed me to hope that as soon as you fixed upon a new subject you would let me know and give me the satisfaction of indulging the hopes of living until you finished it i trust that you are not idle still i may now tell you with authority that you are yet far from that period of life when you should lay down your pen i can say from experience that the busiest season of life is the most happy and i have no doubt that you will concur with me in this sentiment let me know then my dear sir how you are what you are doing and what progress you make as for my part i enjoy good health and except some fits of deafness am little troubled with the infirmities of old age i write this at my soninlaws mr brydone who if he had not a wife and family loves switzerland so well and has so many friends in lausanne that i believe he would gladly join you there believe me to be with great respect your most faithful and obedient servant  william robertson  no ccvii edward gibbon esquire to mrs gibbon bath lausanne august  st      my dearest madam notwithstanding all the arts of our great enemy the demon of procrastination i should not have postponed for so many months a pleasing duty which may at any time be performed in a single hour had i not for some time past entertained a lively and probable hope of visiting you this autumn in person had i not flattered myself that the very next post i might be able to fix the day of my departure from lausanne and almost of my arrival at the belvidere that hope is now vanished and my journey to england is unavoidably delayed till the spring or summer of next year the extraordinary state of public affairs in france opposes an insuperable bar to my passage and every prudent stranger will avoid that inhospitable land in which a people of slaves is suddenly become a nation of tyrants and cannibals the german road is indeed safe but independent of a great addition of fatigue and expense the armies of austria and prussia now cover that frontier and though the generals are polite and the troops well disciplined i am not desirous of passing through the clouds of hussars and pandours that attend their motions these public reasons are fortified by some private motives and to this delay i resign myself with a sigh for the present and a hope for the future  what a strange wild world do we live in you will allow me to be a tolerable historian yet on a fair review of ancient and modern times i can find none that bear any affinity with the present my knowledge of your discerning mind and my recollection of your political principles assure me that you are no more a democrat than myself had the french improved their glorious opportunity to erect a free constitutional monarchy on the ruins of arbitrary power and the bastille i should applaud their generous effort but this total subversion of all rank order and government could be productive only of a popular monster which after devouring every thing else must finally devour itself i was once apprehensive that this monster would propagate some imps in our happy island but they seem to have been crushed in their cradle and i acknowledge with pleasure and pride the good sense of the english nation who seem truly conscious of the blessings which they enjoy and i am happy to find that the most respectable part of opposition has cordially joined in the support of things as they are even this country has been somewhat tainted with the democratical infection the vigilance of government has been exerted the malcontents have been awed the misguided have been undeceived the fever in the blood has gradually subsided and i flatter myself that we have secured the tranquil enjoyment of obscure felicity which we had been almost tempted to despise  you have heard most probably from mrs holroyd of the longexpected though transient satisfaction which i received from the visit of lord sheffields family he appeared highly satisfied with my arrangements here my house garden and situation at once in town and country which are indeed singular in their kind and which have often made me regret the impossibility of showing them to my dearest friend of the belvidere lord sheffield is still and will ever continue the same active being always employed for himself his friends and the public and always persuading himself that he wishes for leisure and repose there are various roads to happiness but when i compare his situation with mine i do not upon the whole repent that i have given the preference to a life of celibacy and retirement although i have been long a spectator of the great world my unambitious temper has been content with the occupations and rewards of study and although my library be still my favorite room i am now no longer stimulated by the prosecution of any literary work the society of lausanne is adapted to my taste my house is open to many agreeable acquaintance and some real friends the uniformity of the natives is enlivened by travelers of all nations and this summer i am happy in a familiar intercourse with lady spencer the duchess of devonshire lady elizabeth foster and lady duncannon who seems to be gradually recovering from her severe complaints my health is remarkably good i have now enjoyed a long interval from the gout and i endeavor to use with moderation dr cadogans best remedies temperance exercise and cheerfulness adieu dear madam may every blessing that nature can allow be attendant on your latter season your age and my habits will not permit a very close correspondence but i wish to hear and i presume to ask a speedy direct account of your own situation may it be such as i shall hear with pleasure once more adieu i live in hopes of embracing you next summer at the belvidere but you may be assured that i bring over nothing for the press  no ccviii edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lady    at florence lausanne november  th      i remember it has been observed of augustus and cromwell that they should never have been born or never have died and i am sometimes tempted to apply the same remark to certain beings of a softer nature who after a short residence on the banks of the leman lake are now flown far away over the alps and the appenines and have abandoned their votaries to the insipidity of common life the remark however would be unreasonable and the sentiment ungrateful the pleasures of the summer the lighter and the graver moments of the society of petit ouchy a beautiful villa near the lake about a mile from lausanne  are indeed past perhaps never to return but the remembrance of that delightful period is itself a pleasure and i enjoy i cherish the flattering persuasion that it is remembered with some satisfaction in the gallery of florence as well as in the library of lausanne long before we were reduced to seek a refuge from the savages of gaul i had secretly indulged the thought or at least the wish of asking leave to attend mes bonnes amies over mount cenis of basking once more in an italian sun and of paying once more my devotions to the apollo of the vatican but my aged and gouty limbs would have failed me in the bold attempt of scaling st bernard and i wanted patience to undertake the tedious circumitineration of the tirol your return to the pays de vaud next summer i hold to be extremely doubtful but my anxiety on that head is somewhat diminished by the sure and certain hope of our all meeting in england the ensuing winter i flatter myself that the porter of devonshirehouse will not be inexorable yet i am afraid of losing you amidst the smoke and tumult of fashionable london in which the night is devoted to pleasure and the morning to sleep my ambition may perhaps aspire to pass some hours in the palladian chiswick or even some days at chatsworth but these princely mansions will not recall the freedom the ease the primitive solitude of dear little ouchy indeed indeed your fair friend was made for something better than a duchess  although you most magnanimously abandoned us in the crisis of our fate yet as you seem to interest yourself in the hopes and fears of this little country it is my duty to inform you that we still hang in a state of suspense inclining however to the side of hope rather than of despair the garrison and even the bourgeoisie of geneva showed a vigorous resolution of defending the city and our frontiers have been gradually covered with fifteen thousand intrepid swiss but the threats of a bombardment the weight of expense and above all the victorious ascendant of the french republic have abated much of the first heroic ardour monsieur de montesquiou displayed a pacific and even yielding temper and a treaty was signed dismissing the swiss garrison from geneva and removing the french troops to the distance of ten leagues but this last condition which is indeed objectionable displeased the convention who refused to ratify the agreement new conferences were held new messengers have been dispatched but unless they are determined to find or to make a subject of quarrel it is probable that we shall purchase peace by submission as geneva has a very dangerous democratical party within her walls and as the national guards are already allowed to enter the city and to tamper with the inhabitants and the garrison i will not ensure that poor little republic from one week to another for ourselves the approaches of danger must be more gradual i think we are now safe for this winter and i no longer run to the window to see whether the french are coming but with so many enemies without and so many within the government of bern and the tranquillity of this happy country will be suspended by a very slender twig and i begin to fear that satan will drive me out of the possession of paradise my only comfort will be that i shall have been expelled by the power and not seduced by the arts of the blackest demon in hell the demon of democracy where indeed will this tremendous inundation this conspiracy of numbers against rank and property be finally stopped europe seems to be universally tainted and wherever the french can light a match they may blow up a mine our only hope is now in their devouring one another they are furious and hungry monsters and war is almost declared between the convention and the city of paris between the moderate republicans and the absolute levellers a majority of the convention wishes to spare the royal victims but they must yield to the rage of the people and the thirst of popularity and a few hours may produce a trial a sentence and a guillotine mr necker is publishing a pamphlet in defense of the august sufferers but his feeble and tardy efforts will rather do credit to himself than service to his clients you kindly ask after the situation of poor severy alas it is now hopeless all his complaints are increased all his resources are exhausted where nature cannot work the effect of art is vain and his best friends begin to wish him a quiet release his wife i had almost said his widow is truly an object of compassion the dragoon is returned for a few days and if his domestic sorrows gave him leave he would almost regret the want of an occasion to deserve his feather and cockade your note has been communicated to madame de montelieu but as she is engaged with a dying aunt i have not yet seen her madame dagaisseau has hastily left us the last decrees seemed to give the emigres only the option of starving abroad or hanging at home yet she has ventured into france on some faint glimpse of clemency for the women and children madame de bouillon does not appear to move madame de stael whom i saw last week at roll is still uncertain where she shall drop her burden but she must soon resolve for the young lady or gentleman is at the door  demanding life impatient for the skies by this time you have joined the ladies spencer and duncannon whom i beg leave to salute with the proper shades of respect and tenderness you may if you please be belle comme un ange but i do not like your comparison of the archangel those of milton with whom i am better acquainted at present than with guido are all masculine manly figures with a great sword by their side and six wings folding round them the heathen goddesses would please me as little your friend is less severe than minerva more decent than venus less cold than diana and not quite so great a vixen as the oxeyed juno to express that infallible mixture of grace sweetness and dignity a new race of beings must be invented and i am a mere prose narrator of matter of fact bess is much nearer the level of a mortal but a mortal for whom the wisest man historic or medical would throw away two or three worlds if he had them in his possession from the aforesaid bess i have received three marks of kind remembrance from the foot of st bernard with an exquisite monument of art and friendship from turin and finally from milan with a most valuable insertion from the duchess at birds in the air it is difficult to take aim and i fear or hope that i shall sustain some reproaches on your not finding this long epistle at florence i will mark it no   and why should i despair of my future since i can say with truth that since your departure i have not spent so agreeable a morning to each of the dear little caros pray deliver nine kisses for me which shall be repaid on demand my best compliments to mr pelham if he is with you  no ccix edward gibbon esquire to the right honorable lady    at florence lausanne april  th      had i not given previous notice of my own unworthiness the plea of being an old incorrigible offender would serve only to aggravate my guilt it is still sufficiently black and i can patiently hear every reproach except the cruel and unjust imputation of having forgotten my fair friends of the arno and the tyber they would indeed have been less present to my thoughts had i maintained a regular weekly correspondence since by the effect of my negligence not a day has elapsed without a serious though fruitless resolution of writing by the very next post what may have somewhat contributed besides original sin to this vile procrastination is the course of events that has filled this abominable winter as long as the poor kings fate was on suspense one waited from post to post between hope and fear and when the blow was struck even shakespeares language was inadequate to express our grief and indignation i have never approved the execution of charles the first yet charles had invaded in many respects the ancient constitution of england and the question had been judged in the field of naseby before it was tried in westminster hall but louis had given and suffered every thing the cruelty of the french was aggravated by ingratitude and a life of innocence was crowned by the death of a saint or what is far better of a virtuous prince who deserves our pity and esteem he might have lived and reigned had he possessed as much active courage as he was endowed with patient fortitude when i read the accounts from home of the universal grief and indignation which that fatal event excited i indeed gloried in the character of an englishman our national fame is now pure and splendid we have nobly stood forth in the common cause of mankind and although our armaments are somewhat slow i still persuade myself that we shall give the last deadly wound to the gallic hydra the king of prussia is likewise slow and your poor friend the duke of brunswick is now not censured but forgotten we turn our eyes to the prince of cobourg and his austrians and it must be confessed that the deliverance of holland and brabant from such a dragon as dumourier is a very tolerable employment for the month of march these blossoms of the spring will be followed it may be fairly hoped by the fruits of summer and in the meanwhile the troubles of paris and the revolt of the provinces may promote by the increase of anarchy the restoration of order i see that restoration through a dark cloud but if france be lost the rest of europe i believe and trust will be saved but amidst the hurricane i dare not fix my eyes on the temple so much for politics which now engross the waking and sleeping thoughts of every feeling and thinking animal in this country we are tranquil and i believe safe at least for this summer though peace has been purchased chased at some expense of national honor of the old reputation of swiss courage we have crouched before the tiger and stroked him till he has sheathed his claws and ceased for a moment to roar my journey to england this year must depend on the events of the campaign as i am fully resolved rather to remain quiet another autumn and winter in my sweet habitation than to encounter the dangers of the sea and land i envy the pleasures which you and your companions have enjoyed at florence and rome nor can i decide which have tasted the most perfect delight those to whom such beauties were new or those to whom they were familiar a fine eye correct judgment and elegant sensibility are requisite to qualify the studious traveller and these gifts have been liberally dispensed among the ouchy caravan but when you have been gratified though not satiated with the hesperian prospect to what fortunate clime will you direct your footsteps have we any hopes of meeting for my journey at all events would be late in the shades or rather in the sunshine of ouchy should mount cenis be still imperious you have trampled on st bernard in a more rigorous season and whatsoever may be the state of the world the pays de vaud will afford you a secure asylum or a pleasant station i rejoice to hear of lady besboroughs improvement will that new title make any difference in the plan is the duchess very impatient to revisit england except some trifling considerations of children etc all countries may be indifferent to her as she is sure of being loved and admired in all i am anxious and impatient to learn the result of your counsels but i feel myself unworthy of a regular correspondence and am not desirous of heaping fresh coals of fire on my head  i am happy to find that you forgive and pity my friend necker against whom you all entertained some versailles prejudices as his heart has been always pure he cannot feel remorse but as his conduct has been unsuccessful he is penetrated with grief and regret madame de stael has written to me from england she likes the country but means to fly over again in may  no ccx mr gibbon to lord    roll february   d      my lord i do not merely congratulate your lordships promotion to an office which your abilities have long deserved my satisfaction does not arise from an assurance of the wisdom and vigor which administration will derive from the support of so respectable an ally but as a friend to government in general i most sincerely rejoice that you are now armed in the common cause against the most dangerous fanatics that have ever invaded the peace of europe against the new barbarians who labor to confound the order and happiness of society and who in the opinion of thinking men are not less the enemies of subjects than of kings the hopes of the wise and good are now fixed on the success of england and i am persuaded that my personal attachment to your lordship will be amply gratified by the important share which your counsels will assume in that success i could wish that some of your former associates possessed sufficient strength of mind to extricate themselves from the toils of prejudice and party but i grieve that a man whom it is impossible for me not to love and admire should refuse to obey the voice of his country and i begin to fear that the powerful genius of mr a town between lausanne and geneva where m necker then resided  instead of being useful will be adverse to the public service at this momentous crisis we should enlist our whole force of virtue ability and spirit and without any view to his private advantage i could wish that    might be properly stationed in some part of the line  mr necker in whose house i am now residing on a visit of some days wishes me to express the sentiments of esteem and consideration which he entertains for your lordships character as a friend to the interest of mankind he is warmly attached to the welfare of great britain which he has long revered as the first and perhaps as the last asylum of genuine liberty his late eloquent work du pouvoir executif which your lordship has assuredly read is a valuable testimony of his esteem for our constitution and the testimony of a sagacious and impartial stranger may have taught some of our countrymen to value the political blessings which they have been tempted to despise  i cherish a lively hope of being in england and of paying my respects to your lordship before the end of the summer but the events of the year are so uncertain and the sea and land are encompassed with so many difficulties and dangers that i am doubtful whether it will be practicable for me to execute my purpose  i am my lord most respectfully and your lordship will permit me to add most affectionately your most faithful humble servant  end of the first volume
