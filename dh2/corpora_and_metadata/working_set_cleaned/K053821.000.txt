a complete treatise of urines showing the right method of urinal prognostication far different from the common practice of quacks and mountebanks  by t h pharmacop rustican  pro captu lectoris habent sua fata libelli london printed for henry bonwicke at the red lion in st pauls churchyard   0   to my very worthy good friend the reverend mr arthur heron rector of morton near chippingongar in essex reverend sir knowing your ability in physic as well as your good and great character in divinity and presuming in the interchange of your studies you had sometimes met with the subject i here present you with i submit it to your impartial judgment and censure  when i came first to reside in these parts nothing was more noised among the vulgar in case of any illness than the wonderful skill some men had above others in waterjudgment by vrinal prognostication  this put me upon the most diligent search i could make and having consulted many books on that subject i found no great satisfaction in the matter yet sometime after perusing a small treatise intituld tractatus epistolaris de vrinis etc which proving multum in parvo more ample though brief than any i had yet read i forthwith translated it and having added some collections from other authors i subjovnd some late observations in my own practice all which was designed for my own proper use only but hearing very frequently of the many grand impositions on a better sort of people than the mere vulgar by some bold quacking medicasters i resolved to print the following discourse hoping thereby that passing through many hands it might in some measure prevent the too much abused credulity of some  for indeed too too many have been so long imposed upon that their faith of the matter is grown so great that they believe those bold pretenders by the bare inspection of a little piss through a glass conjurer like can discover the greatest secrets in nature and unfold the most difficult and most intricate cases of all diseases nay i suppose by a bare shake of the urinal they can as well foretell what number of corns a man has on his toes or what number of teeth an old woman has in her head  yet i must confess indeed some guess pretty well at the matter for it is not long since a good woman in out neighborhood carried her daughter to a famed vrinalconquassator for his advice who after a demure view of the virginlike water and a little handling of the tumefyd damsel told the poor woman her daughter was livergrown that her liver was doubled had two livers which was too true indeed for the poor wench was big with child and visible to almost every eye but the fond doting mothers how great a consternation the poor woman was in at so monstrous a relation i will not here trouble you with to recite  i shall now add no more but that i may presuppose that this pispot discourse will not savor well in the nostrils of every busy critic but whether it will or will not it is equal to me if you please favorably to accept and approve of it which will further engage my ambition of being  sir your most humble and most ready servant in all commands t h  the preface the ancients in the very infancy of physic made strict enquiries into the nature of urines fetching thence their practical directions for hence twas the great hippocrates especially took the measures of his foreknowledge and precepts in passing judgment on the sick and choosing the fittest seasons for physic so that twas unlawful not to observe that famous ancient and established maxim among physicians viz to purge concocteds without a right consultation of the chamber pot and this indeed seems most agreeable to the most common reason that since we cannot thoroughly research the inmost retirement of a sick body which is like a vessel close shut up we should take the hints of judging from the ingested liquor which in its passage washes over every part drawing from most a tincture and carrying off some loose particles with it for urines are as certain indications of the constitutions and illtemperaments of our bodies when a right judgment is made as waters betray the nature of that mineral through which they pass  wherefore the contemplation of this though the basest excrement is become the subject of a science and has exercised the wits of the most renowned physicians both ancient and modern concerning which are many books extant compiled with the greatest diligence in which are enumerated the various differences of urines of their colors and diversities of consistence the contents are exactly described and for every of these distinct precepts of water judgment are delivered which by some are thought so certain as if the bare inspection of urine gave intimation of every disease or affected part nay every minute accident concerning the sick but in this the vulgar are most egregiously cheated and yet are obstinately wilful to be imposed upon for they maintain none can discover the disease nor foretell any thing of it except be consult the chamber pot and unless the doctor undertakes to divine by his urinal as twere by a magic glass they value him not a rush but for what in truth concerns the precepts and rules upon which the practice of waterinspection is bottomed there are many things found out by diligent observation and then confirmed by sound judgment yet because the intimation of urine is too largely stretched by some to particular cases very many uncertainties interwoven and some things plainly false besides what are liable to error whosoever therefore by this water guide only confidently descants on the diseases of the sick desereves the name rather of a juggler than a fair practitioner but this doctrine of urines is every where so full of errors because its practical observations are ill made or not well methodizd it may be justly suspected that the observations are not rightly made since from one or other particular case a general rule is drawn  for example because some dropsical persons make a thin watery urine therefore it is canond that such urines are the undoubted symptoms of a dropsy when indeed in some other affects the same kind of urine is made and sometimes in dropsies the urine is thick and of a deep red  again what is vulgarly most received is for the most part uncertain viz that urine upon which there swims a scum like that on water wherein tartar has been boiled does signify a consumption when this sign is more proper and familiar to hypochondriacks than consumptive persons and also very many without this sign die of a consumption  besides what is generally affirmed is altogether false that the nature of any affect is discoverable by urines because sometimes those that are diseased make water like sound men and sometimes those who seem to be sufficiently in health by reason of some accident perhaps the food they have eaten make suspicious urine and such as are estranged from a natural state as to the method or doctrine of urines delivered by most it looks altogether empiricklike and not at all rational for the naked differences of urines are recited as they are usually distinguished in their color consistence and contents then to every of these kinds are opposed pathological i e affect describing significations only collected from more unusual observations when in the interim neither the causes of phaenomenons or preternatural alterations as ought to have been are assigned neither is the intimation of urines applied to the causes of diseases but only to the disease or its symptom  therefore it is very often deceitful and uncertain by reason the morbifick cause and intimation of the same urine may indifferently at the same time point at diverse diseases and symptoms medimely  for example thin and watrish urine very often unmediately signifies want of concoction in the bowels yet by reason of the state of crudity oftentimes the green sickness in virgins sometimes the dropsy or white and phlegmatic swelling of the whole body sometimes the headache and many other affects also arise  the heads of the subsequent discourse are first the anatomy of urine what elements and paris it consists of as also its originals in our bodies to wit by what concoction and then separation of some particles from others this liquor is made  secondly the inspection of urines is rightly explained and what certainty and rule there is of urine prognostication  thirdly and lastly a general description of the color consistence and contents of the urine in most diseases and what those signs

 of urine chap i of the principles and chief accidents of urine urine new made or after putrefaction by long digestion may be chymically resolved into these principles by distillation  st a small spirit like that of wine diluted with water ascends but in so little a quantity that it is not easily tasted this is succeeded by a watery liquor considerable in quantity intermixed with some looser particles of salt and principally sulphur  dly a very penetrative water is exhaled commonly called spiritus urinae which has but little of the winelike spirit being generally only a phlegm very much sharpened with salt wherefore as in vinegar distilled it ascends last  but because the salt of urine is volatile and of vinegar fluid therefore the distilled liquor impregnated with the particles of this is very acid but what is incorporated with the saline particles of the other is very sharp and pungitive  it is hence evident that the spiritus urine commonly so called owes its sharpness especially to salt because though most subtle it takes not flame but extinguisheth it if presented to it  after distillation and the remaining moisture being wholly evaporated another portion of salt with a little earth remains in the bottom of the mattress out of which by a stronger heat a volatile salt may be sublimed leaving the earthy dregs behind  this anatomy of urine plainly shows that the principles whereof it consists are most water and salt a little sulphur and earth and very little spirit we may discern the saltness of urines by taste and touch in taste it comes nearest a nitrous salt and proceeds from the salt particles of what we eat which by concoction in the vessels is for the most part elaborated into a volatile salt i e a salt and certain spirit which by their long and mutual combination are knit together in the closest tie hence salt it self otherwise fixed is volatilizd and as twere by the wing of another becomes not unfit for motion  from the different dispositions of our bodies urines contain more or less salt and that according to the accidents more volatile or fixed and therefore are different in color and consistence  that there is sulphur in urines their speedy putrefaction and stink sufficiently prove and it proceeds from the salinesulphureous particles of nourishment  of this sulphur there is less than in blood the horns of animals or soot and therefore in the distillation of urine nothing almost oily or fat ascends for while the blood circulates the spirituous and sulphurous bodies which depart from it for the most part evaporate in the interim the saline and watery relics make up the urine yet urines always have some sulphur but the quantities and proportion are diversely altered according to the different degrees of concoction and crudity hence proceed the changes of heat and consistence in urines that the winelike spirits of urine are but few it is evident from the defect in the liquor first distilled as also from the sudden putrefaction of urine but the intestine motion of the particles in urine conclude some viz the separation of thin from thick and the spontaneous division of some parts from others and the collection of that hypostasis or thick substance which generally subsides at the bottom of urine besides the saline particles inasmuch as they become volatile are closely wedded to the spirituous and therefore become more brisk in motion and quick of energy yet according to the different plenty and prevalency of spirits in urines there are diverse modes of those nubeculae or urineclouds and also of the sediments and the urines themselves have a more quick or slow putrefaction the watrypart in urine far exceeds the rest in quantity as being almost six times more than the other and by distillation it is not so clearly separated but that some volatile parts of salt and sulphur ascend together with it which tincture it with an ungrateful sent  this has its original from a plentiful ingestion of liquids with food which yet of what kind soever they be lose their proper qualities and acquire others before their change into urine for nothing almost sincere of that liquor we drink besides moisture barely remains in the piss  the distillation and evaporation of urine plainly demonstrate that there is some portion of earth as well as slimymuddy dreggs in it for when all the liquid parts are exhaled the earth as a caput mortuum remains in the bottom in a moderate quantity  for in the nutritive juice besides the active principles of salt sulphur and spirit is required something solid whence bodies have their bulk and magnitude the recrements and earthy dreggs of this are plentifully dissolved in the serous part making the contents of a more thick consistence but this is different according to the variable state of concoction and crudity  these are the principles which make up the body of urine into which by chemistry it is easily resolvable  from the combinations and various admixtures of these the other accidents of urine viz quantity color and consistence which are sensibly the most observable in it and from hence the especial objects of urinejudgment do arise for when almost nothing besides is discernible in urine those make the first phaenomenons in the right solution of which the whole hypothesis of this science consists  wherefore in the next place i shall treat of these and first concerning the urines of sound men what is their quantity color consistence and contents as also i shall endeavor to declare upon what mixture of elements what concoction of the bowels and vessels every one of these depend  in the next place it shall be showed how far the urines of sick persons differ from the rule and standard of those who are sound and i shall endeavor to assign the proper causes of their change to each of these differences and what i have said hitherto shall finish the first scope of my discourse to wit the anatomy of urine  chap ii concerning the quantity and color in sound mens urine the quantity of urine in sound men ought to be a little less than the liquids daily ingested for what is potable and moist that is daily taken is the very matter of which urines primarily consist but these when hunger and thirst urge are more plentifully required that they may sufficiently dilute the mass of chyle for its right fermentation in the bowels as also that it may serve for a vehicle both to convey it into the mass of blood that the blood it self may circulate in the vessels without stagnation and to the nervous juice that it may actuate and moisten the organs of sense and motion thus the serous part having almost contributed whatever spirit or sulphur it had gives place to a new nutritive humor and it self then as unprofitable is carried off from the blood by the seclusive help of the kidneys  the nourishing liquor which at last is changed unto urine is different in its own nature sometimes waterish sometimes inpregnated with spirits sometimes with salt and sulphur and according to the different prevalency of this or that element in it many variations happen but no liquids wholly and unchanged pass our bodies but in diverse parts undergo their mutations and loose some portion of their quantities before they be ultimated into piss for the liquor to be turned into urine being first received into the stomach and staying there till concocted is also impregnated with salt and sulphur of its own or other dissolved particles from some more solid nourishment after this much of it together with the nutritive juice is mixed with the blood with which after long circulation and then according to the various temper of the blood and its accension in the heart it receives a further tincture of salt and sulphur hence some portion of it is derived into the brain and nerves and there being rendered weak and nonnutritive it is finally again reduced into the mass of blood after that the more generous part of the serum is spent upon the blood and the nervous juice a great part also by sweat and other emunctories the remainder while the blood continually passes the reins is there separated from it either by percolation or the force of some fermentation by way of precipitation passing the ureters into the bladder whence it is ejected  from the original and view of this serous part now discribd it is evident and that clearly that the urine ought to answer the quantity of liquids ingested in a proportion somewhat less perhaps about a third which plainly shows the complextion and strength of the bowels whose office is concoction and likewise of the blood it self as also in some sort the temper and distribution of the succus nervosus moreover it carries with it the signs of the affects of the urinary passages  the quantity of the urine does not always hit this rule but sometimes exceeds sometimes comes short and for a little time may consist with a state not much out of tune but the long continuance of such different accidents argues a sickly condition concerning these i shall speak amongst the phaenomenons of urine in a crasy body  in the next place i consider the color of a sound urine  the urine that is made after a perfect concoction in the whole body is of a citroncolour like a lixivium indifferently boiled which without doubt proceeds from the salt and sulphur of the nutritive juice and blood dissolved by ebullition in the serum  this color arises not from salt only as some contend for any liquor that is impregnated with salt except it be evaporated to a certain thikness does not at all grow yellow and truly the salt of tartar dissolved by liquation yet remains clear  to what is objected concerning a lixivium of ashes i answer the whole quantity of sulphur is not spent by burning but the citron color arises from some salt and other adust sulphurous particles cleaving to the ashes infused and incocted in the liquor nor has sound urine this tincture from sulphur only for sulphur in a waterish menstruum cannot be dissolved without the addition of salt neither parts with any of its tincture without such addition and therefore if you digest salt of tartar and common sulphur together in water or boil antimony in a salt menstrum both liquors urine like grow yellow from thence even so the salt and sulphurous particles of nourishment by digestion in the stomach and intestines and by circulation with the blood in the arteries and veins being minutely divided and througly incocted with the serum make the urine of a citroncolour  the dissolution of salt and sulphur in manner aforementioned by which urines become citroncolourd is first begun in the bowels afterward perfected in the other vessels much depending upon the concoction of the stomach and intestines  for here by the help of heat and fermentation the nourishments ingested are especially fermented the tie of mixture being loosed the sulphurous and saline particles minutely broken are advanced into chyle and then the serum which is the remainder from the concoction and distribution of that milkie juice becomes citron colored as when salt of tartar and common sulphur are dissolved together in any liquor and some acid poured upon it it presently turns milkie and soon after the contents being separated per sabsidentiam the remainder of the liquor grows yellow like a lixivium  but if the nourishment through some indisposition of the stomach be not rightly digested in the first concoction as it often happens in a pica dropsy and other distemperatures of the bowels the urine then becomes crude clear and almost insipid like fountain water  but by reason of the too exalted or otherwise depraved ferments of the bowels as in the scurvy hypocondriack melancholy or in a feverish constitution the particles of nourishment being too much dissolved in the first region the urines become red and thick  the serum which in the first concoction as is said had got a tincture like lie being mixed with the blood as long as it circulates with it is yet further concocted and gets a deeper color for though the thoroughly concocted particles of blood are generally separated into the vesicula fellis yet partly their incoction in the serum enhances its tincture hence urine first made after concoction is most pale the next made somewhat red and after long fasting yet more deep  where the blood is more cold as in a cachexia the color of urine is below its just state but where the blood is accended and as twere boiled by a feverish heat it is of a high red  it is worthy observation that some urines and those sound made after large drinking are not colored but pale and waterish  concerning which the enquiry is how the serum so suddenly passes the stomach contrary to common belief and running through first the chyliepassages then the veins arteries the ventricles of the heart the turnings and windings of the reins and ureters in so short a space is sent out of the body and besides otherwise than in most other cases borrows no color in its passages but loses its own  it is probable besides the long circuit of the nutritive juice wherein after some stay in the stomach it glides down the intestines and thence is carried through the lactealvessels into new passages and thence into the veins a circuit not to be run in a trice therefore it is probable i say that there is another more proper passage of the same nutritive juice by which it is presently conveyed to the mass of blood and perhaps to the succus nervosus wherefore after long hunger immediately upon eating but especially upon drinking we find a sudden refreshment which cannot be supposed to proceed but from spirits or vapors because immediately after such drinking follows pissing and that sooner than the mass of chyle can be thought to be sent out of the stomach therefore it seems not improbable that forthwith a thinner part of the nourishing liquor that is received into the stomach consisting of some spirit and espeially water is imbibed by its membranes like a sponge and thence instilled into the mouths of the veins and is presently mixed with the blood in its return to the heart for many are of this opinion that the chyle in some measure is immediately derived from the stomach and intestines through the branches of the vena porta into the mass of blood and as the lacteal passages carry it about in a long circuit by which it is sent into the descending branch of the vena cava so by a nearer way through these vessels may it be carried into the ascending branch of the same vein for the blood being in some measure impoverisht with its circulation returning both ways ought to be refreshed with a new juice before it enters the heart to enliven the ferment there  now since the far greater part of blood is carried upward it seems certainly reasonable that some part of the nutritive juice should as twere fuel for a new accension in the heart be conveyed into the blood already spent and grown feeble many arguments make for this which to recite were too large a digression from my present scope wherefore i think it is in some measure after the manner aforesaid that we piss such a pale waterish urine so soon after drinking  that liquor which from nourishment is so speedily conveyed into the mass of blood not passing through so many windings as the membranes of the bowels as if drawn by distillation the grosser part rejected in a manner is only water and spirit whereby it may refresh the vital spirits and dilute the blood in which task the spirituous part being spent the waterish part being weighty and troublesome by reason of its plenty is continually sent out by the kidneys and since it comes from the stomach not as yet embrewed with salt and sulphur nor is not so long circulated with the blood as to acquire from thence a lixivious tincture it is pissed out thin and clear  chap iii concerning the consistence and contents of the urine of the sound hitherto have we discoursed of the quantity and color of urines in sound bodies but as to the contents there ought to be nothing in sound urines besides the nubecula or urinesloud and what this is and how it is formed in the next place remains to be explained  while the mass of blood is commixt with serum and the nutritive humor it is continually circulated in the vessels from hence a certain nutritive juice by perpetual digestion is elaborated which becomes a nutriment at last continually supplying the solid parts this at first is concocted into a glutinous humor not much unlike the white of an egg after that into slender filaments which being interwoven in the pores and little spaces of the solid parts supply them with an augmentation always of new substance and while the serum that is mixed with the blood washes over all the regions of the body it swallows up in it self a superfluous part of this last nourishment designed for the augmentation of the solid parts and carries out with it that which makes the urinecloud when this appears because it signifies concoction and nutrition in some measure it is accounted a laudable sign but if no such phenomenon be visible it is a sign of crudity as in a cachexia and dyscrasie in fevers  it consists of slender filaments as aforesaid and is dispersed through the whole body of the urine and then is gathered together into one cloud thus the filaments are long and somewhat smooth having some asperities bramblelike so that being moved to and fro they easily take hold one of another and are complicated in themselves as if we should cast many hairs into a vessel full of water and there by often shaking and tossing the vessel about the hairs which at first swim on the top here and there shortly after mutually embrace and knit in one knot after the same manner it is probable the filaments which make up the nubecula or urinecloud being tossed too and fro by the innate heat and spirits of the urine do concur and knit together till by a mutual complex of each other they concenter into one little cloud and because those filaments are more compact and firm than the rest of the contents of the urine by reason of their gravity they fall to the bottom it is highly probable that such filaments in some persons make up the urinecloud because the blood in a good state and consequently disposed for nourishment is interwoven with many fibers or white threads which any body may discover by phlebotomy when the blood is received into hot water therefore it is probable that some divided slender parts of those threads being snatched along with the serum are the matter of that woollike subsidence in the urine wherefore in a cachexia the blood being waterish through crudities and unfit for nourishment is distitute of those elaborated small fibrous threads as likewise in great dyscrasies when by an over ebullition of the blood the nutritive juice is not rightly concocted into such like threads the hypostasis or thick sediment of the urine is either utterly wanting or very much confused and troubled  a good and laudable urinecloud is white round and equal falling toward the bottom and to this is required first that the nourishment be rightly elaborated whereby the filaments may become somewhat smooth round and firm like slender threads   dly that the urine be sufficiently impregnated with spirits which as it is evident in the fermentation of new wine may drive and exagitate the parts to and fro   dly that the liquor be not too thick nor its pores prepossessed with other little bodies whereby it may happen that the motion of the contents may be hindered wherefore there ought to be an ample space left to agitate and hurry about such particles if the urinecloud be red it is a sign that the last nourishment is rendered adust and over concocted by too much heat therefore such a sediment for the most part is in the beginning of fevers while the concoction of the bowels and vessels is not wholly preverted if the hypostasis be broken and unequal it is a sign that the nutriment designed for the solid parts is not rightly and equally concocted that its particles are not altogether congenerous i e of the same kind and of the same nature and therefore the filaments hang not together uniformly but as twere after a separate and confused manner of implication hence some that are more crass fall to the bottom others more rare hang higher when the substance of which the hypostasis is made does not altogether fall but wholly hangs either in the top or middle region it happens thus either because it is made of filaments not perfectly elaborated firm and compact but more thin and spungy or because the liquor is more than ordinary impregnated with salt and sulphur and therefore like a strong lixivium bears up that weighty matter which otherwise would fall to the bottom  some times the nubecula or urinecloud is wholly wanting in sound bodies after long hunger immoderate labors or extraordinary sweats the matter being either wholly spent in nutriment or evaporated by sweat and  in fevers because the mixture of the blood is greatly depraved in the longing and depraved appetites of child bearing women in a cachexia or an ill habit of body and other such like affects by reason of the predominant crudity  concerning the consistence of sound urines not many things worthy observation occur it is commonly like middle ale well purified by fermentation or a lixivium indifferently boiled viz the aqueous part of the urine ought to contain within its pores and spaces many particles of salt and sulphur broke and disolvd very small as also a little earth disjoined into the least atoms and dispersed throughout the whole body of the urine if the consistence be thinner than it ought to be as it is seen in clear and waterish urine it is a sign of indigestion and crudity that the aliment is not fully concocted but if the urine be more crass and thick than it ought to be it is a sign the body of the liquor is clogged with preternatural contents but of these elsewhere when we treat of the urines of sick persons hitherto have we spoken of urine in a sound body both as the excrement and sign of concoction rightly performed in the bowels and other vessels  we must take the measures of its quantity from what we drink its citroncolour from salt and sulphur dissolved and incocted in the serum the hypostasis or contents depend upon the filaments elaborated in the mass of blood for the nourishment of the solid parts its consistance is from salt and sulphur together with some particles of earth filling up the pores and spaces of the serous part it remains next that we treat of the urines of sick persons in which likewise the quantity color contents and consistence as also some other accidents offer themselves to our consideration  chap iiii of the quantity and color of the urines of sick persons in a desease or sickly state of body the quantity of urine frequently answers not the necessary proportion of ingested liquids for sometimes there is a defect sometimes an excess in the just measure when the urine is far less than the ingested liquors the reason of the defect is because the serous part stagnates somewhere in the body or is diverted some other way than that of the urinary excretion for it is either  st lodged aabout the bowels and their cavities and sometimes also stays longer than it ought in the stomach by which means it is somewhat distended causing troublesome spitting but more frequently it is lodged in the hollow of the paunch sometimes in the cavity of the breast or head and there usually produces dropsical diseases or  dly the serum stagnates in the vessels and thereby augmenting the mass of blood and nervous liquor greatly perverts their motion or  dly that waterish humor is thrown upon the habit of the body and so creates a swelling of the whole or some parts or  thly and lastly it is obstructed in the urinary passages by a stone or some viscous matter creating pain and convulsions in those parts and a superfluity of serum in the whole body  but when the serum is diverted otherways it often disposes the sick to frequent and troublesome sweats or almost a continual flux the affects therefore which the deficient quantity of urine indicates are swellings and aqueous collections of some bowels also sometimes rheumatick pains sometimes an ill disposition of the genus nervosum sometimes an universal dropsy and phlegmatic tumors and sometimes the stone in the reins and bladder sometimes also the penury of urine is the effect and sign of some other praeternatural evacuation to wit of sweat a diarrhaea or some other immoderate excretion to describe every cause and mode of the office of the serum either as it is in the body or as it is excernd thence were in a manner to bring over hither the whole matter of all the affects for many and diverse are the occasions and circumstances by reason of which the serum is lodged in this or that part and by staying in the body lessens the quantity of urine notwithstanding the principal and most frequent cause of this is not so much the vice of the liver spleen or reins as that of the blood it self  free and plentiful pissing as likewise its tarrying in the body and penurious excretion depend especially upon the temper of the blood and its accension or fermentation in the heart for if the blood be impregnated with active principles  viz spirit sulphur and salt rightly exalted and have a lively ferment in the vessels so that the well loosened complex of the liquor be rightly accended by the ferment of the heart it all in a manner spiritualizeth and by its heat and rapid motion transmits it self without obstruction through every part whatsoever is superfluous and volatile evaporates and while the blood that is rarified and as twere boiling with heat passes the reins that which is the serous part either by reason only the kidneys is as twere its strainer or having in them some coagulated matter is easily separated and as twere precipitated from the rest of the mass of blood it is the same in a manner with the mass of blood what we observe in milk viz while it grows hot and almost boiling it easily curds or coagulates and its serum or whey soon separates by pouring in a little runnet or any sharp sour liquor but if it be cold though you pour in stronger ferments and a considerable quantity of any acid scarce any precipitation follows  therefore if the blood become more cold and watery from an ill constitution of diet so that being less impregnated with active particles its ebullition is more slow it is accended as twere piecemeal in the heart and circulates very slowly and with difficulty in the vessels and running the course of the pores and passages in the flesh and bowels sticks by degrees leaving something of it self behind it whence obstructions and tumors every where accrue  by this means also the blood being feeble and viscous is consequently less sit for precipitation or percolation and does not so readily convey its serous excrements into the kidneys but leaves them every where dispersed in the whole body by reason of the settlement of some humor and difficulty of circulation wherefore in this state those things which much exagitate the blood as exercise swift and frequent motion or as those things which like rennet infused do precipitate as acids and salt preparations do provoke urine more plentifully  sometimes sick persons piss very copiously so that in the space of twenty four hours they evacuate twice or thrice as much urine as they have taken liquids the cause of which effect is diverse and the signification much different if after the diminution of its quantity or suppression of urine if in dropsical affects rheumatisms or other nervous passions or the crisis of fevers plenty of urine naturally or by the use of diuretics freely ensue for the most part it presages the discontinuance of the disease and preternatural indisposition or at least its declension but if as i have often observed without these foregoing and prementiond effects the urine far exceeds the ingested liquids and thence ensue a remarkable debility this indeed portends an ill state an inclination to an atrophy or consumption i have known some women of a slender thin habit of body who sometimes being indisposed for many days together were wont to make in great plenty above what liquids they took a thin watery urine without contents or urinecloud at which time they complained of their strength languishing difficulty of breathing and an inability to motion  i suppose in this case the blood and succus nervosus by an exalted and fluid salt became too acid and consequently unapt to be in the least dissolved in their mixture and were too much disposed to serosities for it is observable that whatever liquids though thick and clammy if kept till sour they presently become more thinn and waterish further it is manifest that those accidental overflowings of urine arise from such a disposition of the blood and humors for the urine has a vinegar smack and such affects as aforementioned are ordinarily cured by chalybeat medicines and not always by common astringents and thickners  now as to the color of the urine of the sick that of sound persons must be the rule and standard by which all the rest ought to be tried and judged  since then the color of theirs who are sound ought to be citron the urine of those that are sick will either be more pale than citron and so white like common water or more deeply tinctured and then generally twil be either of a flame or saffroncolour red green or black in short i will endeavor to appropriate the causes from which each of these alterations proceed and what affects or preparations of diseases they usually indicate  the urine is clear like water when by reason of the indigestive faculty of the stomach the saline and sulphurous particles of our meat are not so well concocted and minutely broke that they can be volatilizd and dissolved in the serum to tincture it so deep as that after all its windings and passages it can bespeak its originals  for liquids that are to be changed into urine by reason they are pressed and driven through secret and very narrow passages as twere by distillation thereby loose their color and consistence which they had when ingested and imbibe nothing from the chyle whose vehicle they are but what is volatile wherefore if by reason of eminent crudity salt and sulphur and other contents be not first volatilizd in the bowels nor after dissolved in the vessels so far as to run the same course with the serum this at last in a manner divested of all is sent out like clear water and that such urines generally want their active principles it is evident because they are longest preserved from putrefaction  such urine in virgins generally signifies a chlorosis or the green sickness in most an ill habit of body or a dropsy in some it is a sign of great crudity and the want of concoction and sometimes also in those who are subject to the stone it preindicates an approaching fit viz while the serum in the kidneys is coagulated by an acid fermenting juice its contents being condensed into a tartarous matter a thin waterish part is only excernd they who for a time let the disease be what it will piss thin and waterish have very often these symptoms difficult and frequent breathing after motion distension about the region of the stomach and as twere a swelling or puffing up after meat the reason of which wholly depends upon want of volatilization in the blood for because its liquor is destitute of active particles rightly exalted viz  spirit sulphur and salt therefore it is not sufficiently accended by the ferment of the heart whereby the whole should presently sally and as twere break forth into a flame but fermenting with difficulty and apt to stagnate or for the most part to settle in the heart it is much oppressed by it wherefore if the blood thus disposed be hastened through the ventricles of the heart by a motion more quick than ordinary because it has not free rarefaction it presently sallies out in a manner all at once therefore there is need of a greater endeavor and more frequent agitation of the lungs to pump it  waterish urines therefore foretell such like crudities in the blood because if they have received in a manner no tincture from the salt and sulphur it is a sign their particles are less dissolved or less volatilizd in the mass of blood  as to the distention of the stomach of which clear urines are both an effect and sign i say for want of a due fermentation the chyle is not all changed into a volatile white substance but like bread not fermented is altered and transmuted into a heavy ponderous mass which is slowly and not without a viscous phlegm accompanying it sent from the stomach whole relics being fixed to the foldings and membranes of the stomach obstruct all its pores and passages so that nothing can evaporate and what is more thin and spirituous cannot be carried to the blood forthwith through secret passages as it ought hence plenty of flatulencies or windiness is engendered which speedily stretches the stomach blowing it up beyond its proportion and since those dreggs by long residence in the stomach abound with a fixed salt they sometimes degenerate into an acid sometimes into a vitrioline or other base heterogeneous matter whence violent pains in the stomach depraved appetite violent heat with frequent thirst sometimes violent vomitings and other very grievous symptoms arise some of which though they argue heat and that in a great degree lurk and lie hid within yet those who are thus affected for want of concoction often make crude and waterish urine we have thus now largely treated of clear urine because the reasons of the rest may be had hence which are pale and thin without color or consistence in those who are sound for the phaenomenons of pale strawcolourd or other colors below citron arise and may be explicated after the same manner we have already said of the waterlike clear urine from the greater or less dissolution and concoction of salt and sulphur in the serum  another kind of urine more pale than citron yet remains not at all thin but thick of a sullied whitish color which is commonly observed children make when their bowels are much troubled with worms the reason of which seems to be because the matter of which worms are ingenderd is a viscous phlegm through indigestion of chyle and want of volatilization heapt up in the bowels which does not readily transmit any tincture to the urine because the matter is fixed after that the same matter putridfying is exalted and volatilizd in a manner and then partly by heat and spirit is formed into worms and that phlegmatic matter being unfit for nourishment it is separated from the blood with the serum and mixed with the urine hence that white color and whitish sediment  sometimes in fevers especially the urines of children grow white the reason of which is because the supply of nutritive juice coming from the chyle to the mass of blood is not rightly assimilated but degenerates into an excrementitious humor a part of which being incocted in the serum gives it a more thick consistence and milkiecolour otherwise than in fevers of the adult where when the heat is more strong and vigorous the mixture of such juice tinctures the serum with a deep red  sometimes also urines appear white from a gonorrhaea flour albus ulcers of the kidneys ureters or urinary passage by reason of the commixture of matter or corrupted seed however it be the white color of the urine is produced by its contents which falling to the bottom the liquor for the most part becomes of a yelowishpale color like as it is seen in the preparation of lac sulphuris where the milkie substance falling to the bottom the liquor swimming above is commonly of a citron color  urines whose color is more intense than citron owe not their appearances only to the more than ordinary dissolution of salt and sulphur but in some measure to the more crass contents in the liquor  the plentiful dissolution of salt and sulphur is performed in the vessels containing the very mass of blood and thence is the tincture derived upon the serum and this for the most part comes to pass two ways  first either by reason of a feverish heat in as much as the blood boiling in the vessels and being more accended in the heart is much weakened in its mixture and therefore the particles of salt and sulphur which are separated by ebullition plentifully impregnate the serum or secondly without a fever when such like sulphurous and saline little bodies which were wont to be sent out at other emunctories are detained therefore being heapt up by little and little in the blood they are commixt with the serum of which there are two particular cases or modes for either the excrements of blood which especially partake of an adust sulphur and ought to be sent forth by the vesicula fellis are retained and so mixing with the serum tincture it with a yellow or the effluviums which are especially of a saline nature and were wont to evaporate by insensible transpiration are retained and by them is the urine tinctured like a lixivium or with a lyelike color  all persons in the jaundise have urine of the frist sort but that of the latter is familiar to the scurvy for in a scorhutick habit the saline particles of blood fall short of volatilization and become fluid wherefore by reason of fixation they evaporate less and being plentifully heaped up in the mass of blood they greatly prevent its mixture and especially impregnate the serum with salt  the contents which augment the color of urine are of two sorts viz either the adust recrements which are the relics of the bloods inflammation or the particles of the nutritive juice degenerated into an unknown matter of which in their proper place hereafter our present task is a particular decyphering every color that is above citron  in the first place the flamecolourd urine appears like the yellowish red vapors in the distillation of spiritus nitri and this is very often found in intermitting fevers frequently in tertians this color arises from a small portion of thin yellow choler mixed with the serum while it is in motion for in this fever there is a sharp and hot distemperature of the blood which burns and in a manner torrifies all the humors and therefore plentifully produces choler  and though this for the most part is sent out by the ductus bilarius notwithstanding since it abounds in the vessels part of it or what is equivalent the adust particles of blood and humors being incocted in the serum tincture it with a deep yellowishred this urine is thin and shining because in this disease almost a continual sweat forces out the excrements of the nutritive juice and the more gross part of the serum to the circumference of the body the saffroncolourd urine which dies linen cloth with the same color is an undoubted sign of the jaundise and it is thus tinctured from yellow choler or salt and sulphur adust and plentifully mixed with the serum for that yellow is necessarily produced by the more than ordinary continual motion and overheat of the blood and nature has designed the vesicula fellis and its passages which are radicated in the liver for discharging the choler from the mass of blood but if this office of the ductus bilarius in conveying the gall be any ways hindered that humor stagnating in the blood and plentifully heapt up there dies the skin blood and urine especially with a yellow tincture  a safftroncolourd differs from a flamecolourd urine because in the last only some part of the thinner in the first a more crass and plentiful part of the gall is incorporated with the urine farther in yellow choler sulphur being long circulated with an accompanying salt is fully dissolved by it and becomes like paint coloring any subject with a saffron tincture like as when common sulphur and the oil of tartar are dissolved together  but that redness which is in urine without the stagnation of choler happens after the same manner as in a lixivium or lie of ashes where the particles of sulphur without any predisposition from those of salt together with them are imbibed in the liquor  in the next place we will treat of red urines which are of a different nature depend upon different causes and many times signify differrent kinds of affects the chief of which and their proper significations well briefly describe first of all the liquor grows red of it self remains in the same condition neither is the color of any part of it altered by subsidence or  dly the deep dye of urine proceeds especially from what is contained in it and after its residence to the bottom it becomes yellowish or less red than before the affects which such urines are wont to signify are especially fevers scurvy and a confirmed consumption  let us consider the reasons of each when the urine which is made red continues so it is either  st of an indifferent consistence and transparent and then it owes its color to salt and sulphur more than ordinarily adust and therefore plentifully incocted in the serum  or  dly such an urine is red as also dark and muddy and besides what particles of salt and sulphur it has some earthy particles are emboyld in it which sticking in the pores and passages of the urine do not all precipitate because the liquor of the urine divested of its fit spirits which would separate and precipitate all parts of a different disposition as it usually happens in wine that has lost its head or been sowerd by thunder in which case the liquor is impregnated with thick and muddy dreggs and for want of due spirits cannot finally clarify and become limpid as before  hence such urine is the worst of signs in fevers because it signifies such a confusion of adust matter in the blood that ought to be separated and yet the vital spirits cannot bring it under and overcome it the urine is sometimes made red because of its contents which falling to the bottom the liquor becomes of another color  now this as it is said above is twofold viz sometimes thin which is the matter or remainder of the adust recrements from the deflagration of the blood sometimes thick viz from the degenerate particles of the nutritive juice both these being torrifyd by the bloods ebullition and being separated are partly sent out by sweat and partly mixed with the serum whose consistence they thicken and enhance its color to wit as long as those contents are held up being enclosed in the pores and passages of the liquor the color appears more deep and the consistence more thick but these being fallen to the bottom the redness and thickness of the liquor are abated the reason of both which shall be assigned hereafter when we assert the causes of clearness darkness and other colors of urines now let us enquire what is the reason of the difference that red urines are wont to be made  fevers the scurvy consumptions and peraps in other affects   st in fevers the liquor of urines is of a eep red through the plentiful dissolution of salt and sulphur whose particles are plentifully ncocted in the serum for while the blood and humors are in ebullition from a febrifick cause y reason of great heat highly inflamed the little odies of salt and sulphur being torrefyd and dust are more dissolved and by incoction in the sum tincture it more deeply as a lixivium or lie of ashes boiled on the fire becomes far more red than if we only proceed by way of inusion  as likewise in fevers the contents of urine often advance its color that is by reason of the intemperature and deflagration of the blood for then both the degenerate particles of the nutritive juice as also another matter like ashes remaining from the calcination of blood are burnt as twere into a red calx which being shut up in the pores of the urine render its color higher and afterward falling to the bottom becomes a red sediment like painters oaker   dly in an inveterate scurvy the urine is often so high colored that it is not exceeded in a violent burning fever which if evaporated or distilled yields plenty of salt with slimy dreggs wherefore it seems evident by this experiment that this high color owes its original to salt principles as was hinted before because in scorbutic cases those salt particles which ought to be volatilizd and sent forth by a constant transpiration are fixed and restrained from their usual motion and therefore are more plentifully heaped up in the affected body this salt aforesaid remaining within with sulphur and earth is diversely coagulated and then plentifully resolved and from this different coagulation and redissolution follows wonderful symptoms of this disease  likewise from these saline particles plentifully dissolved with some tartarous dreggs and diluted with the serum urines become tinctured with adeep and high red besides in this affect when inveterate the course and passages of the liver and vesicula fellis being obstructed and depraved they perform their office worse in separating the adust particles of blood from the rest of the mass which being plentifully loaded with it and dissolved in the serum do the more dye it with a lielike tincure and if those particles of adust sulphur overbalance those of a fixed and scorbutic salt the jaundise is in complication with the scurvy and the urine then dies linen with a saffroncolour  but if they be exceeded by the saline particles only a scorbutic affect is produced in which the urine is highly red but yet will not make yellow linen that it is thus it is highly probable for in dissecting many of those who had frequently made red urine and died of the scurvy it has has been observed that their liver or the vesicu fellis was greatly in fault in some the liver has appeared wholly bloodless and dried like a cows udder in others the vesicula fellis was quite empty in some obstructed with little stones in others again filled with mothery dreggs nor at all bitter but in all those that were so affected a separation of the gall was hindered   dly by reason of salt so dissolved the urines are sometimes red in gouty diseases for besides the arthritik fits in which such urine is often made i have observed in some very painsal affects imitating in a manner a fever with a deep red urine wandering pains sometimes raging in this sometimes in that part so that the afficted patient could scarce stand upon his feet or move a member troubled also with watchings and frequent sweats and likewise with thirst great dryness of the jaws the urine very red with a plentiful sediment yet in the interim twas not evident that there was any great ebullition in the blood that the patient was under any great languor of spirits or headache whereupon i suspected this affect was especially from the genus nervosum chiefly depending upon the exorbitances of a saline rather than a sulphurous principle   ly likewise the urine is red in a confirmed consumption especially if a hectic as it is generally be joined with it the reason of which is if at any time an ulcer has seized the lungs from thence a putrid matter being mixed with the blood in it is circulation causes almost a continual ebullition whereby the sulphurous and saline particles being more plentifully dissolved and incocted in the serum render its liquor red besides by reason the blood is thus contaminated almost all the nutritive juice degenerates into putrefaction and with those recrements the urine being impregnated grows more red and is plentifully stuss d with its contents an evidence of which is that consumptive persons are for the most part hot after meat their whole body being put into a feaverishheat which is succeeded by nocturnal sweats moreover there is in the urines a thick and plentiful sediment viz  the nutritive juice being mixed with the blood and not rightly assimilated causes an ebullition in it and degenerating into some strange matter is partly driven through the skin partly transmitted by urine and partly augments its color and consistence  hitherto have we treated of red urines and every kind of em now hinted at have many degrees of intension and remission for as the causes change in them so in the color and consistence they are either weaker or stronger  as for green or black urine i confess i never saw any that was either exactly green as leeks or black as ink but i think from a very high yellow with a dark or somewhat inky mixture the appearances of greenish or blackish urine may arise which authors usually call green or black urine  but those urines which are thus colored do either constantly remain in the same state for some time and are signs of the blackjaundise or the blood affected with some virulency or the urines are occasionally diversely changed and are sometimes of that and sometimes presently of another color so that i have known hypocondriacal persons wont first to make such urines and then a little after like those of sound persons  as to the former when the jaundise grows very high so that the adust portion of sulphur and salt have a longer continuance in the mass of blood these same by long incoction acquire a color more deep than yellow viz at first greenish and then afterward somewhat black with which the serum is in like manner tinctured for if yellow gall be taken out of the vesicula fellis and put into a bolthead and exposed to the gentle heat of a warm bath it waxes shortly green and afterward by continuance will appear almost as black as ink wherefore in the blackjaundise which is only the yellow by longer continuance advanced into a greater degeneracy there is nothing more usual than an inky urine  further such urines sometimes appear in a malignant fever and the plague as also frequently after the drinking of poison and in these cases are commonly a deadly sign because they argue the blood much corrupted and as twere mortified the spirits being vanquished and the bond of mixture loosed just as when a part in our bodies is ulcerated and afterward perverted into a gangrene or mortification presently the piss which before was waterish white or yellow becomes black wherefore in the aforesaid affects when the urine grows black the serum and blood being wholly vitiated the outward skin is likewise darkened with such a color  urines that are tinctured with a greenish or especially a black color at certain times which often happens to hypocondriacks very likely proceed from the dregs of the bilis atra or the black choler entreasurd in the spleen and then through too plentiful congestion overflowing at sometimes mix with the mass of blood for such matter being often effunded into the stomachs of some men produces greenish or inky vomits as likewise in others the same matter being sucked up by the blood in its circulation may tincture the urine with such like colors  hitherto have we spoken of the colors of urines those that are pale proceed from too much crudity almost all those that are highcolourd arise either from salt or sulphur too plentifully dissolved and sometimes from the adust recrements thoroughly incocted in the serum or from the more crass contents of the urine whether they be the very calx and remainder of the aliment degenerated in concoction or the liquations and mouldrings of the consumptive body or some illaffected part thereof which expressions will be better understood if we explain the manner how suchlike dissolutions and contents may diversely change the color of urine  the causes of different appearances and changeable colors as also of darkness and transparency in urines as in other liquors depend wholly on the different immission and emmission of the rays of light  for if the body of the liquor be thin with open pores and passages that the rays of light may be easily transmitted it is then transparent and clear like fountain water but if the pores of the liquor be stuffed with contents or little bodies swimming in it so that the illuminating rays be refracted and broken in the transmission at last when they appear according to the different modes of refraction and reflection in the as yet diaphanous liquor the color will appear either citron saffron or red  but if the spaces of the pores be yet more possessed so that the light be not at all transmitted from thence darkness will proceed but then if the rays once received be but little or not at all reflected the liquor will appear of a dusky or blackish color but if they be reflected according to the different modes of reflection the appearance will be white ashecolourd or of another kind upon this supposition that as the liquor of the urine is sometimes in a manner almost devoid of salt sulphur and other dissolvables it easily transmits the light sometimes being moderately or much stuftd with suchlike contents it either distorts the incident rays in their passage or wholly imbibes them or lastly reflects them so that from hence it is easy to unfold all the phaenomenons of colors and consistence in urines  it happens frequently that the color of the same urine is much changed for that which is made red being exposed to the air becomes white or of a darkishcolour and then a little time after of a citron color the reason of which appearance seems to be this  this urine when made is red because the pores of the liquor are much possessed with the contents yet as long as those pores are kept open by heat they transmit the rays of light in such manner though diversely distorted that they by way of reflection rebound again  but this urine is no sooner exposed to the cold air but the pores being shut up the position of parts are changed in the contents and therefore the transmission of the rays of light is hindered wherefore the liquor becomes presently dark and as those rays are reflected this or that way the color becomes white dusky or some other color but at last the contents by their weight falling to the bottom the pores being freed easily transmit the rays of light and do less distort them wherefore the color appears not high but citron  from what has been said concerning the color of urines it may appear what is the causes of the different consistence of urines for as the particles of salt sulphur or adust matter or the nutritive juice deprived of a right assimilation are more or less incocted in the serum the urines become more or less thick or thin in their consistence  in the next place it remains we speak of the preternatural contents in urine  chap v concerning the contents in the urines of the sick we acknowledge the contents to be twofold in the urine of the sick viz either universal which proceed from the mass of blood and succus nervosus and respect the habit of the whole body or particular which are the excrements and refuse of some bowel or part illaffected concerning which by and by  these of the former kind which proceed from the habit of the whole body are either natural to wit the filaments making up the nubecula or urinecloud as in sound persons or preternatural which especially are the particles of the nutritive juice degenerated in assimilation making up those more crass bodies of the sediments in urines  and lastly in a fever some adust matter from the inflammation of the blood diluted with the serum is added which augments the blackness of the contents  but these as well natural as preternatural contents of urines are very different as the blood is more or less disorderly or unduly fermented  and likewise as the aliment in the bowels and vessels is diversely concocted and either the superfluities or refuse of the chyle which is made thence are washed off with the serum and if the nutritive juice sent to the blood be not wholly perverted but a great part changed into nourishment for the augmentation of the solid parts then likewise a part of this being mixed with the serum leaves some footsteps of an urinecloud and if that preternatural sediment which is made up of a degenerate or adust matter be yet but little and thin it does not as yet wholly obliterate the appearance of this which is natural  hence in the beginning and declension of fevers and sometimes in a consumption or in a cachexia or an ill habit of body the nubecula or urinecloud is seen though not so perfect but if the greater part of the chyle boiling with the blood through its immoderate heat be perverted into an heterogeneal matter which afterward as hurtful and unprofitable is sent out with the serum the urinecloud forthwith becomes obscure and imperfect also besides that there are many contents in the urines which enhance their color and consistence  such urine which has in it a urinecloud though imperfect if it be kept in a hot place the nubecula only is visible and the rest of the contents being kept in the pores of the urine while enlarged by heat become utterly invisible notwithstanding the same contents the little spaces of the pores being straightened by cold are precipitated and thereupon changing their place and situation rendet the urine dark and troubled obliterating the appearance of the urinecloud such urines are commonly made in the better state of fevers a catarrh cough want of transpiration a caccchymia or the abundance of illhumours in the blood and in most of the higher sort of dyscrafies i e evil complexion or temperature  but if the sickness be so far advanced that the concoction and nutritive juice be wholly changed into putrefaction such like are plainly visible in the urine and that without the appearance of an urine cloud and do signify a great diversity in diseases as they are precipitated diverse ways and make a sediment of diverse kinds as there is a sudden slow or no separation at all of parts and as the matter falling is little or much white red or dusky i shall briefly run through all the material or chief observations concerning this matter  first urine impregnated with such contents sometimes is not precipitated at all unless it be after a long time the body of the liquor dissolving by putrefaction but remains a long time troubled and somewhat dark the little bodies floating all over it the reason of this is either because these contents are too deeply incocted in the serum so that the innate spirits cannot separate the pure from the impure the thick from the thin as is seen in the brewing of beer in which if too much of the mealypart of the malt be commixt the liquor will scarce ever after become clear or likewise the urine remains troubled because it is utterly destitute of spirits which might ferment the parts of the liquor as it is wont to happen in beer that grows sour by reason of thunder or immoderate heat and being loaded with muddy dreggs is seldom or ever rightly depurated again such like urine in fevers is for the most part very dangerous sometimes also it denotes an irrecoverable cachexia and always intimates a very ill sign   dly it sometimes happens that the urine is so impregnated with contents that they begin to precipitate while it is yet hot i have often observed it thus in a lingering fever where the heat is more mild and remiss in which the particles of the thick nourishment are depraved and being less conquered by that heat or less incocted in the serum do more easily fall from its pores like as when common sulphur is boiled in a lixivium if it be removed from the fire before a perfect dissolution the liquor that is at first clear and red because of the sudden precapitation of the dissolved contents forthwith becomes turbid obscure and of a whitish color   dly what usually happens the urine being much impregnated with such like contents as long as it is hot and sometime after appears clear and transparent but when it grows cold by degrees it waxes turbid and as if some infused coagulum or curdling matter had mixed with all its parts is precipitated which notwithstanding if it be kept at the fire or in a hot place grows clear again the reason of which is sufficiently explained before where we spoke of the causes of darkness and transparency   thly after the urine exposed to cold is precipitated in manner aforesaid it may be observed how its contents fall to the bottom for sometimes they fall in a short time and if in the space of two or three hours the liquor grows clear it is a sign the urine is not stuffed nor much impregnated with salt and sulphur hence in the beginning and declension of fevers when the heat is remiss such urine is often made sometimes except in the space of many days such a subsidence of contents will not ensue because the consistence of the urine is thicker than it ought to be therefore it cannot let go its contents out of its embraces so easily that by their gravity they may find the bottom  such urines are generally made in the state of fevers and are the forerunners of an ill crisis   thly the sediments which fall to the bottom are not less differing in this place passing by corruption and blood sand and gravel and certain other deposited parts  for those that are the products of the whole body are for the most part white dusky or like red oker  if the urine after it has stood long be filtered through cappaper such contents are retained and may be plainly examined i have often seen white sediments like chalk sometimes red like armenian bole and without doubt the matter of all is the same viz the recrements of the blood after its inflammation and the nutritive juice depraved in assimilation which as they are concocted in our bodies by heat and diversely perverted they appear likewise in urine under a different color and form as antimony mixed with nitre and more or less calcined produces a calx sometimes red sometimes saffroncolourd sometimes yellow and sometimes dusky  the like reason as it seems may be rendered concerning the sediments of urines which are as twere the calx of a sulphurous and terrestrial matter overburnt by the heat of a fever in the bowels and vessels   thly besides such usual contents in the urine of the sick i have often observed that after the urine had stood sometime in a chamberpot some sandlike matter cleavd to the sides thereof and that under a different figure for sometimes these little bodies are like sands with a rough and unequal surface  sometimes they grow together with ridge and furrow like the chrystals of nitre and are splendent and glistring like ice sometimes i have seen suchlike chrystals stick to the sides of the pot from those who had labored under a dysenteria or bloody flux sometimes in urines when they have stood a while there appears a scumm swimming at top just like tartar when boiled in water that whitish crust coagulated in the surface of the urine is commonly believed to be both fat and oily and is accounted a liquation or melting away of the solid parts those therefore who make this urine are presently pronounced consumptive and very deplorable  but this concretion is only saline and being exposed to the fire is not at all dissolvable but is condensed into a crusty substance moreover both these and the rest of the incrustations of urines are a kind of tartar produced in them by a certain coagulation such a concretion wholly depends on the particles of a fluid and acid salt combined with those of a fixed or alkalizd salt  for in any subject where this commixture of salts of both kinds does happen whether produced naturally or by artificial operation there ensue diverse kinds of coagulations and chrystallizations  wherefore such kind of urine on which there swims a tartarlike scum or in which crystals cleave to the side of the pot or urinal show that the blood is degenerated from its sweet balsamic nature such as is the result of salt volatilizd into an acid and corrosive temper and the fludity and fixation of a saline principle such urine if evaporated leaves great store of salt in the bottom of the vessel the affects of which as it is often observable as i have experienced are spitting of blood an atrophy and an hypocondriacal disposition it is worthy observation whether the vrines of sick persons give a tincture to the chamber pot or not for sometimes in fevers the urine is no sooner put into a glass but presently it darkens its sides with a whitishcloud yet at another time twill not happen so i think the reason of that sullied dye on the glass is because the urine is more impregnated with a dissolved sulphur than its pores can contain in them for every liquor that is too much impregnated with sulphur does the same as it is seen in a lixivium in which common sulphur or antimony has been boiled  likewise every urine if it stands in a glass till it putrefies it tinctures its sides with a cloudyness or some crusty matter sometimes whitish or red or sometimes of another color for the fabric of the urine being loosed by putrefaction the particles being freed from the bond of mixture are fastened and adhere to the glass  now further in the urines of sick persons this happens forthwith because the sul phar is more plentifully dissolved in the serum than can be contained in the pores  now as for the particular contents of urine those indeed are manifold and may proceed from diverse places and parts yet very frequently from diseases seated about the kidneys bladder and urinary passages sometimes happening from an ulcer in the liver spleen lungs or other bowels or because some preternatural humors are heaped up in those places and overflow through their superabundancy hence some extraneous or foreign matter is transmitted into the mass of blood and thence into the serum yet this happens but seldom for when n impostume is broke within for the most part it sends its matter into the cavity of the bowels from which there are no passages to the urinary conduits  besides the mass of blood being impregnated with impurities nature does not presently endeavor to send them out by urine but often by swet expectoration throwing out of pimples wheals or tumors and by other ways of excretion it is hence commonly observed that other contents of urines besides what we have spoken of above are especially sent from the kidneys or their appendages the chief of which are sand stones blood purulent matter little pieces of flesh small skins or mealy sediments which for the most part signify either some great ulcer or the stone or both together seated beyond the emulgent vessels  it is usual with some to piss little grains of sand of a red color in great quantity some of those are troubled with the stone in the kidneys and often have those nephritick fits yet i have known others void gravel a long time without pain or any other grievous symptom  all urines if they stand long in an earthen glazed vessel sometimes leave such a gravel sticking to the sides or bottom viz the volatilesalt of urine is coagulated with the sixdsalt of the metal so when sal armoniacum mixed with the silings of steel vitrioline or sea salt is sublimed the elevated flowers grow eminently red  wherefore it is probable that suchlike red grains of sand are produced in the kidneys because the volatile salt of urine is coagulated with the dregs of some tartarous matter left about the meanders or windings of the reins and thereupon is that sandy matter made which forthwith is washed away by the serum in its passage therefore those grains of sand which are so often made are not the piecemeal mouldrings of some greater stones as it is vulgarly believed but the extemporary products of the blood and serum while they pass the channels of the kidneys  how stones are produced in the bladder and reins is not the enquiry of this place fully to discuss yet beyond all peradventure rather by coagulation than exsiccation or calefaction  i have observed some men afflicted with the stone in the bladder who after they had made water were wont with much labor and grief to void a more than ordinary viscorus juice which was presently condensed into a scaly matter the smell of it was like that of a lixivium and it was of the same consistence too as that evaporated to a thickness which liquor when it becomes more crass and is exposed to the cold forthwith does concrete into a saline crustiness  lesser stones pass the urinary passages and are ejected with little or no difficulty but it is better that those that are great rest quietly in their dens  the places in which they are usually produced are the crooked passages and winding meanders of the reins from whence those that are less fall into the bladder and if they be not ejected from thence grow very great  i once saw many somewhat large stones about the sides of the bladder betwixt its membranes shut closely up these without doubt while less were sent from the reins and detained in the passages of the ureters that creep between the tunicks of the bladder and there by degrees were augmented in bulk the poor gentlewoman who was thus troubled long before her death avoided a membrane thick and large filled with a sandy matter which as it after appeared by dissection of her body was a part of the inner tunick of her bladder fretted and broken asunder by the stones that had been shut up there  it is ordinary with those who have the stone to emit both blood and purulent matter frequently with their urine for the fleshy part of the kidneys being fretted asunder with a stone that is greater than ordinary and being very rough and unequal the mouths of the veins and capillary vessels are unlocked from which the blood issuing tinctures the urine  by this means a solution of continuity in the reins is begun and an ulcer very frequently follows whereby corruption and matter are mixed with the serum and make a plentiful and stinking sediment in the urine after that a continued pus proceeds from the ulcer and large effusions of blood very often follow and the very flesh of the kidneys being corroded and eaten away by degrees is cast out by urine i remember formerly an ancient good woman who for a long time voided blood in her urine every day in great quantity moreover she usually emitted great plenty of pieces of flesh as twere little gobbets and the fistulous ends of corroded vessels when she mad water so that twas suspected one of her kidneys was quite destroyed by this means yet afterward by a decoction of vulnerary herbs made acid with spirit of vitriol this emission of blood by urine was stopped and the woman grew sound and lived many years after  i have heard of another gentlewoman who at first was wont to void both blood and corrupted matter with some little membranes for a long time but after that sanguinary pissing ceasing she made for many years a waterish urine with a plentiful sediment white and like purulent matter falling to the bottom of the chamber pot afterward when that sediment was wanting a feverish distemper with wandering pains here and there a deliquium and languor of strength and other illnatured symptoms ensued but when this patient was brought into great danger of death a tumor rising in her side about the seat of the left kidney being brought to suppuration a copious eruption of matter freed her yet the hollow and sinuous ulcer in that place sweating out a thin matter remained as long as she lived which sometimes being healed suddenly broke forth again after that in the space of less than two years this illustrious lady having labored under an ischuria or a suppression of urine for the space of fourteen days died apoplectick her body being opened the left kidney was utterly gone and in its place grew a membranous substance cleaving to the loins enfolding the extremities of the ureters and other vessels yet though some footsteps of the ureter did remain twas without any orifice into the cavity of its passage  moreover an ichor or serous matter sweating out of the orifices of the emulgent arteries was carried into the outward and sinuous ulcer  the other kidney was very much obstructed with a gravelly matter and little stones besides also about the top of the ureter a stone was fastened about the bigness of a large filbertnut and its extremity was adapted for the passage or cavity of the ureter and so firmly as twere rammd into it that it exactly shut up its orifice as in the nature of a stopple and hindered all the passages of the urine  a corrupted matter not only from the reins but also from the bladder and urinary passages in those who are ulcerated is deposited in the urine as also sometimes from the genital vessels glandulae prostatae and from certain little neighboring tubes corrupted seed or some other purulent matter is voided with the urine  sometimes also the albae mulrieum fluxiones and menstruous blood mixing with the urine produce preternatural sediments in it which ought therefore to be diligently examined and accurately distinguished from the purulent and sanguinary urines aforementioned  in the urines of sick persons white and plentiful contents made up of very little bodies which after settlement filling the liquor above half way making it white and darkish while the rest in the upper region of the chamber pot is thin and clear such is called a mealy sediment because indeed it resembles water mixed with meal and of this it is doubted whether it proceeds from the whole mass of blood or from the urinary vessels  it is observable that in the stone of the bladder such urines are for the most part made and sometimes also because a greater stone possesses the reins for without some affect in the kidneys such a sediment in the urine is never seen wherefore this is always accounted an undeniable sign of the stone and it seems to depend wholly upon some sort of juice or curdling humor heapt about the external parts of the stone for where a stone is fixed in the reins or bladder there the nutritious humor is perverted from assimilation and degenerates into a more crass filthy substance like the ichor in an issue that by reason of the pea lodged therein being changed into thick matter is more plentifully excerned and that filthy thick substance being carried off with the scrum makes up this sediment of the urine  chap vi of passing judgment on the urines of the sick hitherto concerning the anatomy of urines in which their elementary and constitutive principles together with their chief accidents to wit color consistence and contents as well those that might be in them naturally and essentially as those that are wont preternaturally to happen to them by reason of the body being illaffected hence it is not very difficult for any to bring this hypothesis to practice and to pass judgment upon vrines by a right examination of the urinal for by what has been said it is manifest of what parts the diseases are discoverable by inspection of urine and what the urine signifies in every particular of them concerning this subject some authors have sufficiently treated wherefore i shall pass over this matter more briefly  although the principal matter of the urine viz the serum does pass by every region of the body and circulates together with the blood through every part yet it discovers not the state and diseases of them all but of those only to which it owes its natural perfection and original or from which it receives some alteration wherefore in some sort it discovers the action and temper of those bowels which serve for concoction and besides it hints at the motion and temper of the blood and humors in the vessels but that any should pretend to guess and pronounce a pain in the head an ulcer in the throat or any other affect of another part from whence nothing is communicated to the serum by the urinal only he will rather suggest to us a symptom of his ignorance than one of the disease  the urines that are brought from sick persons sometimes perfectly resemble those of the sound and then they give no light to the disease or part affected but upon inspection something negatively may be said that the patient is free from a fever and that as to his stomach and concoction of nourishment they are not very bad wherefore except he be inclinable to a consumption or labor under an ulcer or some other disease of solution of continuity the affect whatever it be is not very dangerous or difficult to cure but yet i would not have him say any thing rashly nor proceed so far from whence he can have no commendable retreat for it has sometimes happened in the most grievous affects to wit in a malignant fever when the patient lay very dangerously sick his strength greatly dejected the pulse weak and unequal an eruption of spots and other very ill symptoms accruing that notwithstanding all these accidents the urine has been laudable like that of sound persons as to the color consistence and hypostasis so that in such a case the physician having only a sight of the urine will err grossly as to the prognostic wherefore except other symptoms coindicate credit is scarcely to be given to the single testimony of the urine that sometimes it thus happens in the plague and malignant fevers proceeds from this reason because the blood is corrupted in those diseases many times without any great ebullition and as twere silently so that although its serum be affected with a certain kind of coagulation yet because at the same time the blood does not produce any heap of adust matter by its intense inflammation but is little or not at all altered from its wonted crasis or tenor hence i say the urine that sometimes cannot carry with it any such adust recrements in the most dangerous affects becomes a perfect cheat besides many times in such an inflammation when the ebullition of the blood is very great whatever excrementitious matter is heaped together in its mass it is presently carried to the brain and genus nervosum wherefore the serum is usually freed from preternatural contents therefore except in these cases when the urines are highcolourd turbid and without any sediment there is no reason why the waterprophet should much stick in making his prognostic  as often as the vrines of sick persons are not like those of sound men either something natural is deficient or something preternatural is superfluous or both together may happen first color consistence contents and quantity may be defective if the color be more remiss than what it ought to be if very pale it discovers crudity and want of spiritualization viz because the nutritive juice is neither so rightly concocted or exalted in the bowels and vessels that the salt and sulphurous particles in sublimation together may follow the distribution of the serum as twere in distillation so far as wholly to cleave to it and tincture it wherefore upon the sight of such an urine thou may and that without folly guess at the following symptoms to wit that there is an oppression and heaviness in the stomach want of appetite hardness of digestion drowsiness a difficulty of breathing frequent palpitation of the heart in any exercise more than ordinary a pale countenance swelling of the feet and belly and that there is danger of falling into if he is not already in a cachexia or else a dropsy and if the person is one of the fair sex that she is or will be affected with a depravity of appetite or the green sickness but if in a fever the color of urines be abated without a crisis it is a sign that the fermentative matter or the adust recrements of the blood are excluded from its reception and fixed somewhere else which happens for the most part in the brain and then such urines commonly prognosticate a delirium or sometimes a pleurisy in nephritick persons a sudden alteration of the urine into a palecolour and waterish foretells an approaching fit of the stone  a pale and plentiful urine often declares a too great dissolution of salts by which serosities are sent from the whole body and especially from the nervous parts as twere in a certain inundation such an excretion is sometimes wholesome as twere critical when the superfluities happen only to be sent forth sometimes symptomatical and brings a great weakness because then the nutritious juice and other profitable humors are sent out together with it  if the consistence be thin and the liquor pale it argues crudity and want of spiritualization or a disposition to a nephritick paroxsym as aforementioned or else it proceeds from too large a potation of drink but if the color be flaming it is a sign of an intermitting tertian  if there be no contents and the urine pale it is a sign of inconcoction and a cachectick affect of the body but if the color be citron and the urine of an indifferent consistence without any nubecula or urinecloud you may suspect the sick person to have accustomed himself to too much exercise and hardlabour or is frequently troubled with nocturnal sweats or paradventure is in a consumption or inclinable to it but if the urine be daily made in a less quantity than is meet unless there be a more than ordinary plentiful sweating it is a sign the blood is not sufficiently discharged of lis serum and therefore of necessity it becomes more pale and waterish and at last a cachectick disposition or else an anasarca or dropsy of the whole body follows but if it be stopped suddenly and voided with pain and difficulty it is a sign of some affect belonging to the kidneys or bladder   dly something superfluous is sometimes added to the urine viz the color is sometimes augmented when in the mean time the consistence and contents are in their due order and then there is a suspicion of a disposition to a fever or an hectic begun perhaps some evident cause forerunneth as great heat from bathing drunkenness or immoderate exercise which might overheat the blood or some great cold was unwarily taken whereupon ensued a closure of the pores and consequently want of transpiration if the urine be saffroncolourd and give that dye to linen cloth the disease is undoubtedly the jaundise but if it be of an intense red without a fever for the most part it argues a scorbutic or hypocondriack affect although the color and hypostasis be both as they ought yet preternatural contents are often lodged in the urine therefore when it grows cold it is turbid and leaves a sediment sometimes white and then there is a suspicion that the blood is filled with many impurities as likewise the stomach is loaded with an excrementitious matter or troubled with worms sometimes the sediment is red which commonly happers by reason that transpiration is hindered and ostructed to which a fever if not a consumption may owe its original although the urine be in a natural state yet sometimes more than ordinary thick contents are in it which argues that some parts about the urinary passages are either ulcerated or suffer some other way whence purulent matter fluxus albus contaminated seed or such like are mixed in the urine you may therefore easily discover by asking the patient how he is in this or that place which is the place affected and so you may be ascertained of the nature of the affect by recollecting what disease the sediment of such urines will show  when urine has stood for some time and a white and plentiful sediment appears in it it is not easy at the first sight to discover whence it proceeds whether from the whole mass of blood or from some particular bowel appropriated to the preparation of the serum or sperma for the impurities of the blood succus nervosus falling to the bottom of the chamber pot in a mealy appearance are often wont to make the physician suspect a fluor albus or a gonorrhaea likewise the contents of the urine which proceed from the urinary parts are to slight in a manner the same with those which are emitted from the spermatick vessels among these doubts least the waterprophet from a rash confidence not only tell uncertainties for realities but falsities for undeniable truths thus may he search the difference of such like vrines if the contents be universal and their intimations applicable to the whole mass of blood for the most part presently after making of water except sometimes by chance in a critical evacuation of urine these because they are of a more thin substance are utterly invisible afterward when the urine proves cold and begins to separate the contents descend slowly to the bottom and after they have settled in the chamber pot being heated again their appearance totally revanish but if those white sediments owe their originals to some particular spring they thicken and make the urine very turbid though newly made and are presently precipitated to the bottom and do not at all disappear by heat if warmed again now to find out to what particular vessel such contents are to be ascribed it is easy to discover by other circumstances   dly the urine is sometimes wholly altered from its natural state the color and contents which ought to be in it are deficient and other accidents are deposited in their room and then it is a sign the whole body is distempered and the concoction is depraved in the bowels and vessels then may you say the sick person is in a fever and also by asking questions you may learn and forthwith pronounce that he is troubled with thirst great heat want of appetite watchings and other symptoms deducible from hence by consequence  it sometimes happens that the urine falls short of its natural state yet does not at all indicate the affect of which the patient complains and it either shows the causes of the disease or the consent of another part with the affected part as if any one should complain of a violent headache or trembling of the heart and should make a waterish urine this does not denote the very affects but only the crudity of the stomach as also an obstruction of the spleen and neighboring bowels which may be the cause of those affects i say in this case the primary indications in the method of cure are to be taken from the urine viz we must use neither cephalic not cardiack remedies but either emetick cathartick or deoppilative medicines and especially chalybeats sometimes the urine is vitiated yet its indication utterly disagreeth with the affects of which the sick person complains for example if any in a coma or a lethargy make red urine filled with preternatural contents its inspection excellently suggests coindications to wit that we use not remedies too hot but temperate the principal use of waterjudgment is in observing the state and progress of every disease as also the critical alterations toward health or death for in chronical affects where the physician sees the urine every day he may know from hence by what degrees the disease or sickness is every day augmented what time purgatives or alteratives will be most fit and what other medicaments will be most suitable hence may he observe whether nature prevails over the disease or no and hence may the most certain prognostics be made of the hope or danger of recovery viz how the signs of concoction or crudity appear in vrines hence in acute diseases may the state and height of a fever be best foreseen at what time the crisis and with what success it may be hoped for when seasonable to evacuate and when to give restoratives and cordials  physicians ought to observe with as much assurance and diligence the phaenomenons of urines for the fit season and most proper method of administering physic as mariners their seacompass to steer their course by let this which is already delivered concerning urinejudgment suffice which is not a collection from the empty traditions of mountebancks but consonant to right reason and truth i know besides that quacks and other bold pretenders almost every where scatter innumerable rules and false preceps of waterprophesy insomuch that if they look but on the urinal they pretend as if they could divine whether it be a man or woman that is sick how long the patient has been ill what disease he is sick of whether the disease will end in life or death whether the party be amorous or sad whether a woman be with child or no and if with child foretell whether boy or girl and many other ridiculous stories in which by using these empty conjectures and by their confidence they impose on credulous minds or what is more frequent with them make private and subtle inquiry other ways into the state of the matter and then falsely ascribe that knowledge to the inspection of urine  chap vii concerning the examination of urines and the different manner of trial though commonly the trial and inspection of urine be but simple viz most quacks and mountebanks immediately after they have put the water into a glass shake it and then forthwith pass their judgment yet the matter seems a little more intricate to those who heartily design the welfare and health of the sick and concerning this waterinspection there are some observable circumstances which if omitted nothing certain or that may be indeed a directory in practice can be learnt from the urinal moreover in some affects besides inspection of the glass there are other methods of trial by which what is hidden and in the dark in relation to urines is made manifest whence some who endeavored a more accurate waterjudgement have successfully brought in fashion the evaporation and artificial precipitation of urines  wherefore we will briefly speak of the right manner of urineinspection and in some cases bow they may differently be resolved into their first principles  when the urine of the sick person is offered to the physician if it has stood sometime before in the glass and if the liquor be transparent the nubecula formed and if the rest of the contents fall to the bottom there is nothing further wanting but that forthwith the prognostic be pronounced but if the water be newly poured out into the vrinal or be before troubled by shaking together you must stay till the confused parts be again separated and recover their due places of settlement but if the liquor being filled with contents its pores being shut up with cold become turbid and muddy let the glass be kept in a hot place till the urine clear again and afterward let it be placed for some time near the fire so long till the preternatural contents to wit either the thinner be reimbibd by the pores when enlarged by heat or the more thick fall to the bottom and if the filaments which make the urinecloud if there be any be collected together in the middle region or a little beneath then from hence twill appear what is the nature of and what kind of predominancy the disease has and likewise in fevers the degree of heat and effervency the concoction of the nutritive juice or its depravation as also the heaping up of adust matter in the blood and its separation begun or wholly frustrated will also be somewhat more manifest by intimation from the urine wherefore after this manner must you proceed when urine is brought from far whole particles being greatly troubled by such shaking except they be kept sometime in a hot place will not easily recover their right position but if you visit the patient often at his own house twill be convenient that the urine newly made be put into an urinal and placed near some heat and while it leisurely grows hot every part without any perturbation will be disposed of after the best manner of settlement  after that urine is thus nakedly and as twere without its vail presented to the sight the next caution is least that some of its phaenomenons only accidentally contracted and not properly belonging to it impose upon the physician which is wont to happen sometimes through diverse alterations proceeding from the food that is eaten of which this especially consists and then the color and scent are variously changed beyond nature and the physicians expectation for indeed there is an error sufficiently common when the urine by ruburb saffron or the seed of lvendercotton and other things of the like tincture ingested by the mouth growing yellow and giving that dye to linen is thence believed to be an undoubted sign of the jaundice sometimes we likewise suppose though falsely that the urine shows a feverish distemper when highly tinctured wirh a deep red by the broth of pease or a decoction of madder or other liquids of the like nature  it often happens that the high color of urine by a thin small liquor copiously drank is abated and by a stronger drink and more hot nourishment is raised which accidental causes except a physician know he is necessitated to pass a false judgment upon the bare sight of urine  when therefore without any manifest cause the color of vrines is changed the manner of diet must be inquired into so that when the alteration proceeds from what is ingested it may not rashly be ascribed to the disease a question may be raised here why since most things taken in at the mouth before they be transmuted into urine wholly lose their innate colors there are yet some others which being eaten bequeath such a lasting tincture to the serum that they run through the windings of all the passages without any alteration  the reason of which is solely this some mixed bodies have particles of immutability of color which make up their composition so subtle and exceeding volatile that these bodies ingested though in a  ittle quantity color the whole mass of chyle and then the nutritive juice that is conveyed to the blood ascends colored and its vehicle to wit the serous part is sent out always tinctured  it is obvious to every one who sometimes smells his own to know what scent sound urines have viz because when newly made the sulphurous and saline particles are closely bound together in the liquor and then it is not very ingrate but when it has stood sometime so that from the solution of the mixture the sulphur edged with salt begins to exhale it has a very noisome stinking scent besides we may observe that vrines new made sometimes smell sweet like violets and sometimes smell very strong and stinkingly  the first depends neither upon a sound nor unsound state of the body but is only produced by those things that are ingested turpentine nutmegs and some other aromaticks though of a different nature or operation taken inwardly give a sweet scent equally alike to the urine whereof this seems to be the reason in such like bodies very many particles of a purer sulphur that is more spirituous have the predominancy in the mixture and though blended with the serum cannot be contained in it but forthwith when the urine is made break their bond of mixture and those alone not accompanied with other stinking particles of the urine sally forth and thereupon diffuse a scent sufficiently grateful which though it be the result of different ingestibles yet always smells violetlike because all those sulphurous particles are freed in digestion from other adjuncts of the same concrete body neither are they infected with others from the urine  as for a very ingrate stinking urine that sometimes proceeds from an ulcer about the kidneys bladder or urinary passages sometimes it likewise proceeds from a more than ordinary hot distemperature of the reins or the whole body for when sulphur is too deeply incocted in the serum its particles being edged with those of salt because less closely combined do forthwith exhale and very offensively smite the organs of smelling besides urine sometimes has its graveolent or stinking scent from what is eaten for garlicky sparrowgrass the balsom of sulphur syder rhenishwine and many other ingestibles cause a stinking urine if the reason of these be required i answer those things that cause a stinking scent in urine likewise provoke it in a more plentiful manner wherefore it appears and is hence demonstrable that the assumption or taking of such things precipitates the blood and abundantly hastens the emission of the serum and when that after this manner is abruptly disunited from the mass of blood the compage of the liquor is rendered loose neither are the parts exactly mixed wherefore the compage of the urine before it is sent out of the body being thus loosed and dissolved as soon as it is made the more crass and sulphurous particles which are linked together with salt do presently exhale or breath forth and so diffuse a very ill sent for the urine that is thus altered by what is taken inwardly seems very like a lixivium in which antimony or common sulphur is boiled and an acid afterward instilled for in this decoction as also in such an urine the compage of the liquor being destroyed the sulphurous little bodies break forth and attaque the organs of sensation with a noisome savor  but if any curious searcher of urines will go beyond the trial of sight and smell he may readily by several operations resolve them into their several parts and at twere anatomize them to the life and thence deduce physical directions of great consequence  for in some chronical diseases where the ill contemperaments of the blood are exactly to be searched that the proportion and temperature of the salt and sulphur in it may be rightly found out twill be convenient sometimes to evaporate or distill the urine as also something may be learned by precipitating or separating them by putrefaction i knew an honest woman grievously afflicted with a perfect lepra or scaly deformity of her skin who usually every day scraped off a great quantity of branlike or scaly matter her urine being evaporated left behind it a crusty salt sediment very much like that excrement of the skin sticking to the sides of the vessel formerly i evaporated the urine of a gentlewoman who was greatly afflicted with convulsive motions and distension of the muscles the quantity of the saline and tartarous matter that remained in the bottom did exceed the half of all the liquor in weight by these means it appears we may easily find out the proportion of a saline principle in the blood and humors now whether that salt is volatilizd or fixed above measure the distillation of the urine will manifest for if the spirit so called be plentifully exhaled from the urine and if the salt also ascends in the glassalembick it is a visible sign of volatilization but if the contrary it argues the fixation of the salt as the evaporation and distillation of urine shows the power of a saline principle so the precipitation and putrefaction discover the sulphur and more crass contents of urines as twere in weight and measure  as to the first though the urine be a salt liquor and full of contents yet because its saline particles are not as it is usual in other menstruums either wholly in a state of fixation or fluidity but for the most part volatile therefore it is not presently precipitated by the pouring in of any thing that is salt the spirit of vitriol and other acids do nothing the salt of tartar makes a little perturbation but the dissolution of allom in it because it very much binds its spaces presently and that very much troubles the whole liquor forcing all the contents of the liquor or urine out of their places and renders them visible whereupon by this means without the tedious process of settling you may know how much sulphurous and terrene matter the mass of blood as its dregs imparts to the serum the putrefaction of vrines is wont to exhibit every particle of every kind yet more distinct and as twere separately ranged for if the urine stand in a glass unmoved for many days it is much altered in color scent and consistence for the color is more intense and high the smell ingrate and very stinking the consistence more thick and very often it acquires in its surface a dark and sometimes a blackishblew color as also a thick and plentiful sediment in the bottom of the vessel and often a sandy crust on the sides or a whitish or ashcolored tartar  by such phaenomenons since urines putrify sooner or later and thereupon are more or less altered from their former state we may guess what is the proportion of salt or sulphur and which predominates likewise a true judgment may hence be made concerning the quantity of the terrene or earthy matter  chap viii urocritica or the general signs of urines in most diseases and what those signs prognosticate when judgment is to be passed on urine it must not be shook together as quacks generally do but if it be far brought or much confused any other way let it forthwith be put into a thin clear urinal placed in the sun or the clearest light you can and then permit it to subside for the space of one at least if not two or three hours that its separation may be rightly made and then every part will distinctly appear to view in the next place you must diligently examine the color consistence and contents of the urine whence you may fairly pronounce a true and perfect vrocriterium or judgment upon the urine  wherefore that you may the more readily descant upon this matter i shall now describe the most general colors consistence and contents of the vrines in most diseases according to the several assertions of some authors hereafter mentioned and which for the most part i have by my own observation found very true and if any examine this matter accurately and rightly as it ought he will undoubtedly find great satisfaction therein but according to the common practice from an immediate coagitation or bare inspection very little or nothing of the disease can be discovered and consequently nothing certain can be pronounced yet after a diligent examination of every distinct part of the urine it may then be well shook together or warmed upon a fire if any desire to know what color it had when newly made  and where the patient is visited every day it is necessary that the physician should consult the chamber pot as soon as the urine is first made if conveniently it may be before any separation is begun that by observing the color and consistence when new made and well remembering the experiments made by the urinal he may from frequent practice guess in a great measure while the urine is hot at some of the contents and what kind of hypostasis or sediment will happen after a just separation of the urine  i shall now submit the following observations to the impartial judgment and censure of every honest and ingenious practitioner  thin urine like clear water if the urine appears thin and white like clear water it shows the defect of the digestive faculty obstructions a cachexia an oppression at stomach want of appetite the green sickness or else a dropsy such thin and watery urines in an obstinate disease are very pernicious because such urines are signs of an extreme crudity for either these urines do show the choleric matter to be carried up into the head whence arises phrensy and madness which is confirmed by hippocrates aph    sect   where he says if the urine appears white and perspicuous it is dangerous especially if it come from such as are in a phrensy or they signify very great crudities which portend either death or a long disease for nature requires a long time to expel that extreme crudity that these thin white clear and watery vrines are always bad is also confirmed in cap xliii lib   petri poterii de febribus page     de urinis  vrina quae alba funditur inquit atque pellucida mali est ominis atque potissimum in phreneticis aquosae malae sunt vrinae ob debilitatem coctricis facultatis tenues vero and albae valde malae in intermitting fevers or gentle and diuturnal a thin urine denotes great obstructions of the spleen liver mesentery and other like parts through which the urine being strained becomes so thin and watery  that urine which comes from the body thick muddy and troubled but becomes afterward of it self clear and limpid is good for it portends the victory of nature separating things heterogeneous and expelling that which is injurious to her and that so much the more if after the separation the thicker part settle in the bottom white smooth and equal  thick muddy urine without separation a thick muddy urine which so remains that being put to the fire will not clear up is a very evil and bad sign for such urine says galen in aph  0 sect   if the strength of the body be great shows that the disease will be of long continuance but if the strength be much diminished it portends the death of the patient for it is caused by a multitude of thick and crude humors with which much wind being mixed the urine is thereby agitated and troubled so that if the strength be much wasted there is great danger lest it be suffocated by the superabundance of such humors but if there be any considerable strength remaining much time is required to discuss those humors this thick and turbid urine continuing so without separation for some days is a very dangerous sign in a fever  when the urine is highly tinctured with a deep and intense red red urine it is a certain indication of a feverish distemperature for it shows an extraordinary heat and inflaming disposition in the liver or stomach or midriff by which no concoction but rather an adustion or scorching of the humors is caused it this high colored red urine be voided thin as commonly it is from a great scorching and adustion and if it so continues for some time it is a very evil sign for if the body be weak it portends death but if the body be in any reasonable strength it signifies a prolongation of the disease or a diversion of the humor into the lower parts  though red urine be the common sign of fevers in general yet it also indicates a consumption for in a phthisis pulmonalis from the hectic heat it is very frequently emitted red if the urine be of a reddish brown without a fever redish brown it shows a scorbutic or hypocondriack affect especially the latter if it has a tartarous scum swimming upon it scum like tartar which is also sometimes seen in the urine of consumptive persons and of those who are troubled with spitting of blood  flamecolour as the flamecolourd or yellowish red shining urine is commonly made in intermitting fevers especially tertians so likewise the saffron colored urine which dies linen cloth of the same color saffron color is vulgarly known to be an undoubted sign of the yellow jaundise as is thus confirmed in the processus integri dris sydenham page    de jectero urina crocea et pannum immersum eodem color inficiens morbum icterum indigitat  sometimes but not common in the black jaundice a very black urine is voided black urine and if such appear in an acute disease it is very dangerous  for it signifies an extraordinary scorching up of the humors causing them to degenerate into deep melancholy which produces deadly affections  and if these black urines are also thin they are so much the worse because they signify a greater crudity hence hipocr in   epid says that thin black urine and made in a little quantity which appeared at the beginning of burning fevers was one of the signs by which they were wont to portend certain death but whether they come forth in a great or small quantity these black and thin urines in acute diseases are always mortal as also those which appearing at first black turn afterward into thin and watery i e clear and transparent  lastly worst of all are the black urines with a blacksediment of which galen black sediment   de cris cap    thus discourses worst of all is that urine which is totally black so that i have seen no man escape that ever made such water yet it is less pernicious if the sediment be only black and still less dangerous if only that which is in the middle be black and much less it is to be feared if the cloud appears only of that color and thus another author urinae nigrae a calore adurente malae censentur and again viris and mulieribus urinae nigrae pessimae sunt pueris vero aquosae  white gravel if white gravel does issue forthwith the urine it does signify that the patient has or shall have the stone ingenderd in the bladder and there is pain about those parts  mealy urine red sand or small stones if the urine appears mealy or has large red or yellow sand or small stones at the bottom it is an undoubted sign of the stone in the kidneys or bladder and is attended if in the kidneys with great pain in the small of the back a certain obscure itching at the kidneys and the sense of a weight or heaviness at the loins a sharp and pricking pain in moving or bending the body a numbness of the thigh of the same side by reason of the compression caused by the stone of the nerves descending out of the vertebrae of the loins into the thigh but when the stone is in the bladder the fundament and whole perineum is pressed as it were with a heavy weight especially if the stone be of any bigness a troublesome and pricking pain runs to the very end of the yard and there is a continual itching of that part with a frequent and needless desire to make water the urine coming away drop by drop with a most grievous tormenting pain the cause of so great torment is the frequent striving of the bladder to expel the stone wholly contrary to the nature thereof whereto by sympathy the expulsive faculty of the guts and all other parts of the belly come as it were for supply  sediments like whites of eggs the sediment of the urine is gross and viscid and sometimes like the whites of eggs  black gravel sometimes black gravel subsides in the urine which is produced chiefly of a melancholy humor superabounding  note that if the gravel of what kind soever come away and the patient find no ease it is a certain indication that the stone is confirmed but if the pain goes off after the gravel is voided it is a sign that the stone is broken and mouldreth away  note also if the urine be very pale and waterish in the stone it shows an approaching fit that the urine is first clear thin and voided in a small quantity or sometimes bloody in the stone is confirmed in the praxis barbettiana page  0  thus urina primum clara tenuis and pauca cruentavi postea vero aliquid fundum petit and tandem arenulae aut lapilli excernuntur in dolor nephritico but it is said also in the same place in colicis vero urinae ab initio crassiores excernuntur fiuntque  those who labor under the cholick make a very thick water in the beginning by which a cholick and a nephritick pain are distinguished and so continues during the paroxysm  this consistence of urine in the cholick when it is first made i e in the beginning of the cholick fit is also confirmed in the processus integri dris sydenham page    in colica inquit urinae ab initio crassiores existunt  bloody urine bloody pissing is a voiding of blood together with the urine arising from the heaping up of the same in the bladder and when the urine thus mixed is expelled it does not shine but has the color of water in which the flesh of beasts new killed is washed if the blood proceeds from the kidneys it is plentifully and exquisitely mixed with the whole urine that being as twere diluted with it it is thin ruddy liquid and settles without clotting together it arises either from the anastomosis or opening of the veins of some vessel in them and then it is plentifully made and highcolourd or from the corrosion of a vessel and then the blood is voided in a lesser quantity especially at the beginning or by a diapedesis  i e an eruption of the blood from the thinness of the vessels and then the urine is highly died with a redcolour and is thus also sometimes by a wound of the ureters from stones passing through them  if any one piss blood on a sudden it is a sign there is some vein of the kidneys broken namely if mere and pure blood and without any external cause this is intimated by hippocrates cos of blood aph    sect   and aph  0 of the same sect if any piss blood or clots of blood and make his water by drops having pain about the hypogastrium perinaeum or pecten then the places about the bladder are diseased namely all the parts belonging to the bladder and not the bladder only  the signs of an ulcer of the kidneys are purulent matter puulert matter howsoever mixed with the urine never evacuated by it self but always flowing forth with the urine and residing at the bottom of the chamber pot with a sanious and red sediment small fibers of flesh fleshy and as it were bloody fibers which fibers are part of the reins or kidneys and are a manifest sign of their being ulcerated swimming up and down in the urine the smell of the filth is not so great as that which flows from the ulcerated bladder because the kidneys being of a fleshy substance do far better ripen and digest the purulent matter than the bladder which is nervous and bloodless this or the ulcerated kidneys and the next of the ulceration of the bladder you may read in pareys surgery page  0   the signs of an ulcer in the bladder are a deep pain in the sharebones the great stench of the matter flowing therefrom white skins white and thin skins swimming up and down in the water but when the ulcer possesses the neck and not the bottom of the bladder the pain is more gentle neither does it trouble before the patient come to make water but in the very making thereof and a little while after  if bloody purulent matter flow forth with the urine bloody purulent matter it may rather proceed from an exulceration of the glandulae prostatae or some other neighboring vessels than from the bladder because that purulent matter is never seen mixed with the urine in ulcers of the bladder as is usual in an ulcer of the upper parts because it is poured forth not together with urine but immediately after it  note it has sometimes happened that a filthy matter has been discharged with the urine from an ulcer in the lungs or from the liver or it may proceed from the breaking of an impostume in some other parts in as much as those parts do transmit matter through the veins to the bladder but this is dstinguishd from the situation of the pain if from the lungs the pain is in the breast if from the liver the pain is only in the right side  and if it be from an ulcer in the kidneys there is great pain in the loins and small of the back but if from the bladder a very intense pain is about the share as is aforementioned  if filthy matter be voided with the urine of a very stinking or strong smell that purulent matter and stink are almost infallible signs of an exulceration of the bladder ex vrinis magis exitio saesunt faetidae quod magnam putredinem denotent and where a thick urine comes forth with certain branny scales cales ike bra the bladder of such persons is scabby by thick  urine is here meant well concocted which is a peculiar symptom that the things then contained in the urine proceed from the reins or bladder  trciasts  pfig  h trichiasis or pissing of hairs is when with the urine a mucous matter is voided like to hairs which sometimes seem to equal the length of one or two hands breadth the cause of them is a thick and viscous phlegm dried and knit together in the veins by heat which in its long passage through the narrow veins of the kidneys and ureters is extended to so great a length see concerning this the idea of practical physic book  0 page    also horstius his fifth section epistol medic and hippocrates in his aph    sect   says that water which has in it small fleshy fibers as it were certain hairs proceeds from the reins  bubbles when bubbles do swim on the top of urine they proceed from windy matter included in some viscous humidity and signify great crudity and indigestion in many parts of the body where the humors are chiefly multiplied and heaped together  resident bubbles do signify great flatulencies in the body or do indicate some indisposition of long continuance but bubbles not resident which break quickly signify a present debility or great weakness of body  and it bubbles cleave to the urinal it is a sign of a cacochymia or the abundance of illhumours in the blood  if a green circle appears in urine green and black circles it intimates a burning heat in the stomach and this color in a fever does indicate some disorder in the head proceeding from choler if a black circle be visible in the urine it is a sign that death is approaching  if a woman with child leadcolour void her urine of a leadcolour it is an undoubted sign that the child is dead within her this leadencolourd urine as also that which has as twere a dark sky fleeting above also urine black and thick and little in quantity are generally mortal signs in whatsoever diseases they appear  urines that are oily olyrine wherein do swim little fat things like cobwebs are extremely bad forasmuch as they show a mighty heat that melts the fat about the kidneys and in the whole body now how you may know whether this colliquation proceeds from the reins or from the whole body hippocrates teaches aph    sect   in these words those who have a close fat or oilyness swimming en the top of their urine have an acute evil in their reins by an acute evil he means a hot distemper which causes from its colliquative force as it were little heaps of fat in the urine for as there is a great quantity of fat heaped up about the reins and as from thence there is a short and quick way for the emission of the urine therefore that which is melted sticks not much by the way and if the fat be voided in little lumps little lumps of fat or sometime ke cobwebs it proceeds from an acute evil in the reins but if not in lumps but like cobwebs it shows a consumption of the fat through the whole body these oily fat urines says hippocrates are commonly signs that death is near at hand that these fat urines in which there is an appearance like cobwebs swimming at top are always very evil and dangerous is also confirmed by another author in these words pingues urinae telis aranearum similes valde periculosae and sunt damnandae  if the urine has no brackish but a sweetishtaste urite of an honeytaste like water dulcified with honey it is acknowledged an undoubted sign of a diabetes a disease wherein immediately after one has drank the urine is presently made in great plenty by the dissolution of the retentive faculty of the reins and the depravation or immoderation of the attractive faculty proceeding ordinarily from a too much exalted or too acid ferment of the reins and from an inflammation of the liver and other parts but especially of the kidneys and bladder the loins in this disease are molested with a pricking and biting pain and there is a continual and unquenchable thirst and although this disease proceeds from a hot distemper yet the urine is not colored red troubled or thick but thin and like water by reason the matter thereof makes very small stay in the stomach liver and vena cava being presently drawn away by the heat of the kidneys or bladder  those sediments in urines that appear like course meal are evil sediments like course meal those that appear like scales are worse but those that seem like bran are worst of all hip   prog  these kind of settlements according to galen   of crit chap    are caused by an immense heat melting and burning the fat and the very substance of the flesh but when this burning heat preys upon the solid parts first it assails the more soft and newly substantiated fat afterward the more solid and when all the fat is melted and consumed then it falls upon the more tender and newly compacted flesh after that upon the more solid flesh and lastly upon the most solid parts themselves by the new fat thus melted by the extreme heat of the fever are caused as is already mentioned oily urines sediments like course meal but the more solid fat being melted as also from the flesh raggedly dissolved and likewise from thick blood parched are caused those sediments resembling course meal  from the solid parts unequally dissolved proceed those sediments sediments like scales of fish or like bran which are like scales of fish as also those resembling bran when the heat is more intense whence it plainly appears that the scaly sediments are worse than the mealy ones and the branny sediments worse than the scaly as is testified by galen  and thus confirmed by another author subsidentiae in urinis speciem crassioris farinae referentes malae sunt iis vero pejores sunt squamosae at omnum pessimae sunt furfuraceae  how pernicious those sediments are will appear by the judgment of galen of that resembling course meal sediments like course meal which as is already declared is not so bad as the rest in com in aph    sect   he thus writes such urines are sometimes mortal as also is said in the prognost and many dye in a short time of sickness but whoever of them escape they have a long illness the disposition requiring a great concoction where such water s mde hippocrates confirms this in the following aphorism sediments in urines made in the time of agues like unto course wheatmeal do signify that the sickness shall continue long for they show a kind of gross thick humor which cannot be dissolved or voided in a short space  it is therefore manifest by these examples that whoever they be that void urine like to a thicker sort of meal if they may be saved yet it is long before they escape but whoever they are that are thus mortally affected they perish immediately  thin sediment a thin sediment in the beginning of a disease which in the progress of the malady thickens daily by degrees is good for it shows that nature endeavored a concoction at the beginning and does daily labor to bring its work to perfection  thick sediment a thick sediment caused by thick and crude humors is very bad for as those thick and crude humors are very hard to be overcome by nature therefore they do threaten much danger especially if the strength of the body be decayed but if there be any strength of nature they do only signify a prolongation of the disease  these crude and thick humors settling at the bottom of the chamber pot may deceive a young practitioner who may perhaps think them to be a good and true settlement and therefore they are to be exactly distinguished  and first those crude and thick humors usually appear at the beginning of a disease but the good and true settlement never till the declination thereof and it happens that after the beginning of the disease that thick and crude humor being attenuated there appears no more settlement in the bottom but only in the place thereof a cloud or matter hanging in the middle or the urine which as the concoction proceeds falls down daily from the upper part of the chamber pot to the lower part which is the true sign of concoction when the cloud changes into that matter which hangs in the middle of the pot called enaeorema and that eraeorema into the sediment but on the contrary when the sediment changes into the enaeorema or cloud that settlement is not laudable but a crude and thick humor which was afterward attenuated by concoction  secondly this crude humor does not stick close together neither is it altogether smooth and equal but the laudable sediment is smooth equal and moderately thick lastly this crude humor is heavier and resides altogether to the bottom of the chamber pot but a good sediment does not close but rather rests in the bottom being a little raised from it and as it were gathered into a kind of globe which the crude humor does not do but remains a little more diffused and scattered  urines in malignant and pestilent fevers in substance color and contents like the urine of found people are pernicious for hippocrates says urines concocted suddenly and without reason for it are evil and whatever appears contained in the urine not concocted according to nature is worse  i will close all in the words of the ever honored and never to be forgotten prince of physicians the great hippocrates  coctio ex superioribus securitatem salutis and celeritatem criseos demonstrat  si vero intermiserit atque interdum mingatur sine sedimento and aliqando habeat sedimentum album laeve and aequale morbum diuturnum and minus securum ostendit  iterum idem in coacis praenotionibus scribit urina bonum sedimentum habens quod derepente evanescit laborem mutationemque significat item si urina fuerit subrubra and sedimentum subrubrum ac laeve diuturnior haec quidem est quam prior valde tamen salubris  qui in vrinis celeriter sedimentum habent celeriter judicantur ex iisdem coacis praenot  celeriter id est intra paucos dies nam urina derepente cocta mala judicata fuit  from hence it appears that urine is best which has its sediment white smooth and even and does also continue so all the while till perfect judgment be made of the disease this well concocted matter is a sign of a speedy crisis and perfect recovery  but if it do intermit and that sometimes the water be made without any sediment it portends that the disease will be longer and less safe again that urine which has a good sediment if it suddenly disappear it foretells a great change and that the distemper will prove dangerous also if the urine be somewhat red with a sediment of the same color and smooth such indeed is more continual than the former yet greatly profitable and very healthful i e it shows the disease will be of long continuance but free from danger those which have a sediment in their urines within a few days after their illness have judgment soon made on the diseases for vrines concocted suddenly are judged very had  in a word as a good sound urine ought to be of a middling substance that is neither too thick nor too thin of a citroncolour or a little inclining to red and those other differences that come nearest to this are to be accounted best so likewise those vrines which in any degree appear contrary either in substance or color are to be adjudgd naught of both which a right prognostication may be made by an accurate uroscopia or diligent inspection of the urine  finis
