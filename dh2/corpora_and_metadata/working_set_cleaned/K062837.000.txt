mdccxviii  to the right honorable john lord summers baron of evesham my lord there is a pleasure in owning obligations which it is an honor to have received but should i publish any favors done me by your lordship i am afraid it would look more like vanity than gratitude  i had a very early ambition to recommend my self to your lordships patronage which yet increased in me as i traveled through the countries of which i here give your lordship some account for whatever great impressions an englishman must have of your lordship they who have been conversant abroad will find them still improved it cannot but be obvious to them that though they see your lordships admirers every where they meet with very few of your wellwishers at paris or at rome and i could not but observe when i passed through most of the protestant governments in europe that their hopes or fears for the common cause rose or fell with your lordships interest and authority in england  i here present your lordship with the remarks that i made in a part of these my travels wherein not withstanding the variety of the subject i am very sensible that i offer nothing new to your lordship and can have no other design in this address than to declare that i am  my lord your lordships most obliged and most obedient humble servant j addison  preface there is certainly no place in the world where a man may travel with greater pleasure and advantage than in italy one finds something more particular in the face of the country and more astonishing in the works of nature than can be met with in any other part of europe it is the great school of music and painting and contains in it all the noblest productions of statuary and architecture both ancient and modern it abounds with cabinets of curiosities and vast collections of all kinds of antiquities no other country in the world has such a variety of governments that are so different in their constitutions and so refined in their politics there is scarce any part of the nation that is not famous in history nor so much as a mountain or river that has not been the scene of some extraordinary action  as there are few men that have talents or opportunities for examining so copious a subject one may observe among those who have written on italy that different authors have succeeded best on different sorts of curiosities some have been more particular in their accounts of pictures statues and buildings some have searched into libraries cabinets of rarities and collections of medals as others have been wholly taken up with inscriptions ruins and antiquities among the authors of our own country we are obliged to the bishop of salisbury for his masterly and uncommon observations on the religion and governments of italy lassels may be useful in giving us the names of such writers as have treated of the several states through which he passed mr ray is to be valued for his observations on the natural productions of the place monsieur mission has wrote a more correct account of italy in general than any before him as he particularly excels in the plan of the country which he has given us in true and lively colors  there are still several of these topics that are far from being exhausted as there are many new subjects that a traveller may find to employ himself upon for my own part as i have taken notice of several places and antiquities that no body else has spoken of so i think i have mentioned but few things in common with others that are notei there set in a new light or accompanied with different reflections i have taken care particularly to consider the several passages of the ancient poets which have any relation to the places or curiosities that i met with for before i entered on my voyage i took care to refresh my memory among the classic authors and to make such collections out of them as i might afterward have occasion for i must confess it was not one of the least entertainments that i met with in traveling to examine these several descriptions as it were upon the spot and to compare the natural face of the country with the landskips that the poets have given us of it however to avoid the confusion that might arise from a multitude of quotations i have only cited such verses as have given us some image of the place or that have something else besides the bare name of it to recommend them  a letter from italy to the right honorable charles lord halifax in the year mdcci salve magna parens frugum saturnia tellus magna virum tibi res antiquae laudis et artis aggredior sanctos ausus recludere fontes vir geo   by mr addison while you my lord the rural shades admire and from britannias public posts retire nor longer her ungrateful sons to please for their advantage sacrifice your ease me into foreign realms my fate conveys through nations fruitful of immortal lays where the soft season and inviting clime conspire to trouble your repose with rhyme for wheresoeer i turn my ravished eyes gay gilded scenes and shining prospects rise poetic fields encompass me around and still i seem to tread on classic ground for here the muse so often her harp has strung that not a mountain rears its head unsung renowned in verse each shady thicket grows and every stream in heavenly numbers flows how am i pleased to search the hills and woods for rising springs and celebrated floods to view the nar tumultuous in his course and trace the smooth clitumnus to his sourse to see the mincio draw his watery store through the long windings of a fruitful shore and hoary albulas infected tide over the warm bed of smoking sulphur glide fired with a thousand raptures i survey eridanus through flowery meadows stray the king of floods that rolling over the plains the towering alps of half their moisture drains and proudly swollen with a whole winters snows distributes wealth and plenty where he flows sometimes misguided by the tuneful throng i look for streams immortalized in song that lost in silence and oblivion lie dumbare their fountains and their channels dry yet run for ever by the muses skill and in the smooth description murmur still sometimes to gentle tiber i retire and the famed rivers empty shores admire that destitute of strength derives its course from thrifty urns and an unfruitful sourse yet sung so often in poetic lays with scorn the danube and the nile surveys so high the deathless muse exalts her theme such was the boin a poor inglorious stream that in hibernian vales obscurely strayed and unobserved in wild meanders played till by your lines and nassaus sword renowned its rising billows through the world refound wherever the heros godlike acts can pierce or where the fame of an immortal verse oh could the muse my ravished breast inspire with warmth like yours and raise an equal fire unnumberd beauties in my verse should shine and virgils italy should yield to mine see how the golden groves around me smile that shun the coast of britains stormy isle or when transplanted and preserved with care curse the cold clime and starve in northern air here kindly warmth their mounting juice ferments to nobler tastes and more exalted scents even the rough rocks with tender myrtle bloom and trodden weeds send out a rich perfume bear me some god to bajas gentle seats or cover me in umbrias green retreats where western gales eternally reside and all the seasons lavish all their pride blossoms and fruits and flowers together rise and the whole year in gay confusion lies immortal glories in my mind revive and in my soul a thousand passions strive when romes exalted beauties i descry magnificent in piles of ruin lie an amphitheaters amazing height here fills my eye with terror and delight that on its public shows unpeopled rome and held uncrowded nations in its womb here pillars rough with sculpture pierce the skies and here the proud triumphal arches rise where the old romans deathless acts displayed their base degenerate progeny upbraid whole rivers here forsake the fields below and wondering at their height through airy channels flow still to new scenes my wandering muse retires and the dumb show of breathing rocks admires where the smooth chissel all its force has shown and softened into flesh the rugged stone in solemn silence a majestic band heroes and gods and roman consuls stand stern tyrants whom their cruelties renown and emperors in parian marble frown while the bright dames to whom they humbly sud still show the charms that their proud hearts subdued fain would i raphaels godlike art rehearse and show the immortal labors in my verse where from the mingled strength of shade and light a new creation rises to my sight such heavenly figures from his pencil flow so warm with life his blended colors glow from theme to theme with secret pleasure tossed amidst the soft variety i am lost here pleasing airs my ravished soul confound with circling notes and labyrinths of sound here domes and temples rise in distant views and opening palaces invite my muse how has kind heaven adorned the happy land and scattered blessings with a wasteful hand but what avail her unexhausted stores her blooming mountains and her sunny shores with all the gifts that heaven and earth impart the smiles of nature and the charms of art while proud oppression in her valleys reigns and tyranny usurps her happy plains the poor inhabitant beholds in vain the redning orange and the swelling grain joyless he sees the growing oils and wines and in the myrtles fragrant shade repines starves in the midst of natures bounty cursed and in the laden vineyard dies for thirst oh liberty thou goddess heavenly bright profuse of bliss and pregnant with delight eternal pleasures in thy presence reign and smiling plenty leads thy wanton train eased of her load subjection grows more light and poverty looks cheerful in thy sight thou make the gloomy face of nature gay givst beauty to the sun and pleasure to the day thee goddess thee britannias isle adores how has she often exhausted all her stores how often in fields of death thy presence sought nor thinks the mighty prize too dearly bought on foreign mountains may the sun refine the grapes soft juice and mellow it to wine with citron groves adorn a distant soil and the fat olive swell with floods of oil we envy not the warmer clime that lies in ten degrees of more indulgent skies nor at the coarseness of our heaven repine though over our heads the frozen pleiads shine it is liberty that crowns britannias isle and makes her barren rocks and her bleak mountains smile others with towering piles may please the sight and in their proud aspiring domes delight a nicer touch to the stretched canvas give or teach their animated rocks to live it is britains care to watch over europes fate and hold in balance each contending state to threaten bold presumptuous kings with war and answer her afflicted neighbors prayer the dane and swede roused up by fierce alarms bless the wise conduct of her pious arms soon as her fleets appear their terrors cease and all the northern world lies hushed in peace the ambitious gaul beholds with secret dread her thunder aimed at his aspiring head and fain her godlike sons would disunite by foreign gold or by domestic spite but strives in vain to conquer or divide whom nassaus arms defend and counsels guide fired with the name which i so often have found the distant climes and different tongues resound i bridle in my struggling muse with pain that longs to launch into a bolder strain but i have already troubled you too long nor dare attempt a more adventurous song my humble verse demands a softer theme a painted meadow or a purling stream unfit for heroes whom immortal lays and lines like virgils or like yours should praise monaco genoa etc on the twelfth of december      i set out from marseilles to genoa in a tartane and arrived late at a small french port called casses where the next morning we were not a little surprised to see the mountains about the town covered with green olive trees or laid out in beautiful gardens which gave us a great variety of pleasing prospects even in the depth of winter the most uncultivated of them produce abundance of sweet plants as wildtime lavender rosemary balm and myrtle we were here shown at a distance the deserts which have been rendered so famous by the penance of mary magdalene who after her arrival with lazarus and joseph of arimathea at marseilles is said to have wept away the rest of her life among these solitary rocks and mountains it is so romantic a scene that it has always probably given occasion to such chimerical relations for it is perhaps of this place that claudian speaks in the following description est locus extremum pandit qua gallia littus oceani praetentus aquis qua fertur ulysses sanguine libato populum movisse silentum illic umbrarum tenui stridore volantum flebilis auditur questus simulachra coloni pallida defunctasque vident migrare figuras etc cl in ruf l   a place there lies on gallias utmost bounds where rising seas insult the fontier grounds ulysses here the blood of victims shed and raised the pale assembly of the dead often in the winds is heard a plaintive sound of melancholy ghosts that hover round the laboring plowman often with horror spies thin airy shapes that over the furrows rise a dreadful scene and skim before his eyes   i know there is nothing more undetermined among the learned than the voyage of ulysses some confining it to the mediterranean others extending it to the great ocean and others ascribing it to a world of the poets own making though his conversations with the dead are generally supposed to have been in the narbon

real seas to real shores he strayed or by the fable driven from coast to coast in new imaginary worlds was lost the next day we again set sail and made the best of our way till we were forced by contrary winds into st remo a very pretty town in the genoese dominions the front to the sea is not large but there are a great many houses behind it built up the side of the mountain to avoid the winds and vapors that come from sea we here saw several persons that in the midst of december had nothing over their shoulders but their shirts without complaining of the cold it is certainly very lucky for the poorer sort to be born in a place that is free from the greatest inconvenience to which those of our northern nations are subject and indeed without this natural benefit of their climates the extreme misery and poverty that are in most of the italian governments would be insupportable there are at st remo many plantations of palm trees that do not grow in other parts of italy we failed from hence directly for genoa and had a fair wind that carried us into the middle of the gulf which is very remarkable for tempests and scarcity of fish it is probable one may be the cause of the other whether it be that the fishermen cannot employ their art with so much success in so troubled a sea or that the fish do not care for inhabiting such stormy waters  atrum defendens pisces hyemat mare  hor sa   li   while black with storms the ruffled ocean rolls and from the fishers art defends her finny sholes   we were forced to lie in it two days and our captain thought his ship in so great danger that he fell upon his knees and confessed himself to a capuchin who was on board with us but at last taking the advantage of a sidewind we were driven back in a few hours time as far as monaco lucan has given us a description of the harbor that we found so very welcome to us after the great danger we had escaped quaque sub herculeo sacratus nomine portus urget rupe cava pelagus non corus in illum jus habet aut zephyrus solus sua littora turbat circius and tuta prohibet statione monaeci lib   the winding rocks a spacious harbor frame that from the great alcides takes it name fenced to the west and to the north it lies but when the winds in southern quarters rise ships from their anchors torn become their sport and sudden tempests rage within the port   on the promontory where the town of monaco now stands was formerly the temple of hercules monaecus which still gives the name to this small principality  aggeribus socer alpinis atque arce monaeci descendens  virg aen   there are but three towns in the dominions of the prince of monaco the chief of them is situate on a rock which runs out into the sea and is well fortified by nature it was formerly under the protection of the spaniard but not many years since drove out the spanish garrison and received a french one which consists at present of five hundred men paid and officerd by the french king the officer who showed me the palace told me with a great deal of gravity that his master and the king of france amidst all the confusions of europe had ever been good friends and allies the palace has handsome apartments that are many of them hung with pictures of the reigning beauties in the court of france but the best of the furniture was at rome where the prince of monaco resided at that time ambassador we here took a little boat to creep along the seashore as far as genoa but at savona finding the sea too rough we were forced to make the best of our way by land over very rugged mountains and precipices for this road is much more difficult than that over mount cennis  the genoese are esteemed extremely cunning industrious and inured to hardship above the rest of the italians which was likewise the character of the old ligurians and indeed it is no wonder while the barrenness of their country continues that the manners of the inhabitants do not change since there is nothing makes men sharper and sets their hands and wits more at work than want the italian proverb says of the genoese that they have a sea without fish land without trees and men without faith the character the latin poets have given of them is not much different assuetumque malo ligurem virg g   the hard ligurians a laborious kind  pernix ligur sil it l   fallaces ligures aus eid    apenninicolae bellator filius auni haud ligurum extremus dum fallere fata finebant aen    yet like a true ligurian born to cheat at least while fortune favored his deceit vane ligur frustraque animis elate superbis nequicquam patrias tentasti lubricus arts id vain fool and coward cries the lofty maid caught in the train which thou thy self have laid on others practice thy ligurian arts thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts are lost on me nor shall thou safe retire with vaunting lies to thy fallacious sire dryden  there are a great many beautiful palaces standing along the seashore on both sides of genoa which make the town appear much longer than it is to those that fail by it the city it self makes the noblest show of any in the world the houses are most of them painted on the outside so that they look extremely gay and lively besides that they are esteemed the highest in europe and stand very thick together the newstreet is a double range of palaces from one end to the other built with an excellent fancy and fit for the greatest princes to inhabit i cannot however be reconciled to their manner of painting several of the genoese houses figures perspectives or pieces of history are certainly very ornamental as they are drawn on many of the walls that would otherwise look too naked and uniform without them but instead of these one often sees the front of a palace covered with painted pillars of different orders if these were so many true columns of marble set in their proper architecture they would certainly very much adorn the places where they stand but as they are now they only show us that there is something wanting and that the palace which without these counterfeit pillars would be beautiful in its kind might have been more perfect by the addition of such as are real the front of the villa imperiale at a mile distance from genoa without any thing of this paint upon it consists of a doric and corinthian row of pillars and is much the handsomest of any i there saw the duke of dorias palace has the best outside of any in genoa as that of durazzo is the best furnished within there is one room in the first that is hung with tapestry in which are wrought the figures of the great persons that the family has produced as perhaps there is no house in europe that can show a longer line of heroes that have still acted for the good of their country andrew doria has a statue erected to him at the entrance of the doges palace with the glorious title of deliverer of the commonwealth and one of his family another that calls him its preserver in the doges palace are the rooms where the great and little council with the two colleges hold their assemblies but as the state of genoa is very poor though several of its members are extremely rich so one may observe infinitely more splendour and magnificence in particular persons houses than in those that belong to the public but we find in most of the states of europe that the people show the greatest marks of poverty where the governors live in the greatest magnificence the churches are very fine particularly that of the annunciation which looks wonderfully beautiful in the inside all but one corner of it being covered with statues gilding and paint a man would expect in so very ancient a town of italy to find some considerable antiquities but all they have to show of this nature is an old rostrum of a roman ship that stands over the door of their arsenal it is not above a foot long and perhaps would never have been thought the beak of a ship had not it been found in so probable a place as the haven it is all of iron fashioned at the end like a boars head as i have seen it represented on medals and on the columna rostrata in rome i saw at genoa signior micconis famous collection of shells which as father buonani the jefuite has since told me is one of the best in italy i know nothing more remarkable in the government of genoa than the bank of st george made up of such branches of the revenues as have been set apart and appropriated to the discharging of several sums that have been borrowed from private persons during the exigencies of the commonwealth whatever inconveniences the state has labored under they have never entertained a thought of violating the public credit or of alienating any part of these revenues to other uses than to what they have been thus assigned the administration of this bank is for life and partly in the hands of the chief citizens which gives them a great authority in the state and a powerful influence over the common people this bank is generally thought the greatest load on the genoese and the managers of it have been represented as a second kind of senate that break the uniformity of government and destroy in some measure the fundamental constitution of the state it is however very certain that the people reap no small advantages from it as it distributes the power among more particular members of the republic and gives the commons a figure so that it is no small check upon the aristocracy and may be one reason why the genoese senate carries it with greater moderation toward their subjects than the venetian  it would have been well for the republic of genoa if she had followed the example of her sister of venice in not permitting her nobles to make any purchase of lands or houses in the dominions of a foreign prince for at present the greatest among the genoese are in part subjects to the monarchy of spain by reason of their estates that lie in the kingdom of naples the spaniards tax them very high upon occasion and are so sensible of the advantage this gives them over the republic that they will not suffer a neapolitan to buy the lands of a genoese who must find a purchaser among his own countrymen if he has a mind to sell for this reason as well as on account of the great sums of money which the spaniard owes the genoese they are under a necessity at present of being in the interest of the french and would probably continue so though all the other states of italy entered into a league against them genoa is not yet secure from a bombardment though it is not so exposed as formerly for since the insult of the french they have built a mole with some little ports and have provided themselves with long guns and mortars it is easy for those that are strong at sea to bring them to what terms they pleafe for having but very little arable land they are forced to fetch all their corn from naples sicily and other foreign countries except what comes to them from lombardy which probably goes another way whilst it furnishes two great armies with provisions their fleet that formerly gained so many victories over the saracens pisans venetians turks and spaniards that made them masters of crete sardinia majorca minorca negrepont lesbos malta that settled them in scio smyrna achaia theodosia and several towns on the eastern confines of europe is now reduced to six galleys when they had made an addition of but four new ones the king of france sent his orders to suppress them telling the republic at the same time that he knew very well how many they had occasion for this little fleet serves only to fetch them wine and corn and to give their ladies an airing in the summerseason the republic of genoa has a crown and scepter for its doge by reason of their conquest of corsica where there was formerly a saracen king this indeed gives their ambassadors a more honorable reception at some courts but at the same time may teach their people to have a mean notion of their own form of government and is a tacit acknowledgment that monarchy is the more honorable the old romans on the contrary made use of a very barbarous kind of politics to inspire their people with a contempt of kings whom they treated with infamy and dragged at the wheels of their triumphal chariots  pavia milan etc from genoa we took chaise for milan and by the way stopped at pavia that was once the metropolis of a kingdom but is at present a poor town we here saw the convent of austin monks who about three years ago pretended to have found out the body of the saint that gives the name to their order king luitprand whose ashes are in the same church brought hither the corpse and was very industrious to conceal it lest it might be abused by the barbarous nations which at that time ravaged italy one would therefore rather wonder that it has not been found out much earlier than that it is discovered at last the fathers however do not yet find their account in the discovery they have made for there are canons regular who have half the same church in their hands that will by no means allow it to be the body of the saint nor is it yet recognized by the pope the monks say for themselves that the very name was written on the urn where the ashes lay and that in an old record of the convent they are said to have been interred between the very wall and the altar where they were taken up they have already too as the monks told us begun to justify themselves by miracles at the corner of one of the cloisters of this convent are buried the duke of suffolk and the duke of lorrain who were both killed in the famous battle of pavia their monument was erected to them by one charles parker an ecclesiastic as i learned from the inscription which i cannot omit transcribing since i have not seen it printed capto a milite caesare  lorum rege in agro pa  feb inter alios proce  in proeli occisi sunt occubuei  llustrissimi pricipes fnciscus  lotharingiae  de la poo anglus  rege tyranno hen v  egno quorum corpora hoc in coenobio and ambitu per annos    fine honor tumulata sunt tandem carolus parker a morley richardi proximus consanguineus regno angliae a regina elisabetha ob catholicam fidem ejectus beneficentia tamen philippi regis cath hispaniarum monarchae invictissimi in statu mediolanensi sustentatus hoc qualecunque monumentum pro rerum suarum tenuitate charissimo propinquo et illustrissimis principibus posuit   sept      et post suum exilium    majora et honorificentiora commendans lotharingicis viator precare quietem  this pretended duke of suffolk was sir richard de la poole brother to the earl of suffolk who was put to death by henry the eighth in his banishment he took upon him the title of duke of suffolk which had been sunk in the family ever since the attainder of the great duke of suffolk under the reign of henry the sixth he fought very bravely in the battle of pavia and was magnificently interred by the duke of bourbon who though an enemy assisted at his funeral in mourning  parker himself is buried in the same place with the following inscription d o m carolo parchero a morley anglo ex illustrissima clarissima stirpe qui episcopus des ob fidem catholicam actus in exilium an xxxi peregrinatus ab invictiss phil rege hispan honestissimis pietatis and constantiae praemiis ornatus moritur anno a partu virginis m d c xi men septembris    in pavia is an university of seven colleges one of them called the college of borromee very large and nearly built there is likewise a statue in brass of marcus antoninus on horseback which the people of the place call charles the fifth and some learned men constantine the great  pavia is the ticinum of the ancients which took its name from the river ticinus which runs by it and is now called the tesin this river falls into the po and is excessively rapid the bishop of salisbury says that he ran down with the stream thirty miles in an hour by the help of but one rower i do not know therefore why silius italicus has represented it as so very gentle and still a river in the beautiful description he has given us of it caeruleas ticinus aquas et stagna vadoso perspicuus servat turbari nescia fundo ac nitidum viridi lent trabit amne liquorem vix credas labi ripis tam mitis opacis argutos inter volucrum certamina cantus somniferam ducit lucenti gurgite lympham l   smooth and untroubled the ticinus flows and through the crystal stream the shining bottom shows scarce can the sight discover if it moves so wondrous slow amidst the shady groves and tuneful birds that warble on its sides within its gloomy banks the limpid liquor glides   a poet of another nation would not have dwelt so long upon the clearness and transparency of the stream but in italy one seldom sees a river that is extremely bright and limpid most of them falling down from the mountains that make their waters very troubled and muddy whereas the tesin is only an outlet of that vast lake which the italians now call the lago maggiore  i saw between pavia and milan the convent of carthusians which is very spacious and beautiful their church is extremely fine and curiously adorned but of a gothic structure  i could not stay long in milan without going to see the great church that i had heard so much of but was never more deceived in my expectation than at my first entering for the front which was all i had seen of the outside is not half finished and the inside is so smutted with dust and the smoke of lamps that neither the marble nor the silver nor brassworks show themselves to an advantage this vast gothic pile of building is all of marble except the roof which would have been of the same matter with the rest had not its weight rendered it improper for that part of the building but for the reason i have just now mentioned the outside of the church looks much whiter and fresher than the inside for where the marble is so often washed with rains it preserves it self more beautiful and unsullyed than in those parts that are not at all exposed to the weather that side of the church indeed which faces the tramontane wind is much more unsightly than the rest by reason of the dust and smoke that are driven against it this profusion of marble though astonishing to strangers is not very wonderful in a country that has so many veins of it within its bowels but though the stones are cheap the working of them is very expensive it is generally said there are eleven thousand statues about the church but they reckon into the account every particular figure in the historypieces and several little images which make up the equipage of those that are larger there are indeed a great multitude of such as are bigger than the life i reckoned above two hundred and fifty on the outside of the church though i only told three sides of it and these are not half so thick set as they intend them the statues are all of marble and generally well cut but the most valuable one they have is a st bartholomew newflead with his skin hanging over his shoulders it is esteemed worth its weight in gold they have inscribed this verse on the pedestal to show the value they have for the workman  non me praxiteles sed marcus finxit agrati lest at the sculptor doubtfully you guess it is marc agrati not praxiteles there is just before the entrance of the quire a little subterraneous chapel dedicated to st charles borromee where i saw his body in episcopal robes lying upon the altar in a shrine of rockcrystal his chapel is adorned with abundance of silver work he was but two and twenty years old when he was chosen archbishop of milan and forty six at his death but made so good use of so short a time by his works of charity and munificence that his countrymen bless his memory which is still fresh among them he was cannonised about a hundred years ago and indeed if this honor were due to any man i think such publickspirited virtues may lay a juster claim to it than a sour retreat from mankind a fiery zeal against heterodoxies a set of chimerical visions or of whimsical penances which are generally the qualifications of roman saints miracles indeed are required of all who aspire to this dignity because they say an hypocrite may imitate a saint in all other particulars and these they attribute in great number to him i am speaking of his merit and the importunity of his countrymen procured his canonization before the ordinary time for it is the policy of the roman church not to allow this honor ordinarily till fifty years after the death of the person who is a candidate for it in which time it may be supposed that all his contemporaries will be worn out who could contradict a pretended miracle or remember any infirmity of the saint one would wonder that roman catholics who are for this kind of worship do not generally address themselves to the holy apostles who have a more unquestionable right to the title of saints than those of a modern date but these are at present quite out of fashion in italy where there is scarce a great town which does not pay its devotions in a more particular manner to some one of their own making this renders it very suspicious that the interests of particular families religious orders convents or churches have too great a sway in their canonizations when i was at milan i saw a book newly published that was dedicated to the present head of the borromean family and entitled a discourse on the humility of jesus christ and of st charles borromee  the great church of milan has two noble pulpits of brass each of them running round a large pillar like a gallery and supported by huge figures of the same metal the history of our savior or rather of the blessed virgin for it begins with her birth and ends with her coronation in heaven that of our savior coming in by way of episode is finely cut in marble by andrew biffy this church is very rich in relics which run up as high as daniel jonas and abraham among the rest they show a fragment of our countryman becket as indeed there are very few treasuries of relics in italy that have not a tooth or a bone of this saint it would be endless to count up the riches of silver gold and precious stones that are amassed together in this and several other churches of milan i was told that in milan there are sixty convents of women eighty of men and two hundred churches at the celestines is a picture in fresco of the marriage of cana very much esteemed but the painter whether designedly or not has put six fingers to the hand of one of the figures they show the gates of a church that st ambrose shut against the emperor theodosius as thinking him unfit to assist at divine service till he had done some extraordinary penance for his barbarous massacring the inhabitants of thessalonica that emperor was however so far from being displeased with the behavior of the saint that at his death he committed to him the education of his children several have picked splinters of wood out of the gates for relics there is a little chapel lately reedifyd where the same saint baptized st austin an inscription upon the wall of it says that it was in this chapel and on this occasion that he first sung his te deum and that his great convert answered him verse by verse in one of the churches i saw a pulpit and confessional very finely inlaid with lapislazuli and several kinds of marble by a father of the convent it is very lucky for a religious who has so much time on his hands to be able to amuse himself with works of this nature and one often finds particular members of convents who have excellent mechanical geniuss and divert themselves at leisure hours with painting sculpture architecture gardening and several kinds of handycrafts since i have mentioned confessionals i shall set down here some inscriptions that i have seen over them in roman catholic countries which are all texts of scripture and regard either the penitent or

bishop fisher whom henry the eighth put to death for not owning his supremacy books are indeed the least part of the furniture that one ordinarily goes to see in an italian library which they generally set off with pictures statues and other ornaments where they can afford them after the example of the old greeks and romans  plena omnia gypso chrysippi invenias nam perfectissimus horum si

brugeals elements a head of titian by his own hand a manuscript in latin of josephus which the bishop of salisbury says was written about the age of theodosius and another of leonardus vincius which king james the first could not procure though he proffered for it three thousand spanish pistols it consists of designings in mechanism and engineering i was shown in it a sketch of bombs and mortars as they are now used canon settalas cabinet is always shown to a stranger among the curiosities of milan which i shall not be particular upon the printed account of it being common enough among its natural curiosities i took particular notice of a piece of crystal that enclosed a couple of drops which looked like water when they were shaken though perhaps they are nothing but bubbles of air it is such a rarity as this that i saw at vendome in france which they there pretend is a tear that our savior shed over lazarus and was gathered up by an angel who put it in a little crystal vial and made a present of it to mary magdalene the famous pere mabillon is now engaged in the vindication of this tear which a learned ecclesiastic in the neighborhood of vendome would have suppressed as a false and ridiculous relick in a book that he has dedicated to his diocesan the bishop of blois it is in the possession of a benedictin convent which raises a considerable revenue out of the devotion that is paid to it and has now retained the most learned father of their order to write in its defense  it was such a curiosity as this i have mentioned that claudian has celebrated in about half a score epigrams solibus indomitum glacies alpina rigorem sumebat nimio jam preciosa gelu nec potuit toto mentiri corpore gemmam sed medio mansit proditor orb latex auctus honor liquidi crescunt

with the commissary of health and others to poison his fellowcitizens there is a void space where his house stood and in the midst of it a pillar superscribd colonna infame the story is told in handsome latin which i shall set down as having never seen it transcribed hic ubi haec area patens est surgebat olim tonstrina jo jacobi morae qui facta cum guliclmo platea publ sanit commissario et

thought a strong fort in italy and has held out formerly after the conquest of the rest of the duchy the governor of it is independent on the governor of milan as the persians used to make the rulers of provinces and fortresses of different conditions and interests to prevent conspiracies  at two miles distance from milan there stands a building that would have been a masterpiece in its kind had the architect designed it for an artificial echo we discharged a pistol and had the sound returned upon us above fifty six times though the air was very foggy the first repetitions follow one another very thick but are heard more distinctly in proportion as they decay there are two parallel walls which beat the sound back on each other till the undulation is quite worn out like the several reverberations of the same image from two opposite lookingglasses father kircher has taken notice of this particular echo as father bartolin has done since in his ingenious discourse on sounds the state of milan is like a vast garden surrounded by a noble moundwork of rocks and mountains indeed if a man considers the face of italy in general one would think that nature had laid it out into such a variety of states and governments as one finds in it for as the alps at one end and the long range of appenines that passes through the body of it branch out on all sides into several different divisions they serve as so many natural boundaries and fortifications to the little territories that lie among them accordingly we find the whole country cut into a multitude of particular kingdoms and commonwealths in the oldest accounts we have of it till the power of the romans like a torrent that overflows its banks bore down all before it and spread it self into the remotest corners of the nation but as this exorbitant power became unable to support it self we find the government of italy again broken into such a variety of subdivisions as naturally suits with its situation  in the court of milan as in several others of italy there are many who fall in with the dress and carriage of the french one may however observe a kind of awkwardness in the italians which easily discovers the airs they give themselves not to be natural it is indeed very strange there should be such a diversity of manners where there is so small a difference in the air and climate the french are always open familiar and talkative the italians on the contrary are stiff ceremonious and reserved in france every one aims at a gaiety and sprightliness of behavior and thinks it an accomplishment to be brisk and lively the italians notwithstanding their natural fieriness of temper affect always to appear sober and sedate insomuch that one sometimes meets young men walking the streets with spectacles on their noses that they may be thought to have impaired their sight by much study and seem more grave and judicious than their neighbors this difference of manners proceeds chiefly from difference of education in france it is usual to bring their children into company and to cherish in them from their infancy a kind of forwardness and assurance besides that the french apply themselves more universally to their exercises than any other nation in the world so that one seldom sees a young gentleman in france that does not fence dance and ride in some tolerable perfection these agitations of the body do not only give them a free and easy carriage but have a kind of mechanical operation on the mind by keeping the animal spirits always awake and in motion but what contributes most to this light airy humor of the french is the free conversation that is allowed them with their women which does not only communicate to them a certain vivacity of temper but makes them endeavor after such a behavior as is most taking with the sex  the italians on the contrary who are excluded from making their court this way are for recommending themselves to those they converse with by their gravity and wisdom in spain therefore where there are fewer liberties of this nature allowed there is something still more serious and composed in the manner of the inhabitants but as mirth is more apt to make proselytes than melancholy it is observed that the italians have many of them for these late years given very far into the modes and freedoms of the french which prevail more or less in the courts of italy as they lie at a smaller or greater distance from france it may be here worth while to consider how it comes to pass that the common people of italy have in general so very great an aversion to the french which every traveller cannot but be sensible of that has passed through the country the most obvious reason is certainly the great difference that there is in the humors and manners of the two nations which always works more in the meaner sort who are not able to vanquish the prejudices of education than with the nobility besides that the french humor in regard of the liberties they take in female conversations and their great ambition to excel in all companies is in a more particular manner very shocking to the italians who are naturally jealous and value themselves upon their great wisdom at the same time the common people of italy who run more into news and politics than those of other countries have all of them something to exasperate them against the king of france the savoyards notwithstanding the present inclinations of their court cannot forbear resenting the infinite mischiefs he did them in the last war the milanese and neapolitans remember the many insults he has offered to the house of austria and particularly to their deceased king for whom they still retain a natural kind of honor and affection the genoese cannot forget his treatment of their doge and his bombarding their city the venetians will tell you of his leagues with the turks and the romans of his threats to pope innocent the eleventh whose memory they adore it is true that interest of state and change of circumstances may have sweetened these reflections to the politer sort but impressions are not so easily worn out of the minds of the vulgar that however which i take to be the principal motive among most of the italians for their favoring the germans above the french is this that they are entirely persuaded it is for the interest of italy to have milan and naples rather in the hands of the first than of the other one may generally observe that the body of a people has juster views for the public good and pursues them with greater uprightness than the nobility and gentry who have so many private expectations and particular interests which hang like a false biass upon their judgments and may possibly dispose them to sacrifice the good of their country to the advancement of their own fortunes whereas the gross of the people can have no other prospect in changes and revolutions than of public blessings that are to diffuse themselves through the whole state in general  to return to milan i shall here set down the description ausonius has given of it among the rest of his great cities et mediolani mira omnia copia rerum innumerae cultaeque domus faecunda virorum ingenia and mores laeti tum duplice muro amplificata loci species populique voluptas circus and inclusi moles cuneata theatri templa palatinaeque arces opulensque

and with wealth oerflows and numerous streets and cleanly dwellings shows the people blessed with natures happy force are eloquent and cheerful in discourse a circus and a theater invites the unruly mob to races and to fights moneta consecrated buildings grace and the whole town redoubled walls embrace here spacious baths and palaces are seen and intermingled temples rise between here circling colonnades the ground enclose and here the marble statues breathe in rows profusely graced the happy town appears nor rome it self her beauteous neighbor fears   brescia verona padua from milan we traveled through a very pleasant country to brescia and by the way crossed the river adda that falls into the lago di como which virgil calls the lake larius and running out at the other end loses it self at last in the po which is the great receptacle of all the rivers of this country the town and province of brescia have freer access to the senate of venice and a quicker redress of injuries than any other part of their dominions they have always a mild and prudent governor and live much more happily than their fellow subjects for as they were once a part of the milanese and are now on their frontiers the venetians dare not exasperate them by the loads they lay on other provinces for fear of a revolt and are forced to treat them with much more indulgence than the spaniards do their neighbors that they may have no temptation to it brescia is famous for its ironworks a small days journey more brought us to verona we saw the lake benacus in our way which the italians now call lago di garda it was so rough with tempests when we passed by it that it brought into my mind virgils noble description of it add lacus tantos te lari maxim teque fluctibus and fremitu assurgens benace marino here vexed by winter storms benacus raves confused with working sands and rolling waves rough and tumultuous like a sea it lies so loud the tempest roars so high the billows rise   this lake perfectly resembles a sea when it is worked up by storms it is thirty five miles in length and twelve in breadth at the lower end of it we crossed the mincio  tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat mincius and tenera praetexit arundine ripas g   where the slow mincius through the valley strays where cooling streams invite the flocks to drink and reeds defend the winding waters brink dryden  the river adige runs through verona so much is the situation of the town changed from what it was in silius italicus his time  verona athesi circumflua l   verona by the circling adige bound   this is the only great river in lombardy that does not fall into the po which it must have done had it run but a little further before its entering the adriatic the rivers are all of them mentioned by claudian  venetosque erectior amnes magna voce ciet frondentibus humida ripis colla levant pulcher ticinus and addua visu caerulus and velox athesis tardusque meatu mincius inque novem consurgens ora timavus sexto con hon venetias rivers summoned all around hear the loud call and answer to the sound her dropping locks the silver tessin rears the blue transparent adda next appears the rapid adige then erects her head and mincio rising slowly from his bed and last timavus that with eager force from nine wide mouths comes gushing to his course   his larius is doubtless an imitation of virgils benacus  umbrosa vestit qua littus oliva larius and dulci mentitur nerea fluctu de bell get the larius here with groves of olives crowned an ocean of fresh water spreads around   i saw at verona the famous amphitheater that with a few modern reparations has all the seats entire there is something very noble in it though the high wall and corridors that went round it are almost entirely ruined and the area is quite filled up to the lower seat which was formerly deep enough to let the spectators see in safety the combats of the wild beasts and gladiators since i have claudian before me i cannot forbear setting down the beautiful description he has made of a wild beast newly brought from the woods and making its first appearance in a full amphitheater ut fera quae nuper montes amisit avitos altorumque exul nemorum damnatur arenae muneribus commota ruit vir murmr contra hortatur nixusque genu venabula tendit illa pavet strepitus cuneosque erecta theatri despicit and tanti miratur sibila vulgi in ruf l   so rushes on his foe the grisly bear that banished from the hills and bushy brakes his old hereditary haunts forsakes condemned the cruel rabble to delight his angry keeper goads him to the fight bent on his knee the savage glares around scared with the mighty crouds promiscuous sound then rearing on his hinder paws retires and the vast hissing multitude admires   there are some other antiquities in verona of which the principal is the ruin of a triumphal arch erected to flaminius where one sees old doric pillars without any pedestal or basis as vitruvius has described them i have not yet seen any gardens in italy worth taking notice of the italians fall as far short of the french in this particular as they excel them in their palaces it must however be said to the honor of the italians that the french took from them the first plans of their gardens as well as of their waterworks so that their surpassing of them at present is to be attributed rather to the greatness of their riches than the excellence of their taste i saw the terracegarden of verona that travelers generally mention among the churches of verona that of st george is the handsomest its chief ornament is the martyrdom of the saint drawn by paul veronese as there are many other pictures about the town by the same hand a stranger is always shown the tomb of pope lucius who lies buried in the dome i saw in the same church a monument erected by the public to one of their bishops the inscription says that there was between him and his maker summa necessitudo summa similitudo the italian epitaphs are often more extravagant than those of other countries as the nation is more given to compliment and hyperbole from verona to padua we traveled through a very pleasant country it is planted thick with rows of white mulberrytrees that furnish food for great quantities of silkworms with their leaves as the swine and poultry consume the fruit the trees themselves serve at the same time as so many stays for their vines which hang all along like garlands from tree to tree between the several ranges lie fields of corn which in these warm countries ripens much better among the mulberry shades than if it were exposed to the open sun this was one reason why the inhabitants of this country when i passed through it were extremely apprehensive of seeing lombardy the seat of war which must have made miserable havoc among their plantations for it is not here as in the corn fields of flanders where the whole product of the place rises from year to year we arrived so late at vicenza that we had not time to take a full sight of the place the next day brought us to padua st anthony who lived about five hundred years ago is the great saint to whom they here pay their devotions he lies buried in the church that is dedicated to him at present though it was formerly consecrated to the blessed virgin it is extremely magnificent and very richly adorned there are narrow clefts in the monument that stands over him where good catholics rub their beads and smell his bones which they say have in them a natural perfume though very like apoplectic balsom and what would make one suspect that they rub the marble with it it is observed that the scent is stronger in the morning than at night there are abundance of inscriptions and pictures hung up by his votaries in several parts of the church for it is the way of those that are in any signal danger to implore his aid and if they come off safe they call their deliverance a miracle and perhaps hang up the picture or description of it in the church this custom spoils the beauty of several roman catholic churches and often covers the walls with wretched daubings impertinent inscriptions hands legs and arms of wax with a thousand idle offerings of the same nature  they sell at padua the life of st anthony which is read with great devotion the most remarkable part of it is his discourse to an assembly of fish as the audience and sermon are both very extraordinary i will set down the whole passage at length non curando gli heretici il suo parlare egli si come era alla riva del mare dove shocca il fiume marecchia chiamo da part di dio li pesci che venissero a sentir la sua santa parola et ecco che di subito sopra lacque nuotando gran moltitudine di varii and diversi pesci e del mare e del fiume si unirono tutti secondo le specie loro e con bell ordine quasi che di ragion capaci stati fossero attenti e cheti con gratioso spettacolo saccommodaro per sentir la parola di dio cio veduto il santo

credete che non vi sia qualche secreto in questo che christo nostro salvatore dall agnelo pasquale in poi si compiacque tanto del cibo di voi pesci credete che sia a caso questo che dovendo il redentor del mondo pagar come huomo il censo a cesare la volesse trovaare nella bocca di un pesce tutti tutti sono misteri e sacramenti percio siete particolarmente obligati a lodare il vostro

cosi singolari beneficii che vi ha fatti di tante gratie che vi ha conferite di tanti favori di che vi ha fatti degna per tanto se non potete snodar la lingua a ringratiar il vostro benefattore and non sapete con parole esprimer le sue lodi fatele segno di riverenza almeno chinatevi al suo nome mostrate nel modo che potete sembiante di gratitudine rendetevi benevoli alla bonta sua in quel miglior modo che potete o sapete non siate sconoscenti de suoi beneficii and non siate ingrati de suoi favori a questo dire o maraviglia grande come si quelli pesci havessero havuto humano intelletto e discorso con gesti di profonda humilta con riverenti sembianti di religione chinarono la testa blandiro col corpo quasi approvando cio che detto havea il benedetto padre s antonio  when the heretics would not regard his preaching he betook himself to the seashore where the river marecchia disembogues it self into the adriatic he here called the fish together in the name of god that they might hear his holy word the fish came swimming toward him in such vast shoals both from the sea and from the river that the surface of the water was quite covered with their multitudes they quickly ranged themselves according to their several species into a very beautiful congregation and like so many rational creatures presented themselves before him to hear the word of god st antonio was so struck with the miraculous obedience and submission of these poor animals that he found a secret sweetness distilling upon his soul and at last addressed himself to them in the following words  although the infinite power and providence of god my dearly beloved fish discovers it self in all the works of his creation as in the heavens in the sun in the moon and in the stars in this lower world in man and in other perfect creatures nevertheless the goodness of the divine majesty shines out in you more eminently and appears after a more particular manner than in any other created beings for notwithstanding you are comprehended under the name of reptiles partaking of a middle nature between stones and beasts and imprisoned in the deep abyss of waters notwithstanding you are tossed among billows thrown up and down by tempests deaf to hearing dumb to speech and terrible to behold notwithstanding i say these natural disadvantages the divine greatness shows it self in you after a very wonderful manner in you are seen the mighty mysteries of an infinite goodness the holy scripture has always made use of you as the types and shadows of some profound sacrament  do you think that without a mystery the first present that god almighty made to man was of you o ye fishes do you think that without a mystery among all creatures and animals which were appointed for sacrifices you only were excepted o ye fishes do you think there was nothing meant by our savior christ that next to the paschal lamb he took so much pleasure in the food of you o ye fishes do you think it was by mere chance that when the redeemer of the world was to pay a tribute to caesar he thought fit to find it in the mouth of a fish these are all of them so many mysteries and sacraments that oblige you in a more particular manner to the praises of your creator  it is from god my beloved fish that you have received being life motion and sense it is he that has given you in compliance with your natural inclinations the whole world of waters for your habitation it is he that has furnished it with lodgings chambers caverns grottoes and such magnificent retirements as are not to be met with in the seats of kings or in the palaces of princes you have the water for your dwelling a clear transparent element brighter than crystal you can see from its deepest bottom every thing that passes on its surface you have the eyes of a lynx or of an argus you are guided by a secret and unerring principle delighting in every thing that may be beneficial to you and avoiding every thing that may be hurtful you are carried on by a hidden instinct to preserve your selves and to propagate your species you obey in all your actions works and motions the dictates and suggestions of nature without the least repugnancy or contradiction  the colds of winter and the heats of summer are equally incapable of molesting you a serene or a clouded sky are indifferent to you let the earth abound in fruits or be cursed with scarcity it has no influence on your welfare you live secure in rains and thunders lightnings and earthquakes you have no concern in the blossoms of spring or in the glowings of summer in the fruits of autumn or in the frosts of winter you are not solicitous about hours or days months or years the variableness of the weather or the change of seasons  in what dreadful majesty in what wonderful power in what amazing providence did god almighty distinguish you among all the species of creatures that perished in the universal deluge you only were insensible of the mischief that had laid waste the whole world  all this as i have already told you ought to inspire you with gratitude and praise toward the divine majesty that has done so great things for you granted you such particular graces and privileges and heaped upon you so many distinguishing favors and since for all this you cannot employ your tongues in the praises of your benefactor and are not provided with words to express your gratitude make at least some sign of reverence bow your selves at his name give some show of gratitude according to the best of your capacities express your thanks in the most becoming manner that you are able and be not unmindful of all the benefits he has bestowed upon you  he had no sooner done speaking but behold a miracle the fish as though they had been endued with reason bowed down their heads with all the marks of a profound humility and devotion moving their bodies up and down with a kind of fondness as approving what had been spoken by the blessed father st antonio the legend adds that after many heretics who were present at the miracle had been converted by it the saint gave his benediction to the fish and dismissed them    several other the like stories of st antony are represented about his monument in a very fine basso relievo  i could not forbear setting down the titles given to st antony in one of the tables that hangs up to him as a token of gratitude from a poor peasant who fancied the saint had saved him from breaking his neck sacratissimi pusionis bethlehemitici lilio candidiori delicio seraphidum soli fulgidissimo celsissimo

sancto antonio paduano pientissimo post deum ejusque virgineam matrem protectori and sospitatori suo etc   the custom of hanging up limbs in wax as well as pictures is certainly derived from the old heathens who used upon their recovery to make an offering in wood metal or clay of the part that had been afflicted with a distemper to the deity that delivered them i have seen i believe every limb of a human body figured in iron or clay which were formerly made on this occasion among the several collections of antiquities that have been shown me in italy the church of st justina designed by palladio is the most handsome luminous disencumbered building in the inside that i have ever seen and is esteemed by many artists one of the finest works in italy the long nef consists of a row of five cupolas the crossone has on each side a single cupola deeper and broader than the others the martyrdom of st justina hangs over the altar and is a piece of paul veronese in the great town hall of padua stands a stone superscribed lapis vituperii any debtor that will swear himself not worth five pound and is set by the bailifs thrice with his bare buttocks on this stone in a full hall clears himself of any farther prosecution from his creditors but this is a punishment that no body has submitted to these four and twenty years the university of padua is of late much more regular than it was formerly though it is not yet safe walking the streets after sunset there is at padua a manufacture of cloth which has brought very great revenues into the republic at present the english have not only gained upon the venetians in the levant which used chiefly to be supplied from this manufacture but have great quantities of their cloth in venice it self few of the nobility wearing any other sort notwithstanding the magistrate of the pomps is obliged by his office to see that no body wears the cloth of a foreign country our merchants indeed are forced to make use of some artifice to get these prohibited goods into port what they here show for the ashes of livy and antenor is disregarded by the best of their own antiquaries  the pretended tomb of antenor put me in mind of the latter part of virgils description which gives us the original of padua antenor potuit mediis elapsus achivis illyricos penetrare sinus atque intimae tutus regna liburnorum and fontem superare timavi unde per ora novem vasto cum murmr montis it mare praeruptum and pelago premit arva sonanti hic tamen ille urbem patavi sedesque locavit teucrorum and genti nomen dedit armaque fixit troia nunc placida compostus pace quiescit ae   antenor from the midst of grecian hosts could pass secure and pierce the illyrian coasts where rolling down the steep timavus raves and through nine channels disembogues his waves at length he founded paduas happy seat and gave his trojans a secure retreat there fixed their arms and there renewed their names and there in quiet lies  dryden   from padua i went down to the river brent in the ordinary ferry which brought me in a days time to venice  venice having often heard venice represented as one of the most defensible cities in the world i took care to inform my self of the particulars in which its strength consists and these i find are chiefly owing to its advantageous situation for it has neither rocks nor fortifications near it and yet is perhaps the most impregnable town in europe it stands at least four miles from any part of the terra firma nor are the shallows that lie about it ever frozen hard enough to bring over an army from the landside the constant flux and reflux of the sea or the natural mildness of the climate hindering the ice from gathering to any thickness which is an advantage the hollanders want when they have laid all their country under water on the side that is exposed to the adriatic the entrance is so difficult to hit that they have marked it out with several stakes driven into the ground which they would not fail to cut upon the first approach of an enemys fleet for this reason they have not fortified the little islands that lie at the entrance to the best advantage which might otherwise very easily command all the passes that lead to the city from the adriatic nor could an ordinary fleet with bombvessels hope to succeed against a place that has always in its arsenal a considerable number of galleys and men of war ready to put to sea on a very short warning if we could therefore suppose them blocked up on all sides by a power too strong for them both by sea and land they would be able to defend themselves against every thing but famine and this would not be a little mitigated by the great quantities of fish that their seas abound with and that may be taken up in the midst of their very streets which is such a natural magazine as few other places can boast of  our voyagewriters will needs have this city in great danger of being left within an age or two on the terra firma and represent it in such a manner as if the sea was insensibly shrinking from it and retiring into its channel i asked several and among the rest father coronelli the states geographer of the truth of this particular and they all assured me that the sea rises as high as ever though the great heaps of dirt it brings along with it are apt to choke up the shallows but that they are in no danger of losing the benefit of their situation so long as they are at the charge of removing these banks of mud and sand one may see abundance of them above the surface of the water scattered up and down like so many little islands when the tide is low and they are these that make the entrance for ships difficult to such as are not used to them for the deep canals run between them which the venetians are at a great expense to keep free and open  this city stands very convenient for commerce it has several navigable rivers that run up into the body of italy by which they might supply a great many countries with fish and other commodities not to mention their opportunities for the levant and each side of the adriatic but notwithstanding these conveniences their trade is far from being in a flourishing condition for many reasons the duties are great that are laid on merchandises their nobles think it below their quality to engage in traffic the merchants who are grown rich and able to manage great dealings buy their nobility and generally give over trade their manufactures of cloth glass and silk formerly the best in europe are now excelled by those of other countries they are tenacious of old laws and customs to their great prejudice whereas a trading nation must be still for new changes and expedients as different junctures and emergencies arise the state is at present very sensible of this decay in their trade and as a noble venetian who is still a merchant told me they will speedily find out some method to redress it possibly by making a free port for they look with an evil eye upon leghorne which draws to it most of the vessels bound for italy they have hitherto been so negligent in this particular that many think the great dukes gold has had no small influence in their councils  venice has several particulars which are not to be found in other cities and is therefore very entertaining to a traveller it looks at a distance like a great town half floated by a deluge there are canals every where crossing it so that one may go to most houses either by land or water this is a very great convenience to the inhabitants for a gondola with two oars at venice is as magnificent as a coach and six horses with a large equipage in another country besides that it makes all carriages extremely cheap the streets are generally paved with brick or freestone and always kept very neat for there is no carriage not so much as a chair that passes through them there is an innumerable multitude of very handsome bridges all of a single arch and without any fence on either side which would be a great inconvenience to a city less sober than venice one would indeed wonder that drinking is so little in vogue among the venetians who are in a moist air and a moderate climate and have no such diversions as bowling hunting walking riding and the like exercises to employ them without doors but as the nobles are not to converse too much with strangers they are in no danger of learning it and they are generally too distrustful of one another for the freedoms that are used in such kind of conversations there are many noble palaces in venice their furniture is not commonly very rich if we except the pictures which are here in greater plenty than in any other place in europe from the hands of the best masters of the lombard school as titian paul veronese and tintoret the last of these is in greater esteem at venice than in other parts of italy the rooms are generally hung with gilt leather which they cover on extraordinary occasions with tapestry and hangings of greater value the flooring is a kind of red plaster made of brick ground to powder and afterward worked into mortar it is rubbed with oil and makes a smooth shining and beautiful surface these particularities are chiefly owing to the moisture of the air which would have an ill effect on other kinds of furniture as it shows it self too visibly in many of their finest pictures though the venetians are extremely jealous of any great fame or merit in a living member of their commonwealth they never fail of giving a man his due parises when they are in no danger of suffering from his ambition for this reason though there are a great many monuments erected to such as have been benefactors to the republic they are generally put up after their deaths among the many elogiums that are given to the doge pisauro who had been ambassador in england his epitaph says in anglia jacobi regis obitum mira calliditate celatum mira sagacitate rimatus priscam benevolentiam firmavit the particular palaces churches and pictures of venice are enumerated in several little books that may be bought on the place and have been faithfully transcribed by many voyagewriters when i was at venice they were putting out very curious stamps of the several edifices which are most famous for their beauty or magnificence the arsenal of venice is an island of about three miles round it contains all the stores and provisions for war that are not actually employed there are docks for their galleys and men of war most of them full as well as workhouses for all land and naval preparations that part of it where the arms are laid makes a great show and was indeed very extraordinary about a hundred years ago but at present a great part of its furniture is grown useless there seem to be almost as many suits of armor as there are guns the swords are oldfashioned and unwieldy in a very great number and the firearms fitted with locks of little convenience in comparison of those that are now in use the venetians pretend they could set out in case of great necessity thirty men of war a hundred galleys and ten galeasses though i cannot conceive how they could man a fleet of half the number it was certainly a mighty error in this state to affect so many conquests on the terra firma which has only served to raise the jealousy of the christian princes and about three hundred years ago had like to have ended in the utter extirpation of the commonwealth whereas had they applied themselves with the same politics and industry to the increase of their strength by sea they might perhaps have had all the islands of the archipelago in their hands and by consequence the greatest fleet and the most seamen of any other state in europe besides that this would have given no jealousy to the princes their neighbors who would have enjoyed their own dominions in peace and have been very well contented to have seen so strong a bulwark against all the forces and invasions of the ottoman empire  this republic has been much more powerful than it is at present as it is still likelier to sink than increase in its dominions it is not impossible but the spaniard may some time or other demand of them creme brescia and bergame which have been torn from the milanese and in case a war should arise upon it and the venetians lose a single battle they might be beaten off the continent in a single summer for their fortifications are very inconsiderable on the other side the venetians are in continual apprehensions from the turk who will certainly endeavor at the recovery of the morea as soon as the ottoman empire has recruited a little of its ancient strength they are very sensible that they had better have pushed their conquests on the other side of the adriatic into albania for then their territories would have lain together and have been nearer the fourtainhead to have received succors on occasions but the venetians are under articles with the emperor to resign into his hands whatever they conquer of the turkish dominions that has been formerly dismembered from the empire and having already very much dissatisfied him in the frioul and dalmatia they dare not think of exasperating him further the pope disputes with them their pretensions to the polesin as the duke of savoy lays an equal claim to the kingdom of cyprus it is surprising to consider with what heats these two powers have contested their title to a kingdom that is in the hands of the turk  among all these difficulties the republic will still maintain it self if policy can prevail upon force for it is certain the venetian senate is one of the wisest councils in the world though at the same time if we believe the reports of several that have been well versed in their constitution a great part of their politics is founded on maxims which others do not think consistent with their honor to put in practice the preservation of the republic is that to which all other considerations submit to encourage idleness and luxury in the nobility to cherish ignorance and licentiousness in the clergy to keep alive a continual faction in the common people to connive at the viciousness and debauchery of convents to breed dissensions among the nobles of the terra firma to treat a brave man with scorn and infamy in short to stick at nothing for the public interest are represented as the refined parts of the venetian wisdom  among all the instances of their politics there is none more admirable than the great secrecy that reigns in their public councils the senate is generally as numerous as our house of commons if we only reckon the sitting members and yet carries its resolutions so privately that they are seldom known till they discover themselves in the execution it is not many years since they had before them a great debate concerning the punishment of one of their admirals which lasted a month together and concluded in his condemnation yet was there none of his friends nor of those who had engaged warmly in his defense that gave him the least intimation of what was passing against him till he was actually seized and in the hands of justice  the noble venetians think themselves equal at least to the electors of the empire and but one degree below kings for which reason they seldom travel into foreign countries where they must undergo the mortification of being treated like private gentlemen yet it is observed of them that they discharge themselves with a great deal of dexterity in such embassies and treaties as are laid on them by the republic for their whole lives are employed in intrigues of state and they naturally give themselves airs of kings and princes of which the ministers of other nations are only the representatives monsieur amelot reckons in his time two thousand five hundred nobles that had voices in the great council but at present i am told there are not at most fifteen hundred notwithstanding the addition of many new families since that time it is very strange that with this advantage they are not able to keep up their number considering that the nobility spreads equally through all the brothers and that so very few of them are destroyed by the wars of the republic whether this may be imputed to the luxury of the venetians or to the ordinary celibacy of the younger brothers or to the last plague which swept away many of them i know not they generally thrust the females of their families into convents the better to preserve their estates this makes the venetian nuns famous for the liberties they allow themselves they have operas within their own walls and often go out of their bounds to meet their admirers or they are very much misrepresented they have many of them their lovers that converse with them daily at the grate and are very free to admit a visit from a stranger there is indeed one of the cornaras that not long ago refused to see any under a prince  the carnaval of venice is every where talked of the great diversion of the place at that time as well as on all other high occasions is masking the venetians who are naturally grave love to give into the follies and entertainments of such seasons when disguised in a false personage they are indeed under a necessity of finding out diversions that may agree with the nature of the place and make some amends for the loss of several pleasures which may be met with on the continent these disguises give occasion to abundance of love adventures for there is something more intriguing in the amors of venice than in those of other countries and i question not but the secret history of a carnaval would make a collection of very diverting novels operas are another great entertainment of this season the poetry of them is generally as exquisitely ill as the music is good the arguments are often taken from some celebrated action of the ancient greeks or romans which sometimes looks ridiculous enough for who can endure to hear one of the rough old romans squeaking through the mouth of an eunuch especially when they may choose a subject out of courts where eunuchs are really actors or represent by them any of the soft asiatic monarchs the opera that was most in vogue during my stay at venice was built on the following subject caesar and scipio are rivals for catos daughter caesars first words bid his soldiers fly for the enemies are upon them si leva cesare e dice a soldati a la fugga a lo scampo the daughter gives the preference to caesar which is made the occasion of catos death before he kills himself you see him withdrawn into his library where among his books i observed the titles of plutarch and tasso after a short soliloquy he strikes himself with the dagger that he holds in his hand but being interrupted by one of his friends he stabs him for his pains and by the violence of the blow unluckily breaks the dagger on one of his ribs so that he is forced to dispatch himself by tearing up his first wound this last circumstance puts me in mind of a contrivance in the opera of st angelo that was acted at the same time the king of the play endeavors at a rape but the poet being resolved to save his heroines honor has so ordered it that the king always acts with a great caseknife stuck in his girdle which the lady snatches from him in the struggle and so defends her self  the italian poets besides the celebrated smoothness of their tongue have a particular advantage above the writers of other nations in the difference of their poetical and prose language there are indeed sets of phrases that in all countries are peculiar to the poets but among the italians there are not only sentences but a multitude of particular words that never enter into common discourse they have such a different turn and polishing for poetical use that they drop several of their letters and appear in another form when they come to be ranged in verse for this reason the italian opera seldom sinks into a poorness of language but amidst all the meanness and familiarity of the thoughts has something beautiful and sonorous in the expression without this natural advantage of the tongue their present poetry would appear wretchedly low and vulgar notwithstanding the many strained allegories that are so much in use among the writers of this nation the english and french who always use the same words in verse as in ordinary conversation are forced to raise their language with metaphors and figures or by the pompousness of the whole phrase to wear off any littleness that appears in the particular parts that compose it this makes our blank verse where there is no rhyme to support the expression extremely difficult to such as are not masters in the tongue especially when they write on low subjects and it is probably for this reason that milton has made use of such frequent transpositions latinisms antiquated words and phrases that he might the better deviate from vulgar and ordinary expressions  the comedies that i saw at venice or indeed in any other part of italy are very indifferent and more lewd than those of other countries their poets have no notion of gentile comedy and fall into the most filthy double meanings imaginable when they have a mind to make their audience merry there is no part generally so wretched as that of the fine gentleman especially when he converses with his mistress for then the whole dialogue is an insipid mixture of pedantry and romance but it is no wonder that the poets of so jealous and reserved a nation fail in such conversations on the stage as they have no patterns of in nature there are four standing characters which enter into every piece that comes on the stage the doctor harlequin pantalone and coviello the doctors character comprehends the whole extent of a pedant that with a deep voice and a magisterial air breaks in upon conversation and drives down all before him every thing he says is backed with quotations out of galen hippocrates plato virgil or any author that rises uppermost aad all answers from his companion are looked upon as impertinencies or interruptions harlequins part is made up of blunders and absurdities he is to mistake one name for another to forget his errands to stumble over queens and to run his head against every post that stands in his way this is all attended with something so comical in the voice and gestures that a man who is sensible of the folly of the part can hardly forbear being pleased with it pantalone is generally an old cully and coviello a sharper  i have seen a translation of the cid acted at bolonia which would never have taken had they not found a place in it for these buffoons all four of them appear in masks that are made like the old roman personae as i shall have occasion to observe in another place the french and italians have probably derived this custom of showing some of their characters in masks from the greek and roman theater the old vatican terence has at the head of every scene the figures of all the persons that are concerned in it with the particular disguises in which they acted and i remember to have seen in the villa mattheio an antic statue masked which was perhaps designed for gnatho in the eunuch for it agrees exactly with the figure he makes in the vatican manuscript one would wonder indeed how so polite a people as the ancient romans and athenians should not look on these borrowed faces as unnatural they might do very well for a cyclops or a satyr that can have no resemblance in human features but for a flatterer a miser or the like characters which abound in our own species nothing is more ridiculous than to represent their looks by a painted vizard in persons of this nature the turns and motions of the face are often as agreeable as any part of the action could we suppose that a mask represented never so naturally the general humor of a character it can never suit with the variety of passions that are incident to every single person in the whole course of a play the grimace may be proper on some occasions but is too steady to agree with all the rabble indeed are generally pleased at the first entry of a disguise but the jest grows cold even with them too when it comes on the stage in a second scene  since i am on this subject i cannot forbear mentioning a custom at venice which they tell me is particular to the common people of this country of singing stanzas out of tasso they are set to a pretty solemn tune and when one begins in any part of the poet it is odds but he will be answered by some body else that overhears him so that sometimes you have ten or a dozen in the neighborhood of one another taking verse after verse and running on with the poem as far as their memories will carry them  on holy thursday among the several shows that are yearly exhibited i saw one that is odd enough and particular to the venetians there is a set of artisans who by the help of several poles which they lay across each others shoulders build themselves up into a kind of pyramid so that you see a pile of men in the air of four or five rows rising one above another the weight is so equally distributed that every man is very well able to bear his part of it the stories if i may so call them growing less and less as they advance higher and higher a little boy represents the point of the pyramid who after a short space leaps off with a great deal of dexterity into the arms of one that catches him at the bottom in the same manner the whole building falls to pieces i have been the more particular on this because it explains the following verses of claudian which show that the venetians are not the inventors of this trick vel qui mere avium sese jaculantur in auras corporaque aedificant celeri crescentia nexu quorum compositam puer augmentatus in arcem emicat and vinctus plantae vel cruribus haerens pendula librato figit vestigia saltu claud de pr and olyb cons men pild on men with active leaps arise and build the breathing fabric to the skies a sprightly youth above the top most row points the tall pyramid and crowns the show   though we meet with the veneti in the old poets the city of venice is too modern to find a place among them sannazariuss epigram is too well known to be inserted the same poet has celebrated this city in two other places of his poems  quis venetae miracula proferat urbis una instar magni quae simul orbis habet salve italum regina altae pulcherrima romae aemula quae terris quae dominaris aquis tu tibi vel reges cives facis o decus o lux ausoniae per quam libera turba sumus per quam barbaries nobis non imperat and sol exoriens nostro clarius orb nitet l   el   venetia stands with endless beauties crowned and as a world within her self is found hail queen of italy for years to come the mighty rival of immortal rome nations and seas are in thy states enrolled and kings among thy citizens are told ausonias

rival towers invade the skies and from amidst the waves with equal glory rise   ferrara ravenna rimini at venice i took a bark for ferrara and in my way thither saw several mouths of the po by which it empties it self into the adriatic  quo non alius per pinguia culta in mare purpureum violentior influit amnis virg g   which is true if understood only of the rivers of italy  lucans description of the po would have been very beautiful had he known when to have given over quoque magis nullum tellus se solvit in amnem eridanus fractasque evolvit in aequora sylvas hesperiamque exhaurit aquis hunc

drains the po as sings the fable first conveyed its wondering current through a poplar shade for when young phaeton mistook his way lost and confounded in the blaze of day this river with surviving streams supplied when all the rest of the whole earth were dried and natures self lay ready to expire quenched the dire flame that set the world on fire   the poets reflections follow non minor hic nilo si non per plana jacentis aegypti libycas nilus stagnaret arenas non minor hic istro nisi quod dum permeat orbem ister casuros in quaelibet aequora fontes accipit and scythicas exit non solus in undas id nor would the nile more watery stores contain but that he stagnates on the libyan plain nor would the danube run with greater force but that he gathers in his tedious course ten thousand streams and swelling as he flows in scythian seas the glut of rivers throws   that is says scaliger the eridanus would be bigger than the nile and danube if the nile and danube were not bigger than the eridanus what makes the poets remark the more improper the very reason why the danube is greater than the po as he assigns it is that which really makes the po as great as it is for before its fall into the gulf it receives into its channel the most considerable rivers of piemont milan and the rest of lombardy  from venice to ancona the tide comes in very sensibly at its stated periods but rises more or less in proportion as it advances nearer the head of the gulf lucan has run out of his way to describe this phenomenon which is indeed very extraordinary to those who lie out of the neighborhood of the great ocean and according to his usual custom lets his poem stand still that he may give way to his own reflections quaque jacet littus dubium quod terra fretumque vendicat alternis vicibus cum funditur ingens oceanus vel cum refugis se fluctibus aufert ventus ab extremo pelagus sic axe volutet destituatque ferens an sidere mota secundo tethyos unda vagae lunaribus

tide do you who study natures works decide whilst i the dark mysterious cause admire nor into what the gods conceal presumptuously enquire   at ferrara i met nothing extraordinary the town is very large but extremely thin of people it has a citadel and something like a fortification running round it but so large that it requires more soldiers to defend it than the pope has in his whole dominions the streets are as beautiful as any i have seen in their length breadth and regularity the benedictins have the finest convent of the place they showed us in the church aristos monument his epitaph says he was nobilitate generis atque animi clarus in rebus publicis administrandis in regendis populis in gravissimis and summis pontificis legationibus prudentia consilio eloquentia praestantissimus  i came down a branch of the po as far as alberto within ten miles of ravenna all this space lies miserably uncultivated till you come near ravenna where the soil is made extremely fruitful and shows that much of the rest might be were there hands enough to manage it to the best advantage it is now on both sides the road very marshy and generally overgrown with rushes which made me fancy it was once floated by the sea that lies within four miles of it nor could i in the least doubt it when i saw ravenna that is now almost at the same distance from the adriatic though it was formerly the most famous of all the roman ports  one may guess at its ancient situation from martials meliusque ranae garrian ravennates lib   ravennas frogs in better music croak and the description that silius italicus has given us of it quaque gravi remo limosis segniter undis lenta paludosae perscindunt stagna ravennae l   encumbered in the mud their oars divide with heavy strokes the thick unwieldy tide   accordingly the old geographers represent it as situated among marshes and shallows the place which is shown for the haven is on a level with the town and has probably been stopped up by the great heaps of dirt that the sea has thrown into it for all the soil on that side of ravenna has been left there insensibly by the seas discharging it self upon it for so many ages the ground must have been formerly much lower for otherwise the town would have lain under water the remains of the pharos that stand about three miles from the sea and two from the town have their foundations covered with earth for some yards as they told me which notwithstanding are upon a level with the fields that lie about them though it is probable they took the advantage of a rising ground to set it upon it was a square tower of about twelve yards in breadth as appears by that part of it which yet remains entire so that its height must have been very considerable to have preserved a proportion it is made in the form of the venetian campanello and is probably the high tower mentioned by pliny lib    cap     on the side of the town where the sea is supposed to have lain formerly there is now a little church called the rotonda at the entrance of it are two stones the one with an inscription in gothic characters that has nothing in it remarkable the other is a square piece of marble that by the inscription appears ancient and by the ornaments about it shows it self to have been a little pagan monument of two persons who were shipwrecked perhaps in the place where now their monument stands the first line and a half that tells their names and families in prose is not legible the rest runs thus  raniae domus hos produxit alumnos libertatis opus contulit una dies naufraga mors pariter rapuit quos junxerat ante et duplices luctus mors periniqua dedit both with the same indulgent master blessed on the same day their liberty possessed a shipwreck slew whom it had joined before and left their common friends their funrals to deplore   there is a turn in the third verse that we lose by not knowing the circumstances of their story it was the naufraga mors which destroyed them as it had formerly united them what this union was is expressed in the preceding verse by their both having been made freemen on the same day if therefore we suppose they had been formerly shipwrecked with their master and that he made them free at the same time the epigram is unriddled nor is this interpretation perhaps so forced as it may seem at first sight since it was the custom of the masters a little before their death to give their slaves their freedom if they had deserved it at their hands and it is natural enough to suppose one involved in a common shipwreck would give such of his slaves their liberty as should have the good luck to save themselves the chancel of this church is vaulted with a single stone of four foot in thickness and a hundred and fourteen in circumference there stood on the outside of this little cupola a great tomb of porphyry and the statues of the twelve apostles but in the war that louis the twelfth made on italy the tomb was broken in pieces by a cannonball it was perhaps the same blow that made the flaw in the cupola though the inhabitants say it was cracked by thunder that destroyed a son of one of their gothic princes who had taken shelter under it as having been foretold what kind of death he was to die i asked an abbot that was in the church what was the name of this gothic prince who after a little recollection answered me that he could not tell precisely but that he thought it was one julius caesar there is a convent of theatins where they show a little window in the church through which the holy ghost is said to have entered in the shape of a dove and to have settled on one of the candidates for the bishopric the dove is represented in the window and in several places of the church and is in great reputation all over italy i should not indeed think it impossible for a pigeon to fly in accidentally through the roof where they still keep the hole open and by its fluttering over such a particular place to give so superstitious an assembly an occasion of favoring a competitor especially if he had many friends among the electors that would make a politic use of such an accident but they pretend the miracle has happened more than once among the pictures of several famous men of their order there is one with this inscription p d thomas gouldvellus ep asis tridno concilio contra haereticos and in anglia contra elisabet fidei confessor conspicuus the statue of alexander the seventh stands in the large square of the town it is cast in brass and has the posture that is always given the figure of a pope an arm extended and blessing the people in another square on a high pillar is set the statue of the blessed virgin arrayed like a queen with a scepter in her hand and a crown upon her head for having delivered the town from a raging pestilence the custom of crowning the holy virgin is so much in vogue among the italians that one often sees in their churches a little tinsel crown or perhaps a circle of stars glewd to the canvas over the head of the figure which sometimes spoils a good picture in the convent of benedictins i saw three huge chests of marble with no inscription on them that i could find though they are said to contain the ashes of valentinian honorius and his sister placidia from ravenna i came to rimini having passed the rubicon by the way this river is not so very contemptible as it is generally represented and was much increased by the melting of the snows when caesar passed it according to lucan font cadit modico parvisque impellitur undis puniceus rubicon cum fervida canduit aestas perque imas serpit valles and gallica certus limes ab ausoniis disterminat arva colonis tunc vires praebebat hyems atque auxerat undas tertia jam gravido pluvialis cynthia cornu et madidis euri resolutae flatibus alps l   while summer lasts the streams of rubicon from their spent source in a small current run hid in the winding vales they gently glide and italy from neighboring gaul divide but now with winter storms increased they rose by watery moons produced and alpine snows that melting on the hoary mountains lay and in warm eastern winds dissolved away   this river is now called pisatello  rimini has nothing modern to boast of its antiquities are as follow a marble bridge of five arches built by augustus and tiberius for the inscription is still legible though not rightly transcribed by gruter a triumphal arch raised by augustus which makes a noble gate to the town though part of it is ruined the ruins of an amphitheater the suggestum on which it is said that julius caesar harangued his army after having passed the rubicon i must confess i can by no means look on this last as authentic it is built of hewn stone like the pedestal of a pillar but something higher than ordinary and is but just broad enough for one man to stand upon it on the contrary the ancient suggestums as i have often observed on medals as well as on constantines arch were made of wood like a little kind of stage for the heads of the nails are sometimes represented that are supposed to have fastened the boards together we often see on them the emperor and two or three general officers sometimes sitting and sometimes standing as they made speeches or distributed a congiary to the soldiers or people they were probably always in readiness and carried among the baggage of the army whereas this at rimini must have been built on the place and required some time before it could be finished  imperator viii s c liberalitas avg s c adlocvt avg   if the observation i have here made is just it may serve as a confirmation to the learned fabrettis conjecture on trajans pillar who supposes i think with a great deal of reason that the camps intrenchments and other works of the same nature which are cut out as if they had been made of brick or hewn stone were in reality only of earth turf or the like materials for there are on the pillar some of those suggestums which are figured like those on medals with only this difference that they seem built of brick or freestone at twelve miles distance from rimini stands the little republic of st marino which i could not forbear visiting though it lies out of the common tour of travelers and has excessively bad ways to it i shall here give a particular account of it because i know of no body else that as done it one may at least have the pleasure of seeing in it something more singular than can be found in great governments and form from it an idea of venico in its first beginnings when it had only a few heaps of earth for its dominions or of rome it self when it had as yet covered but one of its seven hills  the republic of st marino the town and republic of st marino stands on the top of a very high and craggy mountain it is generally hid among the clouds and lay under snow when i saw it though it was clear and warm weather in all the country about it there is not a spring or fountain that i could hear of in the whole dominions but they are always well provided with huge cisterns and reservoirs of rain and snowwater the wine that grows on the sides of their mountain is extraordinary good and i think much better than any i met with on the cold side of the appenines this puts me in mind of their cellars which have most of em a natural advantage that renders em extremely cool in the hottest seasons for they have generally in the sides of them deep holes that run into the hollows of the hill from whence there constantly issues a breathing kind of vapor so very chilling in the summer time that a man can scarce suffer his hand in the wind of it  this mountain and a few neighboring hillocks that lie scattered about the bottom of it is the whole circuit of these dominions they have what they call three castles three convents and five churches and can reckon about five thousand souls in their community the inhabitants as well as the historians who mention this little republic give the following account of its original st marino was its founder a dalmatian by birth and by trade a mason he was employed above thirteen hundred years ago in the reparation of rimini and after he had finished his work retired to this solitary mountain as finding it very proper for the life of a hermit which he led in the greatest rigours and austerities of religion he had not been long here before he wrought a reputed miracle which joined with his extraordinary sanctity gained him so great an esteem that the princess of the country made him a present of the mountain to dispose of it at his own discretion his reputation quickly peopled it and gave rise to the republic which calls it self after his name so that the commonwealth of marino may boast at least of a nobler original than that of rome the one having been at first an asylum for robbers and murderers and the other a resort of persons eminent for their piety and devotion the best of their churches is dedicated to the saint and holds his ashes his statue stands over the high altar with the figure of a mountain in its hands crowned with three castles which is likewise the arms of the commonwealth they attribute to his protection the long duration of their state and look on him as the greatest saint next the blessed virgin i saw in their statutebook a law against such as speak disrespectfully of him who are to be punished in the same manner as those who are convicted of blasphemy  this petty republic has now lasted thirteen hundred years while all the other states of italy have several times changed their masters and forms of government their whole history is comprised in two purchases which they made of a neighboring prince and in a war in which they assisted the pope against a lord of rimini in the year   00 they bought a castle in the neighborhood as they did another in the year    0 the papers of the conditions are preserved in their archives where it is very remarkable that the name of the agent for the commonwealth of the seller of the notary and the witnesses are the same in both the instruments though drawn up at seventy years distance from each other nor can it be any mistake in the date because the popes and emperors names with the year of their respective reigns are both punctually set down about   0 years after this they assisted pope pius the second against one of the malatestas who was then lord of rimini and when they had helped to conquer him received from the pope as a reward for their assistance four little castles this they represent as the flourishing time of the commonwealth when their dominions reached half way up a neighboring hill but at present they are reduced to their old extent they would probably sell their liberty as dear as they could to any that attacked them for there is but one road by which to climb up to them and they have a very severe law against any of their own body that enters the town by another path lest any new one should be worn on the sides of their mountain all that are capable of bearing arms are exercised and ready at a moments call  the sovereign power of the republic was lodged originally in what they call the arengo a great council in which every house had its representative but because they found too much confusion in such a multitude of statesmen they devolved their whole authority into the hands of the council of sixty the arengo however is still called together in cases of extraordinary importance and if after due summons any member absents himself he is to be fined to the value of about a penny english which the statute says he shall pay sine aliqua diminutione aut gratia in the ordinary course of government the council of sixty which notwithstanding the name consists but of forty persons has in its hands the administration of affairs and is made up half out of the noble families and half out of the plebeian they decide all by baloting are not admitted till five and twenty years old and choose the officers of the commonwealth  thus far they agree with the great council of venice but their power is much more extended for no sentence can stand that is not confirmed by two thirds of this council besides that no son can be admitted into it during the life of his father nor two be in it of the same family nor any enter but by election the chief officers of the commonwealth are the two capitaneos who have such a power as the old roman consuls had but are chosen every six months i talked with some that had been capitaneos six or seven times though the office is never to be continued to the same persons twice successively the third officer is the commissary who judges in all civil and criminal matters but because the many alliances friendships and intermarriages as well as the personal feuds and animosities that happen among so small a people might obstruct the course of justice if one of their own number had the distribution of it they have always a foreigner for this employ whom they choose for three years and maintain out of the public stock he must be a doctor of law and a man of known integrity he is joined in commission with the capitaneos and acts something like the recorder of london under the lord mayor the commonwealth of genoa was forced to make use of a foreign judge for many years whilst their republic was torn into the divisions of guelphs and gibelines the fourth man in the state is the physician who must likewise be a stranger and is maintained by a public salary he is obliged to keep a horse to visit the sick and to inspect all drugs that are imported he must be at least thirty five years old a doctor of the faculty and eminent for his religion and honesty that his rashness or ignorance may not unpeople the commonwealth and that they may not suffer long under any bad choice he is elected only for three years the present physician is a very understanding man and well read in our countrymen harvey willis sydenham etc he has been continued for some time among em and they say the commonwealth thrives under his hands another person who makes no ordinary figure in the republic is the schoolmaster i scarce met with any in the place that had not some tincture of learning i had the perusal of a latin book in folio entitled statuta illustrissimae reipublicae sancti marini printed at rimini by order of the commonwealth the chapter on the public ministers says that when an ambassador is dispatched from the republic to any foreign state he shall be allowed out of the treasury to the value of a shilling a day the people are esteemed very honest and rigorous in the execution of justice and seem to live more happy and contented among their rocks and snows than others of the italians do in the pleasantest valleys of the world nothing indeed can be a greater instance of the natural love that mankind has for liberty and of their aversion to an arbitrary government than such a savage mountain covered with people and the campania of rome which lies in the same country almost destitute of inhabitants  pesaro fano senigallia ancona loretto etc to rome from rimini to loretto the towns of note are pesaro fano senigallia and ancona fano received its name from the fane or temple of fortune that stood in it one may still see the triumphal arch erected there to augustus it is indeed very much defaced by time but the plan of it as it stood entire with all its inscriptions is neatly cut upon the wall of a neighboring building in each of these towns is a beautiful marble fountain where the water runs continually through several little spouts which looks very refreshing in these hot countries and gives a great coolness to the air about them that of pesaro is handsomely designed ancona is much the most considerable of these towns it stands on a promontory and looks more beautiful at a distance than when you are in it the port was made by trajan for which he has a triumphal arch erected to him by the seaside the marble of this arch looks very white and fresh as being exposed to the winds and salt seavapours that by continually fretting it preseves it self from that moldy color which others of the same materials have contracted though the italians and voyagewriters call these of rimini fano and ancona triumphal arches there was probably some distinction made among the romans between such honorary arches erected to emperors and those that were raised to them on the account of a victory which are properly triumphal arches this at ancona was an instance of gratitude to trajan for the port he had made there as the two others i have mentioned were probably for some reason of the same nature one may however observe the wisdom of the ancient romans who to encourage their emperors in their inclination of doing good to their country gave the same honors to the great actions of peace which turned to the advantage of the public as to those of war this is very remarkable in the medals that were stamped on the same occasions i remember to have seen one of galbas with a triumphal arch on the reverse that was made by the senates order for his having remitted a tax r xxxx remissa s c the medal which was made for trajan in remembrance of his benificence to ancona is very common the reverse has on it a port with a chain running across it and betwixt them both a boat with this inscription s p q r optimo principi s c xxxx remissa s c s p q r optimo princepi s c   i know fabretti would fain ascribe this medal to another occasion but bellorio in his additions to angeloni has sufficiently refuted all he says on that subject  at loretto i inquired for the english jesuits lodgings and on the staircase that leads to em i saw several pictures of such as had been executed in england as the two garnets oldcorn and others to the number of thirty whatever were their crimes the inscription says they suffered for their religion and some of em are represented lying under such tortures as are not in use among us the martyrs of      are set by themselves with a knife stuck in the bosom of each figure to signify that they were quartered  the riches in the holy house and treasury are surprizingly great and as much surpassed my expectation as other sights have generally fallen short of it silver can scarce find an admission and gold it self looks but poorly among such an incredible number of precious stones there will be in a few ages more the jewels of the greatest value in europe if the devotion of its princes continues in its present fervor the last offering was made by the queen dowager of poland and cost her   000 crowns some have wondered that the turk never attacks this treasury since it lies so near the seashore and is so weakly guarded but besides that he has attempted it formerly with no success it is certain the venetians keep too watchful an eye over his motions at present and would never suffer him to enter the adriatic it would indeed be an easy thing for a christian prince to surprise it who has ships still passing to and fro without suspicion especially if he had a party in the town disguised like pilgrims to secure a gate for him for there have been sometimes to the number of  00000 in a days time as it is generally reported but it is probable the veneration for the holy house and the horror of an action that would be resented by all the catholic princes of europe will be as great a security to the place as the strongest fortification it is indeed an amazing thing to see such a prodigious quantity of riches lie dead and untouched in the midst of so much poverty and misery as reign on all sides of em there is no question however but the pope would make use of these treasures in case of any great calamity that should endanger the holy see as an unfortunate war with the turk or a powerful league among the protestants for i cannot but look on those vast heaps of wealth that are amassed together in so many religious places of italy as the hidden reserves and magazines of the church that she would open on any pressing occasion for her last defense and preservation if these riches were all turned into current coin and employed in commerce they would make italy the most flourishing country in europe the case of the holy house is nobly designed and executed by the great masters of italy that flourished about a hundred years ago the statues of the sibyls are very finely wrought each of em in a different air and posture as are likewise those of the prophets underneath em the roof of the treasury is painted with the same kind of device there stands at the upper end of it a large crucifix very much esteemed the figure of our savior represents him in his last agonies of death and amidst all the ghastliness of the visage has something in it very amiable the gates of the church are said to be of corinthian brass with many scripture stories rising on em in basso relievo the popes statue and the fountain by it would make a noble show in a place less beautified with so many other productions of art the spicery the cellar and its furniture the great revenues of the convent with the story of the holy house are too well known to be here insisted upon  whoever were the first inventors of this imposture they seem to have taken the hint of it from the veneration that the old romans paid to the cottage of romulus which stood on mount capitol and was repaired from time to time as it fell to decay virgil has given a pretty image of this little thatched palace that represents it standing in manliuss time     years after the death of romulus in summo custos tarpeiae manlius areis stabat pro templo and capitolia celsa tenebat romuleoque recens horrebat regia culmo aen l   high on a rock heroic manlius stood to guard the temple and the temples god then rome was poor and there you might behold the palace thatched with straw dryden  from loretto in my way to rome i passed through recanati macorata tolentino and foligni in the last there is a convent of nuns called la contessa that has in the church an incomparable madonna of raphel at spoletto the next town on the road are some antiquities the most remarkable is an aquaeduct of a gothic structure that conveys the water from mount st francis to spoletto which is not to be equaled for its height by any other in europe they reckon from the foundation of the lowest arch to the top of it   0 yards in my way hence to terni i saw the river clitumnus celebrated by so many of the poets for a particular quality in its waters of making cattle white that drink of it the inhabitants of that country have still the same opinion of it as i found upon enquiry and have a great many oxen of a whitish color to confirm em in it it is probable this breed was first settled in the country and continuing still the same species has made the inhabitants impute it to a wrong cause though they may as well fancy their hogs turn black for some reason of the same nature because there are none in italy of any other breed the river clitumnus and mevania that stood on the banks of it are famous for the herds of victims with which they furnished all italy qua formosa suo clitumnus flumina luco integit and niveos abluit unda boves prop l   hinc albi clitumne greges and maxima taurus victima saepe tuo perfusi flumine saero romanos ad templa deum duxere

neighboring pastures feed but of clitumnus whitest sacred breed the lively tincture of whose gushing blood should clearly prove the richness of his food a neck so strong so large as would command the speeding blow of some uncommon hand mr congreve  i shall afterward have occasion to quote claudian  terni is the next town in course formerly called interamna for the same reason that a part of asia was named mesopotamia we enter at the gate of the three monuments so called because there stood near in a monument erected to tacitus the historian with two others to the emperors tacitus and florianus all of them natives of the place these were a few years ago demolished by thunder and the fragments of them are in the hands of some gentlemen of the town near the dome i was shown a square marble inserted in the wall with the following inscription saluti perpetuae augustae libertatique publicae populi romani genio municipi anno post interamnam conditam d cc iv ad cnejum domitium ahenobarbum  coss providentiae ti caesaris augusti nati ad aeternitatem romani nominis sublato host perniciosissimo p r faustus titius liberalis vi vir iterum p s f c that is pecunia sua fieri curavit  this stone was probably set up on occasion of the fall of sejanus after the name of ahenobarbus there is a little furrow in the marble but so smooth and well polished that i should not have taken notice of it had not i seen coss at the end of it by which it is plain there was once the name of another consul which has been industriously razed out lucias aruncius camillus scribonianus was consul under the reign of vid fast consul sicul tiberius and was afterward put to death for a conspiracy that he had formed against the emperor claudius at which time it was ordered that his name and consulate should be effaced out of all public registers and inscriptions it is not therefore improbable that it was this long name which filled up the gap i am now mentioning there are near this monument the ruins of an ancient theater with some of the caves entire i saw among the ruins an old heathen altar with this particularity in it that it is hollowed like a dish at one end but it was not this end on which the sacrifice was laid as one may guess from the make of the festoon that runs round the altar and is inverted when the hollow stands uppermost in the same yard among the rubbish of the theater lie two pillars the one of granate and the other of a very beautiful marble i went out of my way to see the famous cascade about three miles from terni it it formed by the fall of the river velino which virgil mentions in the seventh aeneid  rosed rura velini  the channel of this river lies very high and is shaded on all sides by a green forest made up of several kinds of trees that preserve their verdure all the year the neighboring mountains are covered with them and by reason of their height are more exposed to the dews and drizzling rains than any of the adjacent parts which gives occasion to virgils rosea rura dewy countries the river runs extremely rapid before its fall and rushes down a precipice of a hundred yards high it throws it self into the hollow of a rock which has probably been worn by such a constant fall of water it is impossible to see the bottom on which it breaks for the thickness of the mist that rises from it which looks at a distance like clouds of smoke ascending from some vast furnace and distills in perpetual rains on all the places that lie near it i think there is something more astonishing in this cascade than in all the waterworks of versailles and could not but wonder when i first saw it that i had never met with it in any of the old poets especially in claudian who makes his emperor honorius go out of his way to see the river nar which runs just below it and yet does not mention what would have been so great an embellishment to his poem but at present i dont in the least question notwithstanding the opinion of some learned men to the contrary that this is the gulf through which virgils alecto shoots her self into hell for the very place the great reputation of it the fall of waters the woods that encompass it with the smoke and noise that arise from it are all pointed at in the description perhaps he would not mention the name of the river because he has done it in the verses that precede we may add to this that the cascade is not far off that part of italy which has been called italiae meditullium est locus italiae medio sub montibus altis nobilis and fama multis memoratus in oris amsancti valles densis hunc frondibus atrum urget utrinque latus nemoris medioque fragosus dat sonitum saxis and torto vortice torrens hic specus horrendum and saevi spiracula ditis monstrantur ruptoque ingens acheronte vorago pestiferas aperit fauces queis condita erinnys invisum numen terras coelumque levabat aen   in midst of italy well known to fame there lies a vale amsanctus is the name below the lofty mounts on either side thick forests the forbidden entrance hide full in the center of the sacred wood an arm arises of the stygian flood which falling from on high with bellowing sound whirls the black waves and rattling stones around here pluto pants for breath from out his cell and opens wide the grinning jaws of hell to this infernal gate the fury flies here hides her hated head and frees the laboring skies dryden  it was indeed the most proper place in the world for a fury to make her exit after she had filled a nation with distractions and alarms and i believe every readers imagination is pleased when he sees the angry goddess thus sinking as it were in a tempest and plunging herself into hell amidst such a scene of horror and confusion  the river velino after having found its way out from among the rocks where it falls runs into the nera the channel of this last river is white with rocks and the surface of it for a long space covered with froth and bubbles for it runs all along upon the fret and is still breaking against the stones that oppose its passage so that for these reasons as well as for the mixture of sulphur in its waters it is very well described by virgil in that verse which mentions these two rivers in their old roman names tartaream intendit vocem qua protinus omne contremuit nemus and sylvae intoere profundae audiit and long triviae lacus audiit amnis sulphurea nar albus aqua fontesque velini aen   the sacred lake of trivia from afar the veline fountains and sulphurous nar shake at the baleful blast the signal of the war dryden  he makes the sound of the furys trumpet run up the nera to the very sources of velino which agrees extremely well with the situation of these rivers when virgil has marked any particular quality in a river the other poets seldom fail of copying after him  sulphureus nar auson  narque albescentibus undis in tibrim properans  sil it l    et nar vitiatus odoro sulfure  claud de pr and olyb cons  the hoary nar corrupted with the stench of sulphur flows and into tibers streams the infected current throws   from this river our next town on the road receives the name of narni i saw hereabouts nothing remarkable except augustuss bridge that stands half a mile from the town and is one of the stateliest ruins in italy it has no cement and looks as firm as one entire stone there is an arch of it unbroken the broadest that i have ever seen though by reason of its great height it does not appear so the middle one was still much broader they join together two mountains and belonged without doubt to the bridge that martial mentions though mr ray takes em to be the remains of an ancient aquaeduct sed jam parce mihi nec abutere narnia quinto perpetuo liceat sic tibi ponte frui l   preserve my better part and spare my friend so narni may thy bridge for ever stand   from narni i went to otricoli a very mean little village that stands where the castle of ocriculum did formerly i turned about half a mile out of the road to see the ruins of the old ocriculum that lie near the banks of the tiber there are still scattered pillars and pedestals huge pieces of marble half buried in the earth fragments of towers subterraneous vaults bathing places and the like marks of its ancient magnificence  in my way to rome seeing a high hill standing by it self in the campania i did not question but it had a classic name and upon enquiry found it to be mount soracte the italians at present call it because its name begins with an s st oreste  the fatigue of our crossing the appenines and of our whole journey from loretto to rome was very agreeably relieved by the variety of scenes we passed through for not to mention the rude prospect of rocks rising one above another of the deep gutters worn in the sides of em by torrents of rain and snowwater or the long channels of sand winding about their bottoms that are sometimes filled with so many rivers we saw in six days traveling the several seasons of the year in their beauty and perfection we were sometimes shivering on the top of a bleak mountain and a little while after basking in a warm valley covered with violets and almondtrees in blossom the bees already swarming over em though but in the month of february sometimes our road led us through groves of olives or by gardens of oranges or into several hollow apartments among the rocks and mountains that look like so many natural greenhouses as being always shaded with a great variety of trees and shrubs that never lose their verdure  i shall say nothing of the via flaminia which has been spoken of by most of the voyagewriters that have passed it but shall set down claudians account of the journey that honorius made from ravenna to rome which lies most of it in the fame road that i have been describing  antiquae muros egressa ravennae signa movet jamque or a padi portusque relinquit flumineos certis ubi legibus advena nereus aestuat and pronas

more pains on the geography of italy than any other of the latin poets has given a catalogue of most of the rivers that i saw in umbria or in the borders of it he has avoided a fault if it be really such which macrobius has objected to virgil of passing from one place to another without regarding their regular and natural situation in which homers catalogues are observed to be much more methodical and exact than virgils  cavis venientes montibus umbri hos aefis sapisque lavant rapidasque sonanti vortice contorquens undas per saxa metaurus et lavat ingentem perfundens flamine sacro

may with the proudest tyrian purple vie   fountain water is still very scarce at ravenna and was probably much more so when the sea was within its neighborhood  from rome to naples upon my arrival at rome i took a view of st peters and the rotunda leaving the rest till my return from naples when i should have time and leisure enough to consider what i saw st peters seldom answers expectation at first entering it but enlarges it self on all sides insensibly and mends upon the eye every moment the proportions are so very well observed that nothing appears to an advantage or distinguishes it self above the rest it seems neither extremely high nor long nor broad because it is all of them in a just equality as on the contrary in our gothic cathedrals the narrowness of the arch makes it rise in height or run out in length the lowness often opens it in breadth or the defectiveness of some other particular makes any single part appear in greater perfection though every thing in this church is admirable the most astonishing part of it is the cupola upon my going to the top of it i was surpised to find that the dome which we see in the church is not the same that one looks upon without doors the last of em being a kind of case to the other and the stairs lying betwixt em both by which one ascends into the ball had there been only the outward dome it would not have shown it self to an advantage to those that are in the church or had there only been the inward one it would scarce have been seen by those that are without had they both been one solid dome of so great a thickness the pillars would have been too weak to have supported it after having surveyed this dome i went to see the rotunda which is generally said to have been the model of it this church is at present so much changed from the ancient pantheon as pliny has described it that some have been inclined to think it is not the same temple but the cavalier fontana has abundantly satisfied the world in this particular and shown how the ancient figure and ornaments of the pantheon have been changed into what they are at present this author who is now esteemed the best of the roman architects has lately written a treatise on vespasians amphitheater which is not yet printed  after having seen these two masterpieces of modern and ancient architecture i have often considered with my self whether the ordinary figure of the heathen or that of the christian temples be the most beautiful and the most capable of magnificence and cannot forbear thinking the cross figure more proper for such spacious buildings than the rotund i must confess the eye is better filled at first entering the rotund and takes in the whole beauty and magnificence of the temple at one view but such as are built in the form of a cross give us a greater variety of noble prospects nor is it easy to conceive a more glorious show in architecture than what a man meets with in st peters when he stands under the dome if he looks upward he is astonished at the spacious hollow of the cupola and has a vault on every side of him that makes one of the beautifullest vistas that the eye can possibly pass through i know that such as are professed admirers of the ancients will find abundance of chimerical beauties the architects themselves never thought of as one of the most famous of the moderns in that art tells us the hole in the roof of the rotunda is so admirably contrived that it makes those who are in the temple look like angels by diffusing the light equally on all sides of em  in all the old highways that lead from rome one sees several little ruins on each side of em that were formerly so many sepulchers for the ancient romans generally buried their dead near the great roads  quorum flaminia tegitur cinis atque latina juv s   none but some few of a very extraordinary quality having been interred within the walls of the city  our christian epitaphs that are to be seen only in churches or churchyards begin often with a siste viatorviator precare salutem etc probably in imitation of the old roman inscriptions that generally addressed themselves to the travelers as it was impossible for em to enter the city or to go out of it without passing through one of these melancholy roads which for a great length was nothing else but a street of funeral monuments  in my way from rome to naples i found nothing so remarkable as the beauty of the country and the extreme poverty of its inhabitants it is indeed an amazing thing to see the present desolation of italy when one considers what incredible multitudes of people it abounded with during the reigns of the roman emperors and notwithstanding the removal of the imperial seat the irruptions of the barbarous nations the civil wars of this country with the hardships of its several governments one can scarce imagine how so plentiful a soil should become so miserably unpeopled in comparison of what it once was we may reckon by a very moderate computation more inhabitants in the campania of old rome than are now in all italy and if we could number up those prodigious swarms that had settled themselves in every part of this delighful country i question not but that they would amount to more than can be found at present in any six parts of europe of the same extent this desolation appears no where greater than in the popes territories and yet there are several reasons would make a man expect to see these dominions the best regulated and most flourishing of any other in europe their prince is generally a man of learning and virtue mature in years and experience who has seldom any vanity or pleasure to gratify at his peoples expense and is neither encumbered with wife children or mistresses not to mention the supposed sanctity of his character which obliges him in a more particular manner to consult the good and happiness of mankind the direction of church and state are lodged entirely in his own hands so that his government is naturally free from those principles of faction and division which are mixed in the very composition of most others his subjects are always ready to fall in with his designs and are more at his disposal than any others of the most absolute government as they have a greater veneration for his person and not only court his favor but his blessing his country is extremely fruitful and has good havens both for the adriatic and mediterranean which is an advantage peculiar to himself and the neapolitans above the rest of the italians there is still a benefit the pope enjoys above all other sovereigns in drawing great sums out of spain germany and other countries that belong to foreign princes which one would fancy might be no small ease to his own subjects we may here add that there is no place in europe so much frequented by strangers whether they are such as come out of curiosity or such who are obliged to attend the court of rome on several occasions as are many of the cardinals and prelates that bring considerable sums into the popes dominions but notwithstanding all these promising circumstances and the long peace that has reigned so many years in italy there is not a more miserable people in europe than the popes subjects his state is thin of inhabitants and a great part of his soil uncultivated his subjects are wretchedly poor and idle and have neither sufficient manufactures nor traffic to employ em these ill effects may arise in a great measure out of the arbitrariness of the government but i think they are chiefly to be ascribed to the very genius of the roman catholic religion which here shows it self in its perfection it is not strange to find a country half unpeopled where so great a proportion of the inhabitants of both sexes is tied under such vows of chastity and where at the same time an inquisition forbids all recruits out of any other religion nor is it less easy to account for the great poverty and want that are to be met with in a country which invites into it such swarms of vagabonds under the title of pilgrims and shuts up in cloisters such an incredible multitude of young and lusty beggars who instead of increasing the common stock by their labor and industry lie as a dead weight on their fellow subjects and consume the charity that ought to support the sickly old and decrepid the many hospitals that are every where erected serve rather to encourage idleness in the people than to set em at work not to mention the great riches which lie useless in churches and religious houses with the multitude of festivals that must never be violated by trade or business to speak truly they are here so wholly taken up with mens souls that they neglect the good of their bodies and when to these natural evils in the government and religion there arises among em an avaritious pope who is for making a family it is no wonder if the people sink under such a complication of distempers yet it is to this humor of nepotism that rome owes its present splendour and magnificence for it would have been impossible to have furnished out so many glorious palaces with such a profusion of pictures statues and the like ornaments had not the riches of the people at several times fallen into the hands of many different families and of particular persons as we may observe though the bulk of the roman people was more rich and happy in the times of the commonwealth the city of rome received all its beauties and embellishments under the emperors it is probable the campania of rome as well as other parts of the popes territories would be cultivated much better than it is were there not such an exorbitant tax on corn which makes em plow up only such spots of ground as turn to the most advantage whereas were the money to be raised on lands with an exception to some of the more barren parts that might be taxfree for a certain term of years every one would turn his ground to the best account and in a little time perhaps bring more money into the popes treasury  the greatest pleasure i took in my journey from rome to naples was in seeing the fields towns and rivers that have been described by so many classic authors and have been the scenes of so many great actions for this whole road is extremely barren of curiosities it is worth while to have an eye on horaces voyage to brundisi when one passes this way for by comparing his several stages and the road he took with those that are observed at present we may have some idea of the changes that have been made in the face of this country since his time if we may guess at the common trevelling of persons of quality among the ancient romans from this poets description of his voyage we may conclude they seldom went above fourteen miles a day over the appian way which was more used by the noble romans than any other in italy as it led to naples baiae and the most delightful parts of the nation it is indeed very disagreeable to be carried in haste over this pavement  minus est gravis appia tardis hor lucan has described the very road from anxur to rome that horace took from rome to anxur it is not indeed the ordinary way at present nor is it marked out by the same places in both poets jamque and praecipites superaverat anxuris arces et qua a canal the marks of it still seen pontinas via dividit uda paludes qua sublime

went a long canal the muddy fenn divides and with a clear unsullied current glides dianas woody realms he next invades and crossing through the consecrated shades ascends high alba whence with new delight he sees the city rising to his sight   in my way to naples i crossed the two most considerable rivers of the campania felice that were formerly called the liris and vulturnus and are at present the garigliano and vulturno the first of these rivers has been deservedly celebrated by the latin poets for the gentleness of its course as the other for its rapidity and noise  rura quae

retirements of the ancient romans o nemus o fontes solidumque madentis arenae littus and aequoreis splendidus anxur aquis mar l  0 ye warbling fountains and ye shady trees where anxur feels the cool

our voyagewriters who passed this way more than once had observed the situation of these figures he would not have troubled himself with the dissertation that he has made upon them silius italicus has given us the names of several towns and rivers in the campania felice jam vero quos dives opum quos dives avorum et toto dabat ad bellum campania tractu ductorum adventum vicinis sedibus osci

l    naples my first days at naples were taken up with the sight of processions which are always very magnificent in the holyweek it would be tedious to give an account of the several representations of our saviors death and resurrection of the figures of himself the blessed virgin and the apostles which are carried up and down on this occasion with the cruel penances that several inflict on themselves and the multitude of ceremonies that attend these solemnities i saw at the same time a very splendid procession for the accession of the duke of anjou to the crown of spain in which the viceroy bore his part at the left hand of cardinal cantelmi to grace the parade they exposed at the same time the blood of st januarius which liquefyd at the approach of the saints head though as they say it was hard congealed before i had twice an opportunity of seeing the operation of this pretended miracle and must confess i think it so far from being a real miracle that i look upon it as one of the most bungling tricks that i ever saw yet it is this that makes as great a noise as any in the roman church and that monsieur paschal has hinted at among the rest in his marks of the true religion the modern neapolitans seem to have copied it out from one which was shown in a town of the kingdom of naples as long ago as in horaces time  dehinc gnatia lymphis iratis extructa dedit risusque jocosque dum flamma sine thura liquescere limine sacro persuadere cupit credat judaeus apella non ego  sat   l   at gnatia next arrived we laughed to see the superstitious crouds simplicity that in the sacred temple needs would try without a fire the unheated gums to fry believe who will the solemn sham not i   one may see at least that the heathen priesthood had the same kind of secret among them of which the roman catholics are now masters  i must confess though i had lived above a year in a roman catholic country i was surpised to see many ceremonies and superstitions in naples that are not so much as thought of in france but as it is certain there has been a kind of secret reformation made though not publicly owned in the roman catholic church since the spreading of the protestant religion so we find the several nations are recovered out of their ignorance in proportion as they converse more or less with those of the reformed churches for this reason the french are much more enlightened than the spaniards or italians on occasion of their frequent controversies with the huguenots and we find many of the roman catholic gentlemen of our own country who will not stick to laugh at the superstitions they sometimes meet with in other nations  i shall not be particular in describing the grandeur of the city of naples the beauty of its pavement the regularity of its buildings the magnificence of its churches and convents the multitude of its inhabitants or the delightfulness of its situation which so many others have done with a great deal of leisure and exactness if a war should break out the town has reason to apprehend the exacting of a large contribution or a bombardment it has but seven galleys a mole and two little castles which are capable of hindering an enemys approaches besides that the sea which lies near it is not subject to storms has no sensible flux and reflux and is so deep that a vessel of burden may come up to the very mole the houses are flat roofd to walk upon so that every bomb that fell on them would take effect  pictures statues and pieces of antiquity are not so common at naples as one might expect in so great and ancient a city of italy for the viceroys take care to send into spain every thing that is valuable of this nature two of their finest modern statues are those of apollo and minerva placed on each side of sannazariuss tomb on the face of this monument which is all of marble and very neatly wrought is represented in bas relief neptune among the satyrs to show that this poet was the inventer of piscatory eclogues i remember hugo grotius describes himself in one of his poems as the first that brought the muses to the seaside but he must be understood only of the poets of his own country i here saw the temple that sannazarius mentions in his invocation of the blessed virgin at the beginning of his de partu virginis which was all raised at his own expense  niveis tibi si solennia templis serta damus si mansuras tibi ponimus aras exciso in scopulo fluctus unde aurea canos despiciens celso de culmine mergilline attollit nautisque procul venientibus offert tu vatem ignarumque viae insuetumque labori diva moan  l   thou bright celestial goddess if to thee an acceptable temple i erect with fairest flowers and freshest garlands decked on towering rocks whence mergilline spies the ruffled deep in storms and tempests rise guide thou the pious poet nor refuse thine own propitious aid to his unpracticed muse   there are several very delightful prospects about naples especially from some of the religious houses for one seldom finds in italy a spot of ground more agreeable than ordinary that is not covered with a convent the cupolas of this city though there are many of them dont appear to the best advantage when one surveys them at a distance as being generally too high and narrow the marquis of medina cidonia in his viceroyalty made the shell of a house which he had not time to finish that commands a view of the whole bay and would have been a very noble building had he brought it to perfection  it stands so on the side of a mountain that it would have had a garden to every story by the help of a bridge which was to have been laid over each garden  the bay of naples is the most delightful one that i ever saw it lies in almost a round figure of about thirty miles in the diameter three parts of it are sheltered with a noble circuit of woods and mountains the high promontory of surrentum divides it from the bay of salernum between the utmost point of this promontory and the isle of caprea the sea enters by a straight of about three miles wide this island stands as a vast mole which seems to have been planted there on purpose to break the violence of the waves that run into the bay it lies longways almost in a parallel line to naples the excessive height of its rocks secures a great part of the bay from winds and waves which enter again between the other end of this island and the promontory of miseno the bay of naples is called the crater by the old geographers probably from this its resemblance to a round bowl half filled with liquor perhaps virgil who composed here a great part of his aeneids took from hence the plan of that beautiful harbor which he has made in his first book for the libyan port is but the neapolitan bay in little est in secessu longo locus insula portum efficit objectu laterum quibus omnis ab alto frangitur inque sinus scindit sese unda reductos hinc atque hinc vastae rupes geminique minantur in coelum scopuli quorum sub vertice late aequora tuta silent tum silvis scena coruscis desuper horrentique atrum nemus imminet umbra   aen within a long recess there lies a bay an island shades it from the rouling sea and forms a port secure for ships to ride broke by the jutting land on either side in double streams the briny waters glide between two rows of rocks a sylvan scene appears above and groves for ever green dryden  naples stands in the bosom of this bay and has the pleasantest situation in the world though by reason of its western mountains it wants an advantage vitruvius would have to the front of his palace of seeing the setting sun  one would wonder how the spaniards who have but very few forces in the kingdom of naples should be able to keep a people from revolting that has been famous for its mutinies and seditions in former ages but they have so well contrived it that though the subjects are miserably harassed and oppressed the greatest of their oppressors are those of their own body i shall not mention any thing of the clergy who are sufficiently reproached in most itineraries for the universal poverty that one meets with in this noble and plentiful kingdom a great part of the people is in a state of vassallage to the barons who are the harshest tyrants in the world to those that are under them the vassals indeed are allowed and invited to bring in their complaints and appeals to the viceroy who to foment divisions and gain the hearts of the populace does not stick at imprisoning and chastising their masters very severely on occasion the subjects of the crown are notwithstanding much more rich and happy than the vassals of the barons insomuch that when the king has been upon the point of selling a town to one of his barons the inhabitants have raised the sum upon themselves and presented it to the king that they might keep out of so insupportable a slavery another way the spaniards have taken to grind the neapolitans and yet to take off the odium from themselves has been by erecting several courts of justice with a very small pension for such as fit at the head of them so that they are tempted to take bribes keep causes undecided encourage lawsuits and do all they can to fleece the people that they may have wherewithal to support their own dignity it is incredible how great a multitude of retainers to the law there are at naples it is commonly said that when innocent the eleventh had desired the marquis of carpio to furnish him with thirty thousand head of swine the marquis answered him that for his swine he could not spare them but if his holiness had occasion for thirty thousand lawyers he had them at his service these gentlemen find a continual employ for the fiery temper of the neapolitans and hinder them from uniting in such common friendships and alliances as might endanger the safety of the government there are very few persons of consideration who have not a cause depending for when a neapolitan cavalier has nothing else to do he gravely shuts himself up in his closet and falls a tumbling over his papers to see if he can start a law suit and plague any of his neighbors so much is the genius of this people changed since statiuss time nulla foro rabies aut strictae jurgia legis morum jura viris solum et sine fascibus aequum sil l   by love of right and native justice led in the straight paths of equity they tread nor know the bar nor fear the judges frown unpracticed in the wranglings of the gown   there is another circumstance which makes the neapolitans in a very particular manner the oppressors of each other the gables of naples are very high on oil wine tobacco and indeed on almost every thing that can be eaten drank or worn there would have been one on fruit had not massianellos rebellion abolished it as it has probably put a stop to many others what makes these imposts more intolerable to the poorer sort they are laid on all butchers meat while at the same time the fowl and gibier are tax free besides all meat being taxed equally by the pound it happens that the duty lies heaviest on the coarser sorts which are most likely to fall to the share of the common people so that beef perhaps pays a third and veal a tenth of its price to the government a pound of either sort having the same tax fixed on it these gabels are most of them at present in the hands of private men for as the king of spain has had occasion for money he has borrowed it of the rich neapolitans on condition that they should receive the interest out of such or such gabels till he could repay them the principal  this he has repeated so often that at present there is scarce a single gabel unmortgagd so that there is no place in europe which pays greater taxes and at the same time no prince who draws less advantage from them in other countries the people have the satisfaction of seeing the money they give spent in the necessities defense or ornament of their state or at least in the vanity or pleasures of their prince but here most of it goes to the enriching of their fellow subjects if there was not so great a plenty of every thing in naples the people could not bear it the spaniard however reaps this advantage from the present posture of affairs that the murmurs of the peeple are turned upon their own countrymen and what is more considerable that almost all the persons of the greatest wealth and power in naples are engaged by their own interests to pay these impositions cheerfully and to support the government which has laid them on for this reason though the poorer sort are for the emperor few of the persons of consequence can endure to think of a change in their present establishment though there is no question but the king of spain will reform most of these abuses by breaking or retrenching the power of the barons by cancelling several unnecessary employs or by ransoming or taking the gabels into his own hands i have been told too there is a law of charles the fifth something like our statute of mortmain which has laid dormant ever since his time and will probably have new life put into it under the reign of an active prince the inhabitants of naples have been always very notorious for leading a life of laziness and pleasure which i take to arise partly out of the wonderful plenty of their country that does not make labor so necessary to them and partly out of the temper of their climate that relaxes the fibers of their bodies and disposes the people to such an idle indolent humor whatever it proceeds from we find they were formerly as famous for it as they are at present  this was perhaps the reason that the ancients tell us one of the sirens was buried in this city which thence received the name of parthenope  improba siren

war soft sleep and downy ease inhabit there and dreams unbroken with intruding care   the antiquities and natural curiosities that lie near the city of naples at about eight miles distance from naples lies a very noble scene of antiquities what they call virgils tomb is the first that one meets with on the way thither it is certain this poet was buried at naples but i think it is almost as certain that his tomb stood on the other side of the town which looks toward vesuvio by this tomb is the entry into the grotto of pausilypo the common people of naples believe it to have been wrought by magic and that virgil was the magician who is in greater repute among the neapolitans for having made the grotto than the aeneid  if a man would form to himself a just idea of this place he must fancy a vast rock undermined from one end to the other and a highway running through it near as long and as broad as the mall in st jamess park this subterraneous passage is much mended since seneca gave so bad a character of it the entry at both ends is higher than the middle parts of it and sinks by degrees to fling in more light upon the rest toward the middle are two large funnels bored through the roof of the grotto to let in light and fresh air  there are no where about the mountain any vast heaps of stones though it is certain the great quantities of em that are dug out of the rock could not easily conceal themselves had they not probably been consumed in the moles and buildings of naples this confirmed me in a conjecture which i made at the first sight of this subterraneous passage that it was not at first designed so much for a highway as for a quarry of stone but that the inhabitants finding a double advantage by it hewed it into the form we now see perhaps the same design gave the original to the sibyls grotto considering the prodigious multitude of palaces that stood in its neighborhood  i remember when i was at chateaudun in france i met with a very curious person a member of one of the german universities he had stayed a day or two in the town longer than ordinary to take the measures of several empty spaces that had been cut in the sides of a neighboring mountain some of em were supported with pillars formed out of the rock some were made in the fashion of galleries and some not unlike amphitheaters the gentleman had made to himself several ingenious hypotheses concerning the use of these subterraneous apartments and from thenee collected the vast magnificence and luxury of the ancient chateaudunois but upon communicating his thoughts on this subject to one of the most learned of the place he was not a little surpised to hear that these stupendous works of art were only so many quarries of freestone that had been wrought into different figures according as the veins of it directed the workmen  about five miles from the grotto of pausilypo lie the remains of puteoli and bajae in a soft air and a delicious situation  the country about em by reason of its vast caverns and subterraneous fires has been miserably torn in pieces by earthquakes so that the whole face of it is quite changed from what it was formerly the sea has overwhelmed a multitude of palaces which may be seen at the bottom of the water in a calm day  the lucrine lake is but a puddle in comparison of what it once was its springs having been sunk in an earthquake or stopped up by mountains that have fallen upon em the lake of avernus formerly so famous for its steams of poison is now plentifully stocked with fish and fowl mount gaurus from one of the fruitfullest parts in italy is become one of the most barren several fields which were laid out in beautiful groves and gardens are now naked plains smoking with sulphur or encumbered with hills that have been thrown up by eruptions of fire the works of art lie in no less disorder than those of nature for that which was once the most beautiful spot of ialy covered with temples and palaces adorned by the greatest of the roman commonwealth embelishd by many of the roman emperors and celebrated by the best of their poets has now nothing to show but the ruins of its ancient splendour and a great magnificence in confusion  the mole of puteoli has been mistaken by several authors for caligulas bridge they have all been led into this error from the make of it because it stands on arches but to pass over the many arguments that may be brought against this opinion i shall here take away the foundation of it by setting down an inscription mentioned by julius capitolinus in the life of antoninus pius who was the repairer of this mole imp caesari divi hadriano filio divi trajani parthici nepoti divi nervae pronepoti t act hadriano antonino aug pio etc quod super caetera beneficia ad hujus etiam tutelam portus pilarum viginti molem cum sumptu fornicum reliquo ex aeratio suo largitus est  it would have been very difficult to have made such a mole as this of puteli in a place where they had not so natural a commodity as the earth of puzzuola which immediately hardens in the water and after a little lying in it looks rather like stone than mortar it was this that gave the ancient romans an opportunity of making so many encroachments on the sea and of laying the foundations of their villas and palaces within the very borders of it as l   o    l   o   l   o    epist l   horace has elegantly described it more than once  about four years ago they dug up a great piece of marble near puzzuola with several figures and letters engraven round it which have given occasion to some disputes among the antiquaries vid gronovium fa bretti bulifon etc but they all agree that it is the pedestal of a statue erected to tiberius by the fourteen cities of asia which were flung down by an earthquake the same that according to the opinion of many learned men happened at our saviors crucifixion they have found in the letters which are still legible the names of the several cities and discover in each figure something particular to the city of which it represents the genius there are two medals of tiberius stamped on the same occasion with this inscription to one of em civitatibus asiae restitutis the emperor is represented in both sitting with a patera in one hand and a spear in the other civitatibvs asiae restitvtis caesar divi avg f augustus on max tr pot xxxiii ti   it is probable this might have been the posture of the statue which in all likelihood does not lie far from the place where they took up the pedestal for they say there were other great pieces of marble near it and several of em inscribed but that no body would be at the charges of bringing them to light the pedestal it self lay neglected in an open field when i saw it i shall not be particular on the ruins of the amphitheater the ancient reservoirs of water the sibyls grotto the centum camerae the sepulcher of agrippina neros mother with several other antiquities of less note that lie in the neighborhood of this bay and have been often described by many others i must confess after having surveyed the antiquities about naples and rome i cannot but think that our admiration of em does not so much arise out of their greatness as uncommonness  there are indeed many extraordinary ruins but i believe a traveller would not be so much astonished at em did he find any works of the same kind in his own country amphitheatres triumphal arches baths grottos catacombs rotundas highways paved for so great a length bridges of such an amazing height subterraneous buildings for the reception of rain and snowwater are most of em at present out of fashion and only to be met with among the antiquities of italy we are therefore immediately surpised when we see any considerable sums laid out in any thing of this nature though at the same time there is many a gothic cathedral in england that has cost more pains and money than several of these celebrated works among the ruins of the old heathen temples they showed me what they call the chamber of venus which stands a little behind her temple it is wholly dark and has several figures on the cieling wrought in stucco that seem to represent lust and strength by the emblems of naked jupiters and gladiators tritons and centaurs etc so that one would guess it has formerly been the scene of many lewd mysteries on the other side of naples are the catacombs these must have been full of stench and loathsomness if the dead bodies that lay in em were left to rot in open nitches as an eminent author of our own country imagines but upon examining em i find they were each of em stopped up without doubt as soon as the corpse was laid in it for at the mouth of the nitch one always finds the rock cut into little channels to fasten the board or marble that was to close it up and i think i did not see one which had not still some mortar sticking in it in some i found pieces of tiles that exactly tallyd with the channel and in others a little wall of bricks that sometimes stopped up above a quarter of the nitch the rest having been broken down  proculuss sepulcher seems to have a kind of mosaic work on its covering for i observed at one end of it several little pieces of marble ranged together after that manner it is probable they were adorned more or less according to the quality of the dead one would indeed wonder to find such a multitude of nitches unstoppd and i cannot imagine any body should take the pains to do it who was not in quest of some supposed treasure  bajae was the winter retreat of the old romans that being the proper season to enjoy the bajani soles and the mollis lucrinus as on the contrary tibur tusculum prenaeste alba cajeta mons circeius anxur and the like airy mountains and promontories were their retirements during the heats of summer dum nos blanda tenent jucundi stagna lucrini et quae pumiceis fontibus antra calent tu colis argivi regnum faustine coloni vid hor l   od    quo te

colles gelida vos vincite bruma nunc tiburtinis cedite frigoribus mar l   ep     while near the lucrine lake consumed to death i draw the sultry air and gasp for breath where steams of sulphur raise a stifling heat and through the pores of the warm pumice sweat you taste the cooling breeze where nearer home the twentieth pillar marks the mile from rome and now the sun to the bright lion turns and baja with redoubled fury burns then briny seas and tasteful springs farewell where fountainnymphs confused with nereids dwell in winter you may all the world despise but now it is tivoli that bears the prize   the natural curiosities about naples are as numerous and extraordinary as the artificial i shall set them down as i have done the other without any regard to their situation the grotto del cani is famous for the poisonous steams which float within a foot of its surface the sides of the grotto are marked with green as high as the malignity of the vapor reaches the common experiments are as follow a dog that has his nose held in the vapor loses all signs of life in a very little time but if carried into the open air or thrown into a neighboring lake he immediately recovers if he is not quite gone a torch snuff and all goes out in a moment when dipped into the vapor a pistol cannot take fire in it i split a reed and laid in the channel of it a train of gunpowder so that one end of the reed was above the vapor and the other at the bottom of it and i found though the steam was strong enough to hinder a pistol from taking fire in it and to quench a lighted torch that it could not intercept the train of fire when it had once begun flashing nor hinder it from running to the very end this experiment i repeated twice or thrice to see if i could quite dissipate the vapor which i did in so great a measure that one might easily let off a pistol in it i observed how long a dog was in expiring the first time and after his recovery and found no sensible difference a viper bore it nine minutes the first time we put it in and ten the second when we brought it out after the first trial it took such a vast quantity of air into its lungs that it swelled almost twice as big as before and it was perhaps on this stock of air that it lived a minute longer the second time doctor connor made a discourse in one of the academies at rome upon the subject of this grotto which he has since printed in england he attributes the death of animals and the extinction of lights to a great rarefaction of the air caused by the heat and eruption of the steams but how is it possible for these steams though in never so great quantity to resist the pressure of the whole atmosphere and as for the heat it is but very inconsiderable however to satisfy my self i placed a thin viol well stopped up with wax within the smoke of the vapor which would certainly have burst in an air rarefyd enough to kill a dog or quench a torch but nothing followed upon it however to take away all further doubt i borrowed a weatherglass and so fixed it in the grotto that the stagnum was wholly covered with the vapor but i could not perceive the quicksilver sunk after half an hours standing in it this vapor is generally supposed to be sulphurous though i can see no reason for such a supposition he that dips his hand in it finds no smell that it leaves upon it and though i put a whole bundle of lighted brimstone matches to the smoke they all went out in an instant as if immersed in water whatever is the composition of the vapor let it have but one quality of being very glewy or viscous and i believe it will mechanicaly solve all the phenomenon of the grotto it is unctuousness will make it heavy and unfit for mounting higher than it does unless the heat of the earth which is just strong enough to agitate and bear it up at a little distance from the surface were much greater than it is to rarifie and scatter it it will be too gross and thick to keep the lungs in play for any time so that animals will die in it sooner or later as their blood circulates slower or faster fire will live in it no longer than in water because it wraps it self in the same manner about the flame and by its continuity hinders any quantity of air or nitre from coming to its succor the parts of it however are not so compact as those of liquors nor therefore tenacious enough to intercept the fire that has once caught a train of gunpowder for which reason they may be quite broken and dispersed by the repetition of this experiment there is an unctuous clammy vapor that arises from the stum of grapes when they lie mashd together in the vat which puts out a light when dipped into it and perhaps would take away the breath of weaker animals were it put to the trial  it would be endless to reckon up the different baths to be met with in a country that so much abounds in sulphur there is scarce a disease which has not one adapted to it a stranger is generally led into that they call ciceros bath and several voyagewriters pretend there is a cold vapor rising from the bottom of it which refreshes those who stoop into it it is true the heat is much more supportable to one that stoops than to one that stands upright because the steams of sulphur gather in the hollow of the arch about a mans head and are therefore much thicker and warmer in that part than at the bottom the three lakes of agnano avernus and the lucrin have now nothing in them particular the monte novo was thrown out by an eruption of fire that happened in the place where now the mountain stands the sulfatara is very surprising to one who has not seen mount vesuvio but there is nothing about naples nor indeed in any part of italy which deserves our admiration so much as this mountain i must confess the idea i had of it did not answer the real image of the place when i came to see it i shall therefore give the description of it as it then lay  this mountain stands at about six english miles distance from naples though by reason of its height it seems much nearer to those that survey it from the town in our way to it we passed by what was one of those rivers of burning matter that ran from it in a late eruption this looks at a distance like a new plowed land but as you come near it you see nothing but a long heap of heavy disjointed clods lying one upon another there are innumerable cavities and interstices among the several pieces so that the surface is all broken and irregular sometimes a great fragment stands like a rock above the rest sometimes the whole heap lies in a kind of channel and in other places has nothing like banks to confine it but rises four or five foot high in the open air without spreading abroad on either side this i think is a plain demonstration that these rivers were not as they are usually represented so many streams of running matter for how could a liquid that lay hardening by degrees settle in such a furrowed uncompact surface were the river a confusion of never so many different bodies if they had been all actually dissolved they would at least have formed one continued crust as we see the scorium of metals always gathers into a solid piece let it be compounded of a thousand heterogeneous parts i am apt to think therefore that these huge unwieldy lumps that now lie one upon another as if thrown together by accident remained in the melted matter rigid and unliquifyd floating in it like cakes of ice in a river and that as the fire and ferment gradually abated they adjusted themseves together as well as their irregular figures would permit and by this means fell into such an interrupted disorderly heap as we now find it what was the melted matter lies at the bottom out of sight after having quitted the side of this long heap which was once a stream of fire we came to the roots of the mountain and had a very troublesome march to gain the top of it it is covered on all sides with a kind of burnt earth very dry and crumbled into powder as if it had been artificially sifted it is very hot under the feet and mixed with several burnt stones and cakes of cinders which have been thrown out at different times a man sinks almost a foot in the earth and generally loses half a step by sliding backwards when we had climbed this mountain we discovered the top of it to be a wide naked plain smoking with sulphur in several places and probably undermined with fire for we concluded it to be hollow by the sound it made under our feet in the midst of this plain stands a high hill in the shape of a sugar loaf so very steep that there would be no mounting or descending it were not it made up of such a loose crumbled earth as i have before described the air of this place must be very much impregnated with saltpeter as appears by the specks of it on the sides of the mountain where one can scarce find a stone that has not the top white with it after we had with much ado conquered this hill we saw in the midst of it the present mouth of vesuvio that goes shelving down on all sides till above a hundred yards deep as near as we could guess and has about three or four hundred in the diameter for it seems a perfect round this vast hollow is generally filled with smoke but by the advantage of a wind that blew for us we had a very clear and distinct sight of it the sides appear all over stained with mixtures of white green red and yellow and have several rocks standing out of them that look like pure brimstone the bottom was entirely covered and though we looked very narrowly we could see nothing like a hole in it the smoke breaking through several imperceptible cracks in many places the very middle was firm ground when we saw it as we concluded from the stones we flung upon it and i question not but one might then have crossed the bottom and have gone up on the other side of it with very little danger unless from some accidental breath of wind in the late eruptions this great hollow was like a vast caldron filled with glowing and melted matter which as it boiled over in any part ran down the sides of the mountain and made five such rivers as that beforementioned in proportion as the heat slackened this burning matter must have subsided within the bowels of the mountain and as it sunk very leisurely had time to cake together and form the bottom which covers the mouth of that dreadful vault that lies underneath it the next eruption or earthquake will probably break in pieces this false bottom and quite change the present face of things  this whole mountain shaped like a sugar loaf has been made at several times by the prodigious quantities of earth and cinders which have been flung up out of the mouth that lies in the midst of them so that it increases in bulk at every eruption the ashes still falling down the sides of it like the sand in an hourglass a gentleman of naples told me that in his memory it had gained twenty foot in thickness and i question not but in length of time it will cover the whole plain and make one mountain with that on which it now stands  in those parts of the sea that are not far from the roots of this mountain they find sometimes a very fragrant oil which is sold dear and makes a rich perfume the surface of the sea is for a little space covered with its bubbles during the time that it rises which they skim off into their boats and afterward set a separating in pots and jars they say its sources never run but in a calm warm weather the agitations of the water perhaps hinder them from discovering it at other times  among the natural curiosities of naples i cannot forbear mentioning their manner of furnishing the town with snow which they here use instead of ice because as they say it cools or congeals any liquor sooner there is a great quantity of it consumed yearly for they drink very few liquors not so much as water that have not lain in fresco and every body from the highest to the lowest makes use of it insomuch that a scarcity of snow would raise a mutiny at naples as much as a dearth of corn or provisions in another country to prevent this the king has sold the monopoly of it to certain persons who are obliged to furnish the city with it all the year at so much the pound they have a high mountain at about eighteen miles from the town which has several pits dug into it here they employ many poor people at such a season of the year to roll in vast balls of snow which they ram together and cover from the sunshine out of these reservoirs of snow they cut several lumps as they have occasion for them and send them on asses to the seaside where they are carried off in boats and distributed to several shops at a settled price that from time to time supply the whole city of naples while the banditti continued their disorders in this kingdom they often put the snowmerchants under contribution and threatened them if they appeared tardy in their payments to destroy their magazines which they say might easily have been effected by the infusion of some barrels of oil  it would have been tedious to have put down the many descriptions that the latin poets have made of several of the places mentioned in this chapter i shall therefore conclude it with the general map which silius italicus has given us of this great bay of naples most of the places he mentions lie within the same prospect and if i have passed over any of them it is because i shall take them in my way by sea from naples to rome stagna inter celebrem nunc mitia monstrat avernum tum tristi nemore

poem because agrippa who lived between hannibal and silius had cut down the woods that enclosed the lake and hindered these noxious steams from dissipating which were immediately scattered as soon as the winds and fresh air were let in among them  the isle of caprea having stayed longer at naples than i at first designed i could not dispense with my self from making a little voyage to the isle of caprea as being very desirous to see a place which had been the retirement of augustus for some time and the residence of tiberius for several years the island lies four miles in length from east to west and about one in breadth the western part for about two miles in length is a continued rock vastly high and inaccessible on the seaside it has however the greatest town in the island that goes under the name of anocaprea and is in several places covered with a very fruitful soil the eastern end of the isle rises up in precipices very near as high though not quite so long as the western between these eastern and western mountains lies a slip of lower ground which runs across the island and is one of the pleasantest spots i have seen it is hid with vines figs oranges almonds olives myrtles and fields of corn which look extremely fresh and beautiful and make up the most delightful little landscape imaginable when they are surveyed from the tops of the neighboring mountains here stands the town of caprea the bishops palace and two or three convents in the midst of this fruitful tract of land rises a hill that was probably covered with buildings in tiberiuss time there are still several ruins on the sides of it and about the top are found two or three dark galleries low built and covered with masons work though at present they appear overgrown with grass i entered one of em that is a hundred paces in length i observed as some of the countrymen were digging into the sides of this mountain that what i took for solid earth was only heaps of brick stone and other rubbish skinnd over with a covering of vegetables but the most considerable ruin is that which stands on the very extremity of the eastern promontory where are still some apartments left very high and arched at top i have not indeed seen the remains of any ancient roman buildings that have not been roofd with either vaults or arches the rooms i am mentioning stand deep in the earth and have nothing like windows or chimnies which makes me think they were formerly either bathing places or reservoirs of water an old hermit lives at present among the ruins of this palace who lost his companion a few years ago by a fall from the precipice he told me they had often found medals and pipes of lead as they dug among the rubbish and that not many years ago they discovered a paved road running under ground from the top of the mountain to the seaside which was afterward confirmed to me by a gentleman of the island there is a very noble prospect from this place on the one side lies a vast extent of seas that runs abroad further than the eye can reach just opposite stands the green promontory of surrentum and on the other side the whole circuit of the bay of naples this prospect according to tacitus was more agreeable before the burning of vesuvio that mountain probably which after the first eruption looked like a great pile of ashes was in tiberiuss time shaded with woods and vineyards for i think martials epigram may here serve as a comment to tacitus hic est pampineis viridis vesuvius umbris presserat hic madidos nobilis uva lacus haec juga quam nisae colles plus bacchus amavit hoc nuper satyri monte dedere choros haec veneris seeds lacedaemone gratior illi hic locus herculeo nomine clarus erat cuncta jacent flammis and tristi mersa favilla nec superi vellent hoc licuisse

undistinguished heaps deform the ground the gods themselves the ruined seats bemoan and blame the mischiefs that themselves have done   this view must still have been more pleasant when the whole bay was encompassed with so long a range of buildings that it appeared to those who looked on it at a distance but as one continued city on both the shores of that fruitful bottom which i have before mentioned are still to be seen the marks of ancient edifices particularly on that which looks toward the south there is a little kind of mole which seems to have been the foundation of a palace unless we may suppose that the pharos of caprea stood there which statius takes notice of in his poem that invites his wife to naples and is i think the most natural among the silvae nec desunt variae circum

rich pavement under ground as they had occasion to turn up the earth that lay upon em one still sees on the bendings of these mountains the marks of several ancient scales of stairs by which they used to ascend em the whole island is so unequal that there were but few diversions to be found in it without doors but what recommended it most to tiberius was its wholesome air which is warm in winter and cool in summer and its inaccessible coasts which are generally so very steep that a handful of men might defend em against a powerful army  we need not doubt but tiberius had his different residences according as the seasons of the year and his different sets of pleasure required suetonius says duodecim villas totidem nominibus ornavit the whole island was probably cut into several easy ascents planted with variety of palaces and adorned with as great a multitude of groves and gardens as the situation of the place would suffer the works under ground were however more extraordinary than those above it for the rocks were all undermined with highways grottos galleries bagnios and several subterraneous retirements that suited with the brutal pleasures of the emperor one would indeed very much wonder to see such small appearances of the many works of art that were formerly to be met with in this island were we not told that the romans after the death of tiberius sent hither an army of pioneers on purpose to demolish the buildings and deface the beauties of the island  in sailing round caprea we were entertained with many rude prospects of rocks and precipices that rise in several places half a mile high in perpendicular at the bottom of em are caves and grottos formed by the continual breaking of the waves upon em i entered one which the inhabitants call grotto oscuro and after the light of the sun was a little worn off my eyes could see all the parts of it distinctly by a glimmering reflection that played upon em from the surface of the water the mouth is low and narrow but after having entered pretty far in the grotto opens it self on both sides in an oval figure of an hundred yeads from one extremity to the other as we were toln for it would not have been safe measuring of it the roof is vaulted and distills fresh water from every part of it which fell upon us as fast as the first droppings of a shower the inhabitants and neapolitans who have heard of tiberiuss grottos will have this to be one of em but there are several reasons that show it to be natural for besides the little use we can conceive of such a dark cavern of salt waters there are no where any marks of the chissel the sides are of a soft mouldering stone and one sees many of the like hollow spaces worn in the bottoms of the rocks as they are more or less able to resist the impressions of the water that beats against em  not far from this grotto lie the sirenum scopuli which virgil and ovid mention in aeneass voyage they are two or three sharp rocks that stand about a stones throw from the south side of the island and are generally beaten by waves and tempests which are much more violent on the south than on the north of caprea jamque adeo scopulos sirenum advecta subibat difficiles quondam multorumque ossibus albos tum rauca assiduo long sale saxa sonabant aen glides by the syrens cliffs a shelfy coast long infamous for ships and sailors lost and white with bones the impetuous ocean roars and rocks rebellow from the sounding shores dryden  i have before said that they often find medals in this island many of those they call the spintriae which aretin has copied have been dug up here i know none of the antiquaries that have written on this subject and find nothing satisfactory of it where i thought it most likely to be met with in patins edition of suetonius illustrated by medals those i have conversed with about it are of opinion they were made to ridicule the brutality of tiberius though i cannot but believe they were stamped by his order they are unquestionably antique and no bigger than medals of the third magnitude they bear on one side some lewd invention of that hellish society which suetonius calls monstrosi concubitus repertores and on the other the number of the medal i have seen of em as high as to twenty i cannot think they were made as a jest on the emperor because raillery on coins is of a modern date i know but two in the upper empire besides the spintriae that lie under any suspicion of it the first is one of marcus aurelius where in compliment to the emperor and empress they have stamped on the reverse the figure of venus caressing mars and endeavoring to detain him from the wars veneri victrici  quoniam belli fera maenera mavors armipotens regit in gremium qui saepe tuum se rejicit aeterno devinctus volnere amoris lucr l    the venus has faustinas face her lover is a naked figure with a helmet on his head and a shield on his arm tu scabie frueris mali quod in aggere rodit qui tegitur parma and galea  juv sat    this unluckily brings to mind faustinas fondness for the gladiator and is therefore interpreted by many as a hidden piece of satyr but besides that such a thought was inconsistent with the gravity of a senate how can one imagine that the fathers would have dared affront the wife of aurelius and the mother of commodus or that they could think of giving offense to an empress whom they afterward deifyd and to an emperor that was the darling of the army and people  the other medal is a golden one of gallienus preserved in the french kings cabinet it is inscribed gallienae augustae pax ubique and was stamped at a time when the emperors father was in bondage and the empire torn in pieces by several pretenders to it yet if one considers the strange stupidity of this emperor with the senseless security which appears in several of his sayings that are still left on record one may very well believe this coin was of his own invention we may be sure if raillery had once entered the old roman coins we should have been overstockd with medals of that nature if we consider there were often rival emperors proclaimed at the same time who endeavored at the lessening of each others character and that most of em were succeeded by such as were enemies to their predecessor these medals of tiberius were never current money but rather of the nature of medalions which seem to have been made on purpose to perpetuate the discoveries of that infamous society suetonius tells us that their monstrous inventions were registered several ways and preserved in the emperors private apartments cubicula plurifariam disposita tabellis ac sigillis lascivissimarum picturarum and figurarum adornavit librisque elephantidis instruxit ne cui in opera edenda exemplar impetratae schemae deesset the elephantis here mentioned is probably the same martial takes notice of for her book of postures in sabellum facundos mihi de libidinosis legisti nimium sabelle versus quales nec didymi sciunt puellae nec molles elephantidos libelli sunt illic veneris novae figurae quales etc lib    ep     ovid mentions the same kind of pictures that found a place even in augustiuss cabinet scilicet in domibus vestris ut prisca virorum artifici fulgent corpora picta manu sic quae concubitus varios venerisque figuras exprimat est aliquo parva tabella loco de trist lib    there are several of the sigilla or seals suetonius speaks of to be met with in collections of ancient intaglios  but i think what puts it beyond all doubt that these coins were rather made by the emperors order than as a satyr on him is because they are now found in the very place that was the scene of these his unnatural lusts  quem rupes caprearum tetra latebit incesto possessa seni  cl de  to cons hon who has not heard of capreas guilty shore polluted by the rank old emperor   from naples to rome by sea i took a falucca at naples to carry me to rome that i might not be forced to run over the same sights a second time and might have an opportunity of seeing many things in a road which our voyagewriters have not so particularly described as in my journey from rome to naples i had horace for my guide so i had the pleasure of seeing my voyage from naples to rome described by virgil it is indeed much easier to trace out the way aeneas took than that of horace because virgil has marked it out by capes islands and other parts of nature which are not so subject to change or decay as are towns cities and the works of art mount pausilypo makes a beautiful prospect to those who pass by it at a small distance from it lies the little island of nisida adorned with a great variety of plantations rising one above another in so beautiful an order that the whole island looks like a large terracegarden it has two little ports and is not at present troubled with any of those noxious steams that lucan mentions  tali spiramine nesis emittit stygium nebulosis aera saxis lib   nesis high rocks such stygian air produce and the blue breathing pestilence diffuse   from nifida we rowed to cape miseno the extremity of this cape has a long cleft in it which was enlarged and cut into shape by agrippa who made this the great port for the roman fleet that served in the mediterranean as that of ravenna held the ships designed for the adriatic and archipelago the highest end of this promontory rises in the fashion of a sepulcher or monument to those that survey it from the land which perhaps might occasion virgils burying misenus under it i have seen a grave italian author who has written a very large book on the campania felice that from virgils descrption of this mountain concludes it was called aerius before misenus had given it a new name at pius aeneas ingenti mole sepulchrum imponit suaque arma viro remumque tubamque monte sub aerio qui nunc misenus ab illo dicitur aeternumque tenet per saecula nomen aen l    there are still to be seen a few ruins of old misenum but the most considerable antiquity of the place is a set of galleries that are hewn into the rock and are much more spacious than the piscina mirabilis some will have them to have been a reservoir of water but others more probably suppose them to have been neros baths i lay the first night on the isle of procita which is pretty well cultivated and contains about four thousand inhabitants who are all vassals to the marquis de vasto  the next morning i went to see the isle of ischia that stands further out into the sea the ancient poets call it inarime and lay typhaeus under it by reason of its eruptions of fire there has been no eruption for near these three hundred years the last was very terrible and destroyed a whole city at present there are scarce any marks left of a subterraneous fire for the earth is cold and overrun with grass and shrubs where the rocks will suffer it there are indeed several little cracks in it through which there issues a constant smoke but it is probable this arises from the warm springs that feed the many baths with which this island is plentifully stocked i observed about one of these breathing passages a spot of myrtles that flourish within the steam of these vapors and have a continual moisture hanging upon them on the south of ischia lies a round lake of about three quarters of a mile diameter separate from the sea by a narrow tract of land it was formerly a roman port on the north end of the island stands the town and castle on an exceeding high rock divided from the body of the island and inaccessible to an enemy on all sides this island is larger but much more rocky and barren than procita virgil makes them both shake at the fall of part of the mole of bajae that stood at a few miles distance from them qualis in euboico bajarum littore

wall prone to the deep the stones disjointed fall off the vast pile the scattered ocean flies black sands discolored froth and mingled mud arise the frighted billows roll and seek the shores trembles high prochyta and ischia roars typhaeus roars beneath by joves command astonished at the flaw that shakes the land soon shifts his weary side and scarce awake with wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back dryden  i dont see why virgil in this noble comparison has given the epithet of alta to procita for it is not only no high island in it self but is much lower than ischia and all the points of land that lie within its neighborhood i should think alta was joined adverbially with tremit did virgil make use of so equivocal a syntax i cannot forbear inserting in this place the lame imitation silius italicus has made of the foregoing passage haud aliter structo tyrrhena ad littora saxo pugnatura fretis subter caecisque procellis pila immane sonans impingitur ardua ponto immugit nereus divisaque caerula pulsu illisum accipiunt irata sub aequora montem l   so a vast fragment of the bajan mole that fixed amid the tyrrhene waters braves the beating tempests and insulting

earth that is fallen into it they suppose it to have been the other mouth of the sibyls grotto it lies indeed in the same line with the entrance near the avernus is faced alike with the opus reticulatum and has still the marks of chambers that have been cut into the sides of it among the many fables and conjectures which have been made on this grotto i think it is highly probable that it was once inhabited by such as perhaps thought it a better shelter against the sun than any other kind of building or at least that it was made with smaller trouble and expense as for the mosaic and other works that may be found in it they may very well have been added in later ages according as they thought fit to put the place to different uses the story of the cimmerians is indeed clogged with improbabilities as strabo relates it but it is very likely there was in it some foundation of truth homers description of the cimmerians whom he places in these parts answers very well to the inhabitants of such a long dark cavern the gloomy race in subterraneous cells among surrounding shades and darkness dwells hid in the unwholesome covert of the night theyshun the approaches of the

every one who sees this vast rent in so high a rock and observes how exactly the unequal parts of one side tally with the concave of the other must be satisfied that it was the effect of an earthquake though i question not but it either happened long before the time of the latin writers or in the darker ages since for otherwise i cannot but think they would have taken notice of its original the port town castle and antiquities of this place have been often described  we touched next at monte circeio which homer calls insula aeea whether it be that it was formerly an island or that the greek sailors of his time thought it so it is certain they might easily have been deceived by its appearance as being a very high mountain joined to the main land by a narrow tract of earth that is many miles in length and almost of a level with the surface of the water the end of this promontory is very rocky and mightily exposed to the winds and waves which perhaps gave the first rise to the howlings of wolves and the roarings of linos that used to be heard thence this i had a very lively idea of being forced to lie under it a whole night virgils description of aeneas passing by this

sped their happy flight dryden  virgil calls this promontory aeeae insula circes in the third aeneid but it is the hero and not the poet that speaks it may however be looked upon as an intimation that he himself thought it an island in aeneass time as for the thick woods which not only virgil but homer mentions in the beautiful description that plutarch and longinus have taken notice of they are most of em grubbd up since the promontory has been cultivated and inhabited though there are still many spots of it which show the natural inclination of the soil leans that way  the next place we touched upon was nettuno where we found nothing remarkable besides the extreme poverty and laziness of the inhabitans at two miles distance from it lie the ruins of antium that are spread over a great circuit of land there are still left the foundations of several buildings and what are always the last parts that perish in a ruin many subterraneous grottos and passages of a great length the foundations of neros port are still to be seen it was altogether artificial and composed of huge moles running round it in a kind of circular figure except where the ships were to enter and had about three quarters of a mile in its shortest diameter though the making of this port must have cost prodigious sums of money we find no medal of it and yet the same emperor has a medal struck in his own name for the port of ostia which in reality was a work of his predecessor claudius the last pope was at considerable charges to make a little kind of harbor in this place and to convey fresh water to it which was one of the artifices of the grand duke to divert his holiness from his project of making civitavecchia a free port there lies between antium and nettuno a cardinals villa which is one of the pleasantest for walks fountains shades and prospects that i ever saw  antium was formerly famous for the temple of fortune that stod in it all agree there were two fortunes worshipped here which suetonius calls the fortunae antiates and martial the sorores antii some are of opinion that by these two goddesses were meant the two nemeses one of which rewarded good men as the other punished the wicked fabretti and others are apt to believe that by the two fortunes were only meant in general the goddess who sent prosperity or she who sent afflictions to mankind and produce in their behalf an ancient monument found in this very place and superscribd fortunae felici which indeed may favor one opinion as well as the other and shows at least they are not mistaken in the general sense of their division i dont know whether any body has taken notice that this double function of the goddess gives a considerable light and beauty to the ode which horace has addressed to her the whole poem is a prayer to fortune that she would prosper caesars arms and confound his enemies so that each of the goddesses has her task assigned in the poets prayer and we may observe the invocation is divided between the two deities the first line relating indifferently to either that which i have marked speaks to the goddess of prosperity or if you please to the nemesis of the good and the other to the goddess of adversity or to the nemesis of the wicked o diva gratum quae regis antium praesens vel imo tollere de gradu mortale corpus vel superbos vertere funeribus triumphos etc great goddess antiums guardian power whose force is strong and quick to raise the lowest to the highest place or with a wondrous fall to bring the haughty lower and turn proud triumphs to a funeral etc creech  if we take the first interpretation of the two fortunes for the double nemesis the compliment to caesar is the greater and the fifth stanza clearer than the commentators usually make it for the clavi trabales cunei uncus liquidumque plumbum were actually used in the punishment of criminals  our next stage brought us to the mouth of the tiber into which we entered with some danger the sea being generally very rough in these parts where the river rushes into it the season of the year the muddiness of the stream with the many green trees hanging over it put me in mind of the delightful image that virgil has given us when aeneas took the first view of it atque hic aeneas ingentem ex aequore lucum prospicit hunc inter fluvio tiberinus amaeno vorticibus rapidis et multa flavus arena in mare prorumpit variae circumque supraque assuetae ripis volucres et fluminis alveo aethera mulcebant cantu lucoque volabant flectere iter sociis terraeque advertere proras imperat et laetus fluvio succedit opaco aen l   the trojan from the main beheld a wood which thick with shades and a brown horror stood betwixt the trees the tiber took his course with whirlpools dimpled and with downward force that drove the sand along he took his way and rolled his yellow billows to the sea about him and above and round the wood the birds that haunt the borders of his flood that bathed within or baskd upon his side to tuneful songs their narrow throats applied the captain gives command the joyful train glide through the gloomy shade and leave the main dryden  it is impossible to learn from the ruins of the port of ostia what its figure was when it stood whole and entire i shall therefore set down the medal that i have before mentioned which represents it as it was formerly avgvsti spqr    it is worth while to compare juvenals description of this port with the figure it makes on the coin tandem intrat positas inclusa per aequora moles tyrrhenamque pharon porrectaque brachia rursus quae pelago occurrunt medio longeque relinquunt italiam non sic igitur mirabere portus quos natura dedit  juv sat    at last within the mighty mole she gets our tyrrhene pharos that the mid sea meets with its embrace and leaves the land behind a work so wondrous nature never designed dryd juv  the seas may very properly be said to be enclosed  inclusa between the two semicircular moles that almost surround em the colossus with something like a lighted torch in its hand is probably the pharos in the second line the two moles that we must suppose are joined to the land behind the pharos are very poetically described by the  porrectaque brachia rursus quae pelago occurrunt medio longeque relinquunt italiam  as they retire from one another in the compass they make till their two ends almost meet a second time in the midst of the waters where the figure of neptune sits the poets reflection on the haven is very just since there are few natural ports better landlockd and closed on all sides than this seems to have been the figure of neptune has a rudder by him to mark the convenience of the harbor for navigation as he is represented himself at the entrance of it to show it stood in the sea the dolphin distinguishes him from a river god and figures out his dominion over the seas he holds the same fish in his hand on other medals what it means we may learn from the greek epigram on the figure of a cupid that had a dolphin in one hand and a flower in the other  a proper emblem graces either hand in one he holds the sea in one the land   half a day more brought us to rome through a road that is commonly visited by travelers  rome it is generally observed that modern rome stands higher than the ancient some have computed it about fourteen or fifteen feet taking one place with another the reason given for it is that the present city stands upon the ruins of the former and indeed i have often observed that where any considerable pile of building stood anciently one still finds a rising ground or a little kind of hill which was doubtless made up out of the fragments and rubbish of the ruined edifice but besides this particular cause we may assign another that has very much contributed to the raising the situation of several parts of rome it being certain the great quantities of earth that have been washed off from the hills by the violence of showers have had no small share in it this any one may be sensible of who observes how far several buildings that stand near the roots of mountains are sunk deeper in the earth than those that have been on the tops of hills or in open plains for which reason the present face of rome is much more even and level than it was formerly the same cause that has raised the lower grounds having contributed to sink those that were higher  there are in rome two setts of antiquities the christian and the heathen the former though of a fresher date are so embroiled with fable and legend that one receives but little satisfaction from searching into them the other give a great deal of pleasure to such as have met with them before in ancient authors for a man who is in rome can scarce see an object that does not call to mind a piece of a latin poet or historian among the remains of old rome the grandeur of the commonwealth shows it self chiefly in works that were either necessary or convenient such as temples highways aqueducts walls and bridges of the city on the contrary the magnificence of rome under the emperors is seen principally in such works as were rather for ostentation or luxury than any real usefulness or necessity as in baths amphitheaters circuss obelisks triumphant pillars arches and mausoleums for what they added to the aqueducts was rather to supply their baths and naumachias and to embellish the city with fountains than out of any real necessity there was for them these several remains have been so copiously described by abundance of travelers and other writers particularly by those concerned in the learned collection of graevius that it is very difficult to make any new discoveries on so beaten a subject there is however so much to be observed in so spacious a field of antiquities that it is almost impossible to survey them without taking new hints and raising different reflections according as a mans natural turn of thoughts or the course of his studies direct him  no part of the antiquities of rome pleased me so much as the ancient statues of which there is still an incredible variety the workmanship is often the most exquisite of any thing in its kind a man would wonder how it were possible for so much life to enter into marble as may be discovered in some of the best of them and even in the meanest one has the satisfaction of seeing the faces postures airs and dress of those that have lived so many ages before us there is a strange resemblance between the figures of the several heathen deities and the descriptions that the latin poets have given us of them but as the first may be looked upon as the ancienter of the two i question not but the roman poets were the copiers of the greek statuaries though on other occasions we often find the statuaries took their subjects from the poets the laocoon is too known an instance among many others that are to be met with at rome in the villa aldabrandina are the figures of an old and young man engaged together at the caestus who are probably the dares and entellus of virgil where by the way one may observe the make of the ancient caestus that it only consisted of so many large thongs about the hand without any thing like a piece of lead at the end of them as some writers of antiquities have falsely imagined  i question not but many passages in the old poets hint at several parts of sculpture that were in vogue in the authors time though they are now never thought of and that therefore such passages lose much of their beauty in the eye of a modern reader who does not look upon them in the same light with the authors contemporaries i shall only mention two or three out of juvenal that his commentators have not taken notice of the first runs thus multa pudicitiae veteris vestigia forsan aut aliqua extiterint et sub jove sed jove nondum barbato  sat   some thin remains of chastity appeared even under jove but jove without a beard dryden  i appeal to any reader if the humor here would not appear much more natural and unforced to a people that saw every day some or other statue of this god with a thick bushy beard as there are still many of them extant at rome than it can to us who have no such idea of him especially if we consider there was in the same city a temple dedicated to the young jupiter called templum vaejovis where in all probability there stood the particular statue of a vid ov de fastis li   ecl   jupiter imberbis juvenal in another place makes his flatterer compare the neck of one that is but feebly built to that of hercules holding up antaeus from the earth et longum invalidi collum cervicibus aequat herculis antaeum procul a tellure tenentis sat   his long crane neck and narrow shoulders praise you would think they were describing hercules lifting anteus  dryden  what a strained unnatural similitude must this seem to a modern reader but how full of humor if we suppose it alludes to any celebrated statues of these two champions that stood perhaps in some public place or highway near rome and what makes it more than probable there were such statues we meet with the figures which juvenal here describes on antique intaglios and medals nay propertius has taken notice of the very statues  luctantum in pulvere signa herculis antaeique  lib   car   antaeus here and stern alcides strive and both the grappling statues seem to live   i cannot forbear observing here that the turn of the neck and arms is often commended in the latin poets among the beauties of a man as in horace we find both put together in that beautiful description of jealousy dum tu lydia telephi cervicem roseam et cerea telephi laudas brachia vae meum fervens difficili bile tumet jecur tunc nec mens mihi nec color certa sede manent humor et in genas furtim labitur arguens quam lentis penitus macerer ignibus while telephuss youthful charms his rosy neck and winding arms with endless rapture you recite and in the tender name delight my heart enraged by jealous heats with numberless resentments beats from my pale cheeks the color flies and all the man within me dies by fits my swelling grief appears in rising sighs and falling tears that show too well the warm desires the silent slow consuming fires which on my inmost vitals prey and melt my very soul away   this we should be at a loss to account for did we not observe in the old roman statues that these two parts were always bare and exposed to view as much as our hands and face are at present i cannot leave juvenal without taking notice that his ventilat aestivum digitis sudantilius  nec sufferre queat majoris pondera gem sat   charged with light summor rings his fingers sweat unable to support a gem of weight dryden was not anciently so great an hyperbole as it is now for i have seen old roman rings so very thick about and with such large stones in em that it is no wonder a fop should reckon em a little cumbersome in the summer season of so hot a climate  it is certain that satyr delights in such allusions and instances as are extremely natural and familiar when therefore we see any thing in an old satyrist that looks forced and pedantick we ought to consider how it appeared in the time the poet writ and whether or no there might not be some particular circumstances to recommend it to the readers of his own age which we are now deprived of one of the finest ancient statues in rome is a meleager with a spear in his hand and the head of a wild boar on one side of him it is of parian marble and as yellow as ivory one meets with many other figures of meleager in the ancient basso relievos and on the sides of the sarcophagi or funeral monuments perhaps it was the arms or device of the old roman hunters which conjecture i have found confirmed in a passage of manilius that lets us know the pagan hunters had meleager for their patron as the christians have their st hubert he speaks of the constellation which makes a good sportsman  quibus aspirantibus orti te meleagre colunt  manil lib    i question not but this sets a verse in the fifth satyr of juvenal in a much better light than if we suppose that the poet aims only at the old story of meleager without considering it as so very common and familiar a one among the romans  flavi dignus ferro meleagri spumat aper  juv s   a boar entire and worthy of the sword of meleager smoaks upon the board mr bowls  in the beginning of the ninth satyr juvenal asks his friend why he looks like marsya when he was overcome scire velim quare toties mihi naevole tristis occurris front obducta ceu marsya victus tell me why sauntring thus from place to place i meet thee nevolus with a clouded face drydens juvenal  some of the commentators tell us that marsya was a lawyer who had lost his cause others say that this passage alludes to the story of the satire marsyas who contended with apollo which i think is more humorous than the other if we consider there was a famous statue of apollo fleaing marsya in the midst of the roman forum as there are still several ancient statues of rome on the same subject  there is a passage in the sixth satyr of juvenal that i could never tell what to make of till i had got the interpretation of it from one of bellorios ancient basso relievos magnorum artificum frangebat pocula miles ut phaleris gauderet equus caelataque cassis romuleae simulacra ferae mansuescere jussae imperii fato et geminos sub rupe quirinos ac nudam effigiem clypeo fulgentis et hasta pendentisque dei perituro ostenderet hosti juv sat    or else a helmet for himself he made where various warlike figures were inlaid the roman wolf suckling the twins was there and mars himself armed with his shield and spear hovering above his crest did dreadful show as threatening death to each resisting foe drydens juvenal  juvenal here describes the simplicity of the old roman soldiers and the figures that were generally engraven on their helmets the first of em was the wolf giving suck to romulus and rhemus the second which is comprehended in the two last verses is not so intelligible some of the commentators tell us that the god here mentioned is mars that he comes to see his two sons sucking the wolf and that the old sculptors generally drew their figures naked that they might have the advantage of representing the different swelling of the muscles and the turns of the body but they are extremely at a loss to know what is meant by the word pendentis some fancy it expresses only the great embossment of the figure others believe it hung off the helmet in alto relievo as in the foregoing translation lubin supposes that the god mars was engraven on the shield and that he is said to be hanging because the shield which bore him hung on the left shoulder one of the old interpreters is of opinion that by hanging is only meant a posture of bending forward to strike the enemy another will have it that whatever is placed on the head may be said to hang as we call hanging gardens such as are planted on the top of the house several learned men who like none of these explications believe there has been a fault in the transcriber and that pendentis ought to be perdentis but they quote no manuscript in favor of their conjecture the true meaning of the words is certainly as follows the roman soldiers who were not a little proud of their founder and the military genius of their republic used to bear on their helmets the first history of romulus who was begot by the god of war and suckled by a wolf the figure of the god was made as if descending upon the priestess ilia or as others call her rhea silvia the occasion required his body should be naked tu quoque inermis eras cum te formosa sacerdos cepit ut huic urbi semina magna dares ov de fas l   then too our mighty sire thou stoodst disarmed when thy rapt soul the lovely priestess charmed that romes high founder bore  though on other occasions he is drawn as horace has described him tunica cinctum adamantina the sculptor however to distinguish him from the rest of the gods gave him what the medallists call his proper attributes a spear in one hand and a shield in the other as he was represented descending his figure appeared suspended in the air over the vestal virgin in which sense the word pendentis is extremely proper and poetical besides the antique basso relievo that made me first think of this interpretation i have since met with the same figures on the reverses of a couple of ancient coins which were stamped in the reign of antoninus pius as a compliment to that emperor whom for his excellent government and conduct of the city of rome the senate regarded as a second kind of founder trpot cosiii s c imperator iii s c ilia vestalis quid enim vetat inde moveri sacra

head without taking notice of a line in seneca the tragedian  primus emergit solo dextra ferocem cornibus premens taurum zetus  sen oedip act    first zetus rises through the ground bending the bulls tough neck with pain that tosses back his horns in vain   i cannot doubt but the poet had here in view the posture of zetus in the famous groupe of figures which represents the two brothers binding dirce to the horns of a mad bull  i could not forbear taking particular notice of the several musical instruments that are to be seen in the hands of the apollos muses fauns satyrs bacchanais and shepherds which might certainly give a great light to the dispute for preference between the ancient and modern music it would perhaps be no impertinent design to take off all their models in wood which might not only give us some notion of the ancient music but help us to pleasanter instruments than are now in use by the appearance they make in marble there is not one stringinstrument that seems comparable to our violins for they are all played on either by the bare fingers or the plectrum so that they were incapable of adding any length to their notes or of varying em by those insensible swellings and wearings away of sound upon the same string which give so wonderful a sweetness to our modern music besides that the stringinstruments must have had very low and feeble voices as may be guessed from the small proportion of wood about em which could not contain air enough to render the strokes in any considerable measure full and sonorous there is a great deal of difference in the make not only of the several kinds of instruments but even among those of the same name the syringa for example has sometimes four and sometimes more pipes as high as to twelve the same variety of strings may be observed on their harps and of stops on their tibiae which shows the little foundation that such writers have gone upon who from a verse perhaps in virgils eclogues or a short passage in a classic author have been so very nice in determining the precise shape of the ancient musical instruments with the exact number of their pipes strings and stops it is indeed the usual fault of the writers of antiquities to streighten and confine themselves to particular models they are for making a kind of stamp on every thing of the same name and if they find any thing like an old description of the subject they treat on they take care to regulate it on all occasions according to the figure it makes in such a single passage as the learned german author quoted by monsieur baudelot who had probably never seen any thing of a housholdgod more than a canopus affirms roundly that all the ancient lares were made in the fashion of a jugbottle in short the antiquaries have been guilty of the same fault as the systemewriters who are for cramping their subjects into as narrow a space as they can and for reducing the whole extent of a science into a few general maxims this a man has occasion of observing more than once in the several fragments of antiquity that are still to be seen in rome how many dresses are there for each particular deity what a variety of shapes in the ancient urns lamps lachrymary vessels priapuss housholdgods which have some of em been represented under such a particular form as any one of em has been described with in an ancient author and would probably be all so were they not still to be seen in their own vindication madam dacier from some old cuts of terence fancies that the larva or persona of the roman actors was not only a vizard for the face but had false hair to it and came over the whole head like a helmet among all the statues at rome i remember to have seen but two that are the figures of actors which are both in the villa matthei one sees on em the fashion of the old sock and larva the latter of which answers the description that is given of it by this learned lady though i question not but several others were in use for i have seen the figure of thalia the comic muse sometimes with an entire headpiece in her hand sometimes with about half the head and a little friz like a tower running round the edges of the face and sometimes with a mask for the face only like those of a modern make some of the italian actors wear at present these masks for the whole head i remember formerly i could have no notion of that fable in phaedrus before i had seen the figures of these entire headpieces personam tragicam forte vulpes viderat o quanta species inquit cerebrum non habet l   fab   as wily renard walked the streets at night on a tragedians mask he chanced to light turning it over he muttered with disdain how vast a head is here without a brain   i find madam dacier has taken notice of this passage in phaedrus upon the same occasion but not of the following one in martial which alludes to the same kind of masks non omnes fallis scit te proserpina canum personam capiti detrahet illa tuo l   ep    why should thou try to hide thy self in youth impartial proserpine beholds the truth and laughing at so fond and vain a task will strip thy hoary noddle of its mask   in the villa borghese is the bust of a young nero which shows us the form of an ancient bulla on the breast which is neither like a heart as macrobius describes it nor altogether resembles that in cardinal chigis cabinet so that without establishing a particular instance into a general rule we ought in subjects of this nature to leave room for the humor of the artist or wearer there are many figures of gladiators at rome though i dont remember to have seen any of the retiarius the samnite or the antagonist to the pinnirapus but what i could not find among the statues i met with in two antique pieces of mosaic which are in the possession of a cardinal the retiarius is engaged with the samnite and has had so lucky a throw that his net covers the whole body of his adversary from head to foot yet his antagonist recovered himself out of the toiles and was conqueror according to the inscription in another piece is represented the combat of the pinnirapus who is armed like the samnite and not like the retiarius as some learned men have supposed on the helmet of his antagonist are seen the two pinnae that stand up on either side like the wings in the petasus of a mercury but rise much higher and are more pointed  there is no part of the roman antiquities that we are better acquainted with than what relates to their sacrifices for as the old romans were very much devoted to their religion we see several parts of it entering their ancient basso relievos statues and medals not to mention their altars tombs monuments and those particular ornaments of architecture which were borrowed from it an heathen ritual could not instruct a man better than these several pieces of antiquity in the particular ceremonies and punctilios that attended the different kinds of sacrifices yet there is a much greater variety in the make of the sacrificing instruments than one finds in those who have treated of them or have given us their pictures for not to insist too long on such a subject i saw in signior antonio politis collection a patera without any rising in the middle as it is genenerally engraven and another with a handle to it as macrobius describes it though it is quite contrary to any that i have ever seen cut in marble and i have observed perhaps several hundreds i might here enlarge on the shape of the triumphal chariot which is different in some pieces of sculpture from what it appears in others and on the figure of the discus that is to be seen in the hand of the celebrated castor at don livios which is perfectly round and not oblong as some antiquaries have represented it nor has it any thing like a sling fastened to it to add force to the toss protinus imprudens actusque cupidine lusus tollere taenarides orbem properabat   de hyacinthi disco ov met l  0 the unwary youth impatient for the cast went to snatch up the rolling orb in haste   notwithstanding there are so great a multitude of clothed statues at rome i could never discover the several different roman garments for it is very difficult to trace out the figure of a vest through all the plaits and foldings of the drapery besides that the roman garments did not differ from each other so much by the shape as by the embroidery and color the one of which was too nice for the statuarys observation as the other does not lie within the expression of the chissel i observed in abundance of bas reliefs that the cinctus gabinus is nothing else but a long garment not unlike a surplice which would have traild on the ground had it hung loose and was therefore gathered about the middle with a girdle after this it is worth while to read the laborious description that ferrarius has made of it cinctus gabinus non aliud fuit quam cum togae lacinia laevo brachio subducta in tergum ita rejiciebatur ut contracta retraheretur ad pectus atque ita in nodum necteretur qui nodus sive cinctus togam contrahebat brevioremque et strictiorem reddidit de re vestiar l   c    lipsiuss description of the samnite armor seems drawn out of the very words of livy yet not long ago a statue which was dug up at rome dressed in this kind of armor gives a much different explication of livy from what lipsius has done this figure was superscribd ba to ni from whence fabretti concludes that it was a monument erected to the gladiator bato who after having succeeded in two combats was killed in the third and honorably interred by order of the emperor caracalla the manner of punctuation after each syllable is to be met with in other antique inscriptions i confess i could never learn where this figure is now to be seen but i think it may serve as an instance of the great uncertainty of this science of antiquities vid fabr de columna trajani   in a palace of prince cesarini i saw busts of all the antonine family which were dug up about two years since not far from albano in a place where is supposed to have stood a villa of marcus aurelius there are the heads of antoninus pius the faustinas marcus aurelius lucius verus a young commodus and annius verus all incomparably well cut  though the statues that have been found among the ruins of old rome are already very numerous there is no question but posterity will have the pleasure of seeing many noble pieces of sculpture which are still undiscovered for doubtless there are greater treasures of this nature under ground than what are yet brought to light they have often dug into lands that are described in old authors as the places where such particular statues or obelisks stood and have seldom failed of success in their pursuits there are still many such promising spots of ground that have never been searched into a great part of the palatine mountain for example lies untouched which was formerly the seat of the imperial palace and may be presumed to abound with more treasures of this nature than any other part of rome ecce palatino crevit reverentia monti exultatque habitante deo potioraque delphis supplicibus late populis oracula pandit non alium certe decuit rectoribus orbis esse larem nulloque magis se colle potestas aestimat et summi sentit fastigia juris attollens apicem subjectis regia rostris tot circum delubra videt

mankind inferior temples rise on either hand and on the borders of the palace stand while over the rest her head she proudly rears and lodged amidst her guardian gods appears   but whether it be that the richest of these discoveries fall into the popes hands or for some other reason it is said that the prince farnese who is the present owner of this seat will keep it from being turned up till he sees one of his own family in the chair there are undertakers in rome who often purchase the digging of fields gardens or vineyards where they find any likelihood of succeeding and some have been known to arrive at great estates by it they pay according to the dimensions of the surface they are to break up and after having made essays into it as they do for coal in england they rake into the most promising parts of it though they often find to their disappointment that others have been beforehand with em however they generally gain enough by the rubbish and bricks which the present architects value much beyond those of a modern make to defray the charges of their search i was shown two spaces of ground where part of neros golden house stood for which the owner has been offered an extraordinary sum of money what encouraged the undertakers are several very ancient trees which grow upon the spot from whence they conclude that these particular tracts of ground must have lain untouched for some ages it is pity there is not something like a public register to preserve the memory of such statues as have been found from time to time and to mark the particular places where they have been taken up which would not only prevent many fruitless searches for the future but might often give a considerarable light into the quality of the place or the design of the statue  but the great magazine for all kinds of treasure is supposed to be the bed of the tiber we may be sure when the romans lay under the apprehensions of seeing their city sacked by a barbarous enemy as they have done more than once that they would take care to bestow such of their riches this way as could best bear the water besides what the insolence of a brutish conqueror may be supposed to have contributed who had an ambition to waste and destroy all the beauties of so celebrated a city i need not mention the old commonshore of rome which ran from all parts of the town with the current and violence of an ordinary river nor the frequent inundations of the tiber which may have swept away many of the ornaments of its banks nor the several statues that the romans themselves flung into it when they would revenge themselves on the memory of an ill citizen a dead tyrant or a discarded favorite at rome they have so general an opinion of the riches of this river that the jews have formerly proffered the pope to cleanse it so they might have for their pains what they found in the bosom of it i have seen the valley near ponte molle which they proposed to fashion into a new channel for it till they had cleared the old for its reception the pope however would not comply with the proposal as fearing the heats might advance too far before they had finished their work and produce a pestilence among his people though i dont see why such a design might not be executed now with as little danger as in augustuss time were there as many hands employed upon it the city of rome would receive a great advantage from the undertaking as it would raise the banks and deepen the bed of the tiber and by consequence free em from those frequent inundations to which they are so subject at present for the channel of the river is observed to be narrower within the walls than either below or above them  before i quit this subject of the statues i think it very observable that among those which are already found there should be so many not only of the same persons but made after the same design one would not indeed wonder to see several figures of particular deities and emperors who had a multitude of temples erected to em and had their several sets of worshippers and admirers thus ceres the most beneficent and useful of the heathen divinities has more statues than any other of the gods or goddesses as several of the roman emperesses took a pleasure to be represented in her dress and i believe one finds as many figures of that excellent emperor marcus aurelius as of all the rest together because the romans had so great a veneration for his memory that it grew into a part of their religion to preserve a statue of him in almost every private family but how comes it to pass that so many of these statues are cut after the very same model and not only of these but of such as had no relation either to the interest or devotion of the owner as the dying cleopatra the narcissus the faune leaning against the trunk of a tree the boy with the bird in his hand the leda and her swan with many others of the same nature i must confess i always look upon figures of this kind as the copies of some celebrated masterpiece and question not but they were famous originals that gave rise to the several statues which we see with the same air posture and attitudes what confirms me in this conjecture there are many ancient statues of the venus de medicis the silenus with the young bacchus in his arms the hercules farnese the antinous and other beautiful originals of the ancients that are already drawn out of the rubbish where they lay concealed for so many ages among the rest i have observed more that are formed after the design of the venus of medicis than of any other from whence i believe one may conclude that it was the most celebrated statue among the ancients as well as among the moderns it has always been usual for sculptors to work upon the best models as it is for those that are curious to have copies of them  i am apt to think something of the same account may be given of the resemblance that we meet with in many of the antique basso relievos i remember i was very well pleased with the device of one that i met with on the tomb of a young roman lady which had beem made for her by her mother the sculptor had chosen the rape of proserpine for his device where in one end you might see the god of the dead  pluto hurrying away a beautiful young virgin  proserpine and at the other the grief and distraction of the mother  ceres on that occasion i have since observed the same device upon several sarcophagi that have enclosed the ashes of men or boys maids or matrons for when the thought took though at first it received its rise from such a particular occasion as i have mentioned the ignorance of the sculptors applied it promiscuously i know there are authors who discover a mystery in this device  a man is sometimes surprised to find so many extravagant fancies as are cut on the old pagan tombs masks huntingmatches and bacchanals are very common sometimes one meets with a lewd figure of a priapus and in the villa pamphilia is seen a satyr coupling with a goat there are however many of a more serious nature that shadow out the existence of the soul after death and the hopes of a happy immortality i cannot leave the basso relievos without mentioning one of em where the thought is extremely noble it is called homers apotheosis and consists of a groupe of figures cut in the same block of marble and rising one above another by four or five different ascents jupiter sits at the top of it with a thunderbolt in his hand and in such a majesty as homer himself represents him presides over the ceremony    immediately beneath him are the figures of the nine muses supposed to be celebrating the praises of the poet homer himself is placed at one end of the lowest row sitting in a chair of state which is supported on each side by the figure of a kneeling woman the one holds a sword in her hand to represent the iliad or actions of achilles as the other has an aplustre to represent the odyssy or voyage of ulysses about the poets feet are creeping a couple of mice as an emblem of the batrachomyomachia behind the chair stands time and the genius of the earth distinguished by their proper attributes and putting a garland on the poets head to intimate the mighty reputation he has gained in all ages and in all nations of the world before him stands an altar with a bull ready to be sacrificed to the new god and behind the victim a train of the several virtues that are represented in homers works or to be learnt out of them lifting up their hands in admiration of the poet and in applause of the solemnity this antique piece of sculpture is in the possession of the constable colonna but never shown to those who see the palace unless they particularly desire it  among the great variety of ancient coins which i saw at rome i could not but take particular notice of such as relate to any of the buildings or statues that are still extant those of the first kind have been already published by the writers of the roman antiquities and may be most of them met with in the last edition of donatus as the pillars of trajan and antonine the arches of drusus germanicus and septimius severus the temples of janus concord vesta jupiter tonans apollo and faustina the circus maximus agonalis and that of caracalla or according to fabretti of galienus of vespasians amphitheater and alexander severuss baths though i must confess the subject of the last may be very well doubted of as for the meta sudans and pons aelius which have gained a place among the buildings that are now standing and to be met with on old reverses of medals the coin that shows the first is generally rejected as spurious nor is the other though cited in the last edition of monsieur vaillant esteemed more authentic by the present roman medallists who are certainly the most skilful in the world as to the mechanical part of this science i shall close up this set of medals with a very curious one as large as a medalion that is singular in its kind on one side is the head of the emperor trajan the reverse has on it the circus maximus and a view of the side of the palatine mountain that faces it on which are seen several edifices and among the rest the famous temple of apollo that has still a considerable ruin standing this medal i saw in the hands of monseigneur strozzi brother to the duke of that name who has many curiosities in his possession and is very obliging to a stranger who desires the sight of em it is a surprising thing that among the great pieces of architecture represented on the old coins one can never meet with the pantheon the mausolaeum of augustus neros golden house the moles adriani the septizonium of severus the baths of dioclesian etc but since it was the custom of the roman emperors thus to register their most remarkable buildings as well as actions and since there are several in either of these kinds not to be found on medals more extraordinary than those that are we may i think with great reason suspect our collections of old coins to be extremely deficient and that those which are already found out scarce bear a proportion to what are yet undiscovered a man takes a great deal more pleasure in surveying the ancient statues who compares them with medals than it is possible for him to do without some little knowledge this way for these two arts illustrate each other and as there are several particulars in history and antiquities which receive a great light from ancient coins so would it be impossible to decipher the faces of the many statues that are to be seen at rome without so universal a key to them it is this that teaches to distinguish the kings and consuls emperors and emperesses the deities and virtues with a thousand other particulars relating to statuary and not to be learnt by any other means in the villa pamphilia stands the statue of a man in womans clothes which the antiquaries do not know what to make of and therefore pass it off for an hermaphrodite but a learned medallist in rome has lately fixed it to clodius who is so famous for having intruded into the semnities of the bona dea in a womans habit for one sees the same features and make of face in a medal of the clodian family  i have seen on coins the four finest figures perhaps that are now extant the hercules farnese the venus of medicis the apollo in the belvidere and the famous marcus aurelius on horseback the oldest medal that the first appears upon is one of commodus the second on one of faustina the third on one of antoninus pius and the last on one of lucius verus we may conclude i think from hence that these statues were extremely celebrated among the old romans or they would never have been honored with a place among the emperors coins we may further observe that all four of em make their first appearance in the antonine family for which reason i am apt to think they are all of them the product of that age they would probably have been mentioned by pliny the naturalist who lived in the next reign save one before antoninus pius had they been made in his time as for the brazen figure of marcus aurelius on horseback there is no doubt of its being of this age though i must confess it may be doubted whether the medal i have cited represents it all i can say for it is that the horse and man on the medal are in the same posture as they are on the statue and that there is a resemblance of marcus aureliuss face for i have seen this reverse on a medalion of don livios cabinet and much more distinctly in another very beautiful one that is in the hands of signior marc antonio it is generally objected that lucius verus would rather have placed the figure of himself on horseback upon the reverse of his own coin than the figure of marcus aurelius but it is very well known that an emperor often stamped on his coins the face or ornaments of his colleague as an instance of his respect or friendship for him and we may suppose lucius verus would omit no opportunity of doing honor to marcus aurelius whom he rather revered as his father than treated as his partner in the empire the famous antinous in the belvidere must have been made too about this age for he dyed toward the middle of adrians reign the immediate predecessor of antoninus pius this entire figure though not to be found in medals may be seen in several precious stones monsieur la chausse the author of the musaeum romanum showed me an antinous that he has published in his last volume cut in a cornelian which he values at fifty pistoles it represents him in the habit of a mercury and is the finest intaglia that i ever saw  next to the statues there is nothing in rome more surprising than that amazing variety of ancient pillars of so many kinds of marble as most of the old statues may be well supposed to have been cheaper to their first owners than they are to a modern purchaser several of the pillars are certainly rated at a much lower price at present than they were of old for not to mention what a huge column of granite serpentine or porphyry must have cost in the quarry or in its carriage from egypt to rome we may only consider the great difficulty of hewing it into any form and of giving it the due turn proportion and polish it is well known how these sorts of marble resist the impressions of such instruments as are now in use there is indeed a milanese at rome who works in them but his advances are so very slow that he scarce lives upon what he gains by it he showed me a piece of porphyry worked into an ordinary salver which had cost him four months continual application before he could bring it into that form the ancients had probably some secret to harden the edges of their tools without recurring to those extravagant opinions of their having an art to mollify the stone or that it was naturally softer at its first cutting from the rock or what is still more absurd that it was an artificial composition and not the natural product of mines and quarries the most valuable pillars about rome for the marble of which they are made are the four columns of oriental jasper in st paulinas chapel at st maria maggiore two of oriental granite in st pudenziana one of transparent oriental jasper in the vatican library four of nerobianco in st cecilia transtevere two of brocatello and two of oriental agate in don livios palace two of giallo antico in st john lateran and two of verdi antique in the villa pamphilia these are all entire and solid pillars and made of such kinds of marble as are no where to be found but among antiquities whether it be that the veins of it are undiscovered or that they were quite exhausted upon the ancient buildings among these old pillars i cannot forbear reckoning a great part of an alablaster column which was found in the ruins of livias portico it is of the color of fire and may be seen over the high altar of st maria in campitello for they have cut it into two pieces and fixed it in the shape of a cross in a hole of the wall that was made on purpose to receive it so that the light passing through it from without makes it look to those who are in the church like a huge transparent cross of amber as for the workmanship of the old roman pillars monsieur desgodetz in his accurate measures of these ruins has observed that the ancients have not kept to the nicety of proportion and the rules of art so much as the moderns in this particular some to excuse this defect lay the blame of it on the workmen of egypt and of other nations who sent most of the ancient pillars ready shaped to rome others say that the ancients knowing architecture was chiefly designed to please the eye only took care to avoid such disproportions as were gross enough to be observed by the sight without minding whether or no they approached to a mathematical exactness others will have it rather to be an effect of art and of what the italians call the gusto grande than of any negligence in the architect for they say the ancients always considered the situation of a building whether it were high or low in an open square or in a narrow street and more or less deviated from their rules of art to comply with the several distances and elevations from which their works were to be regarded it is said there is an ionic pillar in the santa maria transtevere where the marks of the compass are still to be seen on the volute and that palladio learnt from hence the working of that difficult problem but i never could find time to examine all the old columns of that church among the pillars i must not pass over the two noblest in the world those of trajan and antonine there could not have been a more magnificent design than that of trajans pillar where could an emperors ashes have been so nobly lodged as in the midst of his metropolis and on the top of so exalted a monument with the greatest of his actions underneath him or as some will have it his statue was on the top his urn at the foundation and his battles in the midst the sculpture of it is too well known to be here mentioned the most remarkable piece in antonines pillar is the figure of jupiter pluvius sending down rain on the fainting army of marcus aurelius and thunderbolts on his enemies which is the greatest confirmation possible of the story of the christian legion and will be a standing evidence for it when any passage in an old author may be supposed to be forged the figure that jupiter here makes among the clouds puts me in mind of a passage in the aeneid which gives just such another image of him virgils interpreters are certainly to blame that suppose it is nothing but the air which is here meant by jupiter quantus ab occasu veniens pluvialibus haedis verberat imber humum quam multa grandine nimbi in vada praecipitant quum jupiter horridas austris torqut aquosam hyemem and caelo cava nubila rumpit aen   the combat thickens like the storm that flies from westward when the showry kids arise or pattring hail comes pouring on the main when jupiter descends in hardened rain or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound and with an armed winter strew the ground dryden  i have seen a medal that according to the opinion of many learned men relates to the same story the emperor is entitled on it germanicus as it was in the wars of germany that this circumstance happened and carries on the reverse a thunderbolt in his hand for the heathens attributed the same miracle to the piety of the emperor that the christians ascribed to the prayers of their legion fulmen de coelo precibus suis contra hostium machinamentum marcus extorsit suis pluvia impetrata cum siti laborarent jul capit  claudian takes notice of this miracle and has given the same reason for it  ad templa vocatus clemens marce redis cum gentibus undique cinctam exuit hesperiam paribus fortuna periclis laus ibi nulla ducum nam flammeus imber in hostem decidit hunc dorso trepidum fumante ferebat ambustus sonipes hic tabescente solutus subsedit galea liquefactaque fulgurecuspis canduit et subitis fluxere vaporibus enses tunc contenta polo mortalis nescia teli pugna fuit chaldaea mago

latium from unnumberd foes was freed nor did he then by his own force succeed but with descending showers of brimstone fired the wild barbarian in the storm expired wrapped in devouring flames the horseman raged and spurred the steed in equal flames engaged another pent in his scorched armor glowed while from his head the melting helmet flowed swords by the lightnings subtle force distilled and the cold sheath with running metal filled no human arm its weak assistance brought but heaven offended heaven the battle fought whether dark magic and chaldean charms had filled the skies and set the gods in arms or good aurelius as i more believe deserved whatever aid the thunderer could give   i do not remember that m dacier among several quotations on this subject in the life of marcus aurelius has taken notice either of the forementioned figure on the pillar of marcus antoninus or of the beautiful passage i have quoted out of claudian  it is pity the obelisks in rome had not been charged with several parts of the egyptian histories instead of hierogliphics which might have given no small light to the antiquities of that nation which are now quite sunk out of sight in those remoter ages of the world among the triumphal arches that of constantine is not only the noblest of any in rome but in the world i searched narrowly into it especially among those additions of sculpture made in the emperors own age to see if i could find any marks of the apparition that is said to have preceded the very victory which gave occasion to the triumphal arch but there are not the least traces of it to be met with which is not very strange if we consider that the greatest part of the ornaments were taken from trajans arch and set up to the new conqueror in no small haste by the senate and people of rome who were then most of them heathens there is however something in the inscription which is as old as the arch it self that seems to hint at the emperors vision imp caes fl constantino maximo p f augusto s p q r quod instinctu divinitatis mentis magnitudine cum exercitu suo tam de tyranno quam de omni ejus factione uno tempore justis rempublicam ultus est armis arcum triumphis insignem dicavit there is no statue of this emperor at rome with a cross to it though the ecclesiastical historians say there were many such erected to him i have seen of his medals that were stamped with it and a very remarkable one of his son constantius where he is crowned by a victory on the reverse with this inscription in hoc signo victor eris this triumphal arch and some other buildings of the same age show us that architecture held up its head after all the other arts of designing were in a very weak and languishing condition as it was probably the first among them that revived if i was surprised not to find the cross in constantines arch i was as much disappointed not to see the figure of the temple of jerusalem on that of titus where are represented the golden candlestick the table of shewbread and the river jordan some are of opinion that the composite pillars of this arch were made in imitation of the pillars of solomons temple and observe that these are the most ancient of any that are found of that order  it is almost impossible for a man to form in his imagination such beautiful and glorious scenes as are to be met with in several of the roman churches and chapels for having such a prodigious stock of ancient marble within the very city and at the same time so many different quarries in the bowels of their country most of their chapels are laid over with such a rich variety of incrustations as cannot possibly be found in any other part of the world and notwithstanding the incredible sums of money which have been already laid out this way there is still the same work going forward in other parts of rome the last still endeavoring to outshine those that went before them painting sculpture and architecture are at present far from being in a flourishing condition but it is thought they may all recover themselves under the present pontificate if the wars and confusions of italy will give them leave for as the pope is himself a master of polite learning and a great encourager of arts so at rome any of these arts immediately thrives under the encouragement of the prince and may be fetched up to its perfection in ten or a dozen years which is the work of an age or two in other countries where they have not such excellent models to form themselves upon  i shall conclude my observations on rome with a letter of king henry the eighth to ann of bulleyn transcribed out of the famous manuscript in the vatican which the bishop of salisbury assures us is written with the kings own hand the cause of my writing at this time is to hear of your health and prosperity of which i would be as glad as in manner of my own praying god that it be his pleasure to send us shortly together for i promise i long for it howbeit i trust it shall not be long too and seeing my darling is absent i can no less do than send her some flesh prognosticating that hereafter thou must have some of mine which if he please i would have now as touching your sisters mother i have consigned walter welsh to write to my lord manwring my mind therein whereby i trust he shall not have power to disseid her for surely whatever is said it cannot so stand with his honor but that he must needs take his natural daughter in her extreme necessity no more to you at this time my own darling but that with a whistle i wish we were together one evening by the hand of yours  henry     these letters are always shown to an englishman that visits the vatican library  towns within the neighborhood of rome i spent three or four days on tivoli frescati palestrina and albano in our way to tivoli i saw the rivulet of solforata formerly called albula and smelt the stench that arises from its waters some time before i saw them martial mentions this offensive smell in an epigram of the fourth book as he does the rivulet it self in the first quod siccae redolet lacus lacunae crudarum nebulae quod albularum l   ep   the drying marshes such a stench convey such the rank steams of reeking albula itur ad herculeae gelidas qua tiburis arces canaque sulphureis albula fumat aquis l   ep   as from high rome to tivoli you go where albulas sulphurous waters flow   the little lake that gives rise to this river with its floating islands is one of the most extraordinary natural curiosities about rome it lies in the very flat of campania and as it is the drain of these parts it is no wonder that it is so impregnated with sulphur it has at bottom so thick a sediment of it that upon throwing in a stone the water boils for a considerable time over the place which has been stirred up at the same time are seen little flakes of scurfe rising up that are probably the parts which compose the islands for they often mount of themselves though the water is not troubled  i question not but this lake was formerly much larger than it is at present and that the banks have grown over it by degrees in the same manner as the islands have been formed on it nor is it improbable but that in process of time the whole surface of it may be crusted over as the islands enlarge themselves and the banks close in upon them all about the lake where the ground is dry we found it to be hollow by the trampling of our horses feet i could not discover the least traces of the sibyls temple and grove which stood on the borders of this lake tivoli is seen at a distance lying along the brow of a hill its situation has given horace occasion to call it tibur supinum as virgil perhaps for the same reason entitles it superbum the villa de medicis with its waterworks the cascade of the teverone and the ruins of the sibyls temple of which vignola has made a little copy at peters de montorio are described in every itinerary i must confess i was most pleased with a beautiful prospect that none of them have mentioned which lies at about a mile distance from the town it opens on one side into the roman campania where the eye loses it self on a smooth spacious plain on the other side is a more broken and interrupted scene made up of an infinite variety of inequalities and shadowings that naturally arise from an agreeable mixture of hills groves and valleys but the most enlivening part of all is the river teverone which you see at about a quarter of a miles distance throwing it self down a precipice and falling by several cascades from one rock to another till it gains the bottom of the valley where the sight of it would be quite lost did not it sometimes discover it self through the breaks and openings of the woods that grow about it the roman painters often work upon this landscape and i am apt to believe that horace had his eye upon it in those two or three beautiful touches which he has given us of these seats the teverone was formerly called the anio me nec tam patiens lacedaemon nec tam larissae percussit campus opimae quam domus albuneae resonantis et praeceps anio et tiburni lacus et uda mobilibus pomaria rivis l   o   not fair larissas fruitful shore nor lacedaemon charms me more than high albuneas airy walls resounding with her waterfalls and tivolis delightful shades and anio rolling in caseades that through the flowery meadows glides and all the beauteous scene divides   i remember monsieur dacier explains mobilibus by ductilibus and believes that the word relates to the conduits pipes and canals that were made to distribute the waters up and down according to the pleasure of the owner but any one who sees the teverone must be of another opinion and conclude it to be one of the most moveable rivers in the world that has its stream broken by such a multitude of cascades and is so often shifted out of one channel into another after a very turbulent and noisie course of several miles among the rocks and mountains the teverone falls into the valley beforementioned where it recovers its temper as it were by little and little and after many turns and windings glides peaceably into the tiber in which sense we are to understand silius italicuss description to give it its proper beauty sulphureis gelidus qua serpit leniter undis ad genitorem anio labens sine murmr tibrim here the loud anios boisterous clamours cease that with submissive murmurs glides in peace to his old sire the tiber    at frescati i had the satisfaction of seeing the first sketch of versailles in the walks and waterworks the prospect from it was doubtless much more delightful formerly when the campania was set thick with towns villas and plantations ciceros tusculum was at a place called grotto ferrate about two miles off this town though most of the modern writers have fixed it to frescati nardini says there was found among the ruins at grotto ferrate a piece of sculpture which cicero himself mentions in one of his familiar epistles in going to frescati we had a fair view of mount algido  on our way to palaestrina we saw the lake regillus famous for the apparition of castor and pollux who were here seen to give their horses drink after the battle between the romans and the soninlaw of tarquin at some distance from it we had a view of the lacus gabinus that is much larger than the former we left the road for about half a mile to see the sources of a modern aqueduct it is entertaining to observe how the several little springs and rills that break out of the sides of the mountain are gleaned up and conveyed through little covered channels into the main hollow of the aqueduct it was certainly very lucky for rome seeing it had occasion for so many aqueducts that there chanced to be such a range of mountains within its neighborhood for by this means they could take up their water from what height they pleased without the expense of such an engine as that of marli thus the claudian aqueduct ran thirty eight miles and sunk after the proportion of five foot and a half every mile by the advantage only of a high source and the low situation of rome palaestrina stands very high like most other towns in italy for the advantage of the cool breezes for which reason virgil calls it altum and horace frigidum praeneste statius calls it praeneste sacrum because of the famous temple of fortune that stood in it there are still great pillars of granite and other fragments of this ancient temple but the most considerable remnant of it is a very beautiful mosaic pavement the finest i have ever seen in marble the parts are so well joined together that the whole piece looks like a continued picture there are in it the figures of a rhinoceros of elephants and of several other animals with little landskips which look very lively and well painted though they are made out of the natural colors and shadows of the marble i do not remember ever to have met with any old roman mosaic composed of little pieces of clay half vitrifyd and prepared at the glasshouses which the italians call smalte these are much in use at present and may be made of what color and figure the workman pleases which is a modern improvement of the art and enables those who are employed in it to make much finer pieces of mosaic than they did formerly  in our excursion to albano we went as far as nemi that takes its name from the nemus dianae the whole country thereabouts is still overrun with woods and thickets the lake of nemi lies in a very deep bottom so surrounded on all sides with mountains and groves that the surface of it is never ruffled with the least breath of wind which perhaps together with the clearness of its waters gave it formerly the name of dianas lookingglass  speculumque dianae virg  prince caesarini has a palace at jensano very near nemi in a pleasant situation and set off with many beautiful walks in our return from jensano to albano we passed through la ricca the aricia of the ancients horaces first stage from rome to brundisi there is nothing at albano so remarkable as the prospect from the capucins garden which for the extent and variety of pleasing incidents is i think the most delightful one that i ever saw it takes in the whole campania and terminates in a full view of the mediterranean you have a sight at the same time of the alban lake which lies just by in an oval figure of about seven miles round and by reason of the continued circuit of high mountains that encompass it looks like the area of some vast amphitheater this together with the several green hills and naked rocks within the neighborhood makes the most agreeable confusion imaginable albano keeps up its credit still for wine which perhaps would be as good as it was anciently did they preserve it to as great an age but as for olives there are now very few here though they are in great plenty at tivoli  albani pretiosa senectus juv sat    cras bibet albanis aliquid de montibus aut de setinis cujus patriam

breeze of breathing air to tusculum or algido repair or in moist tivolis retirements find a cooling shade and a refreshing wind   on the contrary at present rome is never fuller of nobility than in summer time for the country towns are so infested with unwholesome vapors that they dare not trust themselves in them while the heats last there is no question but the air of the campania would be now as healthful as it was formerly were there as many fires burning in it and as many inhabitants to manure the soil leaving rome about the latter end of october in my way to sienna i lay the first night at a little village in the territories of the ancient veii haec tum nomina erant nunc sunt sine nomine campi  the ruins of their capital city are at present so far lost that the geographers are not

fabii were slain tercentum numerabat avos quos turbine martis abstulit una dies cum fors non aequa labori patricio cremerae maculavit sanguine ripas sil it l   fabius a numerous ancestry could tell three hundred heroes that in battle fell near the famed cremeras disastrous flood that ran polluted with patrician blood   we saw afterward in the progress of our voyage the lakes of vico and bolsena the last is reckoned one and twenty miles in circuit and is plentifully stocked with fish and fowl there are in it a couple of islands that are perhaps the two floating isles mentioned by pliny with that improbable circumstance of their appearing sometimes like a circle and sometimes like a triangle but never like a quadrangle it is easy enough to conceive how they might become fixed though they once floated and it is not very credible that the naturalist could be deceived in his account of a place that lay as it were in the neighborhood of rome at one end of this lake stands montefiascone the habitation of virgils aequi falisci aen   and on the side of it the town of the volsinians now called bolsena aut positis nemorosa inter juga volsiniis juv sat    volsinium stood covered with mountains and enclosed with wood   i saw in the churchyard of bolsena an antique funeral monument of that kind which they called a sarcophagus very entire and what is particular engraven on all sides with a curious representation of a bacchanal had the inhabitants observed a couple of lewd figures at one end of it they would not have thought it a proper ornament for the place where it now stands after having traveled hence to aquapendente that stands in a wonderful pleasant situation we came to the little brook which separates the popes dominions from the great dukes the frontier castle of radicofani is seated on the highest mountain in the country and is as well fortified as the situation of the place will permit we here found the natural face of the country quite changed from what we had been entertained with in the popes dominions for instead of the many beautiful scenes of green mountains and fruitful valleys that we had been presented with for some days before we saw now nothing but a wild naked prospect of rocks and hills worn on all sides with gutters and channels and not a tree or shrub to be met with in a vast circuit of several miles this savage prospect put me in mind of the italian proverb that the pope has the flesh and the great duke the bones of italy among a large extent of these barren mountains i saw but a single spot that was cultivated on which there stood a convent  sienna leghorne pisa sienna stands high and is adorned with a great many towers of brick which in the time of the commonwealth were erected to such of the members as had done any considerable service to their country these towers gave us a sight of the town a great while before we entered it there is nothing in this city so extraordinary as the cathedral which a man may view with pleasure after he has seen st peters though it is quite of another make and can only be looked upon as one of the masterpieces of gothic architecture when a man sees the prodigious pains and expense that our forefathers have been at in these barbarous buildings one cannot but fancy to himself what miracles of architecture they would have left us had they only been instructed in the right way for when the devotion of those ages was much warmer than it is at present and the riches of the people much more at the disposal of the priests there was so much money consumed on these gothic cathedrals as would have finished a greater variety of noble buildings than have been raised either before or since that time  one would wonder to see the vast labor that has been laid out on this single cathedral the very spouts are laden with ornaments the windows are formed like so many scenes of perspective with a multitude of little pillars retiring one behind another the great columns are finely engraven with fruits and foliage that run twisting about them from the very top to the bottom the whole body of the church is checkered with different lays of white and black marble the pavement curiously cut out in designs and scripturestories and the front covered with such a variety of figures and overrun with so many little mazes and labyrinths of sculpture that nothing in the world can make a prettier show to those who prefer false beauties and affected ornaments to a noble and majestic simplicity over against this church stands a large hospital erected by a shoemaker who has been beatifyd though never sainted there stands a figure of him superscribd suitor ultra crepidam i shall speak nothing of the extent of this city the cleanliness of its streets nor the beauty of its piazza which so many travelers have described as this is the last republic that fell under the subjection of the duke of florence so is it still supposed to retain many hankerings after its ancient liberty for this reason when the keys and pageants of the dukes towns and governments pass in procession before him on st john baptists day i was told that sienna comes in the rear of his dominions and is pushed forward by those who follow to show the reluctance it has to appear in such a solemnity i shall say nothing of the many gross and absurd traditions of st catherine of sienna who is the great saint of this place i think there is as much pleasure in hearing a man tell his dreams as in reading accounts of this nature a traveller that thinks them worth his observation may fill a book with them at every great town in italy  from sienna we went forward to leghorne where the two ports the bagnio and donatellis statue of the great duke amidst the four slaves chained to his pedestal are very noble sights the square is one of the largest and will be one of the most beautiful in italy when this statue is erected in it and a townhouse built at one end of it to front the church that stands at the other they are at a continual expense to cleanse the ports and keep em from being choked up which they do by the help of several engines that are always at work and employ many of the great dukes slaves whatever part of the harbor they scoop in it has an influence on all the rest for the sea immediately works the whole bottom to a level they draw a double advantage from the dirt that is taken up as it clears the port and at the same time dries up several marshes about the town where they lay it from time to time one can scarce imagine how great profits the duke of tuscany receives from this single place which are not generally thought so considerable because it passes for a free port but it is very well known how the great duke on a late occasion notwithstanding the privileges of the merchants drew no small sums of money out of them though still in respect of the exorbitant dues that are paid at most other ports it deservedly retains the name of free it brings into his dominions a great increase of people from all other nations they reckon in it near ten thousand jews many of them very rich and so great traffickers that our english factors complain they have most of our country trade in their hands it is true the strangers pay little or no taxes directly but out of every thing they buy there goes a large gabel to the government the very icemerchant at leghorne pays above a thousand pound sterling annually for his privilege and the tobaccomerchant ten thousand the ground is sold by the great duke at a very high price and houses are every day rising on it all the commodities that go up into the country of which there are great quantities are clogged with impositions as soon as they leave leghorne all the wines oils and silks that come down from the fruitful valleys of pisa florence and other parts of tuscany must make their way through several duties and taxes before they can reach the port the canal that runs from the sea into the arno gives a convenient carriage to all goods that are to be shipped off which does not a little enrich the owners and in proportion as private men grow wealthy their legacies lawsuits daughters the portions etc increase in all which the great duke comes in for a considerable share the lucquese who traffic at this port are said to bring in a great deal into the dukes coffers another advantage which may be of great use to him is that at five or six days warning he might find credit in this town for very large sums of money which no other prince in italy can pretend to i need not take notice of the reputation that this port gives him among foreign princes but there is one benefit arising from it which though never thrown into the account is doubtless very considerable it is well known how the pisans and florentines long regretted the loss of their ancient liberty and their subjection to a family that some of them thought themselves equal to in the flourishing times of their commonwealths the town of leghorne has accidentally done what the greatest fetch of politics would have found difficult to have brought about for it has almost unpeopled pisa if we compare it with what it was formerly and every day lessens the number of the inhabitants of florence this does not only weaken those places but at the same time turns many of the busiest spirits from their old notions of honor and liberty to the thoughts of traffic and merchandise and as men engaged in a road of thriving are no friends to changes and revolutions they are at present worn into a habit of subjection and push all their pursuits another way it is no wonder therefore that the great duke has such apprehensions of the popes making civita vecchia a free port which may in time prove so very prejudicial to leghorne it would be thought an improbable story should i set down the several methods that are commonly reported to have been made use of during the last pontificate to put a stop to this design the great dukes money was so well bestowed in the conclave that several of the cardinals dissuaded the pope from the undertaking and at last turned all his thoughts upon the little port which he made at antium near nettuno the chief workmen that were to have conveyed the water to civita vecchia were bought off and when a poor capucin that was thought proof against all bribes had undertaken to carry on the work he died a little after he had entered upon it the present pope however who is very well acquainted with the secret history and the weakness of his predecessor seems resolved to bring the project to its perfection he has already been at vast charges in finishing the aqueduct and had some hopes that if the war should drive our english merchants from sicily and naples they would settle here his holiness has told some english gentlemen that those of our nation should have the greatest privileges of any but the subjects of the church one of our countrymen who makes a good figure at rome told me the pope has this design extremely at his heart but that he fears the english will suffer nothing like a resident or consul in his dominions though at the same time he hoped the business might as well be transacted by one that had no public character this gentleman has so busied himself in the affair that he has offended the french and spanish cardinals insomuch that cardinal janson refused to see him when he would have made his apology for what he had said to the pope on this subject there is one great objection to civita vecchia that the air of the place is not wholesome but this they say proceeds from want of inhabitants the air of leghorne having been worse than this before the town was well peopled  the great profits which have accrued to the duke of florence from his free port have set several of the states of italy on the same project the most likely to succeed in it would be the genoese who lie more convenient than the venetians and have a more inviting form of government than that of the church or that of florence but as the port of genoa is so very ill guarded against storms that no privileges can tempt the merchants from leghorne into it so dare not the genoese make any other of their ports free least it should draw to it most of their commerce and inhabitants and by consequence ruin their chief city  from leghorne i went to pisa where there is still the shell of a great city though not half furnished with inhabitants the great church baptistery and and leaning tower are very well worth seeing and are built after the same fancy with the cathedral of sienna half a days journey more brought me into the republic of lucca  the republic of lvcca it is very pleasant to see how the small territories of this little republic are cultivated to the best advantage so that one cannot find the least spot of ground that is not made to contribute its utmost to the owner in all the inhabitants there appears an air of cheerfulness and plenty not often to be met with in those of the countries which lie about em there is but one gate for strangers to enter at that it may be known what numbers of them are in the town over it is written in letters of gold libertas  this republic is shut up in the great dukes dominions who at present is very much incensed against it and seems to threaten it with the fate of florence pisa and sienna the occasion as follows  the lucquese plead prescription for hunting in one of the dukes forests that lies upon their frontiers which about two years since was strictly forbidden them the prince intending to preserve the game for his own pleasure two or three sportsmen of the republic who had the hardiness to offend against the prohibition were seized and kept in a neighboring prison their countrymen to the number of threescore attacked the place where they were kept in custody and rescued them the great duke redemands his prisoners and as a further satisfaction would have the governor of the town where the threescore assailants had combined together delivered into his hands but receiving only excuses he resolved to do himself justice accordingly he ordered all the lucquese to be seized that were found on a market day in one of his frontier towns these amounted to fourscore among whom were persons of some consequence in the republic they are now in prison at florence and as it is said treated hardly enough for there are fifteen of the number dead within less than two years the king of spain who is protector of the commonwealth received information from the great duke of what had passed who approved of his proceedings and ordered the lucquese by his governor or milan to give a proper satisfaction the republic thinking themselves ill used by their protector as they say at florence have sent to prince eugene to desire the emperors protection with an offer of winter quarters as it is said for four thousand germans the great duke rises on them in his demands and will not be satisfied with less than a hundred thousand crowns and a solemn ambassy to beg pardon for the past and promise amendment for the future thus stands the affair at present that may end in the ruin of the commonwealth if the french succeed in italy it is pleasant however to hear the discourse of the common people of lucca who are firmly persuaded that one lucquese can beat five florentines who are grown low spirited as they pretend by the great dukes oppressions and have nothing worth fighting for they say they can bring into the field twenty or thirty thousand fighting men all ready to sacrifice their lives for their liberty they have quantity of arms and ammunition but few horse it must be owned these people are more happy at least in imagination than the rest of their neighbors because they think themselves so though such a chimerical happiness is not peculiar to republicans for we find the subjects of the most absolute prince in europe are as proud of their monarch as the lucquese of being subject to none should the french affairs prosper in italy it is possible the great duke may bargain for the republic of lucca by the help of his great treasures as his predecessors did formerly with the emperor for that of sienna the great dukes have never yet attempted any thing on lucca as not only fearing the arms of their protector but because they are well assured that should the lucquese be reduced to the last extremities they would rather throw themselves under the government of the geneose or some stronger neighbor than submit to a state for which they have so great an aversion and the florentines are very sensible that it is much better having a weak state within their dominions than the branch of one as strong as themselves but should so formidable a power as that of the french king support them in their attempts there is no government in italy that would dare to interpose this republic for the extent of its dominions is esteemed the richest and best peopled state of italy the whole administration of the government passes into different hands at the end of every two months which is the greatest security imaginable to their liberty and wonderfully contributes to the quick dispatch of all public affairs but in any exigence of state like that they are now pressed with it certainly asks a much longer time to conduct any design for the good of the commonwealth to its maturity and perfection  florence i had the good luck to be at florence when there was an opera acted which was the eighth that i had seen in italy i could not but smile to read the solemn protestation of the poet in the first page where he declares that he believes neither in the fates deities or destinies and that if he has made use of the words it is purely out of a poetical liberty and not from his real sentiments for that in all these particulars he believes as the holy mother church believes and commands protesta le voci fato deita destino e simili che per entro questo drama trovarai son mess per ischerzo poetico e non per sentimento vero credendo sempre in tutto quello che creed e comanda santa madre chiesa    there are some beautiful palaces it florence and as tuscan pillars and rustic work owe their original to this country the architects always take care to give them a place in the great edifices that are raised in tuscany the dukes new palace is a very noble pile built after this manner which makes it look extremely solid and majestic it is not unlike that of luxemburg at paris which was built by mary of medicis and for that reason perhaps the workmen fell into the tuscan humor i found in the court of this palace what i could not meet with any where in rome i mean an antique statue of hercules lifting up antaeus from the earth which i have already had occasion to speak of it was found in rome and brought hither under the reign of leo the tenth there are abundance of pictures in the several apartments by the hands of the greatest masters  but it is the famous gallery of the old palace where are perhaps the noblest collections of curiosities to be met with in any part of the whole world the gallery it self is made in the shape of an l according to mr lassel but if it must needs be like a letter it resembles the greek p most it is adorned with admirable pieces of sculpture as well modern as ancient of the last sort i shall mention those that are rarest either for the person they represent or the beauty of the sculpture among the busts of the emperors and emperesses there are these that follow which are all very scarce and some of them almost singular in their kind agrippa caligula otho nerva aelius verus pertinax geta didius julianus albinus extremely well wrought and what is seldom seen in alabaster gordianus africanus the elder eliogabalus galien the elder and the younger pupienus i have put agrippa among the emperors because he is generally ranged so in sets of medals as some that follow among the emperesses have no other right to the company they are joined with domitia agrippina wife of germanicus antonia matidia plotina mallia scantilla falsely inscribed under her bust julia severi aquilia severa julia maesa i have generally observed at rome which is the great magazine of these antiquities that the same heads which are rare in medals are also rare in marble and indeed one may commonly assign the same reason for both which was the shortness of the emperor reigns that did not give the work men time to make many of their figures and as the shortness of their reigns was generally occasioned by the advancement of a rival it is no wonder that no body worked on the figure of a deceased emperor when his enemy was in the throne this observation however does not always hold an agrippa or caligula for example is a common coin but a very extraordinary bust and a tiberius a rare coin but a common bust which one would the more wonder at if we consider the indignities that were offered to this emperors statues after his death the tiberius in tiberim is a known instance  among the busts of such emperors as are common enough there are several in the gallery that deserve to be taken notice of for the excellence of the sculpture as those of augustus vespasian adrian marcus aurelius lucius verus septimius severus caracalla geta there is in the same gallery a beautiful bust of alexander the great casting up his face to heaven with a noble air of grief or discontentedness in his looks i have seen two or three antique busts of alexander in the same air and posture and am apt to think the sculptor had in his thoughts the conquerors weeping for new worlds or some other the like circumstance of his history there is also in porphyry the head of a faun and of the god pan among the entire figures i took particular notice of a vestal virgin with the holy fire burning before her this statue i think may decide that notable controversy among the antiquaries whether the vestals after having received the tonsure ever suffered their hair to come again for it is here full grown and gathered under the veil the brazen figure of the consul with the ring on his finger reminded me of juvenals majoris pondera gemmae there is another statue in brass supposed to be of apollo with this modern inscription on the pedestal which i must confess i do not know what to make of ut potui huc veni musis et fratre relicto i saw in the same gallery the famous figure of the wild boar the gladiator the narcissus the cupid and psyche the flora with some modern statues that several others have described among the antique figures there is a fine one of morpheus in touchstone i have always observed that this god is represented by the ancient statuaries under the figure of a boy asleep with a bundle of poppy in his hand i at first took it for a cupid till i had taken notice that it had neither bow nor quiver i suppose doctor lister has been guilty of the same mistake in the reflections he makes on what he calls the sleeping cupid with poppy in his hands  qualia namque corpora nudorum tabula pinguntur amorum talis erat sed ne faciat discrimina cultus aut huic add leves aut illis deem pharetras ov met l  0 such are the cupids that in paint we view but that the likeness may be nicely true a laden quiver to his shoulders tie or bid the cupids lay their quivers by   it is probable they chose to represent the god of sleep under the figure of a boy contrary to all our modern designers because it is that age which has its repose the least broken by cares and anxieties statius in his celebrated invocation of sleep addresses himself to him under the same figure crimine quo merui juvenis placidissime divum quove errore miser donis ut solus egerem somne tuis tacet omne pecus volucresque feraeque etc silv li   tell me thou best of gods thou gentle youth tell me my sad offense that only i while hushed at ease thy drowsy subjects lie in the dead silence of the night complain nor taste the blessings of thy peaceful reign   i never saw any figure of sleep that was not of black marble which has probably some relation to the night that is the proper season for rest i should not have made this remark but that i remember to have read in one of the ancient authors that the nile is generally represented in stone of this color because it flows from the country of the ethiopians which shows us that the statuaries had sometimes an eye to the person they were to represent in the choice they made of their marble there are still at rome some of these black statues of the nile which are cut in a kind of touchstone usque coloratis amnis devexus ab indis virg geor   de nilo  at one end of the gallery stand two antique marble pillars curiously wrought with the figures of the old roman arms and instruments of war after a full survey of the gallery we were led into four or five chambers of curiosities that stand on the side of it the first was a cabinet of antiquities made up chiefly of idols talismans lamps and hieroglyphics i saw nothing in it that i was not before acquainted with except the four following figures in brass  i a little image of juno sispita or sospita which perhaps is not to be met with any where else but on medals she is clothed in a goatsskin the horns sticking out above her head the right arm is broken that probably supported a shield and the left a little defaced though one may see it held something in its grasp formerly the feet are bare i remember tullys description of this goddess in the following words hercle inquit quam tibi illam nostram sospitam quam tu nunquam ne in somniis vides nisi cum pelle caprina cum hasta cum scutulo cum calceolis repandis ivnonisis pitae s c a medal of juno sispita vid fulv ursin in familia thoria and porcilia  this is a reverse of anton pius    ii an antique model of the famous laocoon and his two sons that stands in the belvidera at rome this is the more remarkable as it is entire in those parts where the statue is maimed it was by the help of this model that bandinelli finished his admirable copy of the laocoon which stands at one end of this gallery  iii an apollo or amphion i took notice of this little figure for the singularity of the instrument which i never before saw in ancient sculpture it is not unlike a violin and played on after the same manner i doubt howeever whether this figure be not of a later date than the rest by the meanness of the workmanship  iv a corona radialis with only eight spikes to it every one knows the usual number was twelve some say allusion to the signs of the zodiac and others to the labors of hercules  ingenti mole latinus quadrijugo vehitur curru cui tempora circum aurati bis sex radii fulgentia cingunt solis avi specimen  virg aen    four steeds the chariot of latinus bear twelve golden beams around his temples play to mark his lineage from the god of day mr dryden  the two next chambers are made up of several artificial curiosities in ivory amber crystal marble and precious stones which all voyagewriters are full of in the chamber that is shown last stands the celebrated venus of medicis the statue seems much less than the life as being perfectly naked and in company with others of a larger make it is notwithstanding as big as the ordinary size of a woman as i concluded from the measure of her wrist for from the bigness of any one part it is easy to guess at all the rest in a figure of such nice proportions the softness of the flesh the delicacy of the shape air and posture and the correctness of design in this statue are inexpressible i have several reasons to believe that the name of the sculptor on the pedestal is not so old as the statue this figure of venus put me in mind of a speech she makes in one of the greek epigrams  anchises paris and adonis too have seen me naked and exposed to view all these i frankly own without denying but where has this praxiteles been prying   there is another venus in the same circle that would make a good figure any where else there are among the old roman statues several of venus in different postures and habits as there are many particular figures of her made after the same design i fancy it is not hard to find among them some that were made after the three statues of this goddess which pliny mentions in the same chamber is the roman slave whetting his knife and listening which from the shoulders upward is incomparable the two wrestlers are in the same room i observed here likewise a very curious bust of annius verus the young son of marcus aurelius who died at nine years of age i have seen several other busts of him at rome though his medals are exceeding rare  the great duke has ordered a large chamber to be fitted up for old inscriptions urns monuments and the like sets of antiquities i was shown several of them which are not yet put up there are the two famous inscriptions that give so great a light to the histories of appius who made the highway and of fabius the dictator they contain a short account of the honors they passed through and the actions they performed i saw too the busts of tranquillina mother to gordianus pius and of quintus herennius son to trajan decius which are extremely valuable for their rarity and a beautiful old figure made after the celebrated hermaphrodite in the villa borghese i saw nothing that has not been observed by several others in the argenteria the tabernacle of st laurences chapel and the chamber of painters the chapel of st laurence will be perhaps the most costly piece of work on the face of the earth when completed but it advances so very slowly that it is not impossible but the family of medicis may be extinct before their burial place is finished  the great duke has lived many years separate from the duchess who is at present in the court of france and intends there to end her days the cardinal his brother is old and infirm and could never be induced to resign his purple for the uncertain prospect of giving an heir to the dukedom of tuscany the great prince has been married several years without any children and notwithstanding all the precautions in the world were taken for the marriage of the prince his younger brother as the finding out a lady for him who was in the vigor and flower of her age and had given marks of her fruitfulness by a former husband they have all hitherto proved unsuccessful there is a branch of the family of medicis in naples the head of it has been owned as a kinsman by the grand duke and it is thought will succeed to his dominions in case the princes his sons die childless though it is not impossible but in such a conjuncture the commonwealths that are thrown under the great duchy may make some efforts toward the recovery of their ancient liberty  i was in the library of manuscripts belonging to st laurence of which there is a printed catalogue i looked into the virgil which disputes its antiquity with that of the vatican it wants the ille ego qui quondam etc and the twenty two lines in the second aeneid beginning at jamque adeo super unus eram  i must confess i always thought this passage left out with a great deal of judgment by tucca and varius as it seems to contradict a part in the sixth aeneid and represents the hero in a passion that is at least not at all becoming the greatness of his character besides i think the apparition of venus comes in very properly to draw him away from the sight of priams murder for without such a machine to take him off i cannot see how the hero could with honor leave neoptolemus triumphant and priam unrevenged but since virgils friends thought fit to let drop this incident of helen i wonder they would not blot out or alter a line in venuss speech that has a relation to the rencounter and comes in improperly without it non tibi tyndaridae facies invisa lacaenae culpatusve paris  aen    florence for modern statues i think excels even rome but these i shall pass over in silence that i may not transcribe out of others  the way from florence to bolonia runs over several ranges of mountains and is the worst road i believe of any over the appennines for this was my third time of crossing them it gave me a lively idea of silius italicuss description of hannibals march quoque magis subiere jugo

but still by new ascents the mountain grew and a fresh toil presented to their view   i shall conclude this chapter with the descriptions which the latin poets have given us of the appennines we may observe in them all the remarkable qualities of this prodigious length of mountains that run from one extremity of italy to the other and give rise to an incredible variety of rivers that water this delightful country  nubifer appenninus ov met l    qui siculum porrectus ad usque pelorum finibus ab ligurum populos amplectitur omnes italiae geminumque latus stringentia long utraque perpetuo

we at last came to the river that runs at the foot of them and was formerly called the little rhine following the course of this river we arrived in a short time at bolonia  parvique bononia rheni sil it   bolonia watered by the petty rhine   we here quickly felt the difference of the northern from the southern side of the mountains as well in the coldness of the air as in the badness of the wine this town is famous for the richness of the soil that lies about it and the magnificence of its convents it is likewise esteemed the third in italy for pictures as having been the school of the lombard painters i saw in it three rarities of different kinds which pleased me more than any other shows of the place the first was an authentic silver medal of the younger brutus in the hands of an eminent antiquary one may see the character of the person in the features of the face which is exquisitely well cut on the reverse is the cap of liberty with a dagger on each side of it subscribed id mar for the ides of march the famous date of caesars murder the second was a picture of raphels in st giouanni in monte it is extremely well preserved and represents st cecilia with an instrument of music in her hands on one side of her are the figures of st paul and st john and on the other of mary magdalene and st austin there is something wonderfully divine in the airs of this picture i cannot forbear mentioning for my third curiosity a new staircase that strangers are generally carried to see where the easiness of the ascent within so small a compass the disposition of the lights and the convenient landing are admirably well contrived the wars of italy and the season of the year made me pass through the dutchies of modena parma and savoy with more haste than i would have done at another time the soil of modena and parma is very rich and well cultivated the palaces of the princes are magnificent but neither of them is yet finished we procured a license of the duke of parma to enter the theater and gallery which deserve to be seen as well as any thing of that nature in italy the theater is i think the most spacious of any i ever saw and at the same time so admirably well contrived that from the very depth of the stage the lowest sound may be heard distinctly to the farthest part of the audience as in a whispering place and yet if you raise your voice as high as you please there is nothing like an echo to cause in it the least confusion the gallery is hung with a numerous collection of pictures all done by celebrated hands on one side of the gallery is a large room adorned with inlaid tables cabinets works in amber and other pieces of great art and value out of this we were led into another great room furnished with old inscriptions idols busts medals and the like antiquities i could have spent a day with great satisfaction in this apartment but had only time to pass my eye over the medals which are in great number and many of them very rare the scarcest of all is a pescennius niger on a medalion well preserved it was coined at antioch where this emperor trifled away his time till he lost his life and empire the reverse is a dea salus there are two of otho the reverse a serapis and two of messalina and poppaea in middle brass the reverses of the emperor claudius i saw two medalions of plotina and matidia the reverse to each a pietas with two medals of pertinax the reverse of one vota decennalia and of the other diis custodibus and another of gordianus africanus the reverse i have forgot  the principalities of modena and parma are much about the same extent and have each of them two large towns besides a great number of little villages the duke of parma however is much richer than the duke of modena their subjects would live in great plenty amidst so rich and well cultivated a soil were not the taxes and impositions so very exorbitant for the courts are much too splendid and magnificent for the territories that lie about them and one cannot but be amazed to see such a profusion of wealth laid out in coaches trappings tables cabinets and the like precious toys in which there are few princes of europe who equal them when at the same time they have not had the generosity to make bridges over the rivers of their countries for the convenience of their subjects as well as strangers who are forced to pay an unreasonable exaction at every ferry upon the least rising of the waters a man might well expect in these small governments a much greater regulation of affairs for the ease and benefit of the people than in large overgrown states where the rules of justice beneficence and mercy may be easily put out of their course in passing through the hands of deputies and a long subordination of officers and it would certainly be for the good of mankind to have all the mighty empires and monarchies of the world cantoned out into petty states and principalities that like so many large families might lie under the eye and observation of their proper governors so that the care of the prince might extend it self to every individual person under his protection but since such a general scheme can never be brought about and if it were it would quickly be destroyed by the ambition of some particular state aspiring above the rest it happens very ill at present to be born under one of these petty sovereigns that will be still endeavoring at his subjects cost to equal the pomp and grandeur of greater princes as well as to outvie those of his own rank  for this reason there are no people in the world who live with more ease and prosperity than the subjects of little commonwealths as on the contrary there are none who suffer more under the grievances of a hard government than the subjects of little principalities i left the road of milan on my right hand having before seen that city and after having passed through asti the frontier town of savoy i at last came within sight of the po which is a fine river even at turin though within six miles of its source this river has been made the scene of two or three poetical stories ovid has chosen it out to throw his phaeton into it after all the smaller rivers had been dried up in the conflagration  i have read some botanical critics who tell us the poets have not rightly followed the traditions of antiquity in metamorphosing the sisters of phaeton into poplars who ought to have been turned into larchtrees for that it is this kind of tree which sheds a gum and is commonly found on the banks of the po the change of cycnus into a swan which closes up the disasters of phaetons family was wrought on the same place where the sisters were turned into trees the descriptions that virgil and ovid have made of it cannot be sufficiently admired  claudian has set off his description of the eridanus with all the poetical stories that have been made of it  ille caput placidis sublime fluentis extulit et totis lucem spargentia ripis

shone divinely bright and over the banks diffused a yellow light no interwoven reeds a garland made to hide his brows within the vulgar shade but poplar wreaths around his temples spread and tears of amber trickled down his head a spacious veil from his broad shoulders flew that set the unhappy phaeton to view the flaming chariot and the steeds it showed and the whole fable in the mantle glowed beneath his arm an urn supported lies with stars embellished and fictitious skies for titan by the mighty loss dismayed among the heavens the immortal fact displayed lest the remembrance of his grief should fail and in the constellations wrote his tale a swan in memory of cycnus shines the mourning sisters weep in watery signs the burning chariot and the charioteer in bright boots and his wane appear whilst in a track of light the waters run that washed the body of his blasted son   the river po gives a name to the chief street of turin which fronts the dukes palace and when finished will be one of the noblest in italy for its length there is one convenience in this city that i never observed in any other and which makes some amends for the badness of the pavement by the help of a river that runs on the upper side of the town they can convey a little stream of water through all the most considerable streets which serves to cleanse the gutters and carries away all the filth that is swept into it the manager opens his sluice every night and distributes the water into what quarters of the town he pleases besides the ordinary convenience that arises from it it is of great use when a fire chances to break out for at a few minutes warning they have a little river running by the very walls of the house that is burning the court of turin is reckoned the most splendid and polite of any in italy but by reason of its being in mourning i could not see it in its magnificence the common people of this state are more exasperated against the french than even the rest of the italians for the great mischiefs they have suffered from them are still fresh upon their memories and notwithstanding this interval of peace one may easily trace out the several marches which the french armies have made through their country by the ruin and desolation they have left behind them i passed through piemont and savoy at a time when the duke was forced by the necessity of his affairs to be in alliance with the french  i came directly from turin to geneva and had a very easy journey over mount cennis though about the beginning of december the snows having not yet fallen on the top of this high mountain is a large plain and in the midst of the plain a beautiful lake which would be very extraordinary were there not several mountains in the neighborhood rising over it the inhabitants thereabout pretend that it is unfathomable and i question not but the waters of it fill up a deep valley before they come to a level with the surface of the plain it is well stocked with trouts though they say it is covered with ice three quarters of the year  there is nothing in the natural face of italy that is more delightful to a traveller than the several lakes which are dispersed up and down among the many breaks and hollows of the alps and appennines for as these vast heaps of mountains are thrown together with so much irregularity and confusion they form a great variety of hollow bottoms that often lie in the figure of so many artificial basins where if any fountains chance to rise they naturally spread themselves into lakes before they can find any issue for their waters the ancient romans took a great deal of pains to hew out a passage for these lakes to discharge themselves into some neighboring river for the bettering of the air or the recovering of the soil that lay underneath them the draining of the fucinus by the emperor claudius with the prodigious multitude of spectators who attended it and the famous naumachia and splendid entertainment which were made upon it before the sluices were opened is a known piece of history in all our journey through the alps as well when we climbed as when we descended them we had still a river running along with the road that probably at first occasioned the discovery of this passage i shall end this chapter with a description of the alps as i did the last with those of the appennines the poet perhaps would not have taken notice that there is no spring nor summer on these mountains but because in this respect the alps are quite different from the appennines which have as delightful green spots among them as any in italy cuncta gelu canaque aeternum grandine tecta atque aevi glaciem cohibent riget ardua montis aetherii facies surgentique obvia phoebo duratas nescit flammis mollire pruinas quantum tartareus regni pallentis hiatus ad manes imos atque atrae flagna paludis a supera tellure patet tam longa per auras erigitur tellus et coelum intercipit umbra nullum ver usquam nullique aestatis honores sola jugis habitat  sedesque tuetur perpetuas deformis hyems illa undique nubes huc atras agit et mixtos cum grandine nimbos nam cuncti flatus ventique furentia regna alpina posuere domo caligat in altis obtutus saxis abeuntque in nubila montes sil it l   stiff with eternal ice and hid in snow that fell a thousand centuries ago the mountain stands nor can the rising sun unfix her frosts and teach em how to run deep as the dark infernal waters lie from the bright regions of the cheerful sky so far the proud ascending rocks invade heavens upper realms and cast a dreadful shade no spring nor summer on the mountain seen smiles with gay fruits or with delightful green but hoary winter unadorned and bare dwells in the dire retreat and freezes there there she assembles all her blackest storms and the rude hail in rattling tempests forms thither the loud tumultuous winds resort and on the mountain keep their boisterous court that in thick showers her rocky summet shrowds and darkens all the broken view with clouds   geneva and the lake near st julian in savoy the alps begin to enlarge themselves on all sides and open into a vast circuit of ground which in respect of the other parts of the alps may pass for a plain champian country this extent of lands with the leman lake would make one of the prettiest and most defensible dominions in europe was it all thrown into a single state and had geneva for its metropolis but there are three powerful neighbors who divide among them the greatest part of this fruitful country the duke of savoy has the chablais and all the fields that lie beyond the arve as far as to the ecluse the king of france is master of the whole country of gex and the canton of bern comes in for that of vaud geneva and its little territories lie in the heart of these three states the greatest part of the town stands upon a hill and has its views bounded on all sides by several ranges of mountains which are however at so great a distance that they leave open a wonderful variety of beautiful prospects the situation of these mountains has some particular effects on the country which they enclose as first they cover it from all winds except the south and north it is to the last of these winds that the inhabitants of geneva ascribe the healthfulness of their air for as the alps surround them on all sides they form a vast kind of basin where there would be a constant stagnation of vapors the country being so well watered did not the north wind put them in motion and scatter them from time to time another effect the alps have on geneva is that the sun here rises later and sets sooner than it does to other places of the same latitude i have often observed that the tops of the neighboring mountains have been covered with light above half an hour after the sun is down in respect of those who live at geneva these mountains likewise very much increase their summer heats and make up a horizon that has something in it very singular and agreeable on one side you have the long tract of hills that goes under the name of mount jura covered with vineyards and pasturage and on the other huge precipices of naked rocks rising up in a thousand odd figures and cleft in some places so as to discover high mountains of snow that lie several leagues behind them toward the south the hills rise more insensibly and leave the eye a vast uninterrupted prospect for many miles but the most beautiful view of all is the lake and the borders of it that lie north of the town  this lake resembles a sea in the color of its waters the storms that are raised on it and the ravage it makes on its banks it receives too a different name from the coasts it washes and in summer has something like an ebb and flow which arises from the melting of the snows that fall into it more copiously at noon than at other times of the day it has five different states bordering on it the kingdom of france the duchy of savoy the canton of bern the bishopric of sion and the republic of geneva i have seen papers fixed up in the canton of bern with this magnificent preface whereas we have been informed of several abuses committed in our ports and harbors on the lake etc  i made a little voyage round the lake and touched on the several towns that lie on its coasts which took up near five days though the wind was pretty fair for us all the while  the right side of the lake from geneva belongs to the duke of savoy and is extremely well cultivated the greatest entertainment we found in coasting it were the several prospects of woods vineyards meadows and cornfieldsd which lie on the borders of it and run up all the sides of the alps where the barrenness of the rocks or the steepness of the ascent will suffer them the wine however on this side of the lake is by no means so good as that on the other as it has not so open a soil and is less exposed to the sun we here passed by yvoire where the duke keeps his galleys and lodged at tonon which is the greatest town on the lake belonging to the savoyard it has four convents and they say about six or seven thousand inhabitants the lake is here about twelve miles in breadth at a little distance from tonon stands ripaille where is a convent of carthusians they have a large forest cut out into walks that are extremely thick and gloomy and very suitable to the genius of the inhabitants there are vistas in it of a great length that terminate upon the lake at one side of the walks you have a near prospect of the alps which are broken into so many steps and precipices that they fill the mind with an agreeable kind of horror and form one of the most irregular misshapen scenes in the world the house that is now in the hands of the carthusians belonged formerly to the hermites of st maurice and is famous in history for the retreat of an antipope who called himself felix the fifth he had been duke of savoy and after a very glorious reign took on him the habit of a hermit and retired into this solitary spot of his dominions his enemies will have it that he lived here in great ease and luxury from whence the italians to this day make use of the proverb andare a ripaglia and the french fair ripaille to express a delightful kind of life they say too that he had great managements with several eccelesiasticks before he turned hermit and that he did it in the view of being advanced to the pontificate however it was he had not been here half a year before he was chosen pope by the council of basil who took upon them to depose eugenio the fourth this promised fair at first but by the death of the emperor who favored amadeo and the resolution of eugenio the greatest part of the church threw it self again under the government of their deposed head our antipope however was still supported by the council of basil and owned by savoy switzerland and a few other little states this schism lasted in the church nine years after which felix voluntarily resigned his title into the hands of pope nicholas the fifth but on the following conditions that amadeo should be the first cardinal in the conclave that the pope should always receive him standing and offer him his mouth to kiss that he should be perpetual cardinallegate in the states of savoy and switzerland and in the archbishopricks of geneva sion bress etc and lastly that all the cardinals of his creation should be recognized by the pope after he had made a peace so acceptable to the church and so honorable to himself he spent the remainder of his life with great devotion at ripaille and died with an extraordinary reputation of sanctity  at tonon they showed us a fountain of water that is in great esteem for its wholesomness they say it weights two ounces in a pound less than the same measure of the lake water notwithstanding this last is very good to drink and as clear as can be imagined a little above tonon is a castle and small garrison the next day we saw other small towns on the coast of savoy where there is nothing but misery and poverty the nearer you come to the end of the lake the mountains on each side grow thicker and higher till at last they almost meet one often sees on the tops of the mountains several sharp rocks that stand above the rest for as these mountains have been doubtless much higher than they are at present the rains have washed away abundance of the soil that has left the veins of stone shooting out of them as in a decayed body the flesh is still shrinking from the bones the natural histories of switzerland talk very much of the fall of these rocks and the great damage they have sometimes done when their foundations have been mouldered with age or rent by an earthquake we saw in several parts of the alps that bordered upon us vast pits of snow as several mountains that lie at a greater distance are wholly covered with it i fancied the confusion of mountains and hollows i here observed furnished me with a more probable reason than any i have met with for those periodical fountains in switzerland which flow only at such particular hours of the day for as the tops of these mountains cast their shadows upon one another they hinder the suns shining on several parts at such certain times so that there are several heaps of snow which have the sun lying upon them two or three hours together and are in the shade all the day afterward if therefore it happens that any particular fountain takes its rise from any of these reservoirs of snow it will naturally begin to flow on such hours of the day as the snow begins to melt but as soon as the sun leaves it again to freeze and harden the fountain dries up and receives no more supplies till about the same time the next day when the heat of the sun again sets the snows a running that fall into the same little conduits traces and canals and by consequence break out and discover themselves always in the same place at the very extremity of the lake the rhone enters and when i saw it brought along with it a prodigious quantity of water the rivers and lakes of this country being much higher in summer than in winter by reason of the melting of the snows one would wonder how so many learned men could fall into so great an absurdity as to believe this river could preserve it self unmixed with the lake till its going out again at geneva which is a course of many miles it was extremely muddy at its entrance when i saw it though as clear as rockwater at its going out besides that it brought in much more water than it carried off the river indeed preserves it self for about a quarter of a mile in the lake but is afterward so wholly mixed and lost with the waters of the lake that one discovers nothing like a stream till within about a quarter of a mile of geneva from the end of the lake to the source of the rhone is a valley of about four days journey in length which gives the name of vallesins to its inhabitants and is the dominion of the bishop of sion we lodged the second night at ville neuve a little town in the canton of bern where we found good accommodations and a much greater appearance of plenty than on the other side of the lake the next day having passed by the castle of chillon we came to versoy another town in the canton of bern where ludlow retired after having left geneva and lausanne the magistrates of the town warned him out of the first by the solicitation of the duchess of orleans as the death of his friend lisle made him quit the other he probably chose this retreat as a place of the greatest safety it being an easy matter to know what strangers are in the town by reason of its situation the house he lived in has this inscription over the door omne solum forti patria quia patris the first part is a piece of a verse in ovid as the last is a cant of his own he is buried in the best of the churches with the following epitaph siste gradum et respice hic jacet edmond ludlow anglus natione provinciae wiltoniensis filius henrici equestris ordinis senatorisque parlamenti cujus quoque fuit ipse membrum patrum stemmate clarus et nobilis virtute propria nobilior religione protestans et insigni pietate coruscus aetatis anno    tribunus militum paulo post exercitus praetor primarius tunc hibernorum domitor in pugna intrepidus et vitae prodigus in victoria clemens et mansuetus patriae libertatis defensor et potestatis arbitrariae propugnator acerrimus cujus causa ab eadem patria    annis extorris meliorique fortuna dignus apud helvetios se recepit ibique aetatis

thomas ejus strenua et maestissima tam in infortuniis quam in matrimonio consors dilectissima quae animi magnitudine et vi amoris conjugalis mota eum in exilium ad obitum usque constanter secuta est anno dom         ludlow was a constant frequenter of sermons and prayers but would never communicate with them either of geneva or vevy just by his monument is a tombstone with the following inscription depositorium andreae broughton armigeri anglicani maydstonensis in comitatu cantii ubi bis praetor urbanus dignatusque etiam fuit sententiam regis regum profari quam ob causam expulsus patria sua peregrinatione ejus finita solo senectutis morbo affectus requiescens a laboribus suis in domino obdormivit    die feb anno d      aetatis suae     the inhabitants of the place could give no account of this broughton but i suppose by his epitaph it is the same person that was clerk to the pretended high court of justice which passed sentence on the royal martyr  the next day we spent at lausanne the greatest town on the lake after geneva we saw the wall of the cathedral church that was opened by an earthquake and shut again some years after by a second the crack can but be just discerned at present though there are several in the town still living who have formerly passed through it the duke of schomberg who was killed in savoy lies in this church but without any monument or inscription over him lausanne was once a republic but is now under the canton of bern and governed like the rest of their dominions by a baily who is sent them every three years from the senate of bern there is one street of this town that has the privilege of acquitting or condemning any person of their own body in matters of life and death every inhabitant of it has his vote which makes a house here sell better than in any other part of the town they tell you that not many years ago it happened that a cobbler had the casting vote for the life of a criminal which he very graciously gave on the merciful side from lausanne to geneva we coasted along the country of the vaud which is the fruitfullest and best cultivated part of any among the alps it belonged formerly to the duke of savoy but was won from him by the canton of bern and made over to it by the treaty of st julian which is still very much regretted by the savoyard we called in at morge where there is an artificial port and a show of more trade than in any other town on the lake from morge we came to nyon the colonia equestris that julius caesar settled in this country is generally supposed to have been planted in this place they have often dug up old roman inscriptions and statues and as i walked in the town i observed in the walls of several houses the fragments of vast corinthian pillars with several other pieces of architecture which must have formerly belonged to some very noble pile of building there is no author that mentions this colony yet it is certain by several old roman inscriptions that there was such an one lucan indeed speaks of a part of caesars army that came to him from the leman lake in the beginning of the civil war deseruere cavo tentoria fixa lemanno  at about five miles distance from nyon they show still the ruins of caesars wall that reached eighteen miles in length from mount jura to the borders of the lake as he has described it in the first book of his commentaries the next town upon the lake is versoy which we could not have an opportunity of seeing as belonging to the king of france it has the reputation of being extremely poor and beggarly we sailed from hence directly for geneva which makes a very noble show from the lake there are near geneva several quarries of freestone that run under the lake when the water is at lowest they make within the borders of it a little square enclosed with four walls in this square they sink a pit and dig for freestone the walls hindering the waters from coming in upon them when the lake rises and runs on all sides of them the great convenience of carriage makes these stones much cheaper than any that can be found upon firm land one sees several deep pits that have been made at several times as one sails over them as the lake approaches geneva it grows still narrower and narrower till at last it changes its name into the rhone that turns all the mills of the town and is extremely rapid notwithstanding its waters are very deep as i have seen a great part of the course of this river i cannot but think it has been guided by the particular hand of providence it rises in the very heart of the alps and has a long valley that seems hewn out on purpose to give its waters a passage amidst so many rocks and mountains which are on all sides of it this brings it almost in a direct line to geneva it would there overflow all the country were there not one particular cleft that divides a vast circuit of mountains and conveys it off to lions from lions there is another great rent which runs across the whole country in almost another straight line and notwithstanding the vast height of the mountains that rise about it gives it the shortest course it can take to fall into the sea had such a river as this been left to it self to have found its way out from among the alps whatever windings it had made it must have formed several little seas and have laid many countries under water before it had come to the end of its course i shall not make any remarks upon geneva that is a republic so well known to the english it lies at present under some difficulties by reason of the emperors displeasure who has forbidden the importation of their manufactures into any part of the empire which will certainly raise a sedition among the people unless the magistrates find some way to remedy it and they say it is already done by the interposition of the states of holland the occasion of the emperors prohibition was their furnishing great sums to the king of france for the payment of his army in italy they obliged themselves to remit after the rate of twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling per annum divided into so many monthly payments as the interest was very great several of the merchants of lions who would not trust their king in their own names are said to have contributed a great deal under the names of geneva merchants the republic fancies it self hardly treated by the emperor since it is not any action of the state but a compact among private persons that has furnished out these several remittances they pretend however to have put a stop to them and by that means are in hopes again to open their commerce into the empire  fribourg bern soleurre zurich st gaul lindaw etc from geneva i traveled to lausanne and thence to fribourg which is but a mean town for the capital of so large a canton its situation is so irregular that they are forced to climb up to several parts of it by staircases of a prodigious ascent this inconvenience however gives them a very great commodity in case a fire breaks out in any part of the town for by reason of several reservoirs on the tops of these mountains by the opening of a sluice they convey a river into what part of the town they please they have four churches four convents of women and as many for men the little chapel called the salutation is very neat and built with a pretty fancy the college of jesuits is they say the finest in switzerland there is a great deal of room in it and several beautiful views from the different parts of it they have a collection of pictures representing most of the fathers of their order who have been eminent for their piety or learning among the rest many english men whom we name rebels and they martyrs henry garnets inscription says that when the heretics could not prevail with him either by force or promises to change his religion they hanged and quartered him at the capucins i saw the escargatoire which i took the more notice of because i do not remember to have met with any thing of the same in other countries it is a square place boarded in and filled with a vast quantity of large snails that are esteemed excellent food when they are well dressed the floor is strowed about half a foot deep with several kinds of plants among which the snails nestle all the winter season when lent arrives they open their magazines and take out of them the best meagre food in the world for there is no dish of fish that they reckon comparable to a ragout of snails  about two leagues from fribourg we went to see a hermitage that is reckoned the greatest curiosity of these parts it lies in the prettiest solitude imaginable among woods and rocks which at first sight dispose a man to be serious there has lived in it a hermit these five and twenty years who with his own hands has worked in the rock a pretty chapel a sacristie a chamber kitchen cellar and other conveniences his chimney is carried up through the whole rock so that you see the sky through it notwithstanding the rooms lie very deep he has cut the side of the rock into a flat for a garden and by laying on it the waste earth that he has found in several of the neighboring parts has made such a spot of ground of it as furnishes out a kind of luxury for a hermit as he saw drops of water distilling from several parts of the rock by following the veins of them he has made himself two or three fountains in the bowels of the mountain that serve his table and water his little garden  we had very bad ways from hence to bern a great part of them through woods of firtrees the great quantity of timber they have in this country makes them mend their highways with wood instead of stone i could not but take notice of the make of several of their barns i here saw after having laid a frame of wood for the foundation they place at the four corners of it four huge blocks cut in such a shape as neither mice nor any other sort of vermin can creep up the sides of them at the same time that they raise the corn above the moisture that might come into it from the ground the whole weight of the barn is supported by these four blocks  what pleased me most at bern was their public walks by the great church they are raised extremely high and that their weight might not break down the walls and pilasters which surround them they are built upon arches and vaults though they are i believe as high as most steeples in england from the streets and gardens that lie at the foot of them yet about forty years ago a person in his drink fell down from the very top to the bottom without doing himself any other hurt than the breaking of an arm he died about four years ago there is the noblest summerprospect in the world from this walk for you have a full view of a huge range of mountains that lie in the country of the grisons and are buried in snow they are about twenty five leagues distance from the town though by reason of their height and their color they seem much nearer the cathedral church stands on one side of these walks and is perhaps the most magnificent of any protestant church in europe out of england it is a very bold work and a masterpiece in gothic architecture  i saw the arsenal of bern where they say there are arms for twenty thousand men there is indeed no great pleasure in visiting these magazines of war after one has seen two or three of them yet it is very well worth a travellers while to look into all that lie in his way for besides the idea it gives him of the forces of a state it serves to fix in his mind the most considerable parts of its history thus in that of geneva one meets with the ladders petard and other utensils which were made use of in their famous escalade besides the weapons they took of the savoyards florentines and french in the several battles mentioned in their history in this of bern you have the figure and armor of the count who founded the town of the famous tell who is represented as shooting at the apple on his sons head the story is too well known to be repeated in this place i here likewise saw the figure and armor of him that headed the peasants in the war upon bern with the several weapons which were found in the hands of his followers they show too abundance of arms that they took from the burgundians in the three great battles which established them in their library and destroyed the great duke of burgundy himself with the bravest of his subjects i saw nothing remarkable in the chambers where the council meet nor in the fortifications of the town these last were made on occasion of the peasants insurrection to defend the place for the future against the like sudden assaults in their liberty i observed a couple of antique figures in metal of a priest pouring wine between the horns of a bull the priest is veiled after the manner of the old roman sacrificers and is represented in the same action that virgil describes in the third aeneid ipsa tenens dextra pateram pulcherrima dido candentis vaccae media inter cornua fundit this antiquity was found at lausanne  the town of bern is plentifully furnished with water there being a great multitude of handsome fountains planted at set distances from one end of the streets to the other there is indeed no country in the world better supplied with water than the several parts of switzerland that i traveled through one meets every where in the roads with fountains continually running into huge troughs that stand underneath them which is wonderfully commodious in a country that so much abounds with horses and cattle it has so many springs breaking out of the sides of the hills and such vast quantities of wood to make pipes of that it is no wonder they are so well stocked with fountains  on the road between bern and soleurre there is a monument erected by the republic of bern which tells us the story of an english man who is not to be met with in any of our own writers the inscription is in latin verse on one side of the stone and in german on the other i had not time to copy it but the substance of it is this one cussinus an english man to whom the duke of austria had given his sister in marriage came to take her from among the swiss by force of arms but after having ravaged the country for some time he was here overthrown by the canton of bern  soleurre is our next considerable town that seemed to me to have a greater air of politeness than any i saw in switzerland the french ambassador has his residence in this place his master contributed a great sum of money to the jesuits church which is not yet quite finished it is the finest modern building in switzerland the old cathedral church stood not far from it at the ascent that leads to it are a couple of antique pillars which belonged to an old heathen temple dedicated to hermes they seem tuscan by their proportion the whole fortification of soleurre is faced with marble but its best fortifications are the high mountains that lie within its neighborhood and separate it from the franche compte  the next days journey carried us through other parts of the canton of bern to the little town of meldingen i was surprised to find in all my road through switzerland the wine that grows in the country of vaud on the borders of the lake of geneva which is very cheap notwithstanding the great distance between the vineyards and the towns that sell the wine but the navigable rivers of switzerland are as commodious to them in this respect as the sea is to the english as soon as the vintage is over they ship off their wine upon the lake which furnishes all the towns that lie upon its borders what they design for other parts of the country they unload at very and after about half a days landcarriage convey it into the river aar which brings it down the stream to bern soleurre and in a word distributes it through all the richest parts of switzerland as it is easy to guess from the first sight of the map which shows us the natural communication providence has formed between the many rivers and lakes of a country that is at so great a distance from the sea the canton of bern is reckoned as powerful as all the rest together they can send a hundred thousand men into the field though the soldiers of the catholic cantons who are much poorer and therefore forced to enter oftener into foreign armies are more esteemed than the protestants  we lay one night at meldingen which is a little roman catholic town with one church and no convent it is a republic of it self under the protection of the eight ancient cantons there are in it a hundred bourgeois and about a thousand souls their government is modelled after the same manner with that of the cantons as much as so small a community can imitate those of so large an extent for this reason though they have very little business to do they have all the variety of councils and officers that are to be met with in the greater states they have a townhouse to meet in adorned with the arms of the eight cantons their protectors they have three councils the great council of fourteen the little council of ten and the privy council of three the chief of the state are the two avoyers when i was there the reigning avoyer or doge of the commonwealth was son to the inn where i was lodged his father having enjoyed the same honors before him his revenue amounts to about thirty pound a year the several councils meet every thursday upon affairs of state such as the reparation of a trough the mending of a pavement or any the like matters of importance the river that runs through their dominions puts them to the charge of a very large bridge that is all made of wood and coped over head like the rest in switzerland those that travel over it pay a certain due toward the maintenance of this bridge and as the french ambassador has often occasion to pass this way his master gives the town a pension of twenty pound sterling which makes them extremely industrious to raise all the men they can for his service and keeps this powerful republic firm to the french interest you may be sure the preserving of the bridge with the regulation of the dues arising from it is the grand affair that cuts out employment for the several councils of state they have a small village belonging to them whither they punctually send a bailiff for the distribution of justice in imitation still of the great cantons there are three other towns that have the same privileges and protectors  we dined the next day at zurich that is prettily situated on the outlet of the lake and is reckoned the handsomest town in switzerland the chief places shown to strangers are the arsenal the library and the townhouse this last is but lately finished and is a very fine pile of building the frontispiece has pillars of a beautiful black marble streaked with white which is found in the neighboring mountains the chambers for the several councils with the other apartments are very neat the whole building is indeed so well designed that it would make a good figure even in italy it is pity they have spoiled the beauty of the walls with abundance of childish latin sentences that consist often in a jingle of words i have indeed observed in several inscriptions of this country that your men of learning here are extremely delighted in playing little tricks with words and figures for your swiss wits are not yet got out of anagram and acrostick the library is a very large room pretty well filled over it is another room furnished with several artificial and natural curiosities i saw in it a huge map of the whole country of zurich drawn with a pensil where they see every particular fountain and hillock in their dominions i ran over their cabinet of medals but dont remember to have met with any in it that are extraordinary rare the arsenal is better than that of bern and they say has arms for thirty thousand men at about a days journey from zurich we entered on the territories of the abbot of st gaul they are four hours riding in breadth and twelve in length the abbot can raise in it an army of twelve thousand men well armed and exercised he is sovereign of the whole country and under the protection of the cantons of zurich lucerne glaris and switz he is always chosen out of the abbey of benedictines at st gaul every father and brother of the convent has a voice in the election which must afterward be confirmed by the pope the last abbot was cardinal sfondrati who was advanced to the purple about two years before his death the abbot takes the advice and consent of his chapter before he enters on any matter of importance as the levying of a tax or declaring of a war his chief layofficer is the grand maitre d hotel or highsteward of the household who is named by the abbot and has the management of all affairs under him there are several other judges and distributers of justice appointed for the several parts of his dominions from whom there always lies an appeal to the prince his residence is generaliy at the benedictine convent at st gaul notwithstanding the town of st gaul is a little protestant republic wholly independent of the abbot and under the protection of the cantons  one would wonder to see so many rich bourgeois in the town of st gaul and so very few poor people in a place that has scarce any lands belonging to it and little or no income but what arises from its trade but the great support and riches of this little state is its linen manufacture which employs almost all ages and conditions of its inhabitants the whole country about them furnishes them with vast quantities of flax out of which they are said to make yearly forty thousand pieces of linen cloth reckoning two hundred else to the piece some of their manufacture is as finely wrought as any that can be met with in holland for they have excellent artizans and great commodities for whitening all the fields about the town were so covered with their manufacture that coming in the dusk of the evening we mistook them for a lake they send off their works upon mules into italy spain germany and all the adjacent countries they reckon in the town of st gaul and in the houses that lie scattered about it near ten thousand souls of which there are sixteen hundred burgeois they choose their councils and burgomasters out of the body of the burgeois as in the other governments of switzerland which are every where of the same nature the difference lying only in the numbers of such as are employed in state affairs which are proportioned to the grandeur of the states that employ them the abbey and the town bear a great aversion to one another but in the general diet of the cantons their representatives sit together and act by concert the abbot deputes his grand maitre d hotel and the town one of its burgomasters  about four years ago the town and abbey would have come to an open rupture had it not been timely prevented by the interposition of their common protectors the occasion was this a benedictine monk in one of their annual processions carried his cross erected through the town with a train of three or four thousand peasants following him they had no sooner entered the convent but the whole town was in a tumult occasioned by the insolence of the priest who contrary to all precedents had presumed to carry his cross in that manner the burgeois immediately put themselves in arms and drew down four pieces of their cannon to the gates of the convent the procession to escape the fury of the citizens durst not return by the way it came but after the devotions of the monks were finished passed out at a backdoor of the convent that immediately led into the abbots territories the abbot on his part raises an army blocks up the town on the side that faces his dominions and forbids his subjects to furnish it with any of their commodities while things were just ripe for a war the cantons their protectors interposed as umpires in the quarrel condemning the town that had appeared too forward in the dispute to a fine of two thousand crowns and enacting at the same time that as soon as any procession entered their walls the priest should let the cross hang about his neck without touching it with either hand till he came within the precincts of the abbey the citizens could bring into the field near two thousand men well exercised and armed to the best advantage with which they fancy they could make head against twelve or fifteen thousand peasants for so many the abbot could easily raise in his territories but the protestant subjects of the abbey who they say make up a good third of its people would probably in case of a war abandon the cause of their prince for that of their religion the town of st gaul has an arsenal library townhouses and churches proportionable to the bigness of the state it is well enough fortified to resist any sudden attack and to give the cantons time to come to their assistance the abbey is by no means so magnificent as one would expect from its endowments the church is one huge nef with a double aisle to it at each end is a large quire the one of them is supported by vast pillars of stone cased over with a composition that looks the most like marble of any thing one can imagine on the cieling and walls of the church are lists of saints martyrs popes cardinals archbishops kings and queens that have been of the benedictine order there are several pictures of such as have been distinguished by their birth sanctity or miracles with inscriptions that let you into the name and history of the persons represented i have often wished that some traveller would take the pains to gather together all the modern inscriptions which are to be met with in roman catholic countries as gruter and others have copied out the ancient heathen monuments had we two or three volumes of this nature without any of the collectors own reflections i am sure there is nothing in the world could give a truer idea of the roman catholic religion nor expose more the pride vanity and selfinterest of convents the abuse of indulgencies the folly and impertinence of votaries and in short the superstition credulity and childishness of the roman catholic religion one might fill several sheets at st gaul as there are few considerable convents or churches that would not afford large contributions  as the king of france distributes his pensions through all the parts of switzerland the town and abbey of st gaul come in too for their share to the first he gives five hundred crowns per annum and to the other a thousand this pension has not been paid these three years which they attribute to their not acknowledging the duke of anjou for king of spain the town and abbey of st gaul carry a bear for their arms the roman catholics have this bears memory in very great veneration and represent him as the first convert their saint made in the country one of the most learned of the benedictine monks gave me the following history of him which he delivered to me with tears of affection in his eyes st gaul it seems whom they call the great apostle of germany found all this country little better than a vast desert as he was walking in it on a very cold day he chanced to meet a bear in his way the saint instead of being startled at the rencounter ordered the bear to bring him a bundle of wood and make him a fire the bear served him to the best of his ability and at his departure was commanded by the saint to retire into the very depth of the woods and there to pass the rest of his life without ever hurting man or beast from this time says the monk the bear lived irreproachably and observed to his dying day the orders that the saint had given him  i have often considered with a great deal of pleasure the profound peace and tranquillity that reigns in switzerland and its alliances it is very wonderful to see such a knot of governments which are so divided among themselves in matters of religion maintain so uninterrupted an union and correspondance that no one of them is for invading the rights of another but remains content within the bounds of its first establishment this i think must be chiefly ascribed to the nature of the people and the constitution of their governments were the swiss animated by zeal or ambition some or other of their states would immediately break in upon the rest or were the states so many principalities they might often have an ambitious sovereign at the head of them that would embroil his neighbors and sacrifice the repose of his subjects to his own glory but as the inhabitants of these countries are naturally of a heavy phlegmatic temper if any of their leading members have more fire and spirit than comes to their share it is quickly tempered by the coldness and moderation of the rest who sit at the helm with them to this we may add that the alps is the worst spot of ground in the world to make conquests in a great part of its governments being so naturally entrenched among woods and mountains however it be we find no such disorders among them as one would expect in such a multitude of states for as soon as any public rupture happens it is immediately closed up by the moderation and good offices of the rest that interpose  as all the considerable governments among the alps are commonwealths so indeed it is a constitution the most adapted of any other to the poverty and barrenness of these countries we may see only in a neighboring government the ill consequences of having a despotic prince in a state that is most of it composed of rocks and mountains for notwithstanding there is a vast extent of lands and many of them better than those of the swiss and grisons the common people among the latter are much more at their ease and in a greater affluence of all the conveniences of life a princes court eats too much into the income of a poor state and generally introduces a kind of luxury and magnificence that sets every particular person upon making a higher figure in his station than is generally consistent with his revenue  it is the great endeavor of the several cantons of switzerland to banish from among them every thing that looks like pomp or superfluity to this end the ministers are always preaching and the governors putting out edicts against dancing gaming entertainments and fine clothes this is become more necessary in some of the governments since there are so many refugees settled among them for though the protestants in france affect ordinarily a greater plainness and simplicity of manners than those of the same quality who are of the roman catholic communion they have however too much of their countrygallantry for the genius and constitution of switzerland should dressing feasting and balls once get among the cantons their military roughness would be quickly lost their tempers would grow too soft for their climate and their expenses outrun their incomes besides that the materials for their luxury must be brought from other nations which would immediately ruin a country that has few commodities of its own to export and is not overstockd with money luxury indeed wounds a republic in its very vitals as its natural consequences are rapine avarice and injustice for the more money a man spends the more must he endeavor to augment his stock which at last sets the liberty and votes of a commonwealth to sale if they find any foreign power that is able to pay the price of them we see no where the pernicious effects of luxury on a republic more than in that of the ancient romans who immediately found it self poor as soon as this vice got footing among them though they were possessed of all the riches in the world we find in the beginnings and increases of their commonwealth strange instances of the contempt of money because indeed they were utter strangers to the pleasures that might be procured by it or in other words because they were wholly ignorant of the arts of luxury but as soon as they once entered into a taste of pleasure politeness and magnificence they fell into a thousand violences conspiracies and divisions that threw them into all the disorders imaginable and terminated in the utter subversion of the commonwealth it is no wonder therefore the poor commonwealths of switzerland are ever laboring at the suppression and prohibition of every thing that may introduce vanity and luxury beside the several fines that are set upon plays games balls and feastings they have many customs among them which very much contribute to the keeping up of their ancient simplicity the bourgeois who are at the head of the governments are obliged to appear at all their public assemblies in a black cloak and a band the womens dress is very plain those of the best quality wearing nothing on their heads generally but furs which are to be met with in their own country the persons of different qualities in both sexes are indeed allowed their different ornaments but these are generally such as are by no means costly being rather designed as marks of distinction than to make a figure the chief officers of bern for example are known by the crowns of their hats which are much deeper than those of an inferior character the peasants are generally clothed in a coarse kind of canvas that is the manufacture of the country their holy day clothes go from father to son and are seldom worn out till the second or third generation so that it is common enough to see a countryman in the doublet and breeches of his greatgrandfather  geneva is much politer than switzerland or any of its allies and is therefore looked upon as the court of the alps whither the protestant cantons often send their children to improve themselves in language and education the genevois have been very much refined or as others will have it corrupted by the conversation of the french protestants who make up almost a third of their people it is certain they have very much forgotten the advice that calvin gave them in a great council a little before his death when he recommended to them above all things an exemplary modesty and humility and as great a simplicity in their manners as in their religion whether or no they have done well to set up for making another kind of figure time will witness there are several that fancy the great sums they have remitted into italy though by this means they make their court to the king of france at present may some time or other give him an inclination to become the master of so wealthy a city  as this collection of little states abounds more in pasturage than in corn they are all provided with their public granaries and have the humanity to furnish one another in public exigencies when the scarcity is not universal as the administration of affairs relating to these public granaries is not very different in any of the particular governments i shall content my self to set down the rules observed in it by the little commonwealth of geneva in which i had more time to inform my self of the particulars than in any other there are three of the little council deputed for this office they are obliged to keep together a provision sufficient to feed the people at least two years in case of war or famine they must take care to fill their magazines in times of the greatest plenty that so they may afford cheaper and increase the public revenue at a small expense of its members none of the three managers must upon any pretense furnish the granaries from his own fields that so they may have no temptation to pay too great a price or put any bad corn upon the public they must buy up no corn growing within twelve miles of geneva that so the filling of their magazines may not prejudice their market and raise the price of their provisions at home that such a collection of corn may not spoil in keeping all the inns and publickhouses are obliged to furnish themselves out of it by which means is raised the most considerable branch of the public revenues the corn being sold out at a much dearer rate than it is bought up so that the greatest income of the commonwealth which pays the pensions of most of its officers and ministers is raised on strangers and travelers or such of their own body as have money enough to spend at taverns and publickhouses  it is the custom in geneva and switzerland to divide their estates equally among all their children by which means every one lives at his ease without growing dangerous to the republic for as soon as an overgrown estate falls into the hands of one that has many children it is broken into so many portions as render the sharers of it rich enough without raising them too much above the level of the rest this is absolutely necessary in these little republics where the rich merchants live very much within their estates and by heaping up vast sums from year to year might become formidable to the rest of their fellowcitizens and break the equality which is so necessary in these kinds of governments were there not means found out to distribute their wealth among several members of their republic at geneva for instance are merchants reckoned worth twenty hundred thousand crowns though perhaps there is not one of them who spends to the value of five hundred pounds a year  though the protestants and papists know very well that it is their common interest to keep a steady neutrality in all the wars between the states of europe they cannot forbear siding with a party in their discourse the catholics are zealous for the french king as the protestants do not a little glory in the riches power and good success of the english and dutch whom they look upon as the bulwarks of the reformation the ministers in particular have often preached against such of their fellow subjects as enter into the troops of the french king but so long as the swiss see their interest in it their poverty will always hold them fast to his service they have indeed the exercise of their religion and their ministers with them which is the more remarkable because the very same prince refused even those of the church of england who followed their master to st germains the public exercise of their religion  before i leave switzerland i cannot but observe that the notion of witchcraft reigns very much in this country i have often been tired with accounts of this nature from very sensible men that are most of them furnished with matters of fact which have happened as they pretend within the compass of their own knowledge it is certain there have been many executions on this account as in the canton of bern there were some put to death during my stay at geneva the people are so universally infatuated with the notion that if a cow falls sick it is ten to one but an old woman is clapped up in prison for it and if the poor creature chance to think her self a witch the whole country is for hanging her up without mercy one finds indeed the same humor prevail in most of the rocky barren parts of europe whether it be that poverty and ignorance which are generally the products of these countries may really engage a wretch in such dark practices or whether or no the same principles may not render the people too credulous and perhaps too easy to get rid of some of their unprofitable members  a great affair that employs the swiss politics at present is the prince of contis succession to the duchess of nemours in the government of neufchatel the inhabitants of neufchatel can by no means think of submitting themselves to a prince who is a roman catholic and a subject of france they were very attentive to his conduct in the principality of orange which they did not question but he would rule with all the mildness and moderation imaginable as it would be the best means in the world to recommend him to neufchatel but notwithstanding it was so much his interest to manage his protestant subjects in that country and the strong assurances he had given them in protecting them in all their privileges and particularly in the free exercise of their religion he made over his principality in a very little time for a sum of money to the king of france it is indeed generally believed the prince of conti would rather still have kept his title to orange but the same respect which induced him to quit this government might at another time tempt him to give up that of neufchatel on the like conditions the king of prussia lays in his claim for neufchatel as he did for the principality of orange and it is probable would be more acceptable to the inhabitants than the other but they are generally disposed to declare themselves a free commonwealth after the death of the duchess of nemours if the swiss will support them the protestant cantons seem much inclined to assist them which they may very well do in case the duchess dies whilst the king of france has his hands so full of business on all sides of him it certainly very much concerns them not to suffer the french king to establish his authority on this side mount jura and on the very borders of their country but it is not easy to foresee what a round sum of money or the fear of a rupture with france may do among a people who have tamely suffered the franche compte to be seized on and a fort to be built within cannonshot of one of their cantons  there is a new sect sprung up in switzerland which spreads very much in the protestant cantons the professors of it call themselves pietists and as enthusiasm carries men generally to the like extravagancies they differ but little from several sectaries in other countries they pretend in general to great refinements as to what regards the practice of christianity and to observe the following rules to retire much from the conversation of the world to sink themselves into an entire repose and tranquillity of mind in this state of silence to attend the secret illapse and flowings in of the holy spirit that may fill their minds with peace and consolation joys or raptures to favor all his secret intimations and give themselves up entirely to his conduct and direction so as neither to speak move or act but as they find his impulse on their souls to retrench themselves within the conveniences and necessities of life to make a covenant with all their senses so far as to shun the smell of a rose or violet and to turn away their eyes from a beautiful prospect to avoid as much as is possible what the world calls innocent pleasures lest they should have their affections tainted by any sensuality and diverted from the love of him who is to be the only comfort repose hope and delight of their whole beings this sect prevails very much among the protestants of germany as well as those of switzerland and has occasioned several edicts against it in the duchy of saxony the professors of it are accused of all the ill practices which may seem to be the consequence of their principles as that they ascribe the worst of actions which their own vicious tempers throw them upon to the dictates of the holy spirit that both sexes under pretense of devout conversation visit one another at all hours and in all places without any regard to common decency often making their religion a cover for their immoralities and that the very best of them are possessed with spiritual pride and a contempt for all such as are not of their own sect the roman catholics who reproach the protestants for their breaking into such a multitude of religions have certainly taken the most effectual way in the world for the keeping their flocks together i dont mean the punishments they inflict on mens persons which are commonly looked upon as the chief methods by which they deter them from breaking through the pale of the church though certainly these lay a very great restraint on those of the roman catholic persuasion but i take one great cause why there are so few sects in the church of rome to be the multitude of convents with which they every where abound that serve as receptacles for all those fiery zealots who would set the church in a flame were not they got together in these houses of devotion all men of dark tempers according to their degree of melancholy or enthusiasm may find convents fitted to their humors and meet with companions as gloomy as themselves so that what the protestants would call a fanatic is in the roman church a religious of such or such an order as i have been told of an english merchant at lisbon who after some great disappointments in the world was resolved to turn quaker or capuchin for in the change of religion men of ordinary understandings dont so much consider the principles as the practice of those to whom they go over  from st gaul i took horse to the lake of constance which lies at two leagues distance from it and is formed by the entry of the rhine this is the only lake in europe that disputes for greatness with that of geneva it appears more beautiful to the eye but wants the fruitful fields and vineyards that border upon the other it receives its name from constance the chief town on its banks when the cantons of bern and zurich proposed at a general diet the incorporating geneva in the number of the cantons the roman catholic party fearing the protestant interest might receive by it too great a strengthening proposed at the same time the incantoning of constance as a counterpoise to which the protestants not consenting the whole project fell to the ground we crossed the lake to lindaw and in several parts of it observed abundance of little bubbles of air that came working upward from the very bottom of the lake the watermen told us that they are observed always to rise in the same places from whence they conclude them to be so many springs that break out of the bottom of the lake lindaw is an imperial town on a little island that lies at about three hundred paces from the firm land to which it is joined by a huge bridge of wood the inhabitants were all in arms when we passed through it being under great apprehensions of the duke of bavaria after his having fallen upon ulm and memminghen they flatter themselves that by cutting their bridge they could hold out against his army but in all probability a shower of bombs would quickly reduce the burgeois to surrender they were formerly bombarded by gustavus adolphus we were advised by our merchants by no means to venture our selves in the duke of bavarias country so that we had the mortification to lose the sight of munich ausburg and ratisbon and were forced to take our way to vienna through the tirol where we had very little to entertain us besides the natural face of the country  tirol inspruck hall etc after having coasted the alps for some time we at last entered them by a passage which leads into the long valley of the tirol and following the course of the river inn we came to inspruck that receives its name from this river and is the capital city of the tirol  inspruck is a handsome town though not a great one and was formerly the residence of the archdukes who were counts of tirol the palace where they used to keep their court is rather convenient than magnificent the great hall is indeed a very noble room the walls of it are painted in fresco and represent the labors of hercules many of them look very finely though a great part of the work has been cracked by earthquakes which are very frequent in this country there is a little wooden palace that borders on the other whither the court used to retire at the first shake of an earthquake i saw here the largest menage that i have met with any where else at one end of it is a great partition designed for an opera they showed us also a very pretty theater the last comedy that was acted on it was designed by the jesuits for the entertainment of the queen of the romans who passed this way from hanover to vienna the compliment which the fathers made her majesty on this occasion was very particular and did not a little expose them to the raillery of the court for the arms of hanover being a horse the fathers thought it a very pretty allusion to represent the queen by bucephalus that would let no body get upon him but alexander the great the wooden horse that acted this nobtale part is still to be seen behind the scenes in one of the rooms of the palace which is hung with the pictures of several illustrious persons they showed us the portrait of mary queen of the scots who was beheaded in the reign of queen elizabeth the gardens about the house are very large but ill kept there is in the middle of them a beautiful statue in brass of an archduke leopold on horseback there are near it twelve other figures of waternymphs and rivergods well cast and as big as the life they were designed for the ornaments of a waterwork as one might easily make a great variety of jetteaus at a small expense in a garden that has the river inn running by its walls the late duke of lorrain had this palace and the government of the tirol assigned him by the emperor and his lady the queen dowager of poland lived here several years after the death of the duke her husband there are covered galleries that lead from the palace to five different churches i passed through a very long one which reaches to the church of the capucin convent where the duke of lorrain used often to assist at their midnight devotions they showed us in this convent the apartments of maximilian who was archduke and count of tirol about fourscore years ago this prince at the same time that he kept the government in his hands lived in this convent with all the rigor and austerity of a capucin his antichamber and room of audience are little square chambers wainscoated his private lodgings are three or four small rooms faced with a kind of fretwork that makes them look like little hollow caverns in a rock they preserve this apartment of the convent uninhabited and show in it the altar bed and stove as likewise a picture and a stamp of this devout prince the church of the franciscan convent is famous for the monument of the emperor maximilian the first which stands in the midst of it it was erected to him by his grandson ferdinand the first who probably looked upon this emperor as the founder of the austrian greatness for as by his own marriage he annexed the low countries to the house of austria so by matching his son to joan of arragon he settled on his posterity the kingdom of spain and by the marriage of his grandson ferdinand got into his family the kingdoms of bohemia and hungary this monument is only honorary for the ashes of the emperor lie elsewhere on the top of it is a brazen figure of maximilian on his knees and on the sides of it a beautiful bas relief representing the actions of this prince his whole history is digested into twenty four square pannels of sculpture in bas relief the subject of two of them is his confederacy with henry the eighth and the wars they made together upon france on each side of this monument is a row of very noble brazen statues much bigger than the life most of them representing such as were some way or other related to maximilian among the rest is one that the fathers of the convent tell us represents king arthur the old british king but what relation had that arthur to maximilian i dont question therefore but it was designed for prince arthur elder brother of henry the eighth who had espoused catharine sister of maximilian whose divorce afterward gave occasion to such signal revolutions in england this church was built by ferdinand the first one sees in it a kind of offer at modern architecture but at the same time that the architect has shown his dislike of the gothic manner one may see very well that in that age they were not at least in this country arrived at the knowledge of the true way the portal for example consists of a composite order unknown to the ancients the ornaments indeed are taken from them but so put together that you see the volutes of the ionic the foliage of the corinthian and the uovali of the doric mixed without any regularity on the same capital so the vault of the church though broad enough is encumbered with too many little tricks in sculpture it is indeed supported with single columns instead of those vast clusters of little pillars that one meets with in gothic cathedrals but at the same time these columns are of no regular order and at least twice too long for their diameter there are other churches in the town and two or three palaces which are of a more modern make and built with a good fancy i was shown the little notredame that is handsomely designed and toppd with a cupola it was made as an offering of gratitude to the blessed virgin for having defended the country of the tirol against the victorious arms of gustavus adolphus who could not enter this part of the empire after having overrun most of the rest this temple was therefore built by the contributions of the whole country at about half a leagues distance from inspruck stands the castle of amras furnished with a prodigious quantity of medals and many other sorts of rarities both in nature and art for which i must refer the reader to monsieur patins account in his letter to the duke of wirtemburg having my self had neither time or opportunity to enter into a particular examination of them  from inspruck we came to hall that lies at a league distance on the same river this place is particularly famous for its saltworks there are in the neighborhood vast mountains of a transparent kind of rock not unlike alum extremely solid and as piquant to the tongue as salt it self four or five hundred men are always at work in these mountains where as soon as they have hewn down any quantities of the rock they let in their springs and reservoirs among their works the water eats away and dissolves the particles of salt which are mixed in the stone and is conveyed by long troughs and canals from the mines to the town of hall where it is received in vast cisterns and boiled off from time to time  they make after the rate of eight hundred loaves a week each loaf four hundred pound weight this would raise a great revenue to the emperor were there here such a tax on salt as there is in france at present he clears but two hundred thousand crowns a year after having defrayed all the charges of working it there are in switzerland and other parts of the alps several of these quarries of salt that turn to very little account by reason of the great quantities of wood they consume  the saltworks at hall have a great convenience for fuel which swims down to them on the river inn this river during its course through the tirol is generally shut up between a double range of mountains that are most of them covered with woods of firtrees abundance of peasants are employed in the hewing down of the largest of these trees that after they are barked and cut into shape are tumbled down from the mountains into the stream of the river which carries them off to the saltworks at inspruck they take up vast quantities for the convents and public officers who have a certain portion of it alloted them by the emperor the rest of it passes on to hall there are generally several hundred loads afloat for they begin to cut above twenty five leagues up the river above hall and there are other rivers that flow into the inn which bring in their contributions these saltworks and a mint that is established at the same place have rendered this town notwithstanding the neighborhood of the capital city almost as populous as inspruck it self the design of this mint is to work off part of the metals which are found in the neighboring mountains where as we were told there are seven thousand men in constant employ at hall we took a boat to carry us to vienna the first night we lay at rottenburg where is a strong castle above the town count serini is still close prisoner in this castle who as they told us in the town had lost his senses by his long imprisonment and afflictions the next day we dined at kuffstain where there is a fortress on a high rock above the town almost inaccessible on all sides this being a frontier place on the duchy of bavaria where we entered after about an hours rowing from kuffstain it was the pleasantest voyage in the world to follow the windings of this river inn through such a variety of pleasing scenes as the course of it naturally led us we had sometimes on each side us a vast extent of naked rocks and mountains broken into a thousand irregular steeps and precipices in other places we saw a long forest of firtrees so thick set together that it was impossible to discover any of the soil they grew upon and rising up so regularly one above another as to give us the view of a whole wood at once the time of the year that had given the leaves of the trees so many different colors completed the beauty of the prospect but as the materials of a fine landscape are not always the most profitable to the owner of them we met with but very little corn or pasturage for the proportion of earth that we passed through the lands of the tirol not being able to feed the inhabitants this long valley of the tirol lies enclosed on all sides by the alps though its dominions shoot out into several branches that lie among the breaks and hollows of the mountains it is governed by three councils residing at inspruck one sits upon life and death the other is for taxes and impositions and a third for the common distributions of justice as these courts regulate themselves by the orders they receive from the imperial court so in many cases there are appeals from them to vienna the inhabitants of the tirol have many particular privileges above those of the other hereditary countries of the emperor for as they are naturally well fortified among their mountains and at the same time border upon many different governments as the grisons venetians swiss bavarians etc a severe treatment might tempt them to set up for a republic or at least throw themselves under the milder government of some of their neighbors besides that their country is poor and that the emperor draws considerable incomes out of its mines of salt and metal they are these mines that fill the country with greater numbers of people than it would be able to bear without the importation of corn from foreign parts the emperor has forts and cittadels at the entrance of all the passes that lead into the tirol which are so advantagiously placed upon rocks and mountains that they command all the valleys and avenues that lie about them besides that the country it self is cut into so many hills and inequalities as would render it defensible by a very little army against a numerous enemy it was therefore generally thought the duke of bavaria would not attempt the cutting off any succors that were sent to prince eugene or the forcing his way through the tirol into italy the river inn that had hitherto been shut up among mountains passes generally through a wide open country during all its course through bavaria which is a voyage of two days after the rate of twenty leagues a day  index a adda and the addige both described by claudian page       albano for what famous     alps
