sirs in the following pages are contained some reasons why the contagious poison of the smallpox received into the human body cannot be extinguished or expelled by any antidote or other means than what nature effects in producing the distemper i have also endeavored to explain the manner of the propagation and eruption of the smallpox from the practice of inoculation and why this distemper taken by common infection in the natural way proves so much more fatal than that which is given by inoculation  the reasons that have induced me to present you with this short account from the press were by no means owing to a consciousness of my having cleared up these matters to any degree of certainty but because i do not remember to have seen any thing of this kind attempted before and in hopes that my endeavors may be the means of employing the thoughts of others to explain these laws of nature to a greater degree of perfection  these inducements have encouraged me in this address to your learned society to which the world will ever be indebted for the improvement of art and science and i hope they may be admitted as a necessary apology for this presumption  i am honored sirs your most respectful and most obedient servant thomas frewen  some reasons why the contagion of the smallpox received into the human body cannot be extinguished or expelled by any antidote or other means than what nature effects in producing the distemper that most celebrated professor the learned dr boerhaave was of opinion that there is to be found out in nature such a kind of medicine as would have the specific power of extinguishing or eradicating the contagion of the smallpox from a body infected without permitting any eruption of the pustules in the manner that other poisons are cured by peculiar antidotes aph    0     et prax med v v  some other physicians also revering the sentiment of this great man have pretended to support the same opinion  but as no improvements have yet appeared to have been made at least nothing material has been advanced by the advocates for this enquiry notwithstanding the doctor gave his reasons for his opinion and explained his suggestions as far as he could it is probable therefore that the unsurmountable obstacles which have arisen from the consideration of this contagious venom and the different manner of it is operations have hitherto discouraged all the attempts that may have been since made toward the discovery and indeed i am inclined to think that had the doctor written on this particular subject after the practice of inoculation grew to be so much used in europe as it now is he would from the new discovery of the operation of this morbific taint have established opposite reasons to an opinion which many years ago he thought uncontrovertable for so conspicuous in experiment as this is could never have escaped his sagacious observation which proves that the least particle of variolous pus containing the very seeds of contagion by enflaming and corroding an external solid part produces a kind of carbuncle whereby the natural operation of this contagious infection is demonstrated to the greatest degree of certainty and silences all hypothetical notions of its contaminating the fluids only by explaining as i shall endeavor to do more hereafter that the morbific effluvia of this disease received by inspiration in the ordinary way of infection by inflaming and corroding in like manner such internal parts as are more immediately subservient to the vital purposes are therefore more likely to be productive of the most dangerous consequences  the method however given for attaining to the knowledge of this discovery is after the infection of the smallpox is taken to prevent inflammation so that a suppurated matter may not ensue and this is proposed to be effected by treating the distemper like other inflammatory cases in the beginning and giving such correcting medicines as by gently diluting and dissolving the blood may carry off the cause by the convenient outlets and so cure the disease while in it is first state without coming to suppuration  for this purpose the doctor mentions a preparation of mercury and antimony brought to a great degree of penetrability and rendered entirely destitute of all acrimony by dissolution etc from whence he says there arises almost such a kind of medicine and by which he has seen some good effects  the aethiops mineralis has been likewise proposed as a specific medicine for the same intention by dr lobb who has given some instances of the smallpox being in his judgment prevented by the timely use of it but as there have been frequent examples of people escaping this distemper who had been supposed to be in the greatest danger of taking it it is not improbable but that some of these may have been attributed by mistake to such preventive means as had been used on those occasions  dr cheyne also has pronounced that the best antidote in nature against the smallpox and the plague itself is aethiops mineralis and cinnabaris antimonii taken made up into boluses twice or three times a day and washed down with orange whey of the efficacy of which he says he has had some successful experience for the confluent smallpox he adds is but a miniature of the plague and both are curable in good habits  many more writers some of which are of great eminence have touched also upon this matter as the sentiment of boerhaave but without presuming any further well knowing that an affair of this nature can admit of no alternative and that it is to no manner of purpose to pretend to defend by argument what cannot be sufficiently warranted by experience for such particularities in opinion have been oftentimes ridiculed in men of learning as the effects of mere whim and chimera  but the character of boerhaave is too sacred for reflection as he certainly had no design to impose on the judgment of others by a prediction of this sort which was grounded probably on such speculations in chemistry as are not easily to be explained on mechanical principles  dr mead de variolis et morbillis  however could not pass over this opinion of his learned friend without wondering how he could be induced to hope that some time or other a specific antidote would be found against the contagious poison of the smallpox that is by which it would be so thoroughly destroyed that thoit had been received into the body it could not produce the disease for continues he the elements of things are so certain and so well established by the permanent laws of nature that whosoever would endeavor to change them would act like those philosophers by fire as they style themselves who labor hard to transmute the baser metals into gold and when continual disappointments have convinced them of the vanity of their hopes actually extract gold out of the purses of the ignorant and credulous by the fumes of their charcoal dr stacks transl p      in an affair of this kind it is undoubtedly the safest and truest way to consult nature herself as a divine principle diffused throughout the creation acting in all bodies by certain properties which are productive of certain effects and we may consider her in a vast variety of senses as she does nothing in vain attempts always to preserve herself cures all diseases and acts upon unerring rules in all her ways hence we observe in fevers particularly those of the eruptive kinds the most surprising commotions and conflicts which serve to throw off the morbific matter by various ways for the relief of the patient and in these cases especially she is to be nicely observed and followed with the greatest care because any counteracting means would obstruct her first design and make her proceed upon other different principles which would consequently beattended with very different effects  it ought to be considered therefore whether a specific antidote against the contagious taint of the smallpox if such an one were discoverable would not be likely to do more hurt than good by preventing a distemper which perhaps was intended by nature as dr gilchrist observes for a drain to clear the constitution of some gross humors which if not carried off in this way would bring on other diseases the same gentleman supports this opinion by observing that those children who had had the smallpox by inoculation in scotland were uncommonly healthy which he supposes to be owing to this cause that the fever in the smallpox communicated in the infant state not only destroys or expells the latent seeds of diseases before they are by time and accidents perfected and put into action but causes such an alteration of the humors as may make them less susceptible of any morbid impressions and the vessels being so accustomed before they become rigid to certain motions and extensions the body is rendered ever after more passive to the impulses of any subsequent distemper this he maintains is agreeable to experience for one who has suffered an acute illness will bear sickness better than another who never had the like distemper and be less overcome by it edinb essays phys and liter vol   art  0   hippocrates calls nature the great physican and our judicious sydenham says that a disease is nothing more than an effort of nature to throw off the morbific matter for the health of the patient which dr mead has observed to be no where more particularly verified than in those envenomed fevers in which the violence of the distemper breaks out on the skin either in the form of pustules carbuncles or bubos and hence it seems pretty plain that no art can abrogate the law of nature by the prevention of those kind of diseases which happen from contagion  those corpuscular effluvia of the smallpox or particles which fly off from distempered bodies and mixing with the juices of others occasion the same disease are produced from a matter differing from all other poisons and liable to cause inflammation in a greater or lesser degree according to the constitutional state and condition of those that receive them and some miserable cases of the smallpox have showed us instances where the whole texture of the blood has been so broken and dissolved that the crassamentum after it had stood a while to become cold could but just hold together yet notwithstanding there have been some instances where this poison has given so little disturbance as scarcely to introduce any perceivable lentor on the blood at least not enough to obstruct it in the capillary vessels and we have several times remarked where it has been applied by inoculation that if it had not been for it is immediate action on a solid part it would have proved insufficient even to show the characteristick marks of the smallpox  therefore it is not altogether improbable but that this contagious venom may operate by various ways sometimes by coagulating the blood at others by dissolving it and sometimes by corroding the solid parts themselves and this may be owing perhaps to such natural causes as are not within the reach of human penetration which considerations notwithstanding the deference i pay to dr boerhaaves extraordinary merit and abilities have induced me to question even the bare possibility of such a discovery but to go on  the doctor intimates that the bite of the scorpion which was formerly supposed to be certain death is now cured by the application of the bruised scorpion or the oil of it and concludes that all poisons have their antidotes and therefore why may not a specific medicine be found out of such a nature that being diffused all the body over after the variolous infection is received may introduce contrary properties and thereby extinguish the distemper in the beginning before those effects are produced which must otherwise necessarily follow for what physician says he in a pleurisy quinsy etc would wait for a cure by suppuration when daily experience convinces us that these distempers are regularly cured without it and why may not the inflammation be carried off as well in the first stage of the smallpox as in other inflammatory diseases and so prevent its coming to suppuration at all  to this it may be said that the general method of cure in pleurisies quinsies and other inflammatory distempers which are neither contagious nor of the eruptive kinds proves insufficient to prevent the return of them as often as the sudden changes and alterations of the weather different seasons of the year and many other accidental causes may happen to produce them but it is not so in regard to the smallpox a disease which is propagated by it is own contagion only without any other antecedent cause and where a determinate length of time brings on every thing according to it is stated periods so that nature in doing her part is a most certain guide to the physician for the doing of his besides it is evident that the venom of this distemper can infect us but once insomuch that that pabulum in our bodies which is productive of this disease being totally taken up by the contagion it has received is thereby expunged and eradicated so that there remains nothing afterward on which this morbific matter can have any further effect and indeed in this sense it may be truly said that the smallpox is it is own antidote by protecting all that undergo it from any future attack  it may be granted how extremely difficult it is to clear the mass of blood of this poison yet it is most certainly true that nature endeavors with all her might at the expulsion of it in the most perfect manner that is by forcing the morbid matter as much as possible to the pustules mead de variol  and any interruption must prove of dangerous consequence lest the humors should be impeded in their circulatory motion and fall into an intestine one and grow putrid which is frequently the case after too large evacuations or excessive heat where there is such a scarcity of spirits that the solids do not vibrate sufficiently to keep the fluids in their due velocity  this plainly indicates the hurtfulness of too great evacuations in the beginning of the smallpox and shows the physicians part to be only to assist by following nature and not going before her  the measles are an inflammatory fever of the eruptive kind whose pustules never arrive to a purulent state like those of the smallpox and they are cured by bleeding and cooling medicines but i believe it was never yet seen that these remedies could prevent their eruption though made use of ever so soon after taking in the nfection  there have been some instances in the smallpox where spontaneous hemorrhages or other repeated bleedings have seemed to alter the nature of the distemper in some degree by making that prove kindly which would probably have fallen out otherwise for want of those evacuations but i am persuaded there never was any one proof of the contagion being wholly carried off that way without some eruption of the pustules so that it seems evident even to a demonstration that nature after a removal of the load that oppresses her must be left to do her part in her own way by causing suppuration in a greater or lesser degree as there happens to be occasion for it in order to free the body from the corrupted state of the blood and humors arising from the contagious taint of this disease  moreover it is certain that the whole animal body at all times before it has passed through the smallpox is in every part alike liable to receive the morbose or infecting taint and so propagate the disease we know also that the least particle of the morbific matter applied to any part of the body will cause the smallpox to be produced as effectively as a much greater quantity could be capable of doing it and it is evident from common experience that all mankind as well those who come of parents that have had the smallpox as those that have not are alike liable to it so that we may conclude the pabulum of this distemper to be a part of the human nature conceived in the first rudiments of generation and therefore not to be extinguished by any art or other means than it is own natural destroyer the smallpox itself which only can render the body more perfect by eradicating this one natural principle of mortality and thereby giving it a security for ever against any further attack from this great evil  the contagion of the smallpox previously considered in a pestilential sense the true manner of it is operation on human bodies as it may be best known from the experiment of inoculation seems sufficient to furnish more matter for the physician and philosopher than could possibly have been advanced without it insomuch that the discovery of a specific medicine to prevent the burning of a caustic or even fire itself may as well be expected as to destroy the power of variolous contagion when taken either in the natural way or applied by inoculation most certain therefore it is that no discovery of this kind so seemingly repugnant to the laws of nature can ever be ascribed to human invention  an attempt to explain the manner of the propagation and eruption of the smallpox from the practice of inoculation and why this distemper taken by common infection in the natural way proves so much more fatal than that which is given by inoculation the main business of natural philosophy as sir isaac newton observes is to argue from phenomena without feigning hypotheses and to deduce causes from effects till we come to the very first cause therefore it ought to be the study of physicians to consider well the various and subtle methods which nature uses in producing diseases and this can be known in general only by the different symptoms that occur to individuals in all cases for her progress is undoubtedly slower or faster according to the different methods she takes in expelling the morbific cause so that the morbid particles being separated by her own action may be discharged in her own way  when a body therefore becomes contaminated by a contagious taint it may be of the greatest use to know by what means it so happened as the mode of nature in her method of extricating the morbific matter differs probably in great measure according to the different manner of receiving it insomuch that the danger or safety of the patient may depend greatly on the primary communication of this matter either to an external or an internal part and this opinion has been confirmed by many observations of the smallpox produced by inoculation where the distemper has been remarkably great from a multitude of the pustules as well as the condition of them which have gone off by that preventive means without any great uneasiness whereas the same in the natural way are usually attended with a very high fever delirium and other dangerous contingencies owing probably to imperceptible effluvia conveyed at first to the lungs heart brain etc  but for a further explanation of this matter by an enquiry into the different methods that nature pursues in communicating the smallpox both by common infection and the artificial experiment of inoculation we shall the better form a judgment agreeable to her own elements and principles by her own rules and indications and in order thereto it is manifestly certain that the air being infected with the venom of this distemper the morbific particles contained therein are received into the human body by inspiration and they act wherever they happen to fall by an irresistible power like fire unextinguishable until they have utterly subdued that pabulum in the body which was susceptible of this contaminating taint and so propagated the disease for thus it is we are secured from having the smallpox a second time but the causes of it is destructive malignity may be more than the nicest observation can discover and indeed the mode of nature from this theory alone seems to be too intricate and perplexing for human understanding insomuch that the nature of the morbific matter from whatever different kind of the smallpox it may happen to come is certainly the same and plainly makes no difference in the nature of the disease the difference of constitutions therefore it may reasonably be supposed is the principal cause of the different kinds of the smallpox and these principles being generally admitted i think it evident therefore as far as it can be demonstrated from experience that a different manner in giving the infection i mean that of inoculation manifestly produces a different effect and this i make not the least doubt would unexceptionably appear upon the trial if it was possible to meet with two persons of exactly the same age and constitution by communicating to each of them the same contagious taint by the different ways of infection but for want of this let us examine further by pursuing the mode of nature also under the experiment of inoculation and see what new discovery will arise to give an additional light to this matter  by this method of trial it is evident that the smallest portion of the variolous pus applied by a slight incision to any part of the body acts in the manner of a caustic by inflaming and corroding the part insomuch that the continuity after some days is destroyed and an ulceration caused from the separation of the eschar and the taint of this infection being infused into the blood is conveyed by means of the circulation throughout the whole animal body and touching every where on it is proper pabulum like a spark of fire among particles of sulphur or nitre in a certain length of time it does it is office by exciting feverish symptoms which regularly go off in a diaphoresis whereby the salt serum of the blood so impregnated is driven out by the glands of the skin and then the pores being properly enlarged let out the fiery pustules on the surface which seems to be the true manner of the propagation and eruption of the smallpox  from this experiment we may reasonably suppose that the morbific effluvia of this distemper received by inspiration also produce the same kind of phenomenon in the natural way and that these venomous particles happening to fall on the vital parts by inflaming and corroding the same in like manner are so commonly attended with their fatal effects for instance on the lungs brain etc where it is impossible for nature to help herself or be furnished with any assistance to her relief and this may occasion which we daily see high fevers delirium shortness of breath the most surprising struggles and conflicts and sudden changes in the smallpox  it may be supposed also that an infinite number of the virose particles contained in the infected air may be drawn in by the breath and nostrils at the same time and so conveyed by the divarication of the trachaea to the lungs and also by the olfactory nerves or their fibrillae to the most delicate texture of the brain whereby a multitude of different parts may receive the contagious effect at the same instant of time which by pervading the innermost recesses of the whole animal compages may so break and destroy the continuity of parts of moment as to render a dissolution of the whole frame unavoidable and that particular species of the smallpox in which the texture of the blood is so absolutely broken that it discharges itself by every outlet of the body and stagnating in the small cuticular vessels produces black gangrenous spots all the surface over is but too melancholy a proof of the truth of this hypothesis from the sudden and untimely destruction that it usually brings upon the patient  inoculation explains also the reasonableness of this opinion for if the morbific matter be applied to ever so many place it will have the same effect in every one by occasioning so many corroding carbuncles if they may be so called which the more they are the more likely they will be to increase the  or the contagious infection of the blood and spirits and for this reason i have wholly given up an opinion i had espoused some years ago from a supposition that discharges from more inoculated places than one would be of advantage to the patient by carrying off a greater quantity of the humors of the body by means of those drains and so consequently would be likely to prevent such feverish disorders and complaints as might otherwise arise in the course of the smallpox but experience has plainly shown this kind of doctrine to be erroneous and convinced me that the application of the virose matter to one part only is much safest and best and indeed the corrosion of any one part caused by the application of variolous matter is a sufficient proof of its taking effect and doing all that this contagion can do even though there may happen to be scarce any febril symptoms produced from it or so much as a perfectly distinguished pustule of the smallpox for the ulcerated part being cicatrised will remain beyond all dispute as certain a mark of security to the patient as if the skin had received the impressions of having undergone this distemper in ever so great a degree and truly if it were not so several persons under my own care who had no pustulary eruptions must have taken the smallpox from those who were their companions and bedfellows in the distemper by the ordinary way of infection which the experience of such trials plainly convinced me they could not from these cases therefore it seems reasonable to suppose that this kind of artificial carbuncle caused by the inoculation was alone capable of extricating from the human nature the first principles of this distemper  from what has been already advanced it seems pretty certain that these first principles of the smallpox being susceptible of the contagion to the most distant extremities are diffused in all parts alike throughout the whole animal body the principal caution therefore requisite to be observed by physicians in regard to those in whom this matter is to be applied is to consider well their different constitutions and temperaments as they are of themselves naturally productive of the different kinds of the smallpox for it is i believe a generally received opinion that the contagious venom of this disease is in it is own nature the same and differs only according to the different bodies it is infused into in some for instance we see that this poison applied can produce no more than it is own variolous carbuncle or a very few of the pustules at most and those of the shortest duration whereas in others it is manifest that the different fluids become more contaminated and therefore consequently produce other different degrees of the smallpox and wherever the lymphatick vessels are corroded by the variolated acrimony being more than can be transpired by the pores of the skin it occasions a suffusion of the lympha itself and so consequently produces a confluence of the smallpox and this happening commonly in a greater degree on the head and face is undoubtedly owing to the great force of the circulation of the blood which carrying with it a variolated power causes the effects above mentioned the ventricles of the brain also from the same morbose cause are usually so affected as to occasion delirium etc in the same manner probably that the effluvia of strong drink and spirits affect the brain in drunkenness for thus it is that the blood having received any morbific taint purifies itself in the circulation by throwing off it is heterogeneous particles by the common emunctories which nature has provided as far as the animal faculties under a morbid state are capable of accomplishing it  those principles in our nature which are susceptible of the contagion of the smallpox though they are not i believe as i have before observed liable to undergo a change by any power of medicine sufficient to prevent the influence of variolous infection yet experience convinces us if we can be so convinced that the manner of propagating the distemper produces a very different effect and there can be no occasion to enforce the truth of this opinion by argument since gods providence has appeared in the success of inoculation so much in favor of that practice since inoculation has been brought into practice it is said by good authority that there has been an annual decrease of a fifth part of the deaths by the smallpox within the bills of mortality   finis
