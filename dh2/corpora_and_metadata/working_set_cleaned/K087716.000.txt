sir alexander it is not action only that adorns the soldiers character it is patience calm and enduring in the rugged hour of want that forms the nobler part of duty you my loved sons and all your fellow sufferers have well that rigorous iron task performed but now a smoother train of hours advances the truce which at tomorrows dawn takes place will enable me from out the northern gate to dismiss the women the aged and the infirm then disencumberd of its useless numbers this foeencircled town shall raise its head the hand of scarceness shall no more dispense her meagre morsel to the exhausted soldier but cheering competency shall provide the meal  archibald it is well yet then inform me sir how you will employ the invaluable hours that still precede the truce  sir alexander our gallant men have been severely tried and worn with toil  archibald their toilenfeebled bodies still enclose the mounting spirit of unwearied vigor  valentine prompt as the hawk to dart upon his prey  archibald the foe since yesterday appears to have lost half of his wonted intrepidity  valentine that shower of arrows we poured down at eve has somewhat quenched their ardor  sir alexander be it so but tell me what is now your present purpose methinks that swelling to some bold design your bosom labors  speak my valentine  valentine command my elder brother sir to speak  sir alexander unfold then archibald this mysterious something this painful secret that disturbs you both  archibald last night as we reclined upon our couch still talking over as is our wonted manner the various hazard of the busy day we wished we fondly wished that ere the truce should intervene some daring enterprise might be attempted under our direction thus we conversed in sacred confidence till as our weakning voices died away we wearied into rest  twas then an image   valentine mark sir what now my brother will unfold  archibald twas then an image rushed upon my sight it showed as one of the angelic train a circling glory glittered over his head a smile benignant beautified his lip and thus he spoke  sons of the valiant seaton arise and hasten to the southern gate thence dart upon the foe  the vision ceased and vanished into air while a rude noise like the fierce struggle of contending spears suddenly waked us starting from my couch and ere i could communicate my dream valentine with impatient voice disclosed the mutual vision  valentine twas as he relates by honors winnowd purity i swear the nightly visitation also came to me  sir alexander i hazard no impeachment of your truth yet then endearing children tell me how can a prudent tender parent send his valiant sons to dangers precipice at the fantastic impulse of a dream  archibald in the old time we read that dreams have often been the prophetic leaders to success  valentine oh do not sir with cautions chill restraint oershade the splendid purpose of our soul  archibald let the bright vision be forgot if that offend you and attend to reasons voice does not the weary foe anticipate the approaching truce and guard neglectingly the southern gate  sir alexander it is a masked neglect it is the couchant lion prompt to seize the unwary prey  ah trust not to his stern repose  valentine if danger still must check the current of enterprise tell tell me father wherefore you reared us in the hardy school of war  archibald the road to martial glory well thou know is not gaysprinkled over with flowers but broken helmets shivered spears and bloodstained arrows choke up the aspiring path of fames ascent  valentine to be restrained when proud occasion calls twere better thou had led me to some cloister where holy peace resides oercanopied by ancient roofs that ever shade her from the maddning sunbeams of ambitions sky  sir alexander forbear to torture thus a parents feelings  archibald indulgent father rest assured we both pay homage to the thought that now disturbs you but with the experienced melvil we have just conferred  sir alexander and he undoubtedly contemned your gaudy dream that meteor of the brain  valentine twas not the meteor of a heated brain it was a sunbeam of revealing heaven it was the sympathetic glow of two according minds  sir alexander of this enough  what said the experienced melvil  archibald after due attention to our proposal he first stamped it with the seal of his applause and then added arguments that embodied as it were our enterprise and brightened it with the calm coloring of reason  sir alexander i will myself confer with melvil and if he has words to smooth the rugged doubts that vex my mind think not my valiant sons i shall withhold you from the object of your bold request  archibald to keep unsullied the bright martial name of seaton is indeed my proudest wish  valentine and if thy valentine might add his mite to the rich treasury of his fathers fame he would be happy  sir alexander wait till i return exit archibald excellent man his ardour to promote our cause and his solicitude about our safety combat and distract his will  valentine more active warm and forcible affection was never embosomd in a fathers soul and therefore much i fear that melvil cannot subdue his scruples  archibald often have i observed that melvils clear illumined manly judgment possesses something like magnetic power which still attracts opinion to his side  valentine may that attractive power be at this moment endued with double influence that my father withholding his restraint i might unbounded spring against the foe  this common praise that is claimed by every soldier ill supplies my starved and craving appetite of fame  archibald endearing valentine think not that i reprove these flashes of an ardent mind but should your mounting wishes meet control wound not a fathers tender caution with reproach  valentine sooner than wound his feeling mind with sullen splenetic unduteous carriage i would like the spartan boy who silently endured the gnawing fox conceal my sorrow though like the savage animal it should prey upon my vitals  archibald consider also this warlike age will gratify your wishes with many a future enterprise the morn of life is now but breaking on thy youth  valentine talk not to me of early youth behold edwards brave son whose age but equals mine  oh were i equal with him in renown behold that boy on cressys wondering field reaping an immortal harvest while i enveloped in obscurity   archibald desist i hear some step approaching enter donaldson  valentine it is my father ah no it is donaldson say have thou seen the governor  donaldson i saw him as i passed by in close conference engaged with melvil  valentine know thou the subject of their conference  donaldson there breathes an ignorant rumor of a sally propos seems by archibald and you  archibald it is as you have darkly heard and here impatiently we wait the governors return  valentine see here he comes enter sir alexander hail to my father  archibald sir you appear disturbed  sir alexander ah tell me archibald is it with a look of cheerfulness a parent resigns his duteous children to the hazard of a fearful enterprise  archibald yet then reflect melvil the military sage approves the enterprise  sir alexander but melvil has no children his smooth sail of honor meets no adverse gales to check its progress  it is not thus with me say how shall i endure the keen reproofs of ethelberta when she is informed that i have sent without the imperious call of stern necessity her darling children to the path of danger  valentine speak not of danger it is the soldiers charter his best privilege  sir alexander something withholds my full consent and calls my judgment to severe account forgive this trembling caution in a parent  valentine had englands warlike king suppressed his sons ascending soul on her proud list of victories we should not have found the name of cressy  archibald twas on the summit of a neighboring hill the father stood and saw his youthful son oppose the pride of france and when the earls of warwick and of oxford sent a herald to claim immediate succor from the king   valentine did not the king reply go tell the lords who sent you that while my boy s alive they will require my aid in vain the glory of this great day shall be his own  sir alexander enough your arguments prevail and you have won me to your request  go join the skilful melvil the nestor of the war and strictly mark his words and wellweighd counsel  first receive the anxious fathers blessing embraces his sons may that power who often has shielded me in many a combat oh may that guardian kind benignant angel now hover over my children leads them to the door and returns donaldson this is an awful moment for a father  donaldson think not so deeply sir nor feed your mind with busy torturing vain surmises think how often you have encountered perils imminent and still returned with glory  sir alexander unavailing remembrance reared as i have almost been in storms of battle say what paternal bosom will not feel a warm renewed affection for two such sons staged to the front of danger  donaldson but should not ethelberta be informed  sir alexander ah there you probe my bosoms tender part no donaldson the mother must not know the gathering storm that is brooding over her sons her quickening apprehension would outrun the deed and picture to itself images that would distract her  it is my duty my religion still to shield her mind from all that may assail it  donaldson many a time have i listened to the splendid narrative of ethelbertas virtues  sir alexander from the happy hour i first called her mine unto this moment she has with unremitting fortitude attended me through many a rugged day  donaldson i think that england triumphs in her birth  sir alexander at those famed tournaments that edward held at windsor did i first behold that matchless woman though attractive yet not dazzling as looks the softer green amidst the radiant colors of the vernal bow so ethelberta seemed mid the circling flush of british beauties  this gorgeous castle and its proud delights the daughter of earl nevil willingly resigned to share with me the perils of the late crusade this faithful wife this soothing companion of my way still smoothed the harrowd walk of war  even as the wallflower rears its form and smiles and flourishes midst tombs and ruins so ethelbertas warm affection grew mid sickness want fatigue distress and danger enter anselm hail holy father what do thou report  anselm with hasty step i come sir to acquaint you that the bold enterprise is well prepared along the subterraneous windings did the gallant troops advance till they approached the chapel of st andrew near the gate that issues to the field here paused the band  and then in sacred silence lowly bending dedicated themselves unto their country  sir alexander what followed  anselm then with solemn voice i uttered warm from my throbbing heart the benediction that is appointed in the hour of danger  sir alexander yet tell me what directions then were given  anselm it was agreed that your two sons attended by a chosen few should rush upon the foe while melvil with a greater number should taking a wide circling path fall on the rear brave melvil first began the silent march then did your sons lead forth their gallant men through the deep awful gloom  the signal for the onset is to be the convent bell that tolls at midnight  sir alexander wherefore did i yield me to their wild request oh say is t yet too late the leave they wrested from me i may still recall  anselm the die is cast and you must wait the event yet elevate your mind to hope for me i augur well of this bold enterprise  sir alexander but as a father should i not have been more cautious more reserved  anselm the sacred poet says children are as arrows in the hand of a giant to perform his purpose  sir alexander your words good anselm animate my hopes and lift me to my wonted confidence in heaven  did thou not say the convent bell at midnight was the appointed signal for the onset  anselm even so  sir alexander see ethelberta comes farewell  it is meet that now ye both retire exeunt enter ethelberta ethelberta i hope i am no intruder if i am my warm solicitude for you must plead indulgence  sir alexander ever most welcome  ethelberta methinks you look all harassed pale and overcome it is not surprising  but i am told the foe anticipates the truce by retreating to some distance  wherefore do you not retire to rest it is late it is almost midnight  sir alexander midnight did thou say  ethelberta sir you seem alarmed  sir alexander what recent subject is there to alarm me  ethelberta forgive my busy fond anxiety that catches as it were at airy symptoms  where are my sons tell me when i may see them  sir alexander i hope tomorrow  ethelberta wherefore do thou only hope does not the truce take place tomorrow what should then prevent  the bell tolls oh what transports you twas but the wonted midnight bell that calls the holy fathers to their prayers relieve relieve me from this painful ignorance and let thine ethelberta share the pang that rends thy heart  sir alexander dear wife forbear to question me   ethelberta will you not retire to rest for sure you need it much  sir alexander perchance i may  directions of highest import i have first to give  ethelberta farewell  do not tarry long  care and sorrow mingle on thy brow  farewell  my warmest blessing to my sons  exit sir alexander that blessing was pronounced by her whose sons perchance are now no more  enter donaldson well donaldson what have thou to relate  donaldson by some perfidious means the foe apprisd of the intended sally were prepared to meet the troops that melvil led  oerpowerd by numbers he and most of his brave train lie slaughtered on the plain  as for your sons   sir alexander ah what of them  donaldson in warmest combat they are now engaged  sir alexander i will fly to their assistance  draws his sabre donaldson let me first   sir alexander cease your vain talking i must speed away to save my sons or perish in their cause exeunt end of the first act act the second enter ethelberta and juliana ethelberta say what can be the cause of their deserting me i have not since the truce began beheld the governor nor have i yet embraced my children they whose dutiful affection i have until this present hour experienced whence comes it they defraud me of their cheering presence  juliana it is business of some great moment perchance delays them  ethelberta feed me not with vain pretexts their presence only can assuage my starved and ravenous longing wild conception peoples the void of absence with many ghastly and terrific forms  juliana shall i withdraw in order to investigate the cause  ethelberta no juliana you must not desert me i am too wretched and unfit for solitude why do you send your view to yonder portal juliana retires a few steps and then returns juliana now cast away your fears behold behold the governor approaches  enter sir alexander ethelberta your presence is as the sun unto the darkened landscape wherefore have thou lingered thus oh tell me where are my children  sir alexander they are well  ethelberta yet why do they delay to bless a mothers sight  sir alexander it is proper now i should reveal  ethelberta reveal you have then some fearful secret to unfold  sir alexander dear ethelberta be not thus alarmed already have i said our boys are well last night a sally was proposed archibald and valentine entreated much to lead the onset  ethelberta and you yielded to their entreaty  sir alexander the subtle foe by some dark perfidy had early notice of the deeplaid scheme and were too well prepared  ethelberta my blood runs cold  sir alexander ah rather let it glow at my recital your sons have gained the warriors best reward unsullied fame three times did their small force drive back their triplenumberd foes at length by their increasing powers subdued with nine of their brave men remaining they submitted to be captives  ethelberta say who first suggested this rash enterprise  sir alexander melvil applauded what my sons proposed and to the energy with which he uttered his approving thought did i reluctantly give my assent  ethelberta cursed be old melvil for his rash approval  sir alexander spare your resentment and revere the dead fallen is his valiant arm to rise no more  ethelberta then peace be to his soul let me retain a grateful sense to heaven that my loved children are not as melvil numbered with the slain the loss of those dear boys would be to me as if the spring were blotted from the year come juliana let us to our customed visitation of the sick and wounded exit ethelberta and juliana enter anselm anselm a herald from the foe is just arrived and waits your orders for admission  sir alexander let him be admitted  enter herald the herald sir this letter of high import i am ordered to deliver into your hands only  sir alexander retire awhile in some few moments come for my reply reads to himself anselm methinks you look disturbed say what can be the drift of this important note  sir alexander attend reads aloud complaints have reached me from my court as if i lingered in subjecting your proud town to these complaints strong menaces are added i therefore summon you to surrender or else your sons shall rue your stubbornness i will erect two pillars near the tower from whence your crowding arrows gall us most to these two pillars shall your sons be chained exposed to the whole tempest of the war  anselm the blackest fiend in hell conceived that thought and breathed it on his mind  sir alexander i know him well it suits the native disposition of the man  enter ethelberta ethelberta ah wonder not i hastily return i am told a herald from the camp is come  what tidings of my sons  sir alexander peruse this note she reads ethelberta say what do thou intend to do  sir alexander my duty  ethelberta is t then a duty to destroy your children to rend affection from your inmost breast uproot the thoughts of pity as they grow embowel nature of her hallowed feelings and to a mother dare you this avow  sir alexander i dare avow what honor bids me do  ethelberta the untamed arab who exists on plunder lets fall his booty to assist his child but you whom polished manners should adorn whose pure religion wears a softer feature do you reject the impulse of compassion for the stern morals of imagined honor  enter herald herald sir the time urges what is your reply  sir alexander go tell your savage and bloodthirsty general the sacred oath i uttered to my country and to my royal master when i was exalted to the station i now hold contains my answer  sir you may return  ethelberta stay one short moment hear a mother plead though dead to pity riches may perchance allure his mind i have jewels of high value   sir alexander makes a signal to the herald who retires he goes he heeds not what i say my sons are then condemned without resource enjoy  turning to sir alexander enjoy this philosophic victory this conquest this cold triumph over all feeling  domestic pity conjugal affiance fatherly endearment are by you profaned  sir alexander what does this mean dare you assert i do not love my children  ethelberta say where are the proofs is yielding up your sons without a conflict without resorting to the prompt expedient affection would have flown to is resigning your sons without the interposing a short delay without a pause without inventing some pious artifice are these the proofs of your paternal kindness evidence like this would not be admitted in the court of nature  sir alexander cease this idle declamation respect respect the great the solemn trial to which my pure allegiance now is called i see the desolating hour approach like the dark storm that thickens as it sails it is the womans privilege to weep and utter her complaints to man belongs the majesty of grief yet not the less does the fond parent warm this bosom even while proud honor and relentless duty seem to command the function of my soul i have that within that tells me i am a father  ethelberta thus the pale cheek of hungry fame is flushed and rudded over with the false glow of duty  anselm make not the bitter cup he is doomed to drink still more bitter by the infusions of reproach  ethelberta may not the brokenhearted mother speak may not her maddning sorrow still attempt to snatch her children from destruction  enter an officer officer i come to pour glad tidings on your ear your sons   ethelberta what of my sons  officer they are returned relenting as it is thought of his intention the general has restored them to your wishes  ethelberta ah tell me where you saw them  officer entering at the southern gate amidst the applauding multitude they bade me hasten to your presence with the news of their return  ethelberta wherefore do they linger thus  officer methinks i hear their footsteps   enter archibald and valentine ethelberta what glorious vision meets my raptured eyes runs to embrace them this sudden joy this unimagind heaven transports me beyond all power of utterance   sir alexander your presence my loved children smooths the rugged conflict in my breast  whence comes this change of counsel in the tyrants mind  ethelberta ah rather tell me where where is the joy that ought to harmonise with ours archibald your downcast look portends some dread intelligence and you my valentine where is thy wonted gaiety  archibald i have of high importance something to communicate to my father  ethelberta may not i be present at the interview  archibald what i am going to unfold will distress you  ethelberta no no your mutual safety is sufficient to bear me up against this new calamity but wherefore do you weep  archibald these tears i shed spring from affection not from fear  i will die worthy of such parents  valentine so will i  ethelberta wherefore wherefore do ye talk of death  archibald with a mockery of pity does the general send us back one of us must return to be the victim of his cruelty  ethelberta oh never  archibald we are bound by honors tie the soldiers strongest chain one must return and unappalld we wait  turning to sir alexander for your decision  sir alexander ah what father can decide of two affectionate and duteous children which shall be led to slaughter say was i to raise in awful thought the balance of my affection and could judgment see one side prevail still sacred natures hand would join and equalize the trembling scales  valentine  to ethelberta be comforted  ethelberta oh my dear valentine falls on his neck anselm i think all this is a mere stratagem to lengthen out the truce  allow me sir to hasten to the generals tent there will i urge with glowing words my suit there paint the infamy that must involve him if thus profaning the hallowed feelings of parents   valentine holy father twoud become thee better to assuage support with comforts lenient voice this drooping mother than to interfere with what regards my brothers honor and my own  ethelberta i will write to the general in words of soothing power in terms of energy such as the mothers throbbing heart conceives  valentine no letter must be written for twoud seem our dictating and would show like cowardice  sir alexander there spoke my valiant son  archibald our mutual dignity forbids abhors all interposition  ethelberta then i have lost my children  valentinf that follows not he who is first in years in skill experience he must be spared the general cause demands him  archibald what says the hasty valentine  valentine command your rising indignation i will explain  allow us father for some few moments to confer alone that free from all restraint i may to archibald disclose my mind and utter arguments that may subdue his reason to my ardent wish and thus prevent the extinction of our family  archibald perish to the root the name of seaton and let oblivions night oershade the proud exploits of our long ancestry ere i consent to that which must degrade and shrink me in my own esteem  valentine i mean not that  sir alexander come ethelberta let us for a while retire and leave them to confer alone  ethelberta well the high theme of your discourse i know it is a contest for the palm of death but in this glorious conflict still remember what is due to your afflicted mother if any plan expedient or device allied to honor should suggest itself if any beam should pierce this awful gloom admit its sacred influence on your mind and save me from despair  exit with anselm juliana and sir alexander valentine fear is no inmate of thy glowing breast yet then reflect that other thoughts than those that courage breathes must sometimes regulate a soldiers conduct say have thou not heard that mercy resignation are the nobler duties of a soldier  archibald where is now that mercy claimed where called for mercy on whom  valentine mercy on your parents and on your country  archibald this puerile declamation moves me not  valentine i speak the language of a mind sincere to one who is my friend as well as brother for whom my partial fondness never was doubted  archibald he loves me not who does not love my fame was i to yield to your illtimed suggestion would not each finger mark me as i pass as one who skulks behind the privilege of eldership to save himself from death i feel dishonor as i feel a wound  the fatal spot to which we both aspire is glorys prize is honors awful station and i now claim it as my sacred birthright  valentine i contend no longer  archibald let me hasten fly to my father to proclaim the news that valentine at length consents to live  valentine allow me one short moment and be calm say will thou with an avarice of fame demand exclusively the meed of glory will thou pursue the path that leads to death and leave thy faithful valentine behind  archibald cease generous brother or thou lt break my heart   valentine when first i quitted childhoods lowly vale eager with you i climbed youths arduous height whence greater scenes expanded onmy view still our pursuits consenting to one plan our lives like wedded streams united rolled and will you now disturb the sacred tide and bid the kindred waves disparting run  archibald it is as you say in us was ever found the sympathetic union of the mind the harmony of affection and design  valentine and would it not be sacrilege to tear our souls asunder  mark my firm resolve i will attend thee to the fatal spot and share an equal destiny with thee  archibald i yield i bow to thy sublimer mind  valentine let us haste away lest ethelberta should return and with her tears unman our purpose  archibald agreed  well hasten to our mutual doom coequals at the hallowed shrine of danger  valentine will not the spirits of our valiant ancestry lean from their golden thrones on high well pleased while thus encircling his brother we march undaunted to our fate one heart   archibald one cause   valentine one ruin and one fame exeunt end of the second act act the third enter ethelberta and juliana ethelberta fled to the camp both fled impossible  juliana pure honor breathing on their bosom   ethelberta fled without one parting word  juliana the great trial they are called to claims their whole attention  ethelberta has then the phantom glory steeled my children into savages  not one endearing word to soothe their fond afflicted mother  juliana the rigorous duty of their situation   ethelberta what duty is more pressing or more sacred than that a mother claims it rises out of natures bosom summoned by the voice of heaven  juliana their better judgment held them from your presence well full well they knew the sight of two sons hastening to untimely death would rend your heart  ethelberta it must be so it was it was their love that urged them to avoid me the cloud of dark surmise that here was gathering begins to melt in air and my full heart expands to all its wonted warm affection  juliana to this affection join a confidence that all may yet be well  ethelberta i dare not cast a meeting glance upon the approaching hour  could i but raise my sinking mind to the faint hope that the arrows happily might not reach my children  that the tyrant may relent of his fell purpose vain endeavor  each way i look i meet despair  yet now  a thought possesses me  indulge my weakness  ah pity the disease that flies to such a remedy  i have heard a skilful sorceress does in this town reside whose magic power unfolds the future to her trembling visitant   juliana it is as you report and many a hapless virgin many a distressful mother have consulted her  ethelberta it is said she rivals the weird sisterhood of ancient days while over her mind pale prophecy hangs fluttering the dread vauntcourier of futurity  perchance this deeplyskilld magician may transport my ignorant fears beyond the event  juliana yet say was she by her exploring art to raise your ignorant fears to horrid certainties   ethelberta better to know the worse than thus to live in apprehension unrelenting agony  can thou inform me where the sorceress dwells  juliana her lonely cell is seen not far from hence amidst the ruins of an ancient cloister upon the burial ground there on a seat of ebony overspread with human skulls she exercises her tremendous function  ethelberta whence does the hag derive her daring mission is t from on high or from the caves of hell does she not lift her impious hand to rend the sanctuaryveil that hangs tween men and angels and on the breast of heaven she sends a glance profane  juliana this deep reflection will avert your anxious mind from its newformd purpose  ethelberta let me be wretched let me not be impious never will i tread the path that leads to her unhallowed cell  another thought occurs which meets my hearts consent  come come what may i will go in person to the hostile camp there rushing on the rude barbarian i will demand my children  juliana vain vain project  ethelberta he will hear my plaintive voice he will see these eyes in tears  juliana the unfeeling wretch will mock those tears  ethelberta affection will endue my speech with eloquence the monster self will soften at warm nature pleading for her darling sons  juliana consider what dangers you will encounter to what insults you there may be exposed it is likely you may be detained a captive and immured within the precincts of a lonesome dungeon  ethelberta talk not to me of dangers i despise them say have thou not beheld the bold seaeagle when her dear young one from the rock has fallen descend undaunted to the roaring main dash with her throbbing breast the waves asunder to snatch the nestling from the ravenous shark and would thou have me pause and hesitate to act the mothers part let us retire and seek for anselm to attend and guide my footsteps to the tyrants tent exeunt enter sir alexander and anselm sir alexander yes anselm i confess i glory in these children  their abrupt departure wakes at once my wonder and delight say has it not a relish of the antique manners some proud resemblance of the roman mind  anselm this mutual dedication of themselves to certain death will ornament our annals  sir alexander as torrents feed the river so my sons swell the strong current of my countrys fame  anselm you also share your part in this sublime transaction  sir alexander the renown is theirs and mine is the distress  my scene in this deep drama is to bid my archers shoot their arrows where my defenseless sons will be exposed to their full rage  alas i fear good father i have not virtue equal to the task  anselm virtue is ever found superior to the rugged task and like the waterplant ascends still higher than the swelling flood  sir alexander was ever father so severely tried  anselm image to yourself that you are acting in sight of angels and immortal spirits and through the scenery that darkens round look up as to the sun that breaks the cloud look up unto the approving smile of heaven  sir alexander i sometimes think the tyrant will relent  anselm he s not of english birth  sir alexander of that you may be certain humanity adorns the english soldier it is the wholesome gale that ventilates their heart from the low subaltern up to the royal youth who now in gallia leads his valiant band   anselm from norway is he not this wretch who outrages a parents feelings  sir alexander even so  a pirate on the northern seas his skill and matchless courage lifted him to fame and being by distress of weather driven on the english coast the warlike edward dazzled by his enterprizing spirit gave him to command the troops that now invest us  anselm but tell me has your sons abrupt departure yet reached the ear of hapless ethelberta  sir alexander i know not that  i must not now approach her presence her unbounded sorrow would ill suit the frame of mind that i must now acquire  go holy father and dispense the balm of comfort to her bleeding soul  i must confer with donaldson exit anselm enter donaldson donaldson your commands have been attended to and now the town is disencumberd of its numbers  the wide northern gate recoiling poured forth a lengthening train  the aged warriors passed on in mournful silence  this dismission which marked their inutility appeared to humble and degrade them  sir alexander it is a cruel but necessary order on my part  yet then these aged and once active men may happily in a few short days return and then resume their wonted occupations habits and customs which they now forego  but never shall i meet with comfort more  my sons my sons  donaldson next in long order moved a female band while many a pensive wife threw back a frequent glance of fond regard  sir alexander it is well  your diligence demands my thanks the truce will in two hours expire  i must prepare me for the sad the solemn task imperious duty has imposed upon me  it is time the men ascend the embattled walls in act to hurl the arrowy war below  donaldson i left the men assembling in the square  sir alexander oh would that with the safety of this town which to my latest moment i will defend i might include the safety of my children exit scene the enemys camp enter ethelberta and anselm sentinel to ethelberta arrest your daring footsteps  ethelberta your uplifted weapon frights not her to whose misfortunes death were welcome  i am ethelberta the sentinel returns the sabre into the scabbard happily in some far distant hamlet sits your mother brooding over your absence all in tears oh think of her and lead me to my sons  sentinel beneath you tent the captive youths abide  ethelberta inform your general that the wretched ethelberta humbly begs an audience exit sentinel  as ethelberta and anselm approach the tent archibald and valentine rush out ethelberta marvel not at my appearance my bleeding bosom demanded this sad interview  archibald we are ever bound to you for this new proof of your affection  valentine have you seen the general  ethelberta i have asked a conference  i wait the answer  valentine be sure you let him know that we did not urge or prompt you to demand an audience  ethelberta is it then criminal in me to own a mothers feelings  archibald it is beneath the dignity of ethelberta to confer with him  ethelberta say what dignity belongs to a wretch like me  valentine his ear is steeled against compassion nor do we wish to live  ethelberta why valentine this contempt of life would you not live to save me from distraction  is the cruelty that breathes within the generals tent

beneath your feet  enter an officer officer the general now in council waits your attendance exeunt ethelberta anselm and officer valentine sooner would the seacliff stoop to the sinking mariner than will the tyrant bend to her imploring voice i mean his mercy will not reach us both what if ethelberta should return and bring with her commands for your releasement  archibald i would reject the despicable mercy has not our mutual vow to heaven ascended yes brother both must be released or both consigned to death  enter officer officer the general bids me lead you to the fatal spot with orders that you should immediately be fastened to the summit of the pillars  archibald and valentine we obey exeunt scene  the place where pillars are erected men with ropes etc first man i relish not

your celestial mind  valentine we were born to die  ethelberta had gradual illness stolen on you as ye faded in my arms or had ye fallen in battle then i should like many many more unfortunate mothers have mournfully submitted but this outrage this indignity   valentine affects me not i am proud to fall in such a cause  ethelberta to anselm did i not fall at the tyrants feet did i not bathe them with my tears like the unheeding rock he stood unmoved the stranger pity knew not the dark avenue to his heart  anselm the king of terrors death comes like a friendly angel in a noble cause  archibald it is as the holy father says the cause for which we die brightens the darkened hour it is the cause that dignifies those ignominious instruments that turns these fatal pillars into pyramids proclaiming our eternal fame  ethelberta who would not glory in such children yes ye are my boast my honor my delight i first led your infant footsteps to the path of virtue indulge the fond idea happily this sublime enthusiasm flows from me  valentine speak ever thus and be the heroine of this conflicting hour  archibald methought as thus you spoke a current of new ardour gushed upon my throbbing heart  ethelberta be not deceived the momentary gleam of triumphs past to glorys touch succeeds tormenting fear and nature gives me up to grief again  enter officer officer the general bids me urge you to retire  ethelberta does he prohibit this short interview this last dear horror of a sad farewell  leans overpowered upon anselm officer the general also says that one of these youths may return and that the choice remains with you  ethelberta suddenly raising up her head ah were i to absolve the life of one say by that act should i not condemn the other to the fate that threatens him  officer reflect that by these means you will prevent the entire extinction of your name  ethelberta your reasoning touches not a mothers breast  while i behold my sons as now they stand before me and recall their virtues their invariable affection toward their mother and the concord of their congenial minds the interweaving harmony of coloring that composes the texture of their mutual life my heart blends and unites the two and my fond eyes behold but one dear son archibald and valentine throw themselves at her feet while ethelberta hangs over them archibald rising kind pitying father we entrust her to your care oh comfort her  anselm mark this hallowed symbol of our dread belief holding up the cross that hangs at his side by this i swear i will administer to her relief and wait upon her sorrow and shed upon the festring wound of grief that gilead balm religion only can supply from thence alone can comfort flow  ethelberta who talks of comfort say will not these pillars rise to my mind in every place to frighten comfort from me in such a state comfort would be impiety leave leave me with despair oh would to heaven that in this conflict of life and sorrow sorrow might prevail that i might fall deathsmitten on this spot and in one grave be buried with my sons  officer the time expires the truce will shortly end the war will be renewed and from you town the arrows then will fly  ethelberta to pierce my children  torturing madness harbors in the thought  officer that devious pathway leads not to the town  ethelberta forgive i was a moment scarce myself and still a dimness hangs across my sight where are my sons they go up to her forbear forbear to weep i see my presence but enfeebles them it is cruelty to linger then resolved i tear myself away oh god of mercy spread over my children thy protecting shield exit with anselm end of the third act act the fourth scene  the archers mounted on the walls expecting the word of command enter sir alexander juliana donaldson

to a single combat how is he distinguished  donaldson a bright scarlet mantle floats around his armor  sir alexander the impulse of an injured father will add vigor to this arm but ethelberta is not yet returned  donaldson her visit to the camp surprises me  sir alexander it moves not my surprise for when the affections of her soul are roused no fear no danger   juliana she comes  mark how her tortured mind speaks through the expressive eye  enter ethelberta and anselm ethelberta i have spoke in vain  sir alexander i do not yet believe he will proceed to such extreme barbarity  ethelberta i saw the pillars i saw the men with chains and instruments prepared ere now your sons are bound to the lofty pillars with their bosoms bare to catch the arrows which these men are now in act to shoot and only wait your terrible command  sir alexander ah leave me then to my dread duty retire retire  the truce is just expiring the trembling sands have almost run their hour  ethelberta kneeling see at your feet the mother of your children who through the unvaried course of long attachment has shown she is not unworthy of your choice oh how i gloried in that day when first you called me yours and do i live to curse that day  sir alexander rise ethelberta cease entreating  awake each virtue that surrounds your heart elevate your mind and dare to meet the approaching trial think that now you stand as in a solemn temple and forbear with vain complaining accents to disturb the awful service that is now beginning  ethelberta these proud exalted sentiments suit well the breast that is fed with glorys turgid vapor my simple heart feels nothing but affection  sir alexander would have me be a traitor do my country  ethelberta dare thou assume the sacred name of father and can thou unappalld behold that scene  sir alexander the voice that dares dissuade me from my duty is to my careless ear an empty sound mark me ethelberta i will not disgrace the school of war in which i have been trained my parting soul shall fly unsullied into the bosom of my ancestry and at my death my honor be conveyed immaculate into the ashes of my grave  donaldson taking up the hourglass the last remaining sands are hastening fast away  sir alexander now bid the archers draw their bows  ethelberta one moment yet delay one moment  sir alexander ring out the alarmbell ethelberta faints and is carried out by juliana and anselm the besiegers scale the walls and are repulsed and pursued the scene then changes to the place where the pillars are erected where sir alexander meets the general sir

ethelberta your sons are now avenged see ethelberta where the monster lies  ethelberta it is nobly done now you are indeed a father but gaudy exultation ill becomes us the dreaded pillars we have not surveyed i will hasten to the spot and dare the event they go to the pillars no children meet these fond enquiring eyes  sir alexander it seems as he relented of his purpose  ethelberta my heart presageful scorns the flattering hope mark how the pillars are overspread with arrows and some that strew the ground are stained with blood takes up one and advances toward the stage this dread informer tells a horrid tale shouts at a distance whence that tumultuous noise  sir alexander happily my valiant men are now returning from their victory  ethelberta what is victory to me without my sons  nearer shouts then the troops enter with archibald and valentine transporting sight i am well repaid for all the heartpangs of this agonizing day  sir alexander how did ye escape the flight of arrows that winged from yonder losty battlements  archibald chained to the pillars to our doom resigned we saw the angry weapons fly around  valentine yet then beneath the spreading canopy of danger still did we remain untouched  ethelberta some hovering angel with benignant hand averted from your breast the crowding darts yet tell me all oh say by what blessed means am i become the happiest of
