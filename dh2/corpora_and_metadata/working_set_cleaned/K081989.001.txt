select letters in two volumes vol i  select letters between the late duchess of somerset lady luxborough miss dolman mr whistler mr r dodsley william shenstone esquire and others including a sketch of the manners laws etc of the republic of venice and some poetical pieces the whole now first published from original copies  by mr hull  in two volumes vol i  london printed for j dodsley pall mall mdcclxxviii  preface the letters which i have herewith the honor and happiness of offering to the public were to me the voluntary gift of an elegant friend of the late mr shenstone of a friend who like myself loved his private virtues and admired his literary abilities and if the value of such a gift could have received enhancement it was effectually derived from the polite manner wherein it was presented the following extracts from some letters which accompanied them will show on what unreserved stipulations i received them and consequently will i hope justify the use i make of them extract the first from a letter dated nov        i herewith perform my promise as i found the letters in my bureau so i send them to you having neither time nor spirits to look them over they are now your own with full permission to apply them to any purpose you think proper i shall be glad if they answer your expectation as some of them are those of a friend so highly valued they will with you i know have merit and i hope with the world of the latter however you are the best judge and to your decision i implicitly trust them i wish i could add much more  the little i can i will pindars odes vernons poems with observations by mr shenstone and the gentle shepherd were all his and as such i hope you will accept them in remembrance of him besides the letters which are tied up the parcel will contain remarks on miltons paradise lost copies of the duchess of somersets letters transcribed by mr shenstone these particular letters i should presume will unquestionably be allowed to deserve the character which mr shenstone has prefixed to them in his transcript it is as follows copies of letters from her grace the duchess dowager of somerset formerly countess of hertford in which is discernible a perfect rectitude of heart delicacy of sentiment and a trulyclassic ease and elegance of style there are many of them tinged with an air of melancholy through the loss of her only son lord beauchamp  and bound in vellum three loose in the leaves her graces own handwriting the scotch fragments and a little memorandumbook over which perhaps you will like to spend half an hour though it contains nothing but names   again in a letter dated april        have you seen or heard from mr  have you yet got or are you likely to get that letter of the duchess of somersets which was missing i hope so  may success attend you when the whole is digested and revised i have no doubt of its being valuable     this explicit disclosure of the liberal means by which these letters came into my hands will i presume confirm the authenticity of them if they can be supposed to stand in need of such confirmation i say if they can for surely they possess indubitable marks of originality and require no adventitious evidence to support them  being thus possessed of such an unlimited power my first care was to make the most cautious and delicate use of it i have accordingly suppressed all entire letters as well as distinct passages which appeared to contain matter improper for public inspection all in fact which might be liable in the slightest degree to misconstruction either relative to the writer or the party addressed or that might awaken unwelcome feelings in the breast of any surviving friend or relation i have likewise where a correspondent is introduced or other person alluded to who may be still alive though most of the correspondents i am convinced are dead i have i say on such occasions preserved only initials of the names in order that public curiosity should be no further gratified than might be agreeable to the parties concerned  after what i have advanced to prove the nice precaution i have taken does this pleasing and at the same time useful undertaking of mine stand in need of an apology  i hope not  i flatter myself the very persons to whose situations i have alluded in the foregoing paragraph will confess it does not not to say a word of my own principles i affirm that the bare idea of a publication wherein mr shenstones talents are displayed or wherein even his name is mentioned would deter me from advancing one step beyond the bounds of propriety and decorum  yet notwithstanding all i have said in selfjustification i know there are some very peculiar if i dared i would call them overnice persons who allege that no private letters should be made public without the consent of the writers of such letters this i will readily allow to be a good general rule but like many others may admit of an exception in particular instances and these instances are where a proper mode of introducing them to the world is inviolably attended to it is a wellknown and equally uncontrovertible maxim that persons of the highest excellence especially in the literary walk are possessed of the greatest reserve and diffidence were the private sentiments of such to be withheld from the public till their individual consent were obtained what a loss would it be to the republic of letters and what an injury to moral improvement any persons general principles and ideas may be seen perhaps in the respective public profession and situation of life and their general intercourse with mankind but the innate sensations the more refined emanations of the mind are alone discoverable in the private communications of friendship there can therefore be no unpardonable liberty in decoying or even gentlycompelling such deservers into public notice nor is it by any means uncharitable to suppose there may be many who would not be violently displeased to see their sentiments in print however reluctant they might and perhaps ought to appear if their particular permission were applied for  to illustrate and enforce this position let me be permitted to ask if the duchess of somerset had been requested to have suffered her letters to be made public whether she would have consented probably not  yet what an advocate would moral virtue pious resignation and genuine piety have been deprived of if those exquisite transcripts of her mind had been concealed from public view  it is moreover matter of great doubt whether we should have been so well acquainted with the talents of a shenstone had providence indulged the wishes of his most intimate friends and acquaintances in prolonging so valuable a life  thus it has been is and will be with most people of distinguished abilities their excellencies must in a manner be forced into daylight or we should lose the benefit of their precepts they might otherwise be said like misers to have a valuable treasure buried with them which ought in common justice to be left behind for the advantage of survivors  i have i doubt been too prolix but the fear of offending or at least a desire to wipe off the stain of such an intention has led me into it i hope i stand exculpated and now beg only to conclude with sincere thanks to the gentleman who politely obliged me with letter xxvii of the duchess of somersets and my most grateful acknowledgements to the first mentioned friend who conferred on me the elegant pleasure of conveying to the public some few more excellencies of that benevolent man whose living talents i admired and whose memory i revere  thomas hull london dec         the accurate reader will discover some letters erroneously placed in point of date owing principally to some copies not being received early enough for their proper situations but as no chain of events is interrupted thereby it is hoped the error may easily be excused  contents to volume

      select letters letter i w shenstone esquire to mr d  oct         i am sorry to put you to an expense for a trifling letter at this distance it seems too to give you leave to expect something extraordinary or uncommon whatever is so in my letters i am sure must be on the bad side i may however have the greater power to convince you that distance is incapable to separate you from my thoughts  i am at present in a very refined state of indolence and inactivity indeed i make little more use of a country life than to live over again the pleasures of oxford and your company you might convey me a letter full would you be so exceedingly good as your promise i am vastly selfinterested for i write only in order to beg a letter from you with very small hopes of your receiving much pleasure from mine  i should here give you an account of the pleasures we have had at m  but my paper will not contain it there was one only wanting pour le comble  you will be the last to find it out  your company i aim at rendering my letters as odd and fantastical as possible but when i write to a person of your elegant character my compliments degenerate into downright truths just i was going to say as the sun turns bad wine to vinegar but downright truths are sometimes valuable though a person of your taste might reasonably expect more refined  at least less obvious ones sometimes however vinegar has also its use though to treat a gentleman with it entirely may well create a nausea i fancy my poignant simile grows stale by this time i write to an intimate and a man of sense whose goodnature will forgive what his judgment may find fault with  i hope your ring gives you all imaginable happiness however fatal it may prove to female ken i suspect to hear of you as the finest performer on the spinnet in the world were i a poet i should be highly pleased to celebrate the admirable conduct of your little finger   tui pollicis ictum says horace vile pedant that i am who shall deliver me from the influence of formality  i heard at oxford of the addition of the sidediamonds i guessed lest the splendor should be extinguished by a greater ou vous scavez i want to see you exceedingly you are i assure you a vast part of my pleasure at oxford as pope is in the country indeed you might share that effect with mr pope would you write it is a favor for which i must grow importunate notwithstanding which the favors i have already received would make me uneasy were i not conscious who bestows them  of all the moral virtues gratitude is sure the most beautiful so far from betraying any thing mean or ignoble in her behavior she has an air which naturally discovers her quality  i cannot stay to describe her now  it is sufficient that i pay some sort of tribute to her when i call myself mr d  s  obedient humble servant w s my humble service to your parents  direct to harborough    letter ii w shenstone esquire to miss g  sent oct  0      i have sent the patterns though with far less expedition than you might expect from one so entirely yours the truth is i was sensible how insupportable the transition must be from your company to none at all so contrived to pay several visits immediately after i had left m  you will guess how sufficient a mortification i found even thus to pass from yours to the company of dull aunts and cousins must needs prove tedious as the reverse would be agreeable  as to the draughts i am satisfied in what a ridiculous light they must appear it was a task i was very much unused to and solicited rather out of an officious fondness to be employed for you than any skill i was conscious of in myself i must beg mr g  s pardon for engaging in a work wherein he is far my superior such as they are i beg you would believe they are the best i am capable of i would rather have my judgment than care censured in any thing i am employed in for you you will be surprised to find them joined with a paper scrawld over with dull poetry however i must confess as i wrote it to please myself i sent it not without hopes that it might in an inferior manner please you one may sometimes amuse onesself with what one cannot entirely approve as i cannot flatter myself your judgment can excuse so i cannot apprehend your goodnature will expose me to vindicate my character to you as a poet i shall only join these alleviating circumstances first that nothing makes so awkward a figure in verse as well as in some other respects as sincerity secondly that these lines were wrote when i had no great flow of spirits namely when i had just left m  and you but i shall want your patience elsewhere so will say no more about em  only this  that i should not have mentioned miss l  were i not persuaded that as you are entirely free from the other faults of your sex so you are from that of not bearing to hear another commended it is a sign of a great want of accomplishments when a person is continually suspicious of being rivalled and for that part you may give every one many more than their due without the least danger of being so  i could not help envying whistlers happiness when i came away i fancy your lives have been a constant round of delights i dont know any neighborhood more likely to produce em i could reconcile myself however pretty well to harboroughs melancholy scenes were i not conscious of such superior pleasures ou vous scavez you might convey me a letter full of them but you will perhaps think it an impertinent request i could set what value you please on the favor though the pleasure i cannot pretend to limit  i must now break off my letter in as aukwark a manner as i take my leave which is likewise usually most awkward where i have most respect i will even lay aside further ceremony in this as in the other case and say no more than that i am  madam your humble servant in the most obsolete sense w s  letter iii miss g  to w shenstone esquire m  may       0 sir you express so great a concern for my brothers illness that not only common civility but humanity obliges me to acquaint you that he is upon the recovery his physicians have thought him out of danger these three weeks as to his fever but are apprehensive of a consumption to prevent which they have ordered him a milkdiet as soon as he gets into the country which he hopes to do some time next week my brother g  is with him to make the journey easy they propose to hire a chaise and make three or four days of it  dick has been so compassionate to write to me twice the first was only to show me he was alive in the last letter he seems to have recovered his usual spirits and says he must be obliged to the most despicable creature in the universe for the most valuable blessing in life he is quite determined to leave the study of physic and turn friar which i am delighted at as i believe it will be conducive to his health  i think i have been very particular in my account of my brother which you would have received last post but that i was from home when yours came and did not return till late on saturday night i write this in the greatest hurry for company waits for me to set out for s  but i must tell you that i am very angry you should think so meanly of me as to imagine i had not generosity enough to send you an account of my brother and your friend without the bribe of a compliment out of regard however i must pardon you  i am sir your humble servant m g p s the letter you wrote to dick i have locked up in the cabinet to give him by way of cordial at his first coming home    letter iv miss f  r to w shenstone esquire sept        sir i think it would be inconsistent with gratitude as well as goodmanners not to return you thanks for the pleasures your writings have given me but i shall desist from declaring my sentiments of them lest you should style it flattery writing has been my constant employ when at home ever since you left us and i hope you could not expect them sooner i could not but think fate doubly cruel when to part us was as much as we here could bear with decency to embroil us still more by the hurt of the leg which i am glad to hear is got well  with you fled all life and spirit from a  a total eclipse succeeded you and the sun will shine no more till your bright influence dispels the cloud company and fruit come in often but all in vain for nothing has any relish but the writings of him who caused the malady you have shone so much to the prejudice of our neighbors that it is with difficulty we behave with tolerable decorum we drink your health as constant as appetite or rather custom calls to table for nothing has any taste except the glass in which you are named  we sent tom thumbs performance i think in my heart it is nonsensense to mr  who read it called him nasty dog and put it in his pocket whether it will be a spitcat or dumb madness i dont know but i am sure the bottled smallbeer was very brisk last sunday  from august   th we date our misery no smile seen or laugh heard since till last night  what could cause one then  why mr shenstone who had been dumb so long spoke then and who can hear him without being pleased it is meet and right as well as highly pleasing to mrs mary that you should respect mr a  who i believe intends to spend his last breath in your praise but he will make your name glorious nothing could give him more pleasure than you have done except a present of lawnsleeves as to the scheme you mention i dare not bid you hope but i will venture to bid you not despair on a presumption that your rhetoric can never fail of success  i cannot prevail with my sisters for a letter apiece one says that you shall be the next gentleman she writes to mrs a  says though you cut off your hair she believes your ears will remain and wishes nothing so much as an opportunity to pinch em miss k  says she has already suffered too much by that tyrant love ever to engage with mankind more not even mr shenstone but cannot bear that miss d  should be so happy s  says she would make a handsome speech but cannot and therefore sends you only service my brother desires his compliments and says he cannot fix a time for seeing the leasowes but designs to be at broom with your brother in three weeks time so here you have the sayings of the a  ians but i have not done yet till i have been a little more troublesome  note if i did not know you to be a good judge of mankind and had not experienced your goodnature which inclines you to excuse the foibles of the weaker vessel together with the hopes that for the sake of some happy favorite you would not expose the sex i should not have trusted you with my nonsense this concludes therefore with desiring one favor which is that you would burn this and that the flame and my folly may die together and be assured you will oblige  w f  r i begin to think you have vowed destruction to some of my favorite poets and must own you have given two of them a wound in the side but if you conquer em you shall never never know it adieu    letter v w shenstone esquire to miss w f  r at a  n the leasowes nov         dear miss f  on a time as it is reported the mountains were in labor when after a long course of pains and inquietudes they made a shift to produce that puny animal a mouse now that very individual mouse according to the mysterious and figurative import of types and shadows was the perfect image and representative of this mine epistle a grovelling starveling insignificant production conceived with much difficulty and transmitted to you with confusion of face in short you may look upon it as the noble booty you have taken by baiting your trap so artfully with praise and compliment about two or three months ago true it is that considering the politeness and complaisance of your obliging letter my behavior since must appear the most unknightly of all proceedings but your packet did not arrive till three weeks after it was sent so you will excuse my silence till the day after i received it and whatever was more than that i freely acknowledge came of sin however you will upon confession pardon me as you expect pardon from your confessor should the benedictines and friars get a footing in this island which i find your brother is endeavoring to prevent  i can be no longer ludicrous on this last article i am too seriously concerned for his safety yet i dont fear but the rebels will be defeated and it may be all danger over in less than a fortnight but general wades behavior loitering so long at newcastle astonishes me i was at birmingham on tuesday morning from whence i saw the remains of ligoniers horse march with vast spirits and alacrity they wish to have what they call the refusal of the highlanders they are men of experienced bravery and fought like furies at the battle of fontenoy may they do so now and with better success  b  told me your brother would borrow my pistols at that time supposing him in jest i sent him no very serious answer i now think it incumbent on me to say that i would lend them him with all my heart but that one of them is broke in the stock and cannot be fired with safety till it is stocked afresh perhaps he might recollect it was so when i was at a   we have been best part of a week at litchfield where we lived like chickens in a pen confined and crammed and where we served god after the manner of popes and cardinals  i only allude to cathedral service mr and mrs d  seemed quite disposed to entertain us agreeably the son and daughter to say the least appeared much more indifferent in that particular these as shakespeare says are certainly better christians or else are worse than we  you have escaped me at birmingham by concealing the time of your visit surely you will come over to broom ere it be long and give me my revenge  tell mrs a  my ears make great shoots and such as may tempt her hand egregiously but if i am metamorphosed into an ass entirely i will come and serenade her in a morning when she has been up late the night before  i beg my compliments to all friends i must not make my letter much longer  the mouse will else grow to the size of a rat i beg you to accept this idle billet in part of an answer to your elegant letter and in lieu of a thousand professions of the friendship and esteem with which i am  dear miss f  your most obedient and faithful humble servant w shenstone  letter vi miss f  to w shenstone esquire jan          sir i have several times examined myself to find out what can authorize or qualify me to write to poets and men of letters upon strict enquiry i am sensible that nothing i am possessed of can entitle me to it and nothing but vanity and selfishness could spur me on to this impertinence vanity in being addressed by a man of your capacity and figure in the world and selfishness as i am sure to be a gainer by your correspondence i must however tell you the epithets of artful polite and witty i have no right to in these respects i am an heroine of your own making but i attribute all this to the consequence of that great and generous mind of your own and in whose nature it is to imagine you see in others what you really possess yourself  i shall not trouble you with a detail of the frights fears and dreadful apprehensions almost every body has been under concerning the devil the pope and the pretender it is my good fortune to have more of that strengthening ingredient called hope than that of the destructive one called fear in my composition which has prevented my suffering so much upon the occasion as the rest of my neighbors for my own part i had but one fear which was that of my brothers marching but i was soon made easy in that particular when i found the duke duke of cumberland second son to king george the second who headed the forces against the rebels had no occasion for nor would accept of the newraised regiments all the neighboring gentlemen who had not commissions went volunteers in captain whitmores company but are all come home again and begin to think they have been upon a don quixote expedition or have done like the king of france and his fortythousand  all the females are turned politicians except myself i bestowed two minutes and an half in considering whether i should affect to appear one or not in the first minute my thoughts suggested to me that there never would be a parliament of women in the second i was convinced if that should happen it was morally impossible i should ever have a seat in the house and the last halfminute confirmed me in my resolution not to meddle with politics which i imagine was never designed a province for women i shall therefore be content till they act in their proper sphere and ribbons and fans which are better adapted to my capacity are again their theme  what shall i say as to neighboring occurrences your friend mr a  is very well and often talks of you he told me last time i was in his company he designed himself the pleasure of calling on you in his way to b  early in the spring meeting with bright b  the other day i desired him to stir up his muse to whip her and lash her and put forth something upon the times a gentleman who sat by replied perhaps he may ruin himself in whipcord before he rouses her the brobdignags go on with their knotting as usual but i dont find that your favorite miss d  designs you any for a waistcoat  it was not in my power to give you more notice of my visit to birmingham than i did as the time was not fixed above six days before i set out in which time my brother went to b  and desired mr d  to let you know when he saw you which he said would be in a day or two you would think you had revenge enough if you knew how i was disappointed at last i sighed within myself and said surely the favor is more than i can merit  i shall now cry aloud and say woe unto them that forget their promise for therein is their fidelity called in question  woe unto them that erase out of their letters what they had written for thereby they injure the brain of her that would find it out  woe unto them that are three months in answering a letter for surely it must tire the patience of her who is all that time in expectation  woeful truths  s  the valiant desires his compliments and thanks you for the offer of your pistols which favor he never asked as he did not imagine they should fight with pistols he has been at home this month recruiting i dont doubt but the shropshire fusileers will make a great figure in military history  at least in the prints the tender the wild the grave and the mild all lump their compliments  by the time you come to this place which without a double share of patience you will never arrive at you must be greatly disappointed as you will then find the sum total of all i have said amounts to nothing but dont then blame nature education or the stars that presided at my birth that i am not a novelist nor capable of saying any thing that can possibly entertain you herein but rather blame your own wrong choice in a correspondent i will now out of compassion to you put an end to this unparalleled piece of nonsense by wishing you the compliments of the season and assuring you that i am  sir your obliged and humble servant w f  p s who is the author of bishop ridley s ghost a poem just come out which i suppose you have seen  i shall be in daily expectation of the book you promised till it comes    letter vii miss f  to w shenstone esquire a  march          sir it cannot possibly be otherwise than that i shall soon arrive at the pinnacle of the temple of vanity in full persuasion of the just and deserved encomiums on my letters in the name of all that is sincere and honest let me prevail with you to leave off flattery and act the plaindealer and let it suffice when i tell you that the grand compliment of all is that you think my letters worthy an answer which alone is sufficient to feed my vanity  now lest you should not immediately recollect the fatal consequences that may attend flattery from a person one may chance to have a good opinion of imagine that you see me intoxicated to the greatest degree that weak woman is capable of in order to which you are to suppose that i have taken it into my head that the house i live in is not embellished with ornaments and decorations fit for me to inhabit that the meat i eat is too coarse for my delicate constitution and ortolans alone fit for my palate that the conversation of my own family is quite despicable my neighbors not worth my notice that the air is not pure enough for me to breathe in fine that i am a celestial creature far superior to the race of mortals on earth and should this happen you must then smite your breast and say alas these are the effects of flattery  which shall deter me from the practice of it upon womankind for the future i know it is a received maxim with most men that no woman can be pleased without flattery but why might there not be an exception to this rule if my letters are polite it is what i never designed nor do i think you could possibly expect they should be so from a little garret in a corner of a house in a corner of the world and from one who has nothing more to boast of than the common gifts of nature without any other assistance than what proceeds from her handmaid time  as to your dispute with mr b  it is so like that between the turks and persians that i fancy it will not be determined soon for my own part though the fighters have done little i am inclined to think the writers have done less for as yet i have not seen one line in the poetical way but what a b  may rival and as to historical facts i think they hang much upon uncertainties as it probably will be demanded of every true englishman what he has done in defense or to the honor of his country i would fain know if you are provided with an hundred pages to throw in the teeth of any one who shall ask you the question  we are going to have some new neighbors at w  d they are sisters in law to old mrs d  t perhaps as complete a pair of old maids as england can produce the youngest is past sixty and yet the lungs of of the eldest are so good that i will be answerable she shall harangue ten hours together upon the subject of matrimony she will scarce allow st paul in the right when he says they that marry do well but is thoroughly persuaded of the truth of his next assertion they which dont marry do better the youngest is not so fluent with her tongue but she like the welchmans owl pays it off with thinking i fancy we shall be able in a little time to furnish out a considerable society of old maids whereof mrs l  which is the name of one of the abovementioned ladies shall be ladypresident  the amazonian mrs a  will not own that she envies mrs m  but i have a great suspicion that she intends to rival jenny cameron being equally fond of wisdom to which i may add some ambition to outshine her in the field she has practiced frequently on one or other of the family this winter by which means it has been my fate more than once to lie in honors trucklebed i believe she designs to do great feats in war this spring  i am vastly pleased with the conversation of your tenants and laughed immoderately when i came to john w  rs witticism i dont intend to appear in print till i am well assured i shall rival mrs  a p with her cope wade etc  mr pit has resigned his post in the army and recommended one of his nephews in his room not mr b  i believe for i dont hear that he intends to boil his lobster  i love a genteel phrase your brother was here last week but i could not prevail with him to sing polly willis  that you may not think a word of yours falls to the ground i must tell you that i delivered your message to mr a  at which a mixture of joy and gratitude appeared in his countenance and being inclined to believe it and perhaps too complaisant to call in question my veracity did not insist upon my oath he told me he had before this time done himself that pleasure had not illness prevented him but if he lives he intends to see you this next ensuing summer i have been under dreadful apprehensions of his drawing near the time of his dissolution and great reason i had you will say when i tell you that for six weeks he had not spirits to squeeze his dear molly by the hand he has taken great pains for upwards of thirty years to instruct and improve his little flock yet such is the perverseness of the people and the corruption of their morals that after a sermon of half an hour long i fear he had little reason to believe he had made any great alteration in their favorite tenets  i hope you are convinced that the consequence of having a female correspondent is to be pestered with nonsense and the return of a very few letters lets you into the knowledge of the materials wherewith a womans mind is furnished from which of em shall we claim merit  all i beg is a favorable allowance which will oblige  your humble servant w f  by the birmingham post you may direct for me at a  n near b  th to be left at the wheel all here desire their compliments    letter viii lady hertford for mr shenstones character of the letters written by this elegant correspondent the reader is desired to revert to the preface afterward duchess of somerset to the hon mrs knight piercylodge may         dear madam i ought and really intended to have made use of the permission you gave me to trouble you with a letter before this time but you do not need any thing to lower your spirits and my letters can hardly have any other effect upon harder hearts than yours when i lost my dear and by me everlamented son lord beauchamp every faculty to please if ever i were possessed of any such died with him i have no longer any cheerful thoughts to communicate to my friends but as the joy and pride of my heart withers in his grave my mind is continually haunting those mansions of the dead and is but too inattentive to what passes in a world where i have still duties and attachments which i ought to be and i hope i may truly say i am thankful for i am sure my affection for my lord hertford and solicitude for his welfare are sincere since if i know my own heart i would not deliberate a moment to lay down my life for his service lady betty and sir hugh smithson and their children are justly dear to me and i still feel the bonds of tender friendship but i enjoy all these blessings with trembling and anxiety for after my dear beauchamp what human things can appear permanent youth beauty virtue health were not sufficient to save him from the hand of death and who then can think themselves secure these are the melancholy considerations which generally entertain my waking hours though sometimes i am able to view the bright side of my fate and ask myself for whom i grieve only for myself how narrow an affection does this imply could he have lived long as my fondest wish desired what could i have asked at the end of that term more than the assurance that he should be placed where i humbly hope and confidently trust he is beyond the reach of sorrow sin or sickness but i must leave a subject which though i am never tired of i ought in regard to my friends to be silent upon and ask you where you would have the collection of letters sent which you were so good to subscribe for at my desire i have a letter from mr collins this day in which he desires to receive your commands my lord and mr cowlad charge me with their compliments to you i am with great truth  dear madam your very affectionate and obedient humble servant f hertford  letter ix miss f  to w shenstone esquire a  n sept        sir i must certainly stand in a very bad light if after so many favors and obligations conferred on me i should be so idle as not to attempt to show my gratitude but how can this be done where is the pen that can describe the pleasures i have been entertained with mine cannot do it  nay even a thomsons would fail here or where shall those thanks or that praise begin that never can end  but hold  he wants no thanks he desires no praise he follows not fame but fame takes pride in following him i shall only say all that is agreeable is to be found at that elegant place the leasowes where you reign as monarch of all and have only to say to this man go and he goes to another come and he comes to your servants do this and they do it and that with a smile which shows that love as well as duty binds em to obedience  mrs a  opens not her mouth but in praise of you and yours she designs to metamorphose into a pigeon and you may expect to find her cooing in virgils grove miss k  thanks you for her picture and values it as a drawing of yours s  drinks tarwater and looks fat and w  could wish you would not stir off your own domain till you had finished your elegies and that the first journey then may be to print em did you but wish it may be so it would not be in the power of any thing to prevent it  my brother has sent you the song and with it his compliments he designed coming to the leasowes while we were there but was prevented and now leaves off all thoughts of it till spring i am going on in my old way  but am determined to be as short as a shrewsbury cake in abruptly telling you that  i am sir your much obliged humble servant w f  all here desire their compliments excuse every thing  adieu    letter x miss f  to w shenstone esquire a  n nov        sir i can no longer forbear telling you that you have in your last obliged me more than by any one action of your whole life and for which i could almost call you friend which i assure you is the highest appellation i can bestow for i must tell you that no one yet ever commenced a friend of mine till they had corrected me of some fault failing or error and though i have long since been taught that i ought not to make a friend of any but my own sex together with other particulars parallel to that yet i cannot but think it a friendly act and as such esteem it for myself let me say that i am not so obstinate as to persist in an error for the sake of supporting a wrong judgment and had i discovered reason to dispute superiority with you in any respect i should have thought you little worthy of my correspondence instead of which i allow you to excel much beyond myself in all preeminence  before i proceed any farther let me clear mrs a  from the aspersion her judgment seems to lie under in this affair otherwise i shall appear to be afraid of the censure it deserves know then twas i chose her shape and peradventure the better to serve my own purposes for how know you but i intended to make a lettercarrier of her as they do in babylon aleppo and the east indies and by that means to accommodate myself with a swifter messenger than the post and as i knew her inclination when a reasonable creature i concluded after transmigration instinct would then as naturally incline her to frequent virgil s grove how unnatural soever this shape may appear to the grove i must tell you i could produce some authorities on my side exclusive of those you have mentioned but i am not about to do this for as you seem to disallow it i readily give it up and answer true o king  nay i think to be in the wrong and to be reproved in such an ingenious humane and polite manner by you more than equals being in the right i believe too twill be for your interest that she remain in her own shape for some time as her fingers are employed in knotting fringe for you so you find you have no occasion to buy twill be ready before the season for wearing it comes  marvel not that i dont admit your next assertion maugre all the forces you can raise nay though the whole nine muses combined against me i will be absolute for once i am as tenacious of my prerogatives as any of my sex nor do i think i have been guilty of an infringement in what i have said i am neither so insensible of favors as not to discover em nor am i so proud or so prudish as not to acknowledge em surely you have dealt with none but the lastmentioned sort of the sex that you are so alarmed at what i have said but no more of this  i now enter a caveat to the subject  mr a  is much pleased with your kind remembrance of him he made an excellent harechase preachment on the thanksgivingday for he told us all the doublings and turnings the pretender and his party made from their first effort to their defeat he has got his brother with him a man whose aspect at one view discovers to you the imbecility of his mind i do not yet know in what capacity he is to act but am a little afraid twill prove that of a servant which will be similar to p  ys generosity  there was a droll scene the other day at w  d between bright b  y and old mrs d  ts servant who was sent to ask him to dinner the message delivered b  y nodded his head and replied i conno come the servant not content with this followed pulled him by the sleeve and entreated him upon which he responsed  i conno come nor i wonno come at this the man retreated much chagrind thinking no doubt his mistress slighted that his own pocket had lost a chance and nothing had been befriended  but the sirloin it was great glee to the spectators and being sunday there was a numerous audience  you have certainly added beauty as well as gentility to the place by destroying those hedges for i think there can scarce be a hedge near you that does not hide a thousand beauties and as to the horsepond it disturbed me greatly when i was there has monsieur snuff box sent your busts and will your elegies ever be printed lord dudley does us an honor when he mentions us and if drinking his health is an equivalent i assure you we are not behindhand with his lordship i had a letter from mr d  n this week he seems as much alarmed as you at my moderate acknowledgment miss f  y is very glad to hear that you design her a picture the enclosed is from mr d  ie surely gossip joan never prated faster  i have only to add that i wish you an untarnished bliss in the company of your polished friend and that you may enjoy each others friendship even to the age of old nestor whose tongue dropped honey full of days was he two ages past he lived the third to see and his first race of subjects long decayed over their sons sons a peaceful scepter swayed popes homer  i have already been too prolix and it is time i tell you that  i am sir your obliged humble servant w f  all here desire their compliments you say you have two fellows but i say you are an odd glove adieu    letter xi in dodsleys collection of mr shenstones letters the   th addressed to a friend begins and contains some passages exactly similar to this but as the editors copy mr shenstones own transcript specifies the particular correspondent to whom it is addressed and contains more subject it was judged not improper to be inserted in this collection w shenstone esquire to the rev mr jago at bishops itchington near kineton in warwickshire the leasowes sept         dear mr jago i think i have outcorresponded all my correspondents whether you are the last that is to be subdued i cannot say but the rest are so fatigued that they are not able to achieve a line apprized of this and being by nature disposed to have mercy on the vanquished parcere subjectis and debellare superbos i seldom write a syllable more than is requisite to further some scheme or ascertain some interview the latter being the purpose of this mine epistle i am in great hopes i shall be at liberty to see you ere many weeks be past and would beg of you to let me know by a line when i am most likely or when very unlikely to meet with you at home the reason why i can fix no week at present is that i am in daily expectations of mr lyttelton and the hagley family i dined there some time since with mr pit mr bouhours mr campion and all the world mr thomson that right friendly bard was expected and i fancy may be there now mr lyttelton offered me the visit and i own i am pleased with the prospect of showing him something at the leasowes beyond his expectations i have made a great improvement in virgils grove since you were here and have finished a new path from it to the house after the manner you approved they are going to build a rotund to terminate the visto at hagley i think there is a little hill joining the park that would suit one better though it will be very pretty where it is  if i come to your house i will not go to mr m  rs he has been twice as near me as the grange with charles lyttelton but never deemed my situation worth seeing i doubt you are a little too modest in praising it wherever you go why dont you applaud it with both hands  parcentes ego dexteras odi  sparge rosas  i am so very much enamoured that is so very partial to my native place that it seems a miracle to me how it comes not to be famous but to be serious  how my lord dudley is tumbled about the world he was overturned in going to town and now again in coming back is not this falling up stairs and down stairs  nevertheless he is safe and sound and able to sit up with you and me till twelve or one at night as i know by last mondays experience  i have somewhere about a thousand things to say to you  not now though  mrs knights visit i reserve till i see you a coach with a coronet is a pretty kind of phenomenon at my door  few things prettier  except the face of such a friend as you for i do not want the grace to prefer a spirituous and generous friendship to all the gewgaws that ambition can contrive  i have wrote out my elegies and heartily wish you had them to look over before i come but i know not how to send them i shall bring and leave much poetry with you   thus and odores  or rather a covering thuri and odoribus  yet i pray you if you shall ever my foolish lines repeat speak of me as i am  nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice  then must you speak of one who    is sir your most affectionate and faithful servant w shenstone  letter xii this letter to mrs knight afterward lady luxborough together with several others addressed to the same correspondent bearing very indistinct dates are placed together in as good order as surmise was capable of directing w shenstone esquire to the honorable mrs knight the leasowes dear madam as it has hitherto seemed good to you to expatiate pretty largely on so diminutive a subject as a thimble i flatter myself that you may read with patience an account of the life and conversation of your most trifling humble servant otherwise i should not have told you that i am extremely unhappy in my present situation that when you left the country i had recourse to another kind of natural beauties namely that which is to be found in groves meads and murmuring streams and so long as summer was pleased to continue his favors i looked upon your departure as what only changed my pleasure to amusement now indeed summer has forsaken me likewise the trees and groves are stripped of their covering and i am left without any fence against spleen vapors megrim discontent and a numerous train of such sort of beings which plague me to death whenever i offer to recollect your absence and how often that happens i leave any one to guess but yourself because any one else is better acquainted with the numerous ways and means you have of rendering your company agreeable i appeal also to the same persons to guess how provoking you are when you mention the possibility there was that i might have seen you at the leasowes some time ago what need you tell one of it since it could not be effected why will you put me upon cursing fortune upon more accounts than i have already occasion to do pray let me endeavor to conform myself to my real circumstances rather than give me a glimpse of the pleasure which you was about to do me and yet had not the goodness to go through with i want no inducements to come to worcester since i discovered that you lived there and that being all that was necessary though you have mentioned others that are attractive  i beg you would make my compliments agreeable to mrs winsmore which you are best capable of doing for two reasons first because you know the sincerity of my esteem and secondly because i have no idea how any thing you say can be disagreeable the consideration that she remembers me and that she spoke of me in the same breath with mrs knight as my vanity interprets your letter makes me so vain that i with the utmost assurance take the liberty of subscribing myself  madam your most obedient humble servant w shenstone p s i believe i shall go to l  n the end of next week if i were to receive a letter from you as i put my foot into the stirup i should bid mrs arnold take in her bottle for i had no occasion for a cordial your affair ou vous scavez diverts me highly    letter xiii w shenstone esquire to the honorable mrs knight nandos coffeehouse near temple bar may madam a lady whose conversation is ever discovering somewhat new and agreeable may possible find some amusement in a subject that is new though with no other recommendation it is upon this account that i beg your acceptance of this grotesque poem  i took great pleasure in seeing the piping faunus at rackstrows because as it is certainly a genteel design it must needs prove agreeable to mrs knight connoisseurs would choose to have his musical intention expressed as it is at present by the posture merely if the pipe was added it would prove more obviously agreeable if i might presume to advise it should be to calculate it in some degree for tastes less refined than your own because there are millions of the former species to perhaps one or two of the latter and i know you take a superior pleasure in the satisfaction of others  trifles light as air or as the poem i am sending acquire a fresh weight with me as often as they give me an occasion of assuring you that  i am madam your most obliged and obedient humble servant w shenstone  letter xiv w shenstone esquire to the right hon lady luxborough at barrels madam i was much concerned to hear by mr williamss account last thursday that your ladyship has been greatly indisposed the particulars of your disorder he does not mention but tells me he was desired to give it as a reason that i did not hear from you before it is as natural for me to make enquiry concerning the recovery of your health as it is for me to wish it which i very earnestly do i have therefore sent an honest neighbor of mine upon this errand who will be glad of an opportunity of seeing barrels poor tom my trusty servant has ever since i came from barrels been in a very dangerous way and whether he ever may regain the small share of health he has been used to is a great question else i had sent something sooner but i must request your ladyship not to write if you find it the least troublesome a verbal message will be very sufficient till such time as you can write me a full account of your recovery  i have no particulars that can tempt me to enlarge this letter and indeed i hardly wish for any lest i should accidentally let fall any thing that might tempt you at this time to write an answer which though so highly agreeable to me at a more favorable season can afford me little satisfaction when i conjecture that you write in pain  i hope mr hall is recovered by this time as my rural scenery could not attract him hither in summer i have little hopes that my conversation can have that effect in winter few persons care to ride twelve dirty miles in winter be their charity ever so great to see the dullest of the sons of men for such am i without any affectation during the winterseason altogether absorbed in what i think they call swissmeditation that is thinking upon nothing a very unjoyous circumstance this for such of my friends as vouchsafe to read my letters  but i digress  i pray for your ladyships health and happiness hoping my messenger may bring me an account of both agreeable to the wishes of  your ladyships most obliged and obedient servant w shenstone it is now oct   th  but this letter was wrote in order to have been sent last week i sat up late with lord dudley one night this week he often proposes your ladyships health and drinks it very respectfully  the inhabitants of our parish have presented our parson at the visitation on which occasion i have given myself the generous air of observing a strict neutrality  in other words i am a person unconcerned    letter xv w shenstone esquire to lady luxborough march          madam after having owned that the fear your ladyship has been under is in reality to be imputed to me i am at a loss for words to express my concern or to alleviate my fault i will not however disallow that the book came to hand much sooner than i could reasonably expect it and that the letter enclosed in it gave me that uncommon pleasure which your ladyships never fail to do i have nothing to say in my behalf but that i have never had health or spirits since i received it that might encourage me to think i could return an answer as i ought and even tonight my spirits are so bad and my head so confused that i have no reason to hope these few lines can do any thing more than free you from your present uncertainty but if i am honored with a line from your ladyship hereafter i will immediately acknowledge it as well as i am able let my capacity be what it will  i do not know how far your ladyships name may be distinguishable by a postwomans ear but this i know that if i had been parson h  k your ladyship should not have known from me that there was any woman in the world who could express herself concerning you with the indecency you mention i am astonished at her behavior and not a little at her forgetfulness there seems to me to be no surer conveyance in the world than that of the farmer by whom i sent my letter to the post office at henley and by whom i suppose you conveyed your parcel however in obedience to your ladyships commands i have sent this letter to master h  k and shall have an additional pressure on my spirits till i hear you have been pleased to forgive my neglect i know extremely well that want of time and leisure and some other excuses which are often made for not writing can be of weight from no one but a cobbler who has ten or a dozen children dependent on a tatchingend but i know as well that your ladyships is no ordinary correspondence and that a person ought to have a clear head and an unembarrassed cheerfulness of temper when he sits down to answer any letter of yours for my part i hardly look upon this as any letter at all and will infallibly write again as soon as i can recover my natural state of mind i have as little reason to consider the enclosed as poetry but as they were short compositions i had been writing them out yesterday with a design to send them to the post office tonight  i am afraid i have tired your ladyship with madrigal and sonnet i hope when the weather gets finer with which my spirits uniformly sympathize to vary my style a little for your ladyships amusement in the mean time i have sent you a poem written by a gentleman of my acquaintance and shown up for a collegeexercise in print your ladyship will soon discover a juvenile want of judgment in several places but i trust that the elegance of his fancy you will admire he sometimes comes and and stays a month with me at the leasowes in the summer the next time he does so i will be obliged to your ladyship for leave to introduce him at barrels i am mistaken if he will not be pleased almost to a degree of enthusiasm  as to your ladyships lameness though it comes last in this irregular letter i beg leave to assure you that it gave me a sincere concern to hear that it was bad and a very sensible pleasure to hear it was abated i as heartily wish your ladyships health and happiness as you do yourself and as i solemnly assure you that such is always the disposition of my mind i will hope to be forgiven if i should through ignorance fall short in my means of expressing it this last neglect is what i shall scarce again be guilty of and can only be excused by your ladyships candor  i am madam your most obliged and most obedient servant w shenstone if your ladyship wants the book i will send it directly otherwise i will beg leave to keep it a week or two longer    letter xvi w shenstone esquire to the right hon lady luxborough at barrels i have sent your ladyship a book of gardening which i borrowed about five years ago of a neighbor if it will be of any service to you in modelling the crooked walks in your shrubbery i shall be glad and you may return it at your leisure as i do it is written by a poor illiterate fellow notwithstanding its dedication to his majesty who is delighted with enquiries into vegetable nature you will see something of his ignorance perhaps in every page more especially page  0  first part where he talks of minerva and pallas for statues with many blunders of like nature it was written seemingly when the present natural taste began to dawn and which i wish rather than hope may last as long as nature  mr l  n you may perhaps hear has been offered and has refused the place of treasurer of the navy in mr d  ns room  what a tide of success  may your ladyship be as happy as success ever made any body and that it is more in the mind than externals is to me a demonstration i am sure i shall never be so happy with with all my philosophy and success as an old fellow who works for me but i think your ladyship has not only a right and philosophical understanding but good animal spirits which are half in half so that you may be much happier that even him which i assure you is to be greatly so  i am now a little maudlin after dinner and if my groups are inconsistent and queer you must excuse me i hope mr allen is by this time well i have written a line to mr outing at the head of his regiment i am now to take my formal leave as i do after a long visit that is with about half a bow and the expression of about half i think but i include as much as any body when i say  i am your ladyships most obliged and most devoted servant w shenstone if your ladyship could spare me about three eggs of your guinea fowl i should be much obliged    letter xvii w shenstone esquire to lady luxborough madam i am quite ashamed that i have not been able to make a speedier enquiry into the event of your ladyships journey it would give me the utmost uneasiness to find that you underwent any inconvenience from a visit which gave me so much pleasure and yourself so little  i am somewhat apprehensive that one ought to guard against ambition and even too much admiration if one would prepare to live as beseems a pious hermit to do your ladyship will discover therefore how dangerous a visitant you are and how much you must have retarded my progress toward an eremitical temper of mind having diffused an air of dignity through my solitary paths which will not fail to present itself as often as i resume them perhaps politeness elegance and taste may be some of those privileged accomplishments which it may be allowable for a recluse to admire under certain limitations if not i can only say that i must remain a very imperfect hermit till i am able to forget the honor you have done me and if i am not likely to succeed that way i may as well indulge my ambition to the full which i never fail to do as often as i am permitted to subscribe myself  your ladyships most obliged and most obedient humble servant w shenstone i propose to wait on your ladyship at barrels very soon in the mean time if you would please to lend me mr mallets and mr whiteheads poems i will take all imaginable care of them    letter xviii w shenstone esquire to lady luxborough the leasowes dear madam though i think it is a sort of maxim that a person in london seldom complains he is forgotten by his friends in the country yet i cannot by any means prevail upon my conscience to acquit me of a sort of disrespectful silence since your ladyship went to town it was not either the politics or the amusements of our great metropolis that could make the letters of your friends appear impertinent or even indifferent to you and though the sublime entertainment you must receive from the conversation of so great a man as lord bolingbroke might bid the fairest to do so yet was i not without conviction that your ladyship would feel some sort of complacency upon the sight of a scrip of paper which should acquaint you that i was alive  alive indeed i am at least if it may be called so to exist among a set of people whose employments passions and sentiments are entirely foreign to my own and where i see and hear and do nothing but what i think may as well be left unseen unheard and undone what can your ladyship expect from a correspondent so situated beside pure respect and friendship and many artless assurances of their reality and continuance  mr o  stayed pretty near a week with me he has i think strict honor goodnature and good sense what he wants in my eye is a little genuine taste for though good sense may by degrees enable a person to discover the beauties of nature or art yet it can never furnish him with any extraordinary relish or enjoyment of them which is the effect of innate taste alone and which differs as widely from the former as the palate differs from the brain your ladyship has i dare say frequently made the same observation  you will hear sir thomas lyttelton notwithstanding he complained always of his head died of a polypus in the great artery which i do not find was ever in the least suspected by his physicians but which if it had been ever so apparent they could not possibly have cured you will imagine that his death must have thrown a sort of gloom round the villages in his neighborhood a numerous and fashionable family animates a countryplace to an inconceivable degree the family at hagley will be immediately dispersed miss lyttelton goes to lady litchfields to the colonels to london and does not think to settle miss west goes first to stow and then intends to reside with her brother the commodore sir george and his lady set out for london tomorrow and as they propose to build next spring upon the old foundation it may be many years ere they come to reside amongst us even for a small part of the summer  lord dudley and i dined together at hagley last wednesday where we found lord ansons brother and some other company mr miller unluckily asked me at table how i liked the new situation of their column which threw me under a necessity of offending either against the rules of politeness or what it more sacred with me the laws of sincerity the truth is i do not like it upon many accounts and i am persuaded before many years are past they will be of the same mind but least of all do i approve their intentions of building three new fronts and altering every room by a gothic model and that with an eye to frugality at the same time that they have not an inch of gothicism about the house to warp their imagination that way but this subject never fails to lead me too far nor can i explain myself to the full unless i could show your ladyship their plan the fine situation they have within an hundred yards they neglect  in short as it appears to me they are going to sacrifice an opportunity of rendering their place complete for the sake of an imperfect but expensive specimen of gothic architecture which not having its foundation either in truth or proportion will fall into disgrace again in the course of a few years  can one then forbear crying out the graces droop  am i in greece or in gothland but as their resolution seems fixed i mention this in confidence and must for the future lay my finger on my mouth  mr s  has so mangled and disfigured my grove that i dare not send it to your ladyship till he has altered the plate so as to render it less intolerable fluellin as i remember in shakespeare historical play of king henry v speaking of the near resemblance betwixt macedon and monmouth observes there is a river in macedon there is a river also in monmouth  peradventure there be fish in both  would you desire better similitude s  being a modest man has seemed to content himself with some such degree of resemblance but i wish him well and will cause him one day to do the place justice for his own sake as well as mine  for his own as his piece will be seen by many who know the place and for mine as the place is known to afford the best scene i have  i am etc w shenstone  letter xix the countess of hertford to lady luxborough piercylodge may         dear madam how long soever your letters are in coming they never fail to assure their welcome by being more agreeable and entertaining as well as breathing more of friendship than any bodys else have the art of doing i have been here about a month and find some little improvements which were ordered when we went to london completed and i think they are not quite unworthy of the name a piece of waste ground on the lower side of the abbeywalk has been turned into a cornfield and a turfwalk about eight feet wide round it close to a flourishing hawthorn hedge on one side there is a thatched seat open on three sides which pretends to no name of greater dignity than justly belongs to what it represents namely a shepherds hut before it there is an irregular piece of turf which was spared for the sake of some old oaks and beeches which are scattered upon it and as you are sitting down there you have under these boughs a direct view of windsor castle there are sweetwilliams narcissuss rosecampions and such flowers as the hares will not eat in little borders round the foot of every tree and i almost flatter myself that you would not be displeased with the rural appearance of the whole the rains have given us the strongest verdure i ever saw our lawns and meadows are enamelled with a profusion of dasies and cowslips and we have the greatest appearance of fruit that has been seen these many years i conclude you will read mr thomsons castle of indolence it is after the manner of spencer but i think he does not always keep so close to his style as the author of the schoolmistress whose name i never knew till you were so good as to inform me of it i think it a charming poem and was very much pleased with his ballad of queen elizabeths seeing the milkmaid she apappears at least in my humble imagination in a more natural light than when we hear of her bullying foreign powers and cutting off the head of an unhappy queen who fled to her for protection but to return to the castle of indolence i believe it will afford you much entertainment there are many pretty paintings in it but i think the wizards song deserves a preference  he needs no muse who dictates from his heart have you met with two little volumes which contain four contemplations written by a mr james hervey a young cornish or devonshire clergyman the subjects are upon walking among the tombs upon a flower garden upon night and upon the starry heavens there is something poetical and truly pious now i have got into the impertinence of recommending books to one who is a much better judge than myself i must name an essay on delicacy the essay on delicacy here mentioned was the production of dr nathaniel lancaster many years rector of stanford rivers near ongar in essex uncle to the editor of these letters he was a man of strong natural parts great erudition refined taste and master of a nervous and at the same time elegant style as is very obvious to every one who has had the happiness to read the essay here spoken of his writings were fewer in number than their authors genius seemed to promise to his friends and his publications less known than their intrinsic excellence deserved had he been as solicitous as he was capable to instruct and please the world few prosewriters would have surpassed him but in his later years he lived a recluse and whatever he composed in the hours of retired leisure he unhappily for the public ordered to be burned which was religiously i had almost said irreligiously performed  he was a native of cheshire and in his earlier years under the patronage and friendship of the late earl of cholmondeley mixed in all the more exalted scenes of polished life where his lively spirit and brilliant conversation rendered him universally distinguished and esteemed and even till within a few months of his decease near seventyfive years of age these faculties could scarce be said to be impaired  the essay on delicacy of which we are now speaking the only material work of his which the editor knows to have survived him was first printed in the year      and has been very judiciously and meritoriously preserved by the late mr dodsley in his fugitive pieces published in two volumes   a subject which if i were not acquainted with you and one or two more i should imagine had no longer an existence upon our globe  i sincerely sympathize in the pleasure which you must feel dear madam from the extreme good character which every body gives of your son and which his behavior to you proves he deserves may this with every other blessing be long continued to you and may you always look upon me as a sincere though insignificant friend as well as a  most faithful and obedient humble servant f hertford my lord is at present in london but i hope he will be here time enough to save the postage of this letter i should be very glad to see any thing of mr shenstones    letter xx w shenstone esquire to the rev mr graves at whitchurch near reading berks the leasowes june      dear mr graves i find a very strong impulse prompting me to write to you this evening i dont know whether i ever let you into the secret that i receive an inward satisfaction at the time that i am sending you a letter and that this action partakes of the nature of all virtuous ones in being its own reward however we are taught to hope for other and more ample rewards attending virtue as i am inclined to expect a more considerable pleasure when i receive your answer my soul now leans entirely on the friendship of a few private acquaintance and if they drop me i shall be a wretched misanthrope is it a great fatigue to you to sit down some vacant halfhour and scribble me a few lines relating to the state of your mind and your affairs  dick jago who called accidentally at a publichouse at mickleton told me they heard  mentioning at the same time his thorough conviction that whatever might prove the event of this affair as you were a principal it would be as it ought mr smith the designer who knew you too was here at the same time and many civil things very agreeable to me were said in your behalf  immo omnes omnia bona dixere as to   i thank you for your little strictures on the schoolmistress i have sacrificed my partiality to your unbiassed judgment multa gemens have i sacrificed it the truth is i am not quite convinced though i have acted as if i were that one should give up any part that appears droll in itself and makes the poem on the whole more agreeable for the sake of rendering it a more perfect imitation of spencer but when you have more leisure and i collect my pieces i dont despair of furnishing a more complete edition yet  mr smith whom i mentioned just now has taken two views of hagleypark which with two from other places complete a set the subscriptionprice half a guinea but he takes other little views of the closer scenes and of particular beauties which will form a drawingbook and which i shall like beyond those i have subscribed for would you not be surprised to see a draught of my virgils grove inserted among the latter  he took one and promised to have it engraved and inserted somewhere but i had rather he should stay a week and take about four views and that you were here and would give him some instructions and it should make a little drawingbook to sell for a shilling but ah me  i fondly dream  the days of fancy and dear enthusiasm will never more return such as those that flew over our heads when you were here and at harborough on your first visit when the merum rus of the leasowes could furnish you with pleasanter ideas than the noblest scenes that ever painter copied  i am impatient to see you and resolve to do so when i can and i beg you will project some means of coming to the leasowes without inconvenience to yourself  i am your truly affectionate w shenstone i beg my compliments to mr whistler i dont know whether i am more ashamed or vexed that i cannot set out  tomorrow  for whitchurch but my mind will not be easy till i have seen both him and you    letter xxi w shenstone esquire to lady luxborough the leasowes sunday july         madam when i received your ladyships letter on friday i was just upon the point of setting out for broom i therefore declined answering it till i had spoke with miss dolman it is now with the greatest thankfulness for your obliging invitation and the most pleasing idea of the visit we propose that i am to inform your ladyship we intend waiting on you upon tuesday or wednesday sevnnight if you should have much company at that time or the visit should be otherwise unseasonable your ladyship will be so good as to let us know if not i will not fail to show miss dolman the way to the most agreeable entertainment and the most engaging conversation i have met with any where your ladyship will not imagine that i understand entertainment in the vulgar sense though what i say is true enough in that my chief pleasures i flatter myself are pleasures of the mind and i can say with great truth that my mind was never more disposed to be pleased any where else or found equal opportunities to gratify that disposition  miss dolman though she has not seen much of the world has done great things or in other words has made good use of the opportunities she has had if she can deserve any part of that favorable mention you make of her all i know is that she has taste enough to put the pleasure i have promised her at barrels out of all dispute  i now proceed to other things i have sent your ladyship the first number of sickness a poem which is all i have i send it as indeed i offered it because it bears some relation to lady hertford on account of the panegyric of lord beauchamp which i believe is just  i have of late read the life of colonel gardener being induced to do so by a vision which is described there and which i hear mr lyttelton countenances i will give your ladyship my opinion of the story when i come to barrels  pray dont buy the books i talked of you will hardly read them twice and i can lend you herveys meditations the life of colonel gardener and in a short time memoirs of mrs pilkington either of my own or my brothers i beseech your ladyship that i may have leave to save you six shillings and three shillings and three shillings that is according to the old maxim viz a penny saved etc put into the power of my gratitude to be of about twelve shillings significancy by so doing i shall not only talk but proceed to one ouvert act in the cause of economy  i wish it be not the only one  in regard to mr outing i will only say that i please myself with the full assurance of meeting him at barrels it is out of my power this day to send you an amusing letter whether it be so at other times or not there is not a single cloud or dimness in the sky but has its exact image or counterpart in my imagination but ones sincerity does not suffer by weather though ones vivacity may and it is with the greatest truth that i shall always remain  your ladyships most obliged and most obedient servant w shenstone  letter xxii miss dolman to w shenstone esquire broom nov        sir i am under two obligations to you for the genteel present you have made me one for the pleasure i have received and shall receive from the neat and valuable lettercase which is part of it and the other for the honor of your letter this acknowledgment is all the return i am able to make you for them at this time but fortune will i hope give me some future opportunity of freeing myself as soon as she does i shall certainly take it if i have your consent so to do but the latter i despair of ever discharging as i can never do it till apollo is pleased to favor me in such a manner as he does you i am desiring you to accept of my brothers compliments and to give both his and mine to your brother  your much obliged and affectionate servant m dolman  letter xxiii countess of hertford to lady luxborough percy lodge nov  0      dear madam i remember mrs higgons used to say lady clarendon had such a power over her understanding that she might persuade her she was a fish you have pretty near the same ascendant over mine yet cannot quite convince me that eight months is not an immoderate while to keep silence and make a chasm in a correspondence with a friend who incessantly wishes to hear of your health and happiness i am not more easily seduced into an assent to your apology for though i admire the beautiful language in which the fiction of your dullness is painted i cannot mistake it for a truth i am so bad at invention that i will not search for an ingenious fable to excuse myself for troubling you with an answer so soon though my readiness to obey your commands in subscribing for the prints you mention if you will let me know where i must send for a receipt might furnish me with one but honestly own that as my lord has been in london since thursday i did not know how to employ the leisure hours his absence afforded me more to my satisfaction  we returned hither from bath only friday the eleventh we were there two months the last fortnight of which we were detained after all our things were gone by my poor lords having a fit of the gout and i believe we came away rather too soon after it for his limbs had not recovered their strength so that he was terribly fatigued however he has now recovered it and is certainly upon the whole infinitely the better for having drank the bath waters if i could envy you dear madam i should be tempted to do it for being in reach of hagley for having mr west for a neighbor and mr shenstone for a friend he has obliged me so much in letting me see his charming ode upon autumn and the honor he does mr thomsons memory in that poem and in his design to erect an urn for him in virgils grove that i am sorry i cannot agree with him in his dislike to autumn on the contrary i draw one motive of my partiality to it from a similar cause to what he partly ascribes his aversion he hates it as a season which deprived him of a friend i love it because the latest days my heart could boast of happiness in the best and most beloved of sons were in that time of the year till as dr young says  at deaths toll whose restless iron tongue calls daily for his millions at a meal starting i woke and found myself undone   and then the clouds the winds the rains the falling leaves the naked branches the poor shivering birds  every thing around me seemed to sympathize in my distress and still at every melancholy anniversary of my evertobelamented loss put on the same friendly appearance of social sorrow and i may say with myra in her poem before mr thomsons first edition of the seasons to thee my gentlydrooping head i bend thy sigh my sister and thy tear my friend   forgive me dear madam for thus continually returning to this afflicting subject but two lines of mr popes with the alteration only of one word must plead my excuse of all affliction taught a sufferer yet it is sure the hardest science to forget   i have done  and will now tell you that our being obliged to go to bath has hindered us from undertaking any thing here so that i have nothing to talk of that is new and i am afraid there was nothing here before that would make a tolerable figure either in a print or a drawing a flat can hardly look well upon paper though in reality the variety of woods and lawns water grass and gravel may produce a contrast not unpleasing to the eye i am sorry you find any defects in mr hervey for both the design and manner of his writing pleases me extremely  i want to know what you think of the peruvian letters and especially of the fifth in the suite i have been very well entertained lately with the two first volumes of the foundling the history of tom jones by henry fielding esquire written by mr fielding but not to be published till the   d of january if the same spirit runs through the whole work i think it it will be much preferable to joseph andrews my lord is absent from london but i hope will be here time enough to free this letter for i am sure it is not worth the postage  i am dear madam your most faithful and devoted f hertford  letter xxiv miss dolman to w shenstone esquire broom jan         sir in the first place i return you thanks for your very polite letter which i do assure you i was proud of receiving and should have troubled you with an answer the same day could i write with as little difficulty as you  i admire the countesss letter and especially that part about her son she seems sensible of her great loss still she talks of virgils grove as if she had seen it i am sure if she had she would have been highly delighted with the beauties of that place i want summer to come that i may see the urn which you intend to erect to thomsons memory and virgils grove in perfection  with carelessness and inattention i have read mrs pilkingtons second volume she is still more entertaining i think she expresses herself well i fancy too her poetry to be good and i dare say she will think it hard not to be allowed the liberty of her tongue and pen  but i ought to be ashamed of giving my opinion with so much freedom to one who is so good a judge of writing as you are  my litchfield journey afforded me but slender amusement less even than i expected mrs dolman had two visitants mrs whitby and her daughter who came from the same town where lord anson lives they talked much in praise of his lordship and seemed to be intimate acquaintance of his  miss fletchers severe letter has never been answered yet i hope sir that will excuse for the shortness of this because i must instantly set about writing one to her pray excuse this nonsense with all its faults which are very numerous  i am yours m dolman  letter xxv miss dolman to w shenstone esquire broom march         so you are determined sir to be silent till i have wrote again  an effectual method indeed to make me for i should be very imprudent did i not procure myself your inimitable letters every opportunity i had which are sure to please amuse and instruct at the same time but i have really so great contempt for my own that when i have finished a letter i can scarcely persuade myself to send it were i not inclined to believe you are more my friend than to make any use of it to my disadvantage  last week i received an epistle from miss fanny fletcher all she says in relation to lady luxborough is as follows pray dont think what i said of lord luxborough proceeded either from envy or jealousy i assure you it did not i am neither so stupid nor so unreasonable to desire you to like me only and hope i am far from speaking ill of any persons because they have accomplishments  mrs d  t of worfield is dead her son is gone to oxford to qualify himself for a living of l 00 a year which his aunt s  n has given him together with an estate of l 00 the living is held in trust by one mr w  re  this is all she informs me of that i think worth relating to you only that she has your eclogues very safe and has kept them she says seven months longer than you gave her leave yet hopes and trusts you will forgive to seventy times seven  if you only mentioned the ruffles to me as a hint that you wanted a pair of that sort i am mighty glad i have taken it so i have sent the enclosed to know whether the flowers are filled up in the manner you would have em if not please to communicate to me some way or other how you mean and then i will persevere in my work with infinite pleasure  this summer i shall also begin my brother a firescreen if he can contrive the pattern of it i wish i may be so fortunate to please you both in the performances which i have undertaken and then i shall be sure my time has not been spent in vain but if the contrary should happen i will immediately go in search of the great mr aesop and entreat a cup of the waters of forgetfulness adieu  i would add more nonsense to what i have already wrote did not your servant wait  i am with great sincerity yours m dolman  letter xxvi w shenstone esquire to lady luxborough the leasowes june        madam though i may seem to have been extremely idle i have really taken no small pains in endeavoring to obey your ladyships commands i wish when you peruse my packet you may not rather think me too officious though i should imagine even that a crime by no means equal to negligence in any affair wherein you are pleased to employ me how far i have erred in that respect i am utterly unable to judge as your ladyships directions were not very explicit and as i have not been favored with a single syllable from mr h  ll to inform me whether or how far he approved of any alterations but what harm do i commit i do not call them alterations which i send they are only a small cargo of different expressions which i sincerely desire you will apply or reject entirely as you think proper nor shall it give me the least offense if you reject the whole if so be you please to acquit me of presumption to speak my present thoughts i think the epitaph on mr h  lls father and indeed all epitaphs should be short what i have chiefly aimed at in number i and number ii is to express his general character in few words nevertheless if mr h  ll chooses to have a more particular account of his father i should think he had better let a printer then residing at birmingham aris take off about half a score copies on a single sheet of that which your ladyship has sketched out after you have made what improvements and additions you shall think advisable i mean to give them away amongst a few friends or relations i am not languid in my wishes to advance the character to as high a pitch as mr h  ll can desire for i believe his father might deserve as good an one as any person in a public station but you remember these lines of mr pope  according to the way of the world it is from high life high characters are drawn a saint in crape is twice a saint in lawn a judge is just a chancllor juster still a gownman learned a bishop  what you will wise if a minister but if a king  more wise more learned more just more every thing where by the way the second and third verses seem to dwell upon the same distinction  but the whole paragraph to the best of my memory is exceedingly beautiful what there seems of weight in this so far as regards the present purpose is that the character of a person in private life should not be drawn too pompously perhaps i am too scrupulous however i wish your ladyship may be full as much so in regard to my trifling criticisms does the affair require haste or may it be deferred till i have the honor of seeing you  i will however for the present take leave of the subject  i lead the unhappy life of seeing nothing in the creation so idle as myself i am continually piddling in little matters about my farm what do you think of my publishing verses once a week upon my skreens for the amusement of my good friends the vulgar  my verses for the present week are published in virgils grove and run thus the editor is well aware that the substance of these lines has been repeatedly published but as this was probably the original reading he thought that it might not be unacceptable in this place here in cool grot and mossy cell we fauns and tripping fairies dwell though rarely seen by human eye yet when the moon ascended high darts through yon limes her quivering beam we frisk it near this crystal stream then fear to spoil these sacred bowers nor wound the shrubs nor cross the flowers so may your path with sweets abound so may your couch with rest be crowned but ill betide or nymph or swain who dares these hallowed haunts profane oberon  my method is a very cheap one i paste some writingpaper to a piece of deal then print with a pen this serves in roothouses and under cover  your ladyship has been so unkind as not to let me know how your pavilion proceeds whether you are happy in planning or in beholding the plans executed  may i hope to hear soon  two hundred pounds expended in a rotund at hagley on ionic pillars the dome of stone with thin lead underneath to keep out wet while i propose or fancy i propose to build a piece of gothic architecture at sight of which all modern castles near shall bow their heads abased like the other sheaves to josephs i send you the plan it is for a seat on the bank above my hermitage and will amount on a moderate computation to the sum of fifteen shillings  i am very constantly your ladyships most obliged and most obedient servant w shenstone  letter xxvii duchess of somerset to lady luxborough percylodge june         dear madam your ladyship bids me give you an account of what alterations we are making at present but i feel myself much less able to describe the fabric and furniture of a palace than a hermitage and while i am attending to all my lords designs there i fancy i am no better acquainted with the effect it will produce than a person would be with the beauty of a piece of tapestry who saw only the wrong side of it my lord will do a good deal to the front of the house in order to make it appear less like a prison he builds a new wing on the right hand side of the garden which will contain a library bedchamber dressing room and a waitingroom i think i told you that all the sashes doors and ceilings in both apartments must be entirely new and the floors in my lords the staircase is very noble but will require as large a lanthorn to light it as that at houghton so much celebrated in the newspapers the chimneypieces in both apartments are to be all new and some of them very expensive the draughts are mighty pretty my lords bed on the groundfloor is crimson damask with tapestry hangings the next room is furnished with green damask on purpose to set off his pictures the next with a set of very fine old hangings of the duke of newcastles horsemanship with his own picture on horseback as big as life and now they are clean looking neat as when new the parlour to be hung with some very good pictures above stairs the great waiting room with saxon green cloth chairs with gilt nails and green lutestring window curtains marble table and large glass between the windows first drawing room new crimson damask with lutestring window curtains two very fine japan tables and glasses between the windows with carved and gilt frames inner drawing room tapestry hangings with small figures very pretty and as fresh as new he lays two rooms together in the right wing of the court on the ground floor in order to make a chapel with a gothic wainscot ceiling and painted windows there is to be a dutch stove in it which is so contrived as to represent a tomb with an urn upon it the court is to be paved and the footway altered and my lord is in treaty for nine houses on the other side the way in order to pull them down and build stables for there are none belonging to the house whose gates are intended to open directly over against those of the court if he can agree for this purchase he will widen the street in that part about eight feet now dear madam i have obeyed you in the best manner i am able but upon looking back into my letter i find i have forgot my bedchamber dressing room and closet which one would think should not appear least interesting to myself the first of these is to have a new bedhanging and chairs of crimson queens damask the dressing room which has two large sashes will have tapestry hangings and green damask chairs the closet which is small and has only one sash exactly facing the chimney furnished with painted paper the chimneypiece in the dressing room is to be of statuarymarble and giallo di siering and just in the front of it the fable of the stork inviting the fox to dinner very neatly carved there is another little waitingroom at this end of the apartment for the groom of the chambers to be in in the morning or when i am not in form in the evening to return to my bergerie nothing has been done in it this summer nor have i the heart to propose any thing for i am actually frightened with the sum my lord is laying out about northumberlandhouse and i find by living long in strait circumstances one contracts a narrowness of mind which makes launching out at once into great expense not appear so desirable as it would be thought by young gay people the cold north winds have blighted and ruined the beauty of my roses for the remainder of this year and starved all the various flowers which used to adorn our clumps and borders the time of our going into sussex remains unfixed but i fancy it will be in about a month and we have taken a new house in bath for the first week in september so that instead of enjoying my peaceful shades as i used to do i appear engaged in a tedious pilgrimage and am looking over the charms of the summer month to a resting place in northumberlandhouse and where perhaps i may never come the probability is much stronger against me than it was this time five years against my everlamented beauchamp and indeed i am far from well at present having a most terrible cough and cold with a continual headache and sickness at my stomach  i am glad to hear that mrs w  ls seeming neglect did not proceed from her own heart but the hardness of anothers which is a stranger to all that is gentle or humane i am persuaded your improvements will add great beauty to your habitation and would make me long to see it if i were a movable being but you know i never was fond of traveling and i cannot take a journey now but as the rhodian colossus might do among all my lords acquisitions none has given me more pleasure than his chaplain who is between sixty and seventy very well bred strictly pious and they say is an admirable scholar has a genius for all the polite arts is a good judge of poetry has read a prodigious deal is very modest and at the same time constantly cheerful but naturally inclined to a solitary country life in short we are all fond of his company from my lord to the lowest servant in the house i am sure you are tired of my obedience by this time and will be glad to see me come to a conclusion by subscribing myself  dear madam your most faithful and obedient humble servant f somerset  letter xxviii mr whistler to w shenstone esquire whitchurch oct        dear mr shenstone i have buried a friend who has made me his executor and of consequence i have had a good deal of fatigue i tell you this thus abruptly because i could not have wrote a sentence without blushing till i had in my opinion made a reasonable excuse for my seeming neglect of you you who so abundantly obliged me by your last favor the flowers were the finest i have seen this season though i have seen those of a celebrated florist this year  inferior in no respect and superior in this which weighs much with me that they will not fade such is the advantage of art the offspring of the mind above the perishable beauties of nature i am sure they shall never perish in my hands for i shall even piously transmit them down to posterity as they deserve you are continually finding out some new way to ravish your friends and yet that seems needless since in your old one i mean that of wit you seem to be infinite all this is so and so superlatively so that i begin to think myself a fool to hold so unequal a correspondence i am a gainer in one respect but i am certainly a loser in another it is a great proof of my affection to you however for none but mean souls would otherwise prefer their pleasure to their honor to speak in the most sincere manner i never am so sensible of my own inability as when i take one of your letters before me to answer it emulation immediately ceases and then you cannot wonder if i fall even below the bathos of my own genius  i know you are by this time impatient to hear what friend i have lost it is mr brooker of whom you have often heard me speak i have got indeed by his death but i assure you no gain would be sufficient to make me unconcerned at the loss of a friend  so far from it that the acquisition only adds to the tenderness and consequently to the regret  now i must return to the old burden when shall i see you  i long to see you  it is more than garrick playing richard to see you  the next highest pitch my imagination can soar i long too to see your alterations which i look upon as so many of your visible ideas  as for my retreat it is not worth describing or to describe it at once i may call it a bandbox viz the citizens delight however i wish you were in it and now let me propose my scheme it is the same i proposed last year it is to meet either here or at london first for i shall be alternately at both places and will order my route at your pleasure i purpose going soon but a letter from you shall determine my schemes at any time though if i should be at london and you would come thither first and afterward with me to whitchurch it would complete my wishes for i long to be at both places with you my residence in london is at mr peareths chambers kingsbenchwalks no   but direct to me at whitchurch as yet  if you have any vanity it must be exquisitely fed by the smallest favor from lady luxborough if you have a taste for pleasure refined to the highest degree why did i say if by all accounts her politeness must gratify it to the full when i say this i dont speak in the gross i dont say that this person or the other said she was a wonder though that i can aver too but i go upon better grounds for my assertion than general applause i go upon particulars from which i have formed a character that must be beautiful  you complain of mr  i told him of it but dont know whether he has made an atonement i am a good deal picqued at him myself though we live next door to each other he has spent but one evening with me since he has been at  and that was after a thousand remonstrances and much against his will he neglects every body for his wife in short he is no more  i hope you will favor me with a line soon and that it may bring sweet boadments all compliments wait on you with these i must conclude applauding myself whenever i reflect that i am  yours a whistler  letter xxix the duchess of somerset to lady luxborough percylodge jan         0 dear madam when i look upon the date of your letter it puts me both out of countenance and patience with myself your letter found me at bath from whence i thank god my lord is returned with his health and appetite much improved and i hope the good effects of this journey will continue longer than those of the preceding years our servants and goods have all been removed to northumberlandhouse since before michaelmas but when we shall get into it ourselves is yet among the secrets of fate it is still hid with scaffolds toward the street but by the plan and the little i could see of it when i was in london on the kings birthday it will be very handsome and indeed it should my lord destined  0000 l for the alterations but i believe he has by this time experienced that he deceived himself at not setting it at above double for though the house itself will not cost perhaps above   000 l yet the houses he has purchased in order to widen the street and build his stables and the remainder of the duke of chandoss grant for scotlandyard which he is in treaty for in order to carry down his garden and open a view from his house to the thames will cost at least as much more mean time you may guess our poor bergerie has been neglected and except a very pretty and convenient hothouse for pineapples has had no additional ornament of any kind we pass this winter here which i should not regret at any other time but as lady betty the late duchess of northumberland is to lie in and is already gone a month past her reckoning i should like to be nearer to her i was not eight and forty hours in town when i went to be presented on my lords new earldoms and to make my appearance on the birthday for i went from hence at seven on the sunday morning and was presented that day at noon and on the monday as soon as the drawing room was over undressed and came back directly i lay at sir hugh smithsons for i could not have a room at northumberlandhouse and i have never seen london since we have the most glorious weather that i believe was ever seen in winter but alas i can only admire it from my windows being under dr shaws hands for the ill consequence of a fall which i had before i went to bath by a servant heedlessly taking away a chair just as i was going to sit down and which i took too little care of at first so i am now forbid all sort of exercise which gives me but a melancholy prospect as to my health for the future but gods will be done and i hope i shall cheerfully submit to the event whatever it be  have you seen a little french book called conseils a une amie said to be written by madame de pompadour the name of the author will not induce you to expect any very exalted sentiments of religion or morality but it contains good rules for making a proper figure in highlife i have also had the letters of monsieur racine le pere and some memoirs of his life by his son lent me and they give me a greater esteem for him as a man than as the author of ester and athaliah i hope you have seen my old acquaintance the minister of b  s answer to dr middletons free enquiry about miracles i cannot imagine how he can reply to it without owning himself a deist or explaining some of his innuendos in a different way to what they appear at first sight mr and mrs wymondesolds handsome behavior to you dear madam gives me a good opinion of them both i believe i shall never have reason to alter that which i have formed of my lord l  for some years past and as to that i strove to entertain of him before twas the work of art and a contrecoeur as to your son i think he does not act of himself i am sorry to hear mr shenstone has been so ill but i hope his muse has not left him i am sure yours has not i am confident she attended you very agreeably upon his bench mr lindsey my lords chaplain who by the way is a very good judge and a pretty sort of man prefers his ode on autumn to almost every modern performance my lord sends you his compliments and i am with a very sincere regard  dear madam your ladyships most obliged and faithful humble servant f somerset the first of the enclosed verses are said to have been written by a gentleman in new england the second by mr marshmam if you have not seen them i hope they will serve for a minutes amusement    letter xxx miss dolman to w shenstone esquire broom feb       0  sir i return you a multitude of thanks for the favor of your last letter to me i think you seem to have had as solitary a winter as we have at broom this is the season a town life is vastly preferable to that of the country the country now is only fit for poachers and gamekeepers like old darby and joan we live now upon the thoughts of past pleasures in fondly meditating over past pleasures and in hoping more however we have two amusements which never fail us and those are reading and music in order that we may enjoy the latter in a greater degree than we have done of late we have got mr g  over sometimes you know who has procured us a new spinnet and he says he will make us proficient in the art of music presently provided we will but be diligent  i have sent for the pamphlet that is wrote against mr g  s compositions as he is my master i have a curiosity to it he says it pulls him all to pieces i cannot tell what genius he has for composing music but certainly he is a very good musicmaster as a companion i do not much admire him i think he is a disagreeable man very mercenary always full of esteem for himself and of contempt for all others and does not consider that it is almost as glorious to acknowledge merit in other persons as to have it oneself but he sets good lessons so i will bear with him as lord foppington tells his shoemaker  now by all that is great and powerful thou art a most incomprehensible coxcomb but thou make good shoes so i will bear with thee sir john vanburghs comedy of the relapse   pray have you seen the memoirs of the house of brandenburgh in english by the king of prussia i have some thoughts of buying the  economy of life a most excellent little work published about this time by mr r dodsley and by most persons supposed to be his writing though vague report attributed it to various geniuses namely lord chesterfield mr melmoth etc but should be glad of your opinion of it first it is wrote in the manner of solomons proverbs which i think is a pretty one i am very glad to hear that lady luxborough has her health the family at a  n are all well i heard from them this moment i am sir  your most obedient humble servant m dolman  letter xxxi w shenstone esquire to lady luxborough the leasowes march    0  madam i can very faithfully assure your ladyship that the pleasure i received from your french letter was equal to what i expected and as i can hardly form an expression that implies my approbation more fully i ought perhaps to add nothing more upon this head however i can ill avoid being more explicit for besides that your choice of words gives me an agreeable idea of the french language there is i dont know what kind of pleasure arises upon seeing common or domestic affairs treated of in a language foreign to ones own i wish it may not one day tempt me to hazard a few french lines to your ladyship although i have in a great measure forgot the termination of my moods and tenses and should of course make a thousand blunders in regard to the proper idiom but if i should i trust your ladyship would be prevailed upon to burn what i wrote immediately surely it is either owing to the delicacy of your choice or the french have great numbers of words more expressive than our own for instance  trop bonne pour avoir besoin de cet assaisonnement too good to stand in need of this recommendation i know not of any english word that would be proper here besides recommendation which is greatly inferior i have observed the same of many others but i confine my partiality to their prose and i dare say your ladyship who knows so well all the beauties of their language is also not unacquainted with the imperfections of it by which means you find yourself so well enabled to disguise the latter at the same time that you are displaying the former notwithstanding the supposed qualifications of the glums and the gawries excites ones curiosity the book does not i think deserve a place in your ladyships library and i would not have you purchase it it makes two volumes in   mo price  s it came into my way so i read it giving it just attention enough to let it amuse me with the imaginary scenes it describes as to what i said of the scribbleriad you will observe i had read nothing but a few quotations and am now to request your ladyships opinion who have received the book believe me my lady i am not lazy in mind i long for nothing so much as bodily health and spirits to be able to acquit myself better of my share of the correspondence and to deserve the vivacity of yours somewhat more than i do but when i shall be able to exchange the cypress grove for the more agreeable verdure of the myrtle or the laurel is a question i cannot pretend to solve  very pedantic truly this  but to proceed i wrote many ludicrous things at college and in the former part of my life and one or two of these am i thinking to enclose during this insipid season perhaps taking like woodcocks the advantage of a fog they may hope at such a time for something better quarter though to speak the truth they are much too silly and your judgment too penetrating to give them any room for such an expectation as to printing i will not say that i never intend it but i must first be able to spend a few weeks with my friend graves who is a person of great delicacy and whose friendship may perhaps induce him to examine my trifles with some attention no very agreeable task to him or any one else mean time the complaint you make of your present want of amusement gives me an occasion to pour in floods of my written impertinence the progress of taste i meant to show you long ago the snuff box which by interweaving another poem or two is now i see a mere piece of patchwork appears before you for no other reason in the world but that it happens to be transcribed in the same book with the former and is interested in my desiring you not to read a line of it i send also the ode i first mentioned to the duchess  rural elegance an ode to the late duchess of somerset see shenstones works vol i page  0  and would ask in the first place whether it deserves correction if you would not choose i should immediately destroy it will you be so kind as to mark any improprieties or propose any improvements to me i hope you will be in no concern about defacing the copy in that case for i would write it over ever so often if i could by that means add a syllable that was more expressive of my veneration for her grace or that tended to give her a moments amusement i calculated the subject as well as i could but i am fearful you will discover nothing but commonplace thoughts i think most of my verses smell of nothing but fieldflowers and considering how i spend my time they can scarce do otherwise  a word more in regard to the proposed alteration in your room if your ladyship does not choose to go to the expense of a carved frame what think you of a white oval frame to your glass in the middle and a festoon on each side this with the stucco need amount to no more than four guineas but the room is mighty well as it is and you are yourself the judge whether the expense of the alteration would afford you an answerable amusement i am greatly pleased with what your ladyship mentions of coming to the leasowes for though you will see but little new this year yet by allowing yourself some little time you will see the same with much greater ease than you could before and if i should add pleasure i hope you will allow it to my fondness for a place that has engrossed my care so long you complain madam of the want of fresh ideas which i never yet observed in your conversation or letters at any time or tide guess however what must be my case who see nothing from day to day but bleak mountains and wild staring rocks the wretched result of my pains the swains greater brutes than their flocks and the nymphs as polite as the swains  i once thought of inscribing these on a seat but now my very spleen forsakes me  letter xxxii w shenstone esquire to lady luxborough the leasowes may         dear madam i hasten to acquaint your ladyship that my brother is now greatly better and is we all hope in a fair way of recovery  what small hopes i have entertained for most part of the time since i wrote last to barrels have been rather owing to a kind of selfflattery and an unwillingness to despair than any proper foundation  but these three days his disorder is so much abated that they seem to receive some sanction from reason not that i am entirely free from apprehensions the asthmatical disorder is fallen down into his legs where it continues at present but what by means of asss milk which agrees with him the advantage of a few days in which he has been carried sedanfashion about my grounds and the most scrupulous care in regard to what we suffer him to eat or drink his spirits pulse and complexion are astonishingly recovered and his strength and stomach proportionably restored  i will not detain your ladyship any longer on this head than to acquaint you that i have thought about writing to barrels every day since your servant was here but finding all along such frequent changes in the disorder and being utterly incapable to give your ladyship any satisfactory account i had not the spirit to set pen to paper  this has been to me the most disagreeable season for a continuance i ever spent in my life betwixt sleepless nights painful apprehensions constant solicitude confinement and an entire alteration in regard to my way of life i found my own situation not a little endangered but as the original cause begins to cease i hope the effect will i might have added to the former vexations the difficulty of procuring good advice and the no less difficulty of prevailing on my brother to follow it such persons as he ought always to be well i mean to guard more than others against diseases as they have so little patience in reserve to submit to the means of cure  but to lead your ladyship from the sick room into the open air a little  i am now beginning for the first time to brush up my walks the trees and shrubs are in full bloom all of a sudden i mean so far as concerns the green leaves for the latter have not yet flowered the servants are now very busy in cleaning my grove etc whither i stray now two or three times a day with great complacency i doubt the death of poor mr h  lls brother will occasion him much worldly perplexity as well as concern at present i would otherwise press him to spend a week with me at the leasowes as some kind of relief to him and a great pleasure to us i think a change of place after such an affliction is very often of no small service that book of mr pearsalls which your ladyship subscribed for is come out i hear but i have had no copies sent yet your ladyship i know intended to oblige me by your subscription and that point you can never fail to obtain  more i am not at liberty to say you will please to mention this publication to mr h  ll i sent his name though i am not sure that he subscribed but i know he would be the readiest of men to serve an old schoolfellow would your ladyship be so kind as to lend me pompey the little i have read as i said before nothing but physicbooks for these last six weeks and i want now to be indulged with somewhat more amusing i will not pretend to your ladyship that i am a very great physician but i consider myself as qualified to make the best nurse of any body in the three kingdoms i hope soon to be able to adjust a time when i may have the longwishedfor happiness of waiting on your ladyship at the leasowes in the mean time i am to return my brothers thanks with my own for every obliging instance of your regard and to subscribe myself inviolably  your ladyships most dutiful and obedient servant w shenstone p s may    i should have sent the foregoing account yesterday when it was wrote but i find nothing to add hitherto that may discolor the favorable relation i have been giving of my brothers recovery i will yet hope that there is some good in reserve for us which may in some measure compensate for the gloomy season we have past  i dont know from what quarter but i will still confide  i hope your ladyship does  i did not propose to do much about my house this year and i now shall do nothing but i know your ladyship will find some pleasure in the conjecture that the money which might have been expended upon rooms or furniture has been spent with some effect upon my brothers recovery without which the leasowes would have afforded no pleasure of one while i hope with this good weather your ladyships wonted spirits will return i hope also that i shall henceforth be able to correspond with you upon more agreeable subjects than i could of late miss dolman desired her compliments when she was here last which was about a week ago i cannot yet write with any sort of spirit so i will relieve your ladyship at once from so many insipid nothings as i should probably add if i proceeded    letter xxiii miss dolman to w shenstone esquire broom oct         sir i return you the collection of poems which you were so kind as to send me and can but acknowledge myself very much obliged to you for the perusal of them  if i did not expect the pleasure of seeing them soon again in print i should have parted with them into your hands with vast reluctance without having taken the liberty of transcribing some of them for my amusement hereafter but something whispers me in my ear that you really design those charming the elegies published in mr shenstones works vol i elegies for the press shortly and that they will no longer be concealed in the little secret box from whence i remember i was so rude as to steal them  sometime before my lord dudley sets out for london my brother and i flatter ourselves that he and miss lea will come to broom and we hope too that you and your brother will accompany them there whenever they intend us the honor of a visit  i came home from the grange so much enamoured with the concert i heard there that the desire i had before of being a performer in such a one has if possible taken a deeper root clarendon calls ambition a weed which he says is apt to grow in the best soils so i will not be wholly void of it i will be ambitious of attaining to some knowledge of two things namely music and the french language and in order to do the latter i believe my brother and i shall be so very extravagant as to have a french master attend us at broom as frequently as we have g  m to teach as music now  how do you approve of the scheme of our having two such great masters both together can you say any thing to encourage us in it or not  i beg the favor of you sir to send me your verses upon autumn where you mention poor thomsons death so feelingly i want it extremely to show miss lyttelton having promised that i would send it her a fortnight ago think of that master broom i pray you think of that alluding to an expression in falstaffs mouth in shakespeares merry wives of windsor surely my letters are always as dull as a twicetold tale yet am i so impertinent as to send you this long one without making any kind of apology for so doing  je suis monsieur votre tres humble serviteur m dolman  letter xxxiv w shenstone esquire to lady luxborough the leasowes dec  0      dear madam i had wrote to your ladyship long before this time to acknowledge the kindness of your letter and present but i have a most deplorable account to give of my delay and what so good a friend as yourself will not read without a sigh alas dear madam i have lost my only brother a more sincere or truly affectionate one never bore the name i cannot now add more though i should not want matter to expatiate upon his merit if i were not at the same time to revive and lament the loss of it he is gone before me in the very prime of his days and ere the force of his understanding or the benevolence of his heart has been half exerted or known  future letters and other conversations may afford me an opportunity to pour out all my soul at present i am not enough master of myself i find all my views intercepted my schemes measures and even my heart itself to be well nigh broken i have lost that spirit of a man which alone is able to sustain his infirmities every object round me that was once the source of my amusement revives a train of ideas that i can hardly render supportable i procure a set of low friends to chat around me and call off my attention but the greatest relief i have found since the fatal close of november is what i have drawn from stupefaction  pardon me my good lady i do not mean to make a display of my affliction i mention it that you may account for and excuse any omissions or improprieties in your unfortunate correspondent  since this unhappy catastrophe it has been my lot to hear of one that must nearly affect your ladyship believe me my honored lady i am far from an unconcerned observer of events that must afford you either pleasure or pain but i am not in a condition to receive relief and how can i pretend to give it one thing however i will suggest  i think caesar confessed at an earlier period of life than what my lord bolingbroke arrived at that he had lived enough either in regard to nature or to glory  during the height of our afflictions we can scarce believe it possible they should ever wear off in my case there are some particulars which render it improbable they should yet time we find alleviates the misfortunes of others and it is fitting we should hope implicitly that it may some how diminish our own  i will excuse your ladyship from dwelling upon the subject assure me only of the continuance of your esteem and it will be of greater service than whole volumes of philosophy  pray be so good as to write or dictate a letter to me i earnestly pray that it may be the former i am dear madam with all the tenderness of my present state of mind your  most obliged faithful and very affectionate servant w shenstone this is the third time i have begun this letter without being able to finish it till now if your ladyship will favor me with a line i hope to be able to answer it without the same difficulty  i have some thoughts of waiting on you at barrels for a week when i hear you are come down but i have had a kind of nervous fever for which i have been taking medicines this i did though i knew at the same time how ineffectual they must prove i was taking drugs from the shop to cure anxiety of the mind    letter xxxv mr whistler to w shenstone esquire whitchurch june        dear sir mr graves has lately set me right as to a mistake which otherwise i might have remained in much longer as i hope to live i had quite forgot my promise of writing to you from london and so wondered i did not hear from you but upon his mentioning it i immediately to my great confusion recollected my error i felt a great deal of uneasiness while i imagined the fault to lie at your door but i assure you much more since i find it to be at my own ingratitude is what i most abhor and i must be a monster to slight such a favor as your last to me and from such a friend pray believe me incapable of it or of possessing a serene mind while there should be any misunderstanding between you and me i am likewise sincerely concerned for the death of your brother especially as mr graves says it touched you so nearly consequently i should advise you to change the place a little after so melancholy an affair and i am sure you can find in no place one who would be more solicitous to divert you than at whitchurch i cannot ask that favor of you because i am so much in debt to you already but it would give me a double pleasure since i believe at present it might be beneficial to you for my own part i long to wait on you but my mothers state of health is so bad that i must not think of gratifying that passion this summer though i can hardly lay that hope aside or forbear saying that a small alteration in her for the better would make me pursue it i have got a little chaise which at present i am much pleased with and i assure you its wheels have a natural penchant to run to the leasowes  i wished for you much at london plays are well worth seeing now i reckon those who cannot be pleased with the present performances of the stage are too delicate ever to be pleased there are a great many very good actors and some garrick and mrs cibber acknowledged to exceed all that ever have been you must come once more into the world i mean to london i am sure it will do you good i find the benefit of it myself change of place gives me spirits for the year which i find fail me very much without  dont let us grow old if we can help it and i think variety and new scenes are the most likely to keep us young at least produce the effects of youth i own life is dull at best and therefore it is the wisest way to vary it as much as possible the most stupid vulgar both high and low find their account in this method then you must find a double pleasure in it who know how to vary it so elegantly as to entertain others as well as yourself i assure you you succeeded so well as to the first when you were here that your praises are still blooming the agreeable impression still remains on all i long to see you and hope to hear from you pray harbor no ill thought of me for if i have erred it was i assure you from mistake or forgetfulness and not with intention i never did nor ever can mean ill or disrepect to dear mr shenstone but shall ever be his most sincere friend and humble servant  a whistler the latter end of july mr perth is engaged to be with me for six weeks any time before that or after september my house will be empty if you should do me the favor i mentioned    letter xxxvi w shenstone esquire to lady luxborough the leasowes june        my conversation dear lady luxborough is by no means equal to the reception i find at barrels and if you return me thanks upon that score you make me doubly sensible how unable i am to make a due acknowledgement  the day after i left barrels i had a morning visit from admiral smith captain whood mrs stanley and her two daughters who engaged me to dine with sir g lyttelton these are ladies of taste i think but admiral smith is the delight of mankind i forgot to mention mr miller who seems to recommend my walks with great cordiality i see they condescend to look upon modern plans at hagley and if they build anew i suppose it will be in that style  since this i have seen a good deal of company more of whom arrive to see my walks than me yet i am not jealous or invidious my walks are truly more deserving of this favor  yesterday i had the company of miss lea and mr hilton a very modest and ingenious man who came with lord dudley from london besides two other parties of visitants who engrossed my whole day  and now i sit down by five in the morning to answer your queries concerning the papiermachee it is bought of mr bromwich at the goldenlion upon ludgate hill what you will want will be an ornament for the middle and four spandrells for the corners i have taken down the pineapple from the middle of my cieling and send it you to see together with some other ornaments which were never yet fixed up they will cost i mean a middle and four corner ornaments somewhere about eight shillings you may ornament it more or less though as you please as to the cracks of your cieling which i dont remember if they are not violently bad they may be mended by a common mason and the color will disguise them as for putting them up i will send you over a very agreeable neighbor of mine who was once an eminent upholsterer but now lives upon his fortune who seems glad of the opportunity it will give him to see barrels and the honor it will afford him of being serviceable to your ladyship they should be painted with flake white and thin starch but all this he will manage to your entire satisfaction he is a person of taste has seen a good deal of life and though he has had his share of difficulties always cheerful you must not offer him any thing thus have i been as short as i can in pointing out your quickest method of embellishing your cieling the whole cove except the moulding should be washed with oker but this you may defer if you please till mr pixell arrives  i beg my thanks to mrs weymondesold for her kind remembrance of me am a little fearful her visit will be too late in the year but it is in mrs weymondesolds power to make all seasons pleasing  my lord dudley will be extremely glad to wait on mr outing but he must come hither first and we will adjust the remainder  i have taken the liberty to send this by my servant girl who is desirous to see her sister and barrels and really my man is so much assistant in the way of fitting up my room which engages me that i could very ill spare him  i hope mr price is recovered by the mention you make of his going again to london i did not merely ask but wish to see him here and now i must leave your ladyship for the company of my carpenters yet am ever uniformly your ladyships most obliged  w shenstone  letter xxxvii mr h  n to w shenstone esquire c  rh  e near coventry aug         dear sir as i promised to write to you soon i hope you will excuse the haste and errors of this epistle i was almost wet through before i reached birmingham last wednesday where i eat a mouthful of dinner at my inn and proceeded to solihull there i stopped and was told by the landlady i should be too late for the races at warwick if i did not make haste i thanked her and proceeded to mr wrens who gave me a very friendly reception and asked me to stay all night which i immediately accepted we walked and talked much he praised gloom and solitude and i fine prospects not but that i told him sometimes i could relish a grave scene and lo he opens a door and turned me into the churchyard which he said was full of graves and desired me to tell you the same great alterations might be made there which he will never do next day after breakfast i took my leave and reached warwick and yesterday came hither i fear my business cannot be ended before the beginning of next week as it is assizetime and my brother is but in an indifferent state of health i have wrote thus far and find my pen can scrawl nothing but what is as insipid as myself lord willoughby de brook is dead the distemper is amongst the cattle here lord brook is at warwick and has locked up the castle gardens  i have not been at coventry yet neither do i intend to enter often into a place so diametrically opposite to those sylvan scenes i was entertained with at the leasowes oh when shall i sit down and end my days on such a spot somewhere near you the moneygetting slaves all think me mad to spend my life in idleness and wonder i have passed another year without setting up in my business sordid wretches whose only god is gold how despicable must life appear when it has past away only in collecting a heap of shining cinders my resolutions are more strongly attached than ever to retire when i come over i purpose to talk with mr shaw about palmershill which if not much out of the way i will purchase i should be glad when you meet any of the workmen you would ask now and then how they go on at northfield i hope yourself and all friends are well to whom my best devoirs from  your affectionate friend and humble servant j s h  n p s i fear lady luxborough and all your fine company will visit you before i come back pray let me hear from you if convenient i have wrote to lord dudley of whom i begged the favor to send you this adieu    letter xxxviii the duchess of somerset to lady luxborough percylodge sept      0 dear madam i am extremely sorry for the accident which prevented my having the pleasure of hearing from you and sincerely hope you have overcome all the ill effects of it you are very obliging in the concern you express for the scenes of sorrow i have passed through i have indeed suffered deeply but when i consider it is the will of god who never chastises his poor creatures but for their good and reflect at the same time how unworthy i was of these blessings which i now lament the loss of i lay my hand upon my mouth and dare not repine but i hope can with truth appeal to him in the following words questo affano ei su che non si oppone al suo santo voler chio gemo e gli affro tutti il gemiti miei chio rango and in tanto benedico il suo nome in mezzo al pianto  you are so good as to wish my solitude may afford me some amusement and as i think it a duty while it pleases god to continue us here not to let ourselves sink into a stupid and unthankful melancholy i endeavor to find out such entertainments as my retirement and my dear lords unmerited bounty will admit of i have built a porters lodge at my gate and am now turning the long drawing room into a chapel which will be finished in the gothic taste and have three fine painted windows these i had bespoke for northumberlandhouse but as its present owners do not intend that their chapel shall be in the same place that we had proposed they would not have fitted there the room where you were so good as to breakfast with us and my lords bedchamber i could not bear to go into since my irreparable misfortune and therefore with lord northumberlands advice have laid them together which will make a room of    by    i shall put up a very pretty chimneypiece in it with paper on which i shall hang my best pictures  the season for some little alterations without doors is now coming on and i intend some change in my rosary and openings in other parts of the park i have also erected a little hermitage in one of the woods near the canal whose roof is thatched and its walls of straw i read as usual and have lately been much pleased with the new edition of sullys memoirs besides this my own servant and myself have worked five crossstitch chairs and intend three more for my chapel they are a gothic mosaic in fine crimson and are to have gothic frames thus dear madam i have given you an account of my schemes and occupations my company at present consists of dr le courayet mr cowslad and my chaplain who is a modest sensible and truly pious young man the gentleman who traveled with poor lord beauchamp has been with me two months but left me yesterday what is come to lord luxborough or rather to his son and why is poor mrs wymondesold to be treated as an alien i conclude she did not marry without her fathers consent  i hear an extreme good character of your nephew lord st john which i am sure will give you pleasure i must do lord egremont the justice to tell you that it is impossible for any one to behave in a more kind and handsome manner than he has done ever since my dreadful loss but mrs o  n has never taken the least notice of me lord and lady northumberland are at present in the country and very well i am so near the end of my paper that i must only add the assurance of being dear madam  your ladyships most faithful and obedient f somerset  letter xxxix w shenstone esquire to mr  the leasowes jan      dear sir the letter with which you favored me deserves my earliest acknowledgments and will prove not a little serviceable in regard to the subscription we have in hand the whole account of that affair is as follows i had been assured by persons of veracity amongst which i may safely name lord dudley mr pixell and tho cotterel that you had generously made an offer of twenty guineas toward the addition of two new bells to our present set and that in case the parish would supply what was wanting it would be a pleasure to you sir to have your offer accepted upon this encouragement i determined to make trial what a subscription would produce and accordingly drew up a form for that purpose intending to write you an account of the undertaking so soon as i could form a conjecture of its success this i was upon the point of doing when i had the pleasure of a letter from you which nevertheless was extremely seasonable as it immediately removed a doubt that began to spread in regard to your concurrence  there is now subscribed exclusive of your benefaction the sum of fifty guineas and i make no scruple of raising twenty more by an application to such persons as have not yet been solicited be our progress what it will i purpose in a few weeks to give you a farther account of it in the mean time can assure you that the subscription will be pushed forward with all possible diligence that it may give us the earlier chance for the pleasure of your company i have only to add that the bells will never sound more agreeably than when they ring for your arrival will be heard no where more advantageously than from some parts of my farm and that you will find no one more desirous of making the country agreeable to you than  your most obedient humble servant w shenstone  letter xl mr h  to w shenstone esquire march  0      my dear friend your two last epistles of the  th and  th instant merit greater acknowledgments than the trifling return of mine i am going upon an expedition in a few hours yet must not neglect assuring you how greatly i think myself indebted to your care and informations relative to my tenants and beg if they apply to you again to tell them i have lately had a letter from mr i  who has promised me to be down at lady day and settle affairs with them all the brickmans bill is much higher than i thought it would have been believe me between lawyers and builders i am almost wearied out of my life and sincerely wish myself disengaged from them especially the former i hope they may be the last set of people applied to by you or me  the malady you complain of at present is not i conjecture so much owing to the winter as to solitude cold braces and heat relaxes could you have in winter the same round of company and enchanting scenes that you enjoy in summer your nerves would i am convinced be stronger and your spirits more alert your friends more particularly myself ought to think ourselves much obliged to you for that small palliative you administer to your languid hours in thinking of or writing to us i could cure you much better by a prescription out of madame de maintenons letters or our friend horace than by any the whole materia medica affords should these fail sappho that universal panacea might prove a restorative i think myself very happy in having this opportunity of conveying to you according to promise what she says of you in her letter to me which i shall do in her own words viz pray tell the salopian bard that it is my wish more than hope to preserve him as an admirer i would cautiously avoid losing a common philander but a son of apollo is inestimable and again the genii could not please more than virgils grove does miss h  s glass shows it perfectly in the postscript say something clever to my second poet and persuade him i should do the same myself you see how far the lady is gone only by my commendations she is a comical girl and i wish you were to see her she has promised me to visit you as soon as our new road will admit of their coach if i will escort her to the leasowes  i was somewhat surprised at being nominated for a commissioner of our new road as my residence is precarious my vote if necessary will be guided by merit and the direction of my friends as c  has been a servant to my father and recommended by you as deserving i will give him my vote if in the country my lord dudley has been applied to by captain w  for his father but declined it and was so good to declare to me he would serve c  before he saw your letter  the  who never knew me at hales met me at my lords house and requested my vote my answer was i knew so little of the affair and my coming down was so uncertain that i could not declare myself in any ones favor  mr cheek i have not lately seen mr outing and self set out this day for purfordsgreen to make a visit to our honest friend charles walker where we hope to arrive before this letter does at lombard street  my lord miss lea mrs rock and her daughter all join in compliments and good wishes to you they are in tolerable good health excepting now and then catching cold i had the pleasure of the three last to breakfast with me yesterday morning  mr o  has often been solicited by me to write to you which he sincerely says he intends when we return to london next week and with his compliments hopes you will forgive the seeming neglect he has been guilty of his going to sleep at the leasowes and my accompanying him therein has been often matter of discourse between us he declares he will soon write a panegyric upon sleep and the benefit arising from the unrestrained occupation of ones own bed  i can furnish you with few particulars concerning mrs w  s amor all i know is her husband and other people had ocular demonstration of her guilt by a servant boys boring three holes in the wainscot which were afterward cut in one i am myself sorry to see a person possessed of amiable and noble qualities so much sunk by one fatal error and much greater is her fall when the less malicious part of the world condemn her and declare her foible of no late commencement mr o  tells me mr k  though i should little have thought it wears a triste visage on this occasion and whimpers that he is much concerned  your glass is done and i have got the gold clasp back from the chasers do let me procure you something if it is but in silver which perhaps you may like as well and be money in pocket  dodsleys man told me mr grays poems would come out in about three weeks the earl of essex is a fine tragedy i have seen it and the rival brothers but do not like the plot of the last i am now reading the memoirs of sir charles goodville in two volumes they are contained in a series of letters relative to his family and i think some of them pathetic and engaging francis either has or soon will publish a new play the tragedy of eugenia replete with delicacy sentiment and pathos it was produced at drury lane under the conduct and assisted by the performance of mr garrick moore is now universally allowed to be the author of the gamester  i have heard southwell is now in place at his own trade and hope he will do well i am really glad my poor patient is happily married and hope she will not relapse any more into a bad state of health i shall be much obliged to you for the verses you promise me to mr w lyttelton and believe i shall like them full as well as those you designed for the colonel because more friendly than panegyrical  i wish to the lord as o  says i had the spirit of versification and i would exert it most superabundantly against two or three of my witty enemies and believe i shall one day endeavor to finish my birmingham verses to revenge myself on some folk in and near this town for smiling in my face and cutting my throat at the same time with a feather mrs r  is quite sick of their folly and hypocrisy and i believe nobody will ever lament the loss of their acquaintance  miss l  is i think more improved since she came to town than before and i am glad to see her address people with a little more vivacity than she used to do my lord has presented her with a fine new flowered silk sack laced linen and a pair of diamond earrings etc etc we were all last night at the concert in deanstreet soho and wish your company had added to our pleasure  upon reconnoitering my epistle i imagine it appears a mere farrago litterarum or more properly like a welsh dish called a salmagundy which hungry people may eat but not well digest and wish you may have any relish for this of mine  the most falsely esteemed polite part of the world deem long letters ridiculous and rude may they ever think so i am now at my conclusion of the fourth page and will so far avoid an apology for it that i assure you it is only want of more time that makes me conclude this with the request of as speedy and as long an answer which will still more firmly if possible unite the bonds of amity between dear sir yourself and him who is most inviolably your affectionate  and sincerely devoted friend and servant j s h  p s i shall be at home again in five or six days i should be glad of the honor of mr w  s acquaintance captain o  blames me for not traveling like an apostle as he does with one coat one shirt one pair of stockings one pair of shoes etc    letter xli w shenstone esquire to lady luxborough the leasowes april        dear madam whilst your ladyships spirits appear as perennial as your genius i have a deplorable account to give you of my own they have been in short but few degrees better than they were the last fatal winter and though i was conscious what apparent cause i gave you to be angry with my silence i could not bear the thoughts of answering so polite a letter as your last with an heart dejected and a head equally confused  les morts necrivent point says madame maintenon  and je me comptois de leur nombre  suffer me to thank you here madam for the very striking amusement i received from those letters i read them twice and as i have sullied the copy you were so good to lend me i will send another i bespoke for myself as soon as it arrives  the memoirs of lord bolingbrokes life abound too much with politics for me i believe the world also would be as well pleased with the more private anecdotes of so great a man herein your ladyship would shine and i could wish you to engage in something of this kind though ever so short if not for the public at least as an amusement to yourself and friends and a legacy to the present lord bolingbroke or whom else you should prefer  now i have begun to mention books let me finish the subject the gamester i have read no more of than what i gleaned from the quotations in the magazines i never yet had any opinion of the genius of mr moore and i hardly think i shall alter my sentiments on account of this performance the moral however must be allowed to be extremely seasonable  the earl of essex i have read the unfortunate earl of essex whose story whatever it may deserve has never yet produced a good line and now hardly ever will yet i am willing with your ladyship to make all allowances for the writer  the brothers which i have also read is a noble tragedy full of refined and elevated sentiments and generally speaking of suitable expressions i am not blind to many of its faults  but i have read nothing of late years that has affected me more  shall i beg the favor some time of borrowing  manners the book you mention to have read  i dont remember to have heard you mention any thing about voltaires last play i therefore send it  and thus ends all i have to say upon the article of books  i am truly glad to hear that you had mrs davies so long at barrels to counterwork the effects of this unjoyous season for my own part had my health permitted i could gladly have borne a part there but i have been little better in bodily health than i have been in mind and home when one is not truly well has more attractions than elysium pardon this unpolite assertion which seems to partake of selfishness and yet it is as unpolite at least to offer ones company to another when one is not pleased with it onesself i deny that penances can be done at barrels at the leasowes i have had many a winters experience they may and what adds to their severity is that they are no way meritorious  the jack was sent to cotterel to be copied in mahogany long ago it is possible your servant may find it ready to take home  i was two or three times in company with captain somerville when he went to westminsterschool i would send my compliments and an invitation if there was probability enough of his remembering me to render it proper though his goodnature alone could induce him to visit me now when there is not a grain of amusement to be expected either from my place or myself  i hear now and then of mr o  by means of my good friend mr h  they were both going last week to charles walkers villa not his cabbagegarden orne as mr graves calls his place at claverton and for which i rebuke him for fear the burlesque should spread the last i heard of o  was that he blamed mr h  for not traveling like an apostle as he did with one coat one shirt one pair of stockings one wig etc  i have promoted and accomplished the addition of two new bells to our present set toward which however i give but two guineas  i drew up a specimen or foul copy of a petition to sir george about the turnpike and so the people of our parish have both signed and sent the echantillon  pardon me if i leave half your letter unanswered you write so fluently and at the same time so correctly that i am angry at myself and yet never better pleased than when i come to subscribe myself  yours  letter xlii mr whistler to w shenstone esquire whitchurch may         dear sir nothing but ill health could have hindered me from writing to you and acknowledging the most agreeable favor of your letter i have been confined ever since christmas with that odious distemper the gout the very name of it is abominable what lengthened my confinement was that as soon as i was almost well i fell down stairs hurt the part and was again laid up but you will say i might have wrote for all this indeed i could not for one of the malicious imps of the old demon got into the forefinger of my right hand at the same time i can show the mark now  besides my mothers health has been so bad as quite to dispirit me and continues to be so else i assure you i should think of seeing the leasowes this summer but i cannot do it as things are upon any account nor should i ever forgive myself should she die in my absence all these reasons have likewise hindered my journey to london this year mr peareth too has been exceeding ill so that i may look upon this year as unfortunate both to myself and friends i hope however you have not felt the influence of this evil star that health and happiness may attend you is the interest of all that know you mine i am sure in particular and i can add that i am thoroughly sensible of it  i am an architect at present since i have been able to hop about i have amused myself that way i have been altering the disposition of my rooms and have made them more commodious as i think but i will not prejudice your judgment beforehand i have like you been at some expense this way but there are two imperfections i have to struggle with at whitchurch which never appeared at the leasowes an indifferent situation and but a secondhand head for architecture i long to see your improvements from those i have seen already lady luxborough has celebrated you as a designer very justly and very elegantly  i have got the verses and wonder you did not communicate them to me for they please me on two accounts yours and lady luxboroughs i dare say it would have given me double pleasure to have received a letter from you by the hand you proposed i am much obliged to you for your kind intention and think myself unhappy i was not in london on that account now though i cannot ask the favor with any propriety yet give me leave to say how glad i should be to see you at whitchurch this summer and whenever i have that pleasure i beg you will let me know beforehand for fear of accidents as for my part i resolve to wait on you at the leasowes as soon as ever it is in my power to do it  i have one piece of news to tell you which most likely you have heard by mr graves which is that my brother and mrs h  s are married i think they are very likely to be happy i had rather have a relation than a friend married for the last is always entirely lost you have the compliments of all this place but my own i shall always separate from the vulgar when addressed to dear mr shenstone from  his most affectionate friend and humble servant a whistler  letter xliii the duchess of somerset to lady luxborough percylodge dec         dear madam apologies between friends appear so unnecessary that if you have still the same inclination which you have formerly shown to look upon me in that light you will never again treat me with the ceremony of a formal acquaintance when you write to me you give me pleasure when you do not i love my own peace two well to fancy you are angry with me while i am not conscious of my deserving to have you so you see i do not regulate my correspondence as poor lady  did her visits which she never was to return sooner than her former ones had been repaid  i am not in the least surprised that you were pleased to return to the venerable seat of your ancestors and the abode of your first and happiest days and find nothing trivial or childish in the satisfaction you felt in seeing old faces full of gratitude for obligations long since past and by you perhaps forgot or in recalling some little lively incidents in the earliest and innocent hours of youth as for the wise and witty of the present age i know not what they would say and i do not design to hear it they will scarce visit my hermitage and i shall not leave it to visit them i hope to dispose of my house in downingstreet which i would not do if i ever intended to pass six weeks in london for i am fond of the situation but i find myself happiest in the retreat which my dear lords unmerited beneficence has made me mistress of and fixed my home upon the spot of earth i would have chose for myself every thing both within and without the house reminds me of my obligations to him and i cannot turn my eyes upon any object which is not an object of his goodness to me the satisfaction i take in adding either beauty or convenience to my habitation is greatly enhanced by the reflection that while i am adorning it i at the same time can show my value for the gift and my gratitude to the lamented giver  i have a regular and i hope a religious family my woman though she has not lived with me quite three years had before lived twentythree betwixt lord granthams and lady cowpers my housekeeper has been a servant as long the person who takes in my accounts pays the bills and overlooks the men within doors has been in the family nineteen years and the other who has lived ten has the care of the stables and every thing without i rise at seven but do not go down till nine when the bell rings and my whole family meet me at chapel after prayers we go to breakfast any friend who happens to be there myself and my chaplain have ours in the little library the rest in their respective eating rooms about eleven if the weather permits we go to walk in the park or take the air in the coach but if it be too bad for either we return to our various occupations at three we dine sit perhaps near an hour afterward then separate till we meet at eight for prayers after which we adjourn again to the library where somebody reads aloud unless some stranger comes who chooses cards until half an hour past nine when we sup and always part before eleven this to the fine world would sound a melancholy monastic life and i cannot be supposed to have chosen it from my ignorance of the splendor and gaiety of a court but from a thorough experience that they can give no solid happiness and i find myself more calmly pleased in my present way of living and more truly contented than i ever was in the bloom and pomp of my youth i am no longer dubious what point to pursue there is but one proper for the decline of life and indeed the only one worth the anxiety of a rational creature at any age but how do the fire of youth and flattery of the world blind our eyes and mislead our fancies after a thousand imaginary pleasures which are sure to disappoint us in the end  i condole with you for the loss of mr price as a faithful servant is always a valuable possession  mr shenstone does me a great deal of honor in inscribing his ode upon rural elegance to me i am persuaded he is master of the subject for i have heard from people who saw his gardens not long ago that they are the most perfect model of it  i dare say lady northumberland did not know how near she was to you or she would not have passed by without enquiring after you the newspapers will inform you that her lord supplies the place of lord waldgrave in the kings bedchamber their children i mean the two youngest were both here while they made their warwick and staffordshire tour and also till they came from bath the little boy is called algernoon after his grandpapa and is though less handsome the counterpart of his poor uncle lord beauchamp his innocence his temper and his voice are just the same and every motion of his body judge if i am fond of him  books you wish me to name you have undoubtedly read voltaires siecle de louis and madame maintenons letters i have been entertained with both he informs the head she i think instructs and may reform the heart i often regret that i had not seen her writings thirty years ago i have seen nothing in the genie of cecile except la laid aimable which i think are pretty but as for jenny jessamy betty barnes and their compeers i never buy any of them though i have looked over the two last i have named in their passage between lady northumberland and mrs kingdon i hope you will prevail with mr shenstone to let me see his ode there are some particulars in archbishop tillotsons life that may amuse you and a dialogue upon beauty by sir harry beaumont these are the only new things i have seen i have hardly room to subscribe myself  dear madam every faithfully yours f somerset i wish you as many happy years as you wish yourself    letter xliv w shenstone esquire to the rev mr graves the leasowes oct         dear mr graves after a long season of vanity and universal dissipation i return with unfeigned pleasure to a correspondence with my dearest and most familiar friends so just is your notion of the permanency of my affection and so true it is that much greater civilities than any yet shown me by the great can never alter my opinion of the valuableness of your friendship will you believe my simple assertion or shall i take pains to prove it by the very nature of things i cannot esteem it necessary  your accounts of mrs walkers death was new to me i will write to mr whistler shortly and am in hopes i shall now prevail with him to give me some weeks of his company amongst the strangers who visited my walks this summer there were three or more as their servants informed us who had recourse to these amusements on the death of their relations perhaps the sight of an old friend is no less serviceable on such occasions  your stream i find is very considerable i dare say horaces was not larger though mentioned as  fit to be called a river insomuch that neither a cooler nor a purer stream surrounded hebrus the thracian river rivo dare nomen idoneus ut nec frigidior thracum nec purior ambiat hebrum and you are mistaken in imagining that there is no notice taken of it for i assure you i have heard it commended here this summer i forget by whom you show excessive delicacy in your dislike of its running over watercresses as pot herbs pray what can at once have more beauty and more propriety supposing your stream to pass through the kitchengarden but i will not quarrel with you about the kind of aquatick if you will allow me to think nothing more pleasing than greens beneath transparent water  when i can fix upon a painter to draw me an head of lord dudley for which he promises to sit at the leasowes i will endeavor to get your picture altered though bond mr bond a painter in birmingham an artist of great taste and ability the editor of these letters is in possession of an admirable likeness of mr shenstone painted by this gentleman for which he is proud to make this public acknowledgment whose painting i have heard much celebrated made no scruple to pronounce it an admirable portrait  i am glad enough to hear of your increase of salary and begin to think a sort of affluence a little more essential to happiness than i have formerly done only remember you are thin and do not injure your constitution  i enclose you a copy of that ode to the duchess it would admit of many emendations if it does not want many corrections but i know not when it will receive either and i choose moreover to send it in the dress it wore at hagley table i would send you moreover the ode to sir rich lyttelton but that it would be grievously irksome to transcribe it at this time the antiquary character given the  is not approved i vindicated it as far as was decent for me but i believe i must exchange it for a compliment upon his humanity  sir george the dean mr lyttelton etc made me a mornings visit yesterday and took me with them to dinner at the grange sir george goes next week to london and the family will disperse  dodsley adds this winter a fourth volume to his miscellanies he wrote to me last week to beg a few copies of verses i shall send him the autumn verses and two copies that are upon my seats  oh let me haunt this etc and  oh you that bathe in courtlye bliss etc in old characters give me your opinion what else of mine and whether i shall send any copy of yours they will be read by the polite world what do you think of getting your verses upon medals inserted but he talks in his letter as if they must be sent immediately  i desire my compliments to mrs graves and am satisfied that i never can be otherwise than what i am at present  your most affectionate friend etc w shenstone excuse this villainous scrawl i am not half in spirits    letter xlv w shenstone esquire to mr h  n the leasowes oct         dear mr h  n this can prove no other than an heavy stupid letter agreeable to the present disposition of my mind the most it can pretend is to acquaint you in vulgar terms that you retain your usual place in my affection and esteem yet this may be no trivial information now you have accepted a place at court and have left your friends at liberty to form conjectures about your future conduct to continue or to dismiss you as our electors do their representatives be this as it will i confess that i rechuse you and wish that every court in europe consisted of as honest men  you are in the right to decline taking m  s if you find the scheme too expensive and as he could not have come into your service without purchasing his time out from his master i believe it will now be his point to continue with him till the expiration of his indentures  i am now in some sort of doubt concerning the management of my snuff box whether to have it repaired in the cheapest way with a figured tortoiseshell on the top and a plain tortoiseshell in the bottom or to exchange the gold of it and have a figured tortoiseshell box with a gold rim like yours with a gilt one only in the shape of an oblong square a little rounded at the corners i should have no thoughts of this but that my own seems too little and unmanly give me your opinion soon though if this latter scheme includes much expense proceed with the former if you please immediately  i desire my gold clasp and rim may be directly exchanged i shall have a new gold clasp and rim perhaps may enclose a pattern for the former before i seal this letter quaere therefore whether the man who makes it will now allow most in the exchange  i believe i shall defer the purchase of my favorite waistcoat till the spring my visitants begin to fail me though sir george lyttelton the dean and mr lyttelton were here yesterday my verdure abandons me and i have little else to do than go to sleep for the winter  pray send me the verses on miss b  r by the honorable personage as to mine you may give copies if you please but as they are not fully corrected i hope whoever has those copies will take care they be not printed i can say nothing polite at present so must defer my acknowledgments to the ladies at woolston till i write to you again  your letter to lady luxborough was promised so i think you should by all means write though i confess it appears to have been rather too long deferred  and now having spoke to the principal parts of your letter let me consider what i have to add  first then your tenant old mr p  s of the hilltop was carried in a hearse through my grounds to be buried yesterday mr i  has been two or three days in this country adjusting matters with your tenants   c  y tells me you may have your place supplied at the expense of five pounds per year if so is it not your point to come down and live at lappal i do not herein speak merely for my own sake sir george told me yesterday that he had secured me bloomers cottage i said i was obliged to him but did not ask after what manner he promised to come and dine and stay a night with me next year in the mean time i am beguiled of his dining with me by your venerable d  for having had an offer from him from mr lyttelton and the dean to take a dinner here this week the d  through his great address conveyed all these honors to the grange and tomorrow it seems sir george dines with master pearsall i remonstrated upon this to mr lyttelton at the grange in a manner pretty forcible and yet tolerably decent he excused for himself and them in a manner that made me quite satisfied with him he is an excellent young man  let these things serve as lessons to you who are a courtier not to hope from ambition to receive the  plaisir sans peine  adieu i am truly yours w shenstone  letter xlvi w shenstone esquire to the duchess of somerset june         madam i find myself at length enabled to obey your graces commands after a delay but ill expressive of the pleasure with which i received them but by some means or other the original of this ode was mislaid and it was not immediately in my power from scattered materials to give it once more the form in which it now appears  i fear it is no less requisite to make an apology for the freedom of inscribing it to your grace from the beginning in this respect i have but little to offer beside the flattering imagination that the subject might recommend it it would be no small vanity in me to presume that in regard to the more elegant amusements of a country life i had the honor to entertain the same sentiments with your grace however something of this kind i must of necessity confess if i would give a genuine account of the liberty i have taken  the additional fragment was originally intended as an episode to a much larger poem on the subject it was thrown into its present form soon after the rebellion and it is now transcribed because i would not send a vacant space in my paper wherein i had the most distant chance of contributing to your graces amusement  lady luxborough who does me the honor of communicating these trifling productions to your grace will not fail to do me the justice of declaring the singular veneration i have for your graces character she will testify with how much diffidence i offer you such imperfect compositions written at a distance from every judicious friend with too much inaccuracy by the side of meadows and streams from which little can be expected but a group of rural allusions above all she will be so obliging as to suggest how little i am influenced by any other ambition compared with that of being esteemed  madam your graces most devoted and most obedient servant w shenstone  letter xlvii the duchess of somerset to w shentone esquire piercylodge near colnebrook nov  0      sir if lady luxborough has not been so just as to let you know that she never conveyed your two excellent poems to my hand till last saturday night you must look upon me as the most ungrateful and tasteless of all mortals i have read them both over more than once with pleasure but will it not appear strange if i confess to you that the honor you have done me by the inscription of the first and a stanza or two in the poem itself has given me some pain and i shall look upon it as a very great addition to the favor if whenever my name or that of piercylodge occurs you will have the goodness to fill the blank which leaving out those words must occasion with stars dashes or any other mark you please without suspecting me of an affected or false modesty since to either of these accusations i can honestly plead not guilty the idea you have formed of my character you have taken from a partial friend whose goodnature may have and in this case certainly has warped her judgment the world in general since they can find no fault in your poem will blame the choice of the person to whom it is inscribed and draw mortifying comparisons betwixt the ideal lady and the real one but i have a more impartial judge to produce than either my friend or the world and that is my own heart which though it may flatter me i am not quite so faulty as the latter would represent me at the same time loudly admonishes me that i am still further from the valuable person lady luxborough has drawn you in to suppose me  i hope you will accept these reasons as the genuine and most serious sentiments of my mind which indeed they are though accompanied with the most grateful sense of the honor you designed me  i cannot help mentioning another copy of verses of yours which if it is not already printed i hope you will permit mr dodsley to add to his new collection and that is damons bower occasioned by the death of mr thomson if you should have mislaid the original i have a copy at your service which i will transmit either to you in case you should have a mind to look it over again or transmit it directly to mr dodsley  i am with unfeigned esteem and gratitude sir your most obliged etc f somerset  letter xlviii the duchess of somerset to lady luxborough piercylodge nov         i did indeed dear madam begin to despair of having the honor and what i felt more sensibly the pleasure of hearing from you again i am so subject to fall into errors that i was afraid some unguarded expression in my last letter might have given you offense and yet my heart bore witness how far i had been from intending it  i have been extremely ill the whole summer and for some weeks believed in great danger but by the blessing of god upon dr shaws prescriptions i am at present though lean and illfavored much better yet still obliged to be carried up and down stairs for want of strength and breath to carry myself but i have great reason to bless god for the ease i now enjoy when one comes to the last broken arches of mirzas bridge rest from pain must bound our ambition for pleasure is not to be expected in this world where i have no more a notion of laying schemes to be executed six months than i have six years hence which i believe helps to keep my spirits in an even state of cheerfulness to enjoy the satisfactions which present themselves without anxious solicitude about their duration we have lived to an age that necessarily shows us the earth crumbling under our feet and as our journey seems approaching toward the verge of life is it not more natural to cast our eyes to the prospect beyond it than by a retrospective view to recall the troublesome trifles that ever made our road difficult or dangerous methinks it would be imitating lots wife whose history is not recorded as an example for us to follow to want to look back to the miserable scene we are so near escaping from  i have spent the last three weeks most agreeably the first of them the bishop of oxford and mr talbot passed with us and had the goodness to leave miss talbot whose character i think you must have heard when they went away she is all the world has said of her as to an uncommon share of understanding but she has other charms which i imagine you will join with me in giving the preference even to that a mild and equal temper an unaffected pious heart and the most universal good will to her fellow creatures that i ever knew she censures nobody she despises nobody and whilst her own life is a pattern of goodness she does not exclaim with bitterness against vice we spent a good deal of our time in our own rooms except in the mornings but our time is a good deal broken in upon soon after nine we meet in the chapel as soon as prayers are over we go to breakfast and after that we work during which mr cowslad or my chaplain read aloud at eleven we go if the weather is tolerable to take the air for two hours at least which dr shaw insists upon my doing the moment we get out of the coach we see no more of one another till three when the dinner is punctually upon the table dinner and tea are both over by five when we retire till eight and then go to prayers after which we adjourn into the little library where we work and the gentlemen read as in the morning till supper a quarter before ten and it is a rule to be all in our rooms a quarter before eleven  we are at present very highly entertained with the history of sir charles grandison which is so vastly above pamela or clarissa that i shall not be easy till you have read it and sent me your sentiments upon it miss talbot received lady grays  somewhat omitted perhaps some remarks on grandison in a letter of six sides wrote with the greatest good sense and vivacity imaginable i fancy she is an excellent and agreeable young woman  it is now more than time to return you thanks for the trouble you have taken in conveying mr shenstones admirable poem rural elegance inscribed to the writer of this letter to me i have wrote to him this post and could not do it sooner because his letter was only dated leasowes and i could not find out his posttown without sending to mrs stanley whom i do not visit and who lives twelve miles from me i have expressed my gratitude in the best manner i am able but am under the necssity of declining the honor he intended me and have begged him to fill up the blanks with stars or what he pleases whenever my name or that of piercylodge was designed and i hope he will oblige me  you say you have been in a lethargy dear madam this must have proceeded from some oppression upon your spirits for which i have known tarwater to be a sovereign remedy and wish you would try it poor mrs w  d but since we can say nothing to her honor let us not expatiate upon her disgrace  any thing directed to be left with william phillips my porter in downingstreet will be sent to me directly  i am dear madam your ladyships most obliged and obedient humble servant f somerset  letter xlix w shenstone esquire to mr iago the leasowes jan         dear mr iago i am at a loss how to begin this letter i will not however in the usual way give you a tedious list of apologies in the front of it some account of my silence you will find dispersed throughout the letter and as for what is deficient i will depend upon your friendship  there has not been a person here since you left me of whom i could obtain the least intelligence concerning you and as an enquiry by the post was my only obvious method and as i both owed and promised you a letter at parting i do acknowledge myself to blame notwithstanding all the excuses i can make  amidst all that conflux of visitants whom i received this last season i was hardly once so happy as i was in your company i was the happier in seeing you so and if you remember i took notice at the time how little your vivacity was impaired in comparison of mine if i was then but a sorry companion it was not solitude and winter that could make me a better correspondent that gaiety and humor which you was once so partial as to discover in my letters will hardly appear again there even to the eyes of my most partial friend at least they will not enliven any letter that i write in winter yet friendship still remains friendship like the root of some perennial flower perhaps even then gathers strength in secret that it may produce a better display of its colors in the spring  this i do not pretend to be an adequate apology i know my dearest friend that you both like to see and to hear from me at all times but it proves that you have no great loss either of my letters or my company  i am as the phrase is deeply penetrated by the civility of your neighbor mr miller he took a short dinner with me once dropping sir george at mr pearsalls he could not have pleased me better he afterward breakfasted here and in general seemed fond of every opportunity of bringing good company to my hole the leasowes do you think that radway or that harbury have no attractions for me you know me too well to imagine it  but i truly am not well enough to dare to be from home friends will say you may be as free at my house as at your own and they will mean what they say but what is this to the purpose if you cannot make yourself so  i cannot pretend to give you a detail of what passed since i saw you lord d  with myself made one visit to hewell i will not say that his lordship only for i also was received in the politest manner imaginable we met mr and mrs winnington we took a trip to mr vernons where we met also mr coventry and a deal of other company all this would afford subject for conversation betwixt you and me but i must not use so much of my paper to this purpose  lord p  s piece of water should have been only a large serpentine stream i can give you many reasons i think him such a sort of character as may shine in company upon growing older he is and must be beloved already he has been here once since and talks of causing me to come and design for him in his park the plan for the house is right supposing it right to continue it his park may have many beauties i hope some time to meet you there  my ode after long delay has been sent to the duchess of somerset it has produced me two genteel letters from her grace and i am pleased with the event for some reasons which i could mention  soon after this dodsley asked me to contribute to a fourth volume of his miscellanies i meant at first to do so pretty largely but i afterward changed my mind and determined to send only little pieces i did send him several of my own some of my friends whistler and graves and some accidental pieces of yours which lay in my drawer i meant to send something of yours of my own accord if i was hurried otherwise not without applying for consent he wrote me word last week that his publication must be deferred upon account of the elections so that we shall now have time enough to meet or write upon the subject what i purposed was your linnets i owe etc dick g  s sent me the enclosed little comical fable i made some few alterations and put it into dodsleys hands be so good as to return it as i have now no other copy  some correspondence i have had this winter with mr h  n about toys and trinkets which he gets done for me in london he is by far a better friend and correspondent than a poet should you take a trip to town he would be quite proud to see you  i am like the rest of the world perusing sir charles grandison i dont know whether that world joins me in preferring the authors clarissa he wants the art of abridgment in every thing he has yet wrote  my dear friend pardon this flegmatic letter and cherish and preserve your own vivacity if occasion offers do not neglect to call upon me for my own sake and believe you have not alive a more lasting or more affectionate friend than  w shenstone  letter l the duchess of somerset to w shenstone esquire piercylodge dec         sir i would sooner have returned you my thanks for the favor of your most truly obliging letter but was afraid of being too troublesome by engaging so much of your time which you know so well how to employ to better purposes  the kind offer you made me of sending me any thing you occasionally happened to write i look upon as the highest obligation and you will greatly add to it if you will permit me to show them to a very ingenious friend of mine whose ingenuity is her least praise since the even cheerfulness of her temper the candor and integrity of her heart joined with the most unaffected and honorable piety must claim the esteem of all lovers of virtue who have the happiness of being acquainted with her you may possibly have heard of her as in her very young days some little things of her writing got abroad which were thought worthy of notice considering the age she was then of she is a granddaughter of old bishop talbots and niece to the lord chancellor of that name she has lately spent six weeks with me here and went away only last thursday  i take the liberty to send this letter without a cover as i am conscious that nothing i write is worth double postage since its only meaning is to express the regard with which i am  sir your most faithful and obliged humble servant f somerset  letter li mr h  to w shenstone esquire dear mr shenstone few people can boast a greater sensibility of the obligations conferred upon them than myself and few are i believe less able to repay them but that i may not appear quite defective in both i will endeavor to send you a long though not a very elegant epistle in return for the many obliging ones you have favored me with  my spirits like yours have a tendency toward retirement and whatever brings them into violent action is sure to destroy them no less than ten or twelve persons in different parts of the town who are lately arrived from the country have i been obliged to attend to one place or another which with my own affairs likewise have often made we wish to dwell where no one should find me out for seven years to come mr b  h was one of my visitors and brought great complaints from sappho and the ladies at w  n against me for not writing according to promise i have wrote her a very penitential letter of two sheets which i hope will make an atonement and produce an answer thus far have i wrote a week ago and by many occurrences have been prevented finishing my letter till this day when i received yours of the twelfth current to which as well as your former epistles i will scrawl forth some things by way of answer  i have at last got after having two returned a gold pencil case made to my mind for you which with the egyptian pebble and some impressions of my seals i packed up in a box and carried them myself to the whitehorse in fridaystreet last tuesday in order to go by rowleys wagon but he was gone before i arrived there which induced me to leave the box packed up in blue paper and sealed with my arms in the hands of the woman of the house who promised herself to deliver it today to old danks and hope you will receive it safe sometime next week the pebble i was obliged to return for i did not think it was made concave and unequal enough it is not quite as i would have it however it is as well as i can procure it and if it pleases you it will please me of course i saw a beautiful onyx at the lapidarys eight inches long or more and four broad it was to be cut for an etwee i have bought a sheet of china paper pink color bigger than this for one shilling and sixpence and some few prints a new pair of fine silver buckles etc  if i could be astonished at any thing it would be at the perplexity and delay of the law and to complete my amazement my attorney has presented me with a bill of costs of more than two hundred pounds positively i will leave london my scheme is this to board at l  and see no company except yourself and lord dudleys family on any account whatever do stand my friend and advise me what do in regard to settling there i propose to send down my cabinet and some other boxes very soon if you will be so good to make john tailor and samuel parkes set their merry men to work for me i will prepare to depart from london the beginning of next month must call for a few days at gorelands as being the first visiting place in my rout next oxford will detain me a little while from thence to edgehills to see mr t  n who i hear has got a living of three hundred pounds per annum lately fell to him next to coventry where i must stay a fortnight or perhaps a month then to birmingham and then to the ne plus ultra of my tours till next summer of which i can say nothing certain however i will live in spe melioris aevi in hope of better times and with sometimes your company i shall esteem myself happier than if i remained here pardon me when i confess i fear you will think me altered in many respects that i am no very elegible companion is most certain what with the intricacy of my affairs indifferent health for my pain in my breast has troubled me much of late and some other incidents i am rendered so stupid and confused that i scarce can rank myself a degree above the veriest boor in the country and when i come down i shall put a quick stop to all the intended visits from all the jackanokess and tomastiles of halesowen even though that doublefaced janus you mention were at the head of them peeping in at both doors at once i absolutely have laughed very heartily this afternoon at your odd account of the old cur whom i should take great pleasure to mortify or even to mar for he can never be mended before the d  l has him  i fear your anger against me is at this hour past eight at night at a crisis another very pestilent fit will arise worse than the former on monday which i prognosticate will go off at the same time the very instant you read this part in my letter am not i very vain to think you can so very easily forgive me i fear you will have more reason to find fault with me in the country when i shall be so much nearer to you then than i am now i do not fish for a compliment when i say i have many dark spots for a few white ones but i flatter myself you will have the goodness to bear with my foibles more than any body else be not angry at me for not enclosing this to lord d  y i write so often there and so seldom have answers that i fear his lordship will think i make too free with him i desired a few franks a while ago but have heard nothing concerning them however do make my respectful compliments at the grange when you go there i hear that miss dolman and miss millward are in london the former i have not seen and the latter i am unacquainted with  i lately contracted some acquaintance with a gentleman who is a great virtuoso he is a f r s and has a very fine collection both of medals and fossils especially the latter which he is willing to increase at the expense of the former i told him of the dudley limepitts he showed me some fossils like those you gave me from thence begs me to procure him all i could lay my hands upon and he would exchange medals for them i should be obliged to you if you meet with any more to reserve them till i come down and in the next to inform me if you are likely to procure any for me as i have promised the gentleman to visit him again soon you must not let the d  y fellow impose upon you he is ignorant though impudent the gentlemans name is b  e of swedish parents i bought some silver coins of him very cheap i saw the famous mr a pond at his house in the city who had a diamond on his finger which i think outshone the d  of e  s who i find is as a f r s an acquaintance of theirs the d  n is gone to e  r  what to say concerning miss  i know not all has been done and said and thought of by all of us that could be i pity her for her mothers as well as for her own sake and should be sorry to have her mother think her incapable of going into the world i do assure you under the veil of secrecy she is too giddy young and thoughtless as well as proud to know her own interest or even knowing it to pursue it a young lady will not bear with her and it would be somewhat difficult to introduce her to one of middle age who would strictly keep her under her eye and improve her by advice and instruction more than command for she has at school a great deal of work to very little book which i am certain makes her at her leisure hours fly to amusement rather than study do not mention this to mrs r i will talk to mrs b  concerning her  the postbell rings and i must conclude this with assuring you  i am dear sir your most affectionate and obliged j s h  march         p s i am reading the abbe de mabblys remarks upon the romans it is too concise for them who have read but little of their history i will bring it down    letter lii mr h  to w shenstone esquire dear mr shenstone my last letter will reach your hands this evening it will be very unamusing i dare say and though i snatch this moment to write i do it at the expense of postponing many other affairs but the melancholy occasion demands nay compels it  poor miss d  expired yesterday morning at three oclock dr b  and mr s  were called up to no purpose miss m  fell into violent hysterics and is now very indifferent what sad catastrophes oftentimes attend the most desirable and innocent pleasures i will say no more of this matter to you as i believe every body of her acquaintance must regret the loss of her  i saw mr crawley today who enquired after your health etc desiring his compliments to you i am by him informed that miss l  is one of mr w  s executors and will inherit great part of his fortune though the will has a caveat lodged against it which may probably cause some trouble before she can enjoy what i hope will render her independent of the world pray do you know whether lord d  is coming to town or not i hear he is  my cabinet and boxes did not go last saturday it seems but will next  when i shall follow them i know not my attorney tells me i must stay in town till my cause comes on and is over i have taken another lodging but shall not go to it till the middle of next month and even then would have you direct your letters here as usual i never shall like another lodging so well as i do this  my brother who is my principal witness is to come up in short i have little time of relaxation either to body or mind and wish i were once settled in the country your kind invitation to the leasowes obliges me much but do not press me to see company whilst i am so much happier there without by company i mean visitors whom i am unacquainted withal  sir g  l  is to be treasurer of the navy as reported people tell me i should make an interest for myself in his favor how am i to introduce myself believe me i had rather live at l  comfortably upon a little than be at any great pains to acquire much here pray write soon to  dear sir your ever affectionate j s h  brookstreet march         letter liii w shenstone esquire to mr h  march         dear mr h  i write in the utmost astonishment and confusion of spirit  i wonder mr c  did not give me some intimation of miss d  s illness before however all her relations will think themselves lastingly indebted both to him and to all beside who have contributed their kind endeavors to further her recovery we are under a terrible anxiety concerning her satisfied as i am of the abilities and vigilance of dr b  and convinced of the friendly care of her acquaintance that attend her i shall dread to look into the letter that i expect by tomorrows post god grant it may be favorable i have hopes given me tonight mr d  sends me word that the letter he received on thursday probably written after yours acquainted him that the pustules began to turn that she was then better and that they hoped the worst was past  believe me uniformly your friend but do not expect me to dwell upon many particulars tonight nor suffer any thing i have said to discourage you in your scheme of retiring into this country will not the grange or the leasowes be endurable for one half year and that the summer half year when they dress themselves afresh to please you  your cabinet nor oysters are neither yet brought me whatever be the reason leave my compliments to dear miss d  and all that attend on her send me five lines at least every post next week  adieu letter live mr h  to w shenstone esquire dear mr shenstone i really compassionate your sufferings both of body as well as mind the former the toothache i mean may perhaps soon be remedied the latter i fear must be effected by time but it is needless as well as impertinent in me to moralize to you upon this or any other unavoidable misfortune who know how to reconcile the seeming contradictions in the decrees of providence and to submit to them in a better manner than people of weaker judgments than yourself can let me have the pleasure my dear friend to find your spirits unbroken by this shock and endeavor to shake off the melancholy you are too subject to indulge to the prejudice of your health when accidents like this or sometimes less befall you i have not seen mr c  nor can i till thursday therefore do not pretend to send you any more particulars relating to the unwelcome news you have received i beg if you would have me think you well to let me hear from you immediately  i am extremely pleased with your argument upon enmity and revenge it is my own way of thinking yet i often lament that i am compelled to act contrary to it in the prosecution of my lawsuit against  the faithless guardian of my younger days and shattered fortune if any man will take my coat i must give him my cloak also this is very selfdenying doctrine and what i scarce think was intended to be literally accepted i have been these three days past attending on my attorney about settling some disagreeable truths relating to my cause and greatly wronged as i am i would forgive the author of my evils if he would restore what he unjustly detains from me and banish himself from my knowledge without calling him to account for what his extravagancy has hitherto robbed me of this i fear he will not do and selfpreservation will compel me to take all advantages i can  i am greatly concerned to think i shall not be able to come down before the end of summer i will write to mr i  to see what he can do with a  t  in order to make him quit when he meets him at birmingham am much obliged to you for the trouble you already have had and still offer to undertake to serve me  as i am in great expectations my cause will be determined this summer i would defer doing any thing material at l  till it is over unless it be putting the parlour in some repair when the tenants quit which i shall desire them by mr i  to comply with  more particulars i will mention in my next and will write next post notwithstanding franks i am told will not go after tonight adieu dear sir and let your next assure me of your being as well as i can wish you which will be the greater satisfaction  to your ever affectionate j s h  brookstreet april        letter lv mr h  to w shenstone esquire dear mr shenstone i should not have let two posts slip away since i received your last letter dated the  th instant could i have avoided such an omission i will give my reasons for so doing before i end my letter  when i reflect upon the melancholy situation of mind you labor under i think i should not indulge it it is offering an unavailable sacrifice to an irremediable misfortune i can sympathize with my friend and partake of his grief yet it is not i believe any impeachment of a compassionate temper to endeavor to remove those ideas from the mind if they impair the health of the sufferer which are too violent for it even though the object were if possible more meritorious than the greatlylamented lady who was so suddenly hurried from us however while this catastrophe is so recent i may venture to write upon a subject which i hope time will draw the veil over though not totally efface you expect it from me yet i know few particulars that have not very probably reached your ears by other hands i purposely avoided going to mr c  s by reason of the great confusion they were in till the middle of this week when i called and paid the thanks you desired both to that family and dr b  for their care and attendance mrs c  s little girl was sent out of the way and is not permitted to come home yet she has been so ill herself that it was feared she would have miscarried but is now better miss m  d came into the room while i was there and asked much after you and mr d  whom she was glad to hear was gone to d  s she desired me to remember her compliments when i wrote to you and should be glad to hear how you were in health i thought she looked a little wild and was fearful of mentioning any thing that might disorder her again they tell me she is in a manner quite well for when she was at the worst ophelia in hamlet mrs b  said could not equal her delirium  mrs b  could scarcely refrain her tears when she spoke upon the subject and it gave me great pain to hear her detail she told me the doctor left her at half an hour past ten as well as could be expected at three in the morning the nurse went down stairs miss m  dropped asleep when miss s  perceived the poor lady struggling to spit and though every assistance was immediately at hand she expired in less than five minutes the doctor returned mrs b  said so affected that he did not recover his spirits for two or three days afterward and wished often that he had never known her though every body is well satisfied with what he did miss m  in particular spoke in raptures upon the tenderness of conduct and friendly affability that appeared through his whole attendance  i will here put an end to my narration i fear i have said too much and am almost inclined not to send what i have wrote my motives for not writing sooner appear on the other side only a disagreeable hurry you will find  you may perhaps remember me to have mentioned a relation i had in norfolk of my name who always was seemingly fond of me and having no children promised to make me his heir i was sent for by a gentleman a few days ago who informed me he was dead and buried that his will was proved in the country the contents of which he knew nothing of but that the executors have sold off all his effects i wrote last tuesday to an attorney near there to whom i gave orders to seek out the executors and send me a copy of the will my time has been somewhat employed in seeking what intelligence i could amongst his acquaintance here who none of them had heard of his death i never had any great reason to expect any thing from this gentleman and i think it an abuse upon a persons credulity to amuse and deceive one with unmeaning promises and false hopes if i am disappointed i will not suffer it to grieve me one moment but forget it as soon as possible to which purpose i will if mr i  can spare me come down to the leasowes for a week or two as my cause will not come on these two months i believe  i do not find that mr coventry and mr pytts are likely to have an opposition in worcestershire therefore my appearance will not serve them much but only will prove an unnecessary expense to myself i have been importuned by many wellwishers to me to congratulate sir g  l  on his new acquired honor where would the advantage be to either i declare i would not contracted as my fortune is willingly accept a place of one hundred pounds per annum to be confined to one spot i wish i were once fixed at some certainty in the country and twice that sum should not move me i seemingly contradict myself but you understand my meaning i would not sell my liberty  let me beg you to write to me soon i hope you will be more capable of so doing than you were a while ago remember me to lord d  s family whom i wish the better part i mean success and happiness i can learn no particulars concerning mr w  s affairs miss r  dines with me tomorrow at dr b  s i am obliged to break off  believe me with every good wish for your health and welfare  dear sir your most affectionately devoted j s h  brookstreet april         p s i have wrote to i  i  at l  to quit the rooms that they may be repaired i thank you kindly for taking care of my boxes i have seen many curious fossils at mr branders who has promised me some of his duplicates i cannot procure the plates of your old box they were thrown away but i will bring something better in lieu of them when i come down  pray present my compliments to lady luxborough when you write i have not heard from sappho yet i have some fine impressions of seals given me to day and i have bought some beautiful etchings of dollabellas this week once more adieu    letter lvi w shenstone esquire to mr d  the leasowes nov         sir the arrival of your servant gave me a retrospective view of my own intolerable omissions and oppressed me with somewhat like the load of an evil conscience i must allow that appearances make against me and yet i must and will assert that there is no one has a truer respect for mr d  a deeper sense of his civilities a greater relish for his company or a more lively desire to partake of those beauties which he is daily distributing round his situation of these last miss f  f  has sometimes favored me with the greatest encomiums i am sure she knew how much i should enjoy them and might also mean them as inducements which i never yet wanted to hasten the visit i intended you at w  alas neither her pleasure in giving me these descriptions nor mine in receiving them were unmixed with pain as she was too often forced to adjoin but an indifferent account of poor miss d  s health for this and for the affliction it occasions you and mrs d  i really feel a concern that i am not satisfied to express in the ordinary forms of condolence  i have passed this summer in a series of dissipation betwixt some events disagreeable enough and others that wear at least the appearance of pleasure i have done what i must call a good deal round my place company produced new operations and new operations produced almost daily company the line of my path is now almost universally extended to the sides of hedges and together with some slighter improvements have been added two new cascades of the first of these i believe you have heard some account it is really if you will pardon such an expression from the proprietor a very great thing for the size of it  my servant has been weekly upon the point of setting out for d  house ever since the time i first heard of your return to it but as he is here much less of the footman or groom than the rivergod he has been almost continually called upon to unlock and conduct his rivulets for this fortnight indeed or three weeks last he has been less importuned on that score but then during that space arrived a visitant who is now with me in the house and till the time of whose departure was ascertained i was unable to fix a day when i could wait upon you and mrs d  i hope to do so about the middle of next week and will not fail to send tom over upon monday or tuesday if he can be of any possible service in regard to the cascades you proposed and i think his head a clear one you are welcome to command him over as often as you please i have detained your servant much beyond the time he purposed to return i can therefore only desire my best compliments to mrs d  and assure her that my muse is not less at her service and beg your acceptance of this ode to etc and would i am sure esteem it greater honor to embellish your place than mine i wish you do not find it obscure however if it discover but an ordinary talent for poetry it will discover at least a warm attachment to rural improvement with this i shall be quite contented so long as i think it has the least tendency to recommend me to mr d  s good opinion  i am dear sir yours and mrs d  s etc  letter lvii w shenstone esquire to lady luxborough the leasowes feb         dear madam i find it necessary to write to your ladyship this week not being able to endure that you should think hardly of me during the time that may elapse before i can possibly see you when i have the honor of doing so i trust that i can erase any unfavourable impressions and very fairly acquit myself of all voluntary neglect meantime let me only beg that you would suspend your accusation i wish i could fix a time for the performance of this visit but it is not in my power such weather as the present does not only numb ones limbs but extends its severity to our projects hopes and resolutions your ladyship well knows how winter affects me and have indeed yourself remarked it in the very style of my letters i am dull enough to be unworthy of a conversation much inferior to yours and if i add that i am a little peevish withal i shall do myself no injustice were it then possible to retain the same venomous or torpid qualities when arrived upon the coast of barrels i ought in common policy to confine myself at home but i have been and am confined upon a different score a kind of partitiontreaty with master d  and when this is concluded or broken off as i trust will soon be the case i shall not then draw excuses from the stupidity with which it is my fate to be visited in winter i have indeed sometimes imagined that i brightened up in your company when i had before esteemed it as impossible as that you should polish a piece of cinder or of sponge  i have expected to see dodsleys miscellany advertised six weeks ago had he allowed me but one half of this time to deliberate i could have adjusted the share we have of it much more to my own satisfaction i know but little what he has done in consequence of that discretionary power with which through mere haste i was obliged to entrust him and this possibly at a time when his own hurry was as great as mine but this i know that in all i did myself you may expect to trace the finger of stupidity precipitated  stupidity however is many an honest mans lot presumption is less excusable and it is with the utmost humility that i beg your ladyships pardon for the liberty i took in proposing what i thought might be an improvement of your verses i have only this to plead that you write these lively pieces almost extempore that you lay no stress upon them and scarce ever revise them that on these accounts only i thought it possible an expression not altogether exact might here and there escape you that finding my proposals disapproved i did all my time would allow to cause dodsley to have recourse to your original readings and if he have not done so universally as i apprehend may be the case those readings may be restored in any future impression i will resume the subject on some other occasion at present let me only mention that dodsley when he wrote to me last desired my opinion whether or no he should be thought impertinent if he presented your ladyship with a complete set of his miscellanies it seems the three first volumes are out of print at this time but will be reprinted in about a month the fourth he gives me reason to expect every day  i am particularly glad to hear that your health is tolerable during this rigorous weather as it gives me room to conceive the advantage you may derive from a better how do i long for the approach of spring methinks i could travel leagues to meet it were it possible by so doing to bring it faster on its way and yet unless it should supply me with health as well as with company with spirits as well as springflowers and in one word enliven both the farmer and the farm what would it avail the two canary birds that were given me about three weeks ago sing whilst i am writing sing from morn to night and that with all the vigor which the spring itself could inspire yet i do not half enjoy them my mind is not in tune the commencement of my spring must receive its date at barrels i am with constant attachment  your ladyships most obliged w shenstone  letter lviii w shenstone esquire to mr graves the leasowes march         dear mr graves pardon the arrival of this one more letter without a frank i have sent some covers to my lord of d  who is down and shall probably enough receive them before i write again  there is nothing that i can less forgive the world than your want of leisure do not misinterpret me or take amiss what i say i know you to be infinitely more happy than myself who am cloyed with it but it would add something to my happiness if not to your own that you had more vacant spaces or intervals of time to employ in those refined amusements for which you are so exquisitely qualified  i am in doubt whether i should add mottos to my seal or not rather cause the circumference which at present is rather of the largest to be contracted should you have struck out any thing since you wrote to me you will be so good as to let me know  as to sundials i never much affected the things themselves nor indeed any mottos with which i have seen them inscribed perhaps this indifference may arise from no very commendable sources a reflection upon my own want of proficiency in mathematics and an habitual consciousness of my own waste of time however i have often had thoughts of placing a slight one somewhere upon my premises for the sake of inscribing it with a couple of lines from virgil sed fugit interea fugit irreparabile tempus singula dum capti circumvectamur amore imitated meantime the hours the irreparable hours wing their swift flight while streams and rural bowers and love engage the mind     all the lines in virgil afford me that sort of pleasure which one receives from melancholy music and i believe i am often struck with the turn and harmony of his expression where a person less attached to these can discover no great beauty  i told you how much i was vexed that dodsley did not suffer me to avail myself of the time that passed from the correction of the proofsheets to the publication of his book he has at last sent me a copy which i received last thursday seennight i wish the last stanza of whistlers verses upon flowers had remained as he himself wrote it but being somewhat dissatisfied with the original reading and having no time left to improve it myself i left it to d  who i think has made it worse however in this respect and some others it may be proper to fix ones eye upon a subsequent impression and dodsley has acted as discreetly as it was possible for him to do considering what instructions were given him and how much was left to his discretion our contributions may be said to begin with mr somervilles address etc page  0  amongst which he has inserted two odes page  0  and  0  to which i am a stranger the song marked j s h is my neighbor mr h  s who has a pretty collection of drawings petrefactions and coins the lady of quality you know and as to all the pieces that follow you know the authors of them as well as i do i will not anticipate your own observations but i cannot help remarking that miltons il penseroso has drove half our poets crazy it has however produced some admirable odes to fancy amongst which that of wharton not in this volume i think deserves the preference and after his merricks penshurst and the ode on solitude are of the same tribe and are good the pleasures of melancholy and mariotts ode to fancy of the same tribe are indifferent there is nothing i am more pleased with than father franciss prayer mrs berkley repeated it to me in my roothouse this last summer and i think said it was mr wests i could wish i had made you some compliments in this volume for particular reasons and had resolutely done so had your own diffidence permitted me  i have now and then some thoughts of printing that ode to the duchess together with something sufficient to make a twelve or an eighteenpenny pamphlet about the time the parliament rises but not unless it sits till june as was reported and not unless you will promise me the favor of your assistance  it is the property of great delicacy to be oftentimes too diffident possibly then you may not long persevere in that manner of spelling your name which you seem at present to prefer yet is nothing so clear to me as that yourself and your relations should spell their name greaves to the end of the world  nati natorum and qui nascentur ab illis grandsons great grandsons and all your posterity   cowpers performance is all that you think it but would you see both his style and sentiments effectually demolished look into the account of books in that gentlemans magazine where it was first advertised  you will guess that i shall want impatiently to hear from you when you have received your set of books or perused them elsewhere  i am evermore affectionately yours w shenstone  letter lix w shenstone esquire to mr b  the leasowes oct      dear mr b  the affectionate letter i received from you ought to have been answered by the next post it had been so if i had pursued the dictates of a heart i will not say altogether happy in our reconciliation but more properly in the manifestation of our everundivided friendship i have had a large conflux of visitants this summer and the dissipation they have occasioned me was for the most part very agreeable but it must not be by any accession of pleasure that i attempt to excuse my unseasonable neglect of writing for pleasure i have in writing to my friends when my mind is free from anxiety and that pleasure connected with a duty i owe to friendship superior to what is claimable by any mere visitant or acquaintance yet i cannot but confess the change which a very few years have wrought in me for surely it is not long since i wearied you and the rest of my correspondents with my assiduity where i now write one letter i then wrote twenty mean while the warmth of my heart is not diminished with regard to friendship i know it from the pleasure which the receipt of your letter gave me of this kind are the only pleasures which accompany us through life they increase upon repetition and grow more lively from indulgence  vient lappetit en mangeant was i think an answer made by a french courtier to his sovereign when it was objected to him by the latter that there was no end of his importunities but whatever odd instances may be found of a perverted appetite the maxim is only universal in regard to social pleasure the case is not the same with regard to pleasures of sense it is not so even with regard to pleasures of imagination accordingly though i first embellished my farm with an eye to the satisfaction i should receive from its beauty i am now grown dependent upon the friends it brings me for the principal enjoyment it affords i am pleased to find them pleased and enjoy its beauties by reflection and thus the durable part of my pleasure appears to be at the last of the social kind  with much willingness would i have waited upon your friend colonel c  this year but for the perplexing lawsuit in which i am involved with young d  it has made me rude to my superiors deaf to all inviting offers and neglectful at once to my old friends and my new pray make my compliments to him and assure him how sensible i am of the honor he has done me another year if i live will i hope make me some amends for this by affording me an opportunity of waiting upon him and you  pray also make my compliments to mr and mrs p  and dr c  and my peace with the a  n family or any other where you visit that may mistake necessity for disrespect above all recommend me to mrs b  in the best manner you are able which i take it is by assuring her that i ever have been and am and will be while i live  dear mr b  you affectionate friend w shenstone  letter lx w shenstone esquire to mr s  the leasowes aug         dear s  i am truly glad to hear of your reception with our worthy admiral to whom i will take the first occasion of conveying my acknowledgments it is not quite clear from your letter whether you are mate or midshipman but whatever your post may be i hope and make no doubt that you will endeavor to fill it as becomes you should you happen to be continued in the admirals own ship you will have the honor to serve more immediately under the most generous man alive whose penetration will not suffer any degree of merit to escape his notice and who will allow yours the more consideration on account of his regard for me as the best means therefore of promoting your interest you will need to concern yourself little further than to deserve well and this by an uniform course of diligence and sobriety by the strictest attention to honor and your duty and by a conduct entirely free from all artifice and disguise you have an honest open countenance i do not in the least question that you will verify it in your behavior neither do i drop any of these hints as though i mistrusted your conduct i do unfeignedly believe them to be every one superfluous however it may prove a satisfaction for you to reflect that the temper which i trust is natural to you is what i think most likely to recommend you to the admiral and be assured that you shall acquire no reputation in the service which shall not be seconded by all the interest and good offices of your affectionate kinsman  w shenstone  letter lxi mr sp  to w shenstone esquire d  aug         my dear sir after a journey of above a month is it not very reasonable to allow a man of my age a month to rest himself i have been here indeed so long but visits and returning visits and business have prevented most of it from being a time of rest i am now set down to writing letters which i verily believe will take up another month for on casting up my accounts of that kind i found myself no less than fortyseven in debt a number for which i am sure you must pity me  i dont know how to thank you enough for all the pleasure we had during the week we were at the leasowes i have talked of it every day since and dream of it anights if you loved traveling as well as i do i should certainly beseech you to come and stay a month or two here at durham and i should be the more encouraged to do so because our friend mr dodsley left us quite in love with the place i dont mean the town itself but the walks about it indeed if wood and water and wildness are the things that make a place agreeable we are as must obliged to nature here and more than any town i have ever seen either at home or abroad  my obligations to you are not confined to shropshire and your delightful paradise in it but spread through all the counties that we passed and increased when we had time to set down here from your works of another kind they often gave me the greatest pleasure not only from their spirit and elegance but from the good heart that shines forth throughout them whatever excellencies a writer possesses and to whatever degree this is the true sun that gives the noblest gilding of all to his compositions and you must give me leave to say that you are the most sunshiny writer of this kind that ever warmed me  if in the first month that you cannot walk abroad you would favor me with the natural history how and why and in what order you laid out every part of your gardens it would not only be a continuation of the pleasure you have given me ever since i saw you but would be i dare say of particular use to me as a guide and assistant in many things and particularly in those two great articles of vistos and cascades what i wrote down was a mere skeleton of the ground and was only intended to enable me to take all the round of it whenever i should want to do so in my imagination but what i would beg of you is a more lively account of a place that is so much mine and every bodys favorite  i went from you to scotland as i fear too many people do with an expectation of scarce seeing any thing there worth seeing but after passing above one hundred miles of it through bad roads over mountains by cottages composed of dirt and a barren bleak country we were very agreeably surprised on our approach toward edinburgh to find ourselves in an open country well cultivated and in a noble view that struck us with double pleasure from our being used so long to see almost nothing but what was displeasing when you have coasted the pentland hills and get upon a rising you see the city all at once spread in a line before you with the castle to the right the palace and a rock the middle part of which is called arthurs seat to the left and a vast basin of water the frith of forth appearing from behind it the country near is varied with little swells and risings and studded with villas the land spreads on with a cheerful and cultivated look and the whole is terminated with a long range of hills that grow dimmer and ruder quite on to those of the highlands you may a little conceive of what an extent this view must be when i assure you that the basin of water about the middle of it does not appear at all overproportioned and yet we were assured that it was sixty miles long about thirty in the broadest part and fifteen in its opening to the sea i could say much more of this same edinburgh but i have been already rather too diffusive  when you see mr baskerville i beg my compliments to him and all the good family may you long enjoy the delicious spot you live in and may you always look upon me as a faithful friend and one of  your most affectionate humble servants j  s  p s could you send me a receipt how to build a root house in my wild abbeygrounds i have a place that asks for one loudly but we have neither any gentleman or artist here who understands any thing of that style of architecture  secondly i hope you will not forget your promise of a visit to me at b  next may  thirdly mr dodsley told me you desired me to mark any thing that i thought suspicious in your elegies and wherever i had the least feeling of any such thing in my mind i have writ it down without much reason but with great honesty i beg you would look upon them only as queries and not as assertions    letter lxii mr w  to w shenstone esquire covent garden jan         dear sir being gone for a few days to hampton court i did not receive the favor of yours so soon as you might naturally imagine consequently it was not in my power to write to you by the returning post and ever since being full of employment i deferred that pleasure till the present moment which i fear will produce little worth your attention however such as it is i give unto you  in going to hampton court i met with little or nothing curious or entertaining as indeed mere motion and horselanguage are subjects that afford no great matter for narrative as to the place it is a flat but very pleasant and has the advantage of being always dry the palace has externally little to recommend it besides bulk and in this respect it would excite the admiration of my friend dr a  who would call it a noble pile there are many grand rooms within and some fine paintings but the method of showing such places would not allow me much time to examine them the gardens are all in the dutch taste with evergreens and strait canals and some fine brass statues interspersed there is a terrass by the side of the thames a great length with a wall on one side and iron pallisades on the other which from the quantity of iron and the workmanship will deserve the approbation of those who deal in that manufacture but i think their least merit is in the place they occupy i took several walks round about and the number of gentlemens seats and neat villages in the neighborhood make it a desirable situation mr garrick has built at hampton a rotund temple in honor of shakespeare but i could not have an opportunity of seeing the inside of it the morning i was to go to london the stage was full therefore being very dry and pleasant i walked to town but taking cold that night afterward at the play i was laid up for a week on my return to covent garden i found besides your letter a card from mr d  i waited on him the next morning but had not the pleasure to find him at home he has since however been so obliging as to call on me when i told him your request which he promised to gratify he was to have dined with the mr k  s and me on sunday last but sent us word he had that morning lost some blood mr k  promises to write to you soon he gave me some of mr p  s subscriptions which i make no doubt but i shall dispose of as soon as i go abroad for not having a single article of mourning by me i am obliged to buy all new and my tailor is a man of such consequence that i have not been able to obtain the favor of mine from his hands yet  i have not seen mr dodsley some time i intend him a visit soon i have not met yet with an antinous mr k  and i shall some morning scrutinize all the shops in town it is very odd that not many nights ago i dreamt somebody had made you a present of one if that should happen to be the case hereafter i shall have more faith in dreams than ever i had before  all public diversions were stopped for a week on the death of the prince of orange how the town so long subsisted without and what new amusement served to kill time would be a subject well worth knowing there has been a successful method thought of to tax curiosity these last three weeks with the sight a famous mohawk warrior armed with his scalping knife battle axe etc and painted in the indian manner for war his body is stained mahogany but his face is made most terrific by the hand of some signpost appelles in his cheeks the red is very predominant his eyebrows owe their breadth and color to a thick stratum of lampblack and his nose is not less remarkable for a large line of sable he goes through his exercise with great expedition performs the war dance and whoop which is a noise unheard in this part of the world before all this is very fine exceeding curious etc but will not you laugh when i tell you who this formidable hero is ecce iterum crispinus mr foot and no less a man if it is not him in propria persona it is one of his agents it is certain it is no indian if it was he could not bear confinement another circumstance mr foot is missing and has not been seen since the arrival of this mohawk which gives strong proof to suspect him however be who he will he is a clever fellow and has got a great deal of money tomorrow night a new farce is to be acted at drury lane for the benefit of mr s  who has been some time confined in lukes hospital  mr g  b  is just come from bath where he left mrs p  in high spirits and mr and mrs b  mr p  is gone into warwickshire to attend a lawsuit somebody having laid claim to a part of his estate which his family have had uninterrupted possession of for above fifty years  your state of one days account is i must confess very natural and too often true particularly in some articles in return for it i am promised by some gentlemen of my acquaintance a true state of their expenses one day which from the manner of the men and way of life cannot fail of being extraordinary some choice spirits to the number of five and twenty agreed to dine at whites and the orders were get a dinner as expensive as you can possibly make it which was punctually performed and to their great surprise and mortification found that the most luxuriant dinner amounted to no more than ten pounds a man this experiment served to convince them that eating was a mean paltry enjoyment and only fit for cits and aldermen to whom they left it because it cost so little and therefore confessed the supremacy of gaming which they embraced as their summum bonum for the contrary reason  mr burkes treatise on the sublime and beautiful i read almost two years ago in his first edition the pleasure i received from the perusal will make me embrace the first opportunity i have of reading the second  quaere whether lady coventry corresponds with his idea of beautiful the study of physic certainly will produce in us admiration because when we trace the mechanism of nature philosophically as in the human body it becomes an object of the sublime every step we take in such researches fills us with amazing instances of wisdom and contrivance but in the living body nature there conceals her machinery and presents to our eyes a smooth object whose external figure is molded with such inimitable harmony such an insensible and pleasing variation from the right line together with such a delicacy and transparency in the skin that it cannot fail of exciting our ideas of beauty which as they tend to relax the solids will refine them into those of love quaere then if that love may not receive additional force in the breast of an anatomist from his previous acquaintance with the internal springs and structure of such an object and thereby the better qualified to judge of the beauty of the whole in other words may not his admiration cooperating with his love make him a more sensible and feeling observer argol the study of physic may be said if not to produce to heighten love i submit it to your decision for who can paint nature must have felt and who has felt is the best judge  i did not understand you literally that you meant what you wrote but as i am beyond what many may conceive taken up every hour of the day i intended my insinuation of my industry as a plea for any seeming neglect i might be guilty of toward my friends in not writing to them so punctually as i could wish for i have known it a maxim with many that no people had so much leisure time as those who lived in london but let it not discourage the oracle let him deal out with as liberal a hand as he pleases mysterious truths and they shall be applied to form the conduct of one who has the happiness to subscribe himself  his most affectionate friend and servant f w   letter lxiii mr h  to w shenstone esquire feb         dear sir i received the tobaccostopper which my friend mr percy bought at moodys shop and also the letter to authenticate its being made of the tree he mentioned i am also pretty well assured of the truth thereof having lately seen mr hobbs of birmingham who informs me that he has a piece of the same tree which he brought from stratford in his possession i think the wood much too spungy to carve neatly on it else should like to improve a hint that mr hobbs gave me of having a cup or little bowl with some particular scene out of one of shakespeares favorite plays carved thereon however if you will get him to procure but not at an extravagant rate any or what he can of the said mulberrytree i will have something made of it as shall make it advantageous to him for undertaking the same if he pleases i have coins of most sorts both english and foreign and some of james the first therefore do not want what seems to me to be imperfect however if that he mentions was really dug up near the tree in shakespeares garden i shall be glad to give a small matter more than the weight for it and mr hodgetts will pay for the same  i will not apologize for applying to you on this whimsical occasion as i have no other connections about your part of the world by which i could procure such a memorial of our distinguished bard when i am so happy as to be the subject of your pen next be so good as to give me your thoughts on this kind of curiosity or whatsoever else you please to call it which induces us to pay a price for a morsel of a tree planted as report says by shakespeares own hand and how far you think such a passion allowable or to frame a word nearer my meaning indulgeable i am dear sir  your very affectionate j s h  letter lxiv w shenstone esquire to mr dodsley march         dear mr dodsley i am afraid you think me negligent know then that i sat down last thursday to write you a long letter about seven oclock at night when i discovered that the post went out at that very hour i sat down to write i had immediate recourse to such consolation as the case admitted and supposed a letter received on monday morning might do near as well as one on saturday night considering that sunday intervened which must be a leisure day even for printers but in good earnest now do you think me lazy or have not you under your present dissipation an heavier complaint against my diligence you and i shall hardly agree about the means of estimating letters you conscious of your own genius are desirous to value them by their weight while i conscious of my late industry would fix their value by the number of words what pretensions pray can you suggest for so very perverse a manner of reckoning is not industry a moral virtue and are not many written words a proof of industry but though your ingenuity be even a miracle you will hardly prove it to be a moral virtue unless indeed in the way you manage it and so all your faculties are moral virtues however we less artful or less heroic personages must magnify the virtues that we have of these industry is one though perhaps this had been scarce allowed me till within these three or four months past i say that we who are the animae nil magnae laudis egentes souls little desirous of praise we the animae viles inhumata infletaque turba low souls  an unburied and unlamented multitude in other words the numerus the crowd born to consume the produce of the ground and the  nati fruges consumere if we would appear considerable pray what method can we take i know indeed but two the one of disparaging your abilities which is not quite so feasible the other of taking all occasion to magnify our own good qualities if then industry be a virtue i am possessed of it very remarkably not a moment of my time passes but i am employed either in overseeing laborers reading robinsons history of scotland writing in my paper books it is not material what but writing perplexing the birmingham artists with sketches for improvements in their manufactures which they will not understand and lastly and finally feeding my poultry my ducks my pigeons and my swans which last give me as much pleasure as what i had before gave me vexation no inconsiderable panegyric i will assure you and surely this is not only industry but an industry of a better kind than what employs the animae viles of a drawing room and now this last instance of my great industry puts me in mind of asking you a question  pray now you that are a mythologist what an absurd man you are not to jump at an invitation to come directly to the leasowes here am i like your friend aesop before ogilbys fables or like adam in our old bibles sitting once or twice a day with every created animal before me is not this the only residence for a person that is writing fables it is true this very person may contemplate better in a crowd than another in the depth of solitude you may far surpass me who thus converse with birds while he describes a sparrow from pall mall or a kingfisher from charing cross but imagination is a prodigious heightener and unless he paints them from life may he not attribute to a kingfisher much finer feathers than he in truth possesses pray take the opinion of mr spence  how i blush while i recollect that name and yet were it not for my own omissions it must revive only my most favorite ideas surely it is written in the book of fate that i shall discharge my debt within a post or two for fate evidently enough interferes or i could never have been so long silent i am almost ashamed to desire my humble respects to him and yet it is impossible for me to suppress my feelings  i must now proceed to business past six oclock once more but the post now goes out at ten if you can procure me the quarto cuts for milton it will be a very desirable favor  mr bond has made some alteration in your grove which i thought very pretty on its arrival yet perhaps he may be right enough if mr grignion can comprehend his meaning the trees he means on the wrong side the water are some of those opposite to the letter s which i have put upon the back but i am fearful of spoiling and must beg mr grignion would recompare the print with mr bonds original drawing then retouch his plate and let me have a few more proofsheets of both the prints give me one or two lines by return of post if possible  no books ready i want mallets works bound in russia leather and lettered on green pray excuse this last vile page i have wasted my time and now am utterly at a fault for it  w shenstone  letter lxv w shenstone esquire to dr percy the leasowes june        dear sir it is perhaps no uncommon case for the magnitude of a debt to prevent or at least retard every step toward a discharge in truth the many favors you have conferred upon me by the packet i have received for e  have made me ashamed of such a partial payment as my health and leisure would permit when i complain of health i mean no other than a kind of drowsihead and lentor which has somewhat infested me at this season perhaps it were better expressed by that disreputable name stupidity be that however as it may it is by this chiefly i have been disqualified from those refined sorts of amusement in which your letters and packets required me to engage  i have been expected to pass a week at shiffnal ever since the beginning of may where i was by particular appointment to meet our friend mr binnel the visit is not laid aside but will probably take place in about a fortnights time or less one pleaure i expect from it beside what i shall reap from mr pit and mr slaneys company and that turns upon the opportunity it will afford me of perusing your ovid in conjunction with mr binnel and it has been with this view in some measure that i have deferred the examination you desired me to bestow upon it in general i would wish you to make it as just to the authors sense and to your own sentiments as you can and afterward consider me as a mere music master whom you would employ to tune your harpsichord in other words as a proper person to retrench any little encroachments upon simplicity ease of style or harmony  i want to communicate many things but must defer most of them till i see you and pray let mrs percy know me for one of your peculiar friends and then i hope she will not scruple to reward me with an irregular visit by way of distinction i brought my friend jagos new bride to pay me that compliment the other day  mr dodsley in his last letter desired i would present you with his new edition of cleone which is the only one you should preserve it is according to my best calculation improved in about an hundred places merely and altered in about six i will either keep it till you come or send it to you if you will show me how  i had retouched and transcribed both the gentle herdsman and edom of gordon two pieces in dr percys collection of ancient poetry long before your letter arrived your supplemental stanzas must undoubtedly approach nearer to what was the original reading than those which i have substituted and which i will not send you now because i will multiply your inducements to visit my place in the proper season  you must by all means read dr younges new conjectures on original composition and let it deter you when you have completed ovid from engaging in any more translations i have also read the essay on the present state of learning written by a dr goldsmith whom you know and whom such as read it will desire to know la motte also has afforded me no little entertainment i read it on account of dodsley who you may remember is writing fables and who has requested me to send him my thoughts upon the subject  letter lxvi the liberal and just mention made in this letter of mr shenstone and mr dodsley will the editor presumes be a sufficient justification for having retained it  to mr dodsley at the leasowes july         dear sir i finished my peregrinations the day before you began yours for the day after my arrival at this place i called at your lodgings and was informed you set off that very morning for mr shenstones i have often thought you in many respects a man to be envied but in your present situation you are in possession of a happiness too great for mortals enjoying in one of the hottest seasons that ever was known in england the shade and coolness of the finest groves perhaps in the world rendered still more enchanting by the conversation of one of the best poets as well as one of the worthiest men of the age a certain monarch of old broke off all connection and alliance with a brother king in greece for no other reason but because the other experienced an uncommon share of felicity if his example deserved to be followed you are the man of all others whose friendship i would renounce but the truth is you cannot have more happiness than i wish you nor more i am persuaded than you deserve and therefore i will even be contented to hold on my amity with you till i have a better reason for parting with it which i am very sure i shall never be furnished with  with respect to my own travels i have little to say worth relating finding my health not equal to so long a journey as to scarborough and the weather at the same time proving extremely cold and wet i turned out of the high road at newark and crossed the country to nottingham as i found the air of the place agree with me and likewise met with an old friend who lives like a true arcadian in a little rural cottage at a short distance from the town i continued there till my return hither i saw every thing in the neighborhood worth looking at but what pleased me most was lord byrons abbey upon the forest which without doubt you have visited adieu dear sir  i am you faithful and affectionate humble servant   letter lxvii mr dodsley to w shenstone esquire oct         dear sir what apology can i make for not writing to you now for more than a month after receiving so much pleasure and so many civilities however as you too well know how easy it is for such things to happen i will make none but leave you to forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us and this would lead me to expostulate with you for not coming to bath but i forbear having many things to be pardoned in myself as well as many to deliver to you and therefore so much for apology  i have seen persfield mr morriss seat and mr spence was just come from seeing it when he arrived at bath he is much struck with it and has attempted somewhat toward a description of it i shall have a copy of his papers soon and will transmit it to you the place is certainly of the great and sublime kind most of the near views are seen below you from the top of high precipices consisting of steep rocks hanging woods the rivers severn and wye which last winds about the feet of the rocks below you in a very romantic manner almost surrounding a very pretty farm where cattle and sheep are feeding in the meadows at such a depth below your eye that they seem very much diminished the rocks are bold and numerous half covered with woods and rise almost perpendicular from the edge of the water to a surprising height forming from the great cliff a kind of double amphitheatre a gun fired from the top of this cliff creates by the reverberation of the report amongst other rocks a loud clap of thunder two or three times repeated before it dies away but even this echo conformably to the pride and grandeur of the rest of the place will not deign to answer a smaller voice than that of a musket with a culverin i suppose it would hold a noble dialogue the town of chepstow and its ruined castle appear in the near view at somewhat more than the distance of hales owen from your grove and the romantic windings of the wye are seen all the way to them except now and then that its stream is hid among the rocks and all the way below them till it is swallowed up by the severn at about two miles distance where that river is also near two miles over and from whence it extends enlarging in breadth quite down to kingroad below bristol i can conceive nothing finer than these views would be were the waters of the rivers as clear as that of the thames but alas they are so muddy that they will scarce return the images of the rocks trees and other objects that rise upon their banks the distant views are very extensive and lets the eye into parts of fourteen different counties the extent of the walks is near four miles which in about five hours time i made shift to accomplish i went from bath with a polite party of gentlemen and ladies and our three days excursion was altogether exceedingly agreeable i am this instant favored with a more particular description of the scenes and views i have attempted to describe and for your better understanding the situation of them have copied them first you enter the serpentine walks which are near four miles and a half in length from chepstow and the i view the town ii the sea and the rocks iii the two passages over the severn from england to wales where the passageboats are continually passing and repassing three avenues from which are seen iv chepstow v the church vi castle and rocks vii a confined view of the rocks and channel viii a balcony from whence are beautiful views of the river wye and its windings the rocks woods etc etc beyond description ix a seat the view the woods continued x a chinese bridge a pretty confined prospect xi a large oak with ivy and two seats under it xii a beautiful green by the wood xiii a seat under two oaks xiv a delightful shrubbery xv a cave of stone and pebbles with an extensive prospect xvi the top of the mount with the prospect of seven counties the sea the rocks berkley castle the shipping etc etc xvii a mew for pheasants with shrubberies of the finest foreign shrubs xviii a fine beech tree exceedingly large xix a druids throne and temple in a parterre xx the cave where we dined the opening before it in form of a semicircle which the prospect from thence resembles from whence are seen the rocks the wood the river with fine lawns xxi a chinese semicircle the view the river rocks and lawns berkley castle and a very extensive prospect of bristol etc etc xxii a cave with iron rails before it the view looking down a precipice the most beautiful woods imaginable xxiii an octagon temple surrounded with chinese rails from whence is a most extensive prospect of many counties with kingsroad the shipping etc etc    dr l  has favored me with six new fables which are very clever and ingenious poor mr m  has been so ill that he has done but one i have written one myself since i came home the butterfly snail and be and one mr g  gave me the tuberose and sunflower the two last i send you enclosed so that if you will favor me with half a dozen i shall have got my number i will therefore now set about writing the preface and the essay on fable and shall be glad to publish this winter that i may get them off my hands and out of my head before i am quite sick of them mr g  was so kind as to read them all over and gave me several corrections and an imitation of the squeaking pig from phaedrus mr m  is now employing himself the same way and when he has done with them dr l  will go over them again so that i shall hope they may be pretty correct i shall throw out several of the weakest of my own new ones and shall endeavor to supply their places with better  as you seemed to like the madeira i shall send by trimens wagon next monday carriage paid four dozen pints of the same which beg your acceptance believe me to be ever  dear sir sincerely and affectionately yours r dodsley p s mr spences drawing which i took to be the arcadia was only a drawing that he directed to be made at rome for a ladys monument in a garden    letter lxviii mr dodsley to w shenstone esquire dec        dear mr shenstone i suppose you have some time ago received from my brother the things you ordered i desired him to send them as also the poems for mr woodhouse to whom i beg my compliments and am sorry he had them not sooner but i had really forgot them i have been such a rambler since i came to town that i have not had time to attend to any thing i have not written a single fable since that i sent you and yet am so unreasonable as to wonder you have not sent me your half dozen i am writing an essay on fable and thinking of a preface both of which i shall desire you to take the trouble of reading and correcting as soon as i have done them however i believe i shall take your advice and not think of printing this winter i was glad to hear you had some hopes of finishing your affairs with mr d  and hope they are completed to your satisfaction i have been favored with a letter from mr wren which i answer by this post you said my lord lyttelton was to be at the admirals till after christmas but i saw him pass by in his chariot a few days ago you have given me hopes of seeing a survey of your farm i beg you will not delay what will give me so much pleasure would to god you would bring it yourself with all your verbal descriptions mottoes etc and let them be engraved and printed i wish i could hear that you was writing somewhat what think you of an elegy on the death of general wolf you know i suppose that he was to have been married to a sister of  before he went on his last expedition but that she desired it might be deferred till his return i think the scene might be laid in her chamber on the rejoicing night for the taking of quebec her friends may be supposed to have concealed his death from her and her anxiety for his welfare in the midst of the rejoicings might have a fine effect when suddenly his ghost should appear inform her of his fate and endeavor to comfort her in her affliction here is room for description reflection and the true pathetic such a story as this in your hands could not fail to be fine i wish you to try and that right soon  i have searched all the shops in london for a pan proper for the subject we talked of but in vain what think you of the enclosed sketch i think it might be mended is not the left hand raised too high  i had written thus far on saturday afternoon when your letters and plans arrived by the pennypost which determined me to stay till tuesday before i finished my letter you have now embarrassed me i have so many things to reply to that i know not where to begin i must take them as they lie  did i ever tell you of mr p  s chinese novel if i did i have quite forgot it and will therefore never own it i shall be very glad to see mr h  s picture my compliments to him and tell him i suspect he intends it as a reconciling present to miss s  i wish mr alcock would finish my two drawings for the fables as to my face it is a subject not worth considering however i will make you an impudent proposal if you will exchange faces with me when you come up to town we will both sit to the same painter notwithstanding you have taken pains to forfeit all claim to favor from mr spence i am very well satisfied the letter you promise will effectually cancel all your offenses i shall go down to him in about a month you see i give you time enough enclose it to me and i will carry it to him with one of your small plans to which i will put references at the same time i will endeavor to get the scotch paper on gardening as to my sketch of the leasowes i have not yet had time to think of it but as soon as i have finished my essay especially if you make it unnecessary for me to write any more fables by sending me your half dozen i will certainly sit down to it you see i am willing to make good bargains the duchess of somersets letters i have safe and will send them to you i am glad mr graves is going on and doubt not but the work will turn to his advantage i shall certainly not print the fables this winter and as to the essay i hope to have gone through it in about a fortnight i have read dr hawksworths adventurer on the subject in which i exactly agree with you and i have read a bad translation of la mottes essay i know nothing else on the subject worth reading when i send you my essay i beg you will give it any improvement which you may think it wants either in correcting imperfections or in supplying deficiencies i have got six more new fables from dr l   do not think that i will tamely hear my friends custard abused i shall certainly find a time to vindicate his honor and to make your proud foreigner own the superior merit of english custard  and now for your plans i am much obliged to you for sending them and if i might have my wish i would engrave the small colored one with figures of reference this should be the frontispiece to a pamphlet which should contain a description of the places and things referred to somewhat more at large than they are in this drawing together with all your mottos verses compliments etc as also a verbal description of the rising and falling of the ground the objects prospects etc all the way round in the middle of the title page i would put the last plate of virgils grove as a headpiece at the beginning of the pamphlet i would have a print of your house and at the end which should be contrived to be almost a whole page i think the chief cascade might be placed the plate should be worked off in green the road through the path round the house and the water should be afterward colored by hand think of these things and may heaven give you resolution to put them in practice  i am dear sir most affectionately yours r dodsley p s get a drawing by bond of the great cascade and of your house of a proper size and i will be at all other expense and if you have any delicacy about being the editor of this yourself i will write a short preface and sign my name to it in which i will say that i teized you into it which is no more than truth  dec     letter lxix mr dodsley to w shenstone esquire jan      0 health happiness and all the compliments of the season to dear mr shenstone i have enquired of all the spilsburys in town but i cannot find that my little drawings are yet sent up this if mr alcock be still with you i wish you would be so good as to tell him with my compliments when am i to expect an answer to my last long letter and when am i to have your half dozen fables i have sent my preface and my essay on fable to mr graves by this nights post with a desire that he will transmit them to you in a post or two when you get them i shall be very glad if you will look them carefully and critically over they are both very short and there are blank pages on one side for whatever alterations or remarks you shall favor me with i beg you will be so good as to let me have them back with your fables as soon as possible i shall not publish this winter but i want to have all my materials together that i may begin to think of disposing them in the order they are to stand  i have compliments to you from mr spence and he is much obliged to you for the survey of your farm he has never been able to get dalrymples essay on garden grounds i enclose a few lines on the leasowes if you should think them not totally unworthy of the subject i should be glad if you would please to bestow such correction upon them as you may think will tend to their good i have other matters to communicate to you and to advise with you about but you have so much upon your hands already from my last letter and this that i will not discourage you from sitting down to write to me by adding at present any thing further to your trouble  i am dear sir affectionately yours r dodsley  letter lxx w shenstone esquire to mr hull the leasowes jan        dear sir i am with you aware that the story of the spanish lady is rather too simple too destitute of matter for the generality of people who frequent the galleries of a london theater but might not some incidents of humor be extracted from the group of sailors which must necessarily be introduced in the piece there are in real life various and very striking characters among our english tars indeed much use has been made of them already and to very pleasing purposes  observe i propose or rather merely allow this violation of the simplicity of the story as a means to make it answer the purposes of emolument to you if you choose to undertake it for as far as relates to my own taste i think even in representation it could not be preserved too simple  the consideration that an author is compelled to forego in many instances his favorite intention renounce a compliance with his own judgment and even sometimes abolish the very excellencies of his genius to gratify the vitiated taste of a few noisy auditors who otherwise would condemn the work is rather melancholy and could not by any species of reason be supported except that which you advanced namely that your theaters in london are maintained in these days at a very great expense and that expense must be repaid consequently if shakespeare cannnot elicit a full house harlequin must extort it but woe the while for the state of letters and genius  such was not the genuine end and intention of a theater i for my own part look upon it as a temple raised to moral virtue the design of it is to instruct through the medium of delight to show virtue and vice in their respective colors and the business of the audience is to judge compare define to distinguish between what is given for example and what for precaution so conducted and preserved a theater truly merits the denomination i have given it but if moral is to submit to matter if fine sentiment is to give way to fine scenery it falls from the purposes for which is was originally instituted and becomes a place of show indeed but not of science  all these absurdities and misfortunes are owing to the audience and it is much to be lamented that the conductor of an useful place of amusement cannot oppose and rectify them but i clearly see he cannot your anecdote of mr garricks laudable attempt some years ago to remove from public view an annual object of indecorum and immorality and substitute a piece which however antique furnished matter for the moral hogarth to display his genius on diverts me much and would were i of any country beside england most probably astonish me as an englishman it does not the attempt was as much to the credit of mr garrick as the defeat of it was disreputable to the audience it had been a custom at both the royal theaters for many years to perform the london cuckolds on the lordmayors day mr garrick from motives of propriety endeavored to substitute the old play of eastwardhoe but the audience exploded it   this subject might i think by itself furnish matter for a tolerablysized essay and i marvel that some writer who has rather more affection for the use of a pen than myself does not adopt it a reflection on the very severe trial a dramatic writer undergoes when he offers his work to the public has frequently called forth my compassion the means to procure general approbation are so vague and precarious that i almost wonder when i hear of any one hardy enough to stand a candidate for it  my zeal in these particulars has made me deviate from the principal object of this letter which was to request you to make a little sketch of my favorite story upon dramatic principles during the course of this winter and let us deo favente when next we meet at the leasowes see how the design apappears it may be an agreeable amusement if it answers no other purpose  whether i may ever execute the elegy which mr dodsley has recommended is very uncertain though i much approve his plan suppose you were to attempt it  i have some reasons for thinking that elegy would suit your disposition and abilities the mention of dodsleys application see letter lxviii dec        to me has procured me twelve lines for which i hold myself indebted you do not tell me who they were written by so i suppose i am to ask no questions  when you get any more such original morsels your communicating them will be a kindness while i am thus a winter solitudinarian while scarce one friend my grassgrown threshold finds you can hardly conceive how much value such trifles bear  i am dear mr hull your very faithful and affectionate w shenstone  epitaph on general wolf alluded to in the preceding letter with patriot zeal inspired in youths first bloom conquest and fame adorned his early

polite favor you are particularly good in conferring so much honor on a poor prattling insignificant being like me yet however ill i may confess i deserve it in my ability to repay it i will venture to affirm that my merits if rated by the value i set on it are equal to those of any other wild female in the circle of your acquaintance but is it come to this and must i really take pen in hand and describe our little peregrinations i must for you have commanded me if i even wanted an inducement beyond your command it is at hand i mean our common friend mr hull i applied to him for counsel and he flatly says i shall be rude if i decline to obey here then my good sir take it in the best manner i am able to execute a descriptive letter and if it is badly done you must be my advocate to yourself for having drawn me into such a dilemma in short your own humane heart must make allowances for whatever is unworthy your judgment  be it known unto you then that last wednesday morning we all four you know our party got into a coach at six oclock and drove at no slow rate for we got to bristol at eight there we were met by a gentleman and a lady from the hotwell as wild and as whimsical as ourselves we are all of a spinning i can tell you we just took a bit of breakfast at bristol and then made the best of our way to aust the old passage over to wales there we dined and then after driving a long way over the rocks amongst seaweed and i cannot tell what with some difficulty we got into a stable in which we were to cross the water  a stable methinks i hear you say  why yes in truth good sir for pray what can one better compare a thing to that was littered from one end to the other with dirty straw and filled with as many horses as people oh we went most sociably over horses coach and ourselves all together this however was the worst of the bargain all the best was to come  when we arrived in wales we just took a little refreshment and then drove to chepstow remarkable for the great height of its bridge the tide rising higher by some degrees there than in any part of the three kingdoms at this place we were to sleep so we went to the best inn to get accommodations these secured we made the best of our way to persfield the seat of mr morris and such a place for the variety and beauty of its prospects i never saw  the gardens are seven miles round so our poor old lady was forced to occupy a seat just by the house and the rest of us then walked as far as our legs were able to carry us we could not compass the whole round but saw all the principal prospects to attempt describing them is impossible at least to do it with justice to their merit yet though unequal to the task i must say something the gardens are situated on the rocks i cannot call them the banks of the river wye and cut into walks in themselves excessively beautiful but the superior beauty of the views they command so entirely engrosses the eye that they can be very little heeded sometimes we look down upon the river from an eminence of near four hundred feet which winds itself round as in a semicircle the opposite side is bounded by rocks of equal height some barren and resembling the ruins of old fortifications others covered with the most pleasing variety of greens the eye can wish to behold while at the bottom cattle are feeding in the sweet pastures by the rivers side cattle we were told the creatures were which we saw but really our faith had need be strong to believe it since they appeared to our view more like hens and chickens and i do assure you one of our company took them for such  here too we saw a place called the loversleap it was at the summit of a rock full four hundred feet high from the river and i believe if used would be a certain cure for love or any other kind of trouble after having delighted our eyes as long as our feet would support us we went back to the reverend lady and one of our company being acquainted with a lady at mr morriss house we were invited to eat a bit of cake and drink a glass of wine this was a most agreeable repast after our fatigue and helped us on very notably but here methinks i hear you say alas the poor old lady she saw none of these fine sights  yes but she did sir as you shall hear we had a servant of mr morriss to attend our coach and he conducted us through various fields to some views we had not seen in the part of the gardens we walked over and from these the reverend dame feasted her eyes so you see she came in for a share of the show  we now returned to chepstow where after spending as laughable an evening as could be desired i have before told you we were all of a spinning we retired to rest a thing not at all unpleasing after the employment of the day  next morning we got into a large boat with two pair of oars and went up the river wye to a place called tinternabbey here we had the extreme pleasure of contemplating the most curious piece of ruins i ever beheld i do not believe your balbecks or palmiras can much exceed it it is the remains of a cathedral all the outside walls remain so far entire as to be a fence to keep people out but are in a cracked ruinous state most of the pillars on the inside are standing though robbed of the fine carving which adorned them yet we had some notion of their former beauty from many pieces tolerably entire which lay scattered here and there on the ground grass and wood strawberries here supply the place of a pavement except in one small part where it has not yet been broken here is discernible a very pretty kind of tile of stone the ground yellow flowered with black  the top of the church is entirely off so that birds build all around in the pillars and walls there are planted a great variety of trees in many parts of the edifice some fruit trees i myself eat three strawberries i gathered in the body of the church this place it seems was dedicated to the virgin mary and part of an image remains which still bears some resemblance to her there is likewise one of an earl of pembroke formerly lord of the place that earl who was surnamed strongbow and as tradition says who had five fingers and two thumbs on each hand one hand of the monumental figure is so perfect that we could distinguish the five fingers and two thumbs in short i never in my life saw any place so well worth visiting of its kind as this tinternabbey and we were as loath to quit it as i seem now to be of finishing my wild description  next we went to look at some iron works and saw the manner of making bar iron and drawing of wire after this we got again into our boat to return to chepstow and as we rowed along the river had the pleasure of looking up to those beautiful rocks we had looked down from in mr morriss ground this reverse of view made a second enjoyment and we were more sensible of the height of the mountains in this situation than when we were at the summit of them so delightful was this waterscene that we all wished a continuance of it this put us upon asking the master of the boat if he could safely venture to land us in england he assured us he could and then it was resolved nem con only to stop at chepstow to dine  we did so and sending our carriage and horses to the passage to be again taken over in the beforementioned stable we went on board our boat and rowed till we got into the severn and then the wind favoring us we had a most charming sail to the opposite shore here we had another piece of variety the river was not deep enough from the rocks to bring the boat to dry ground nor shallow enough to let the carriages come to us so we were all compelled to be carried out on mens shoulders  we drank tea at the old passagehouse and then drove to the hotwell bristol but made kingswestondown in our way which for the beauty of its prospects could well vie with what we had been seeing in wales next morning our first route was up to clifton where we saw mr goldneys grotto of its kind to be sure the most finished thing all description must fail to do it justice so let your imagination form the most regular elegant costly arrangement of shells it is able and it cannot go beyond the real beauty  from a part of mr goldneys garden we had a prospect i think rather superior to what we saw in wales it was if i mistake not more extensive commanding a full scope of the severn losing itself in the sea an entire and uninterrupted view of bristol and as fine a rural prospect around as the eye could wish to behold  are you not my good sir almost weary with reading i am of writing i can assure you and i fear you will not make out what i have wrote without some difficulty but my ideas of this charming scene flowed so fast i could not keep my pen in any order it run on and i must beg you to take it as it is for i have not time to write a fair copy  mr hull i take it for granted will have the happiness to deliver this scrawl of mine as he sets out for warwickshire tomorrow morning he has been endeavoring to persuade us to another jaunt incontinently and to let him guide us to the sweetest retirement in the world such he calls the leasowes that happiness is denied us at present but i trust will not be always so  i hope my good sir this implicit obedience to your commands will entitle me to some small degree of approbation and that you will continue to esteem me  your very faithful humble servant j  m   letter lxxii this letter having been unluckily mislaid is here inserted erroneously in point of date the reader will be pleased to observe it ought to have taken place page     in this volume immediately preceding letter li the duchess of somerset to lady luxborough piercylodge feb         dear madam pray never think excuse can be necessary to me about exactness in answering my letters i am always glad to hear from you when it is agreeable to you to write but am not one of those overkind friends who are for ever out of humor with those whom they rather enthrall than oblige by giving them that name as a proof i never wish to act so by my friends or am afraid of being treated so by them i will own to you i am not quite sure i should have answered your last letter so soon were it not that i am under serious concern to find how aukwardly i must have expressed myself to mr shenstone if i gave him room to believe i harbored a secret wish to have so fine a poem as his ode suppressed on the contrary i should think myself guilty of a very great crime and injustice to the public if i were to be the means of depriving them of so charming and rational an entertainment i gave him the true reasons in my letter for desiring that my own name nor that of my humble yet peaceful dwelling might be inserted you know i always envied the lot of  la vislette qui se cache sous lherbe  it is true my dear lady luxborough times are changed with us since no walk was long enough or exercise painful enough to hurt us as we childishly imagined yet after a ball or masquerade have we not come home very well contented to pull off our ornaments and fine clothes in order to go to rest such methinks is the reception we naturally give to the warnings of our bodily decays they seem to undress us by degrees to prepare us for a rest that will refresh us far more powerfully than any nights sleep could do we shall then find no weariness from the fatigues which either our bodies or our minds have undergone but all tears shall be wiped from our eyes and sorrow and crying and pains shall be no more we shall then without weariness move in our new vehicles transport ourselves from one part of the skies to another with much more ease and velocity than we could have done in the prime of our strength upon the fleetest horses the distance of a mile this cheerful prospect enables us to see our strength fail and await the tokens of our approaching dissolution with a kind of awful pleasure i will ingenuously own to you dear madam that i experience more true happiness in the retired manner of life that i have embraced than i ever knew from all the splendor or flatteries of the world there was always a void they could not satisfy a rational mind and at the most heedless time of my youth i well remember that i always looked forward with a kind of joy to a decent retreat when the evening of life should make it practicable  boadicea i have read  there is an interesting scene or two in it but there is something wanting in the management of the drama to keep up the spirits of the audience philoclea i have not seen nor have heard such a character of it as to raise my curiosity if you have not read deformity an essay by mr hay nor his religio philosophi i dont know how that last word should end i believe they will entertain you very well in their different ways the adventurer will soon be published in volumes and will be very well worth buying i doubt i must agree with mr shenstone that the style of sir charles grandison is too prolix and yet i dont know any of it i should be willing to part with except harriot byrons conversation with the oxonian in the first volume and the preparations and entertainments at sir charless wedding in the fifth  when i came home from taking the air on friday i was very agreeably surprised to find lady northumberland ready to receive me as i had no notion of her coming she had been alarmed with a false report that i had not been so well for some days as she left me i took the opportunity of showing her your letter and she desired me to make her compliments to your ladyship and tell you she keeps no servant about lady elizabeth while she is at school and at her return will think it necessary to have a person of a middle age about her such a one she now has about her little boy a pretty sort of woman who speaks french and english equally well is grave and properly behaved and i believe hopes for lady elizabeths place when her little angel of a master goes into the hands of the men his mamma took him away with her on saturday after lending him to me for a month though she is excessively fond of him because she sees he is the joy of my life he has some faint resemblance though not a good one of his poor uncle but his openness and mildness of temper are the very same her eldest boy too is a very sensible and good one he and lady greville dine with me from eaton every sunday they are here at present for two or three days on account of their being hollidays i have hardly left myself room to make mr cowslads compliments and subscribe myself dear madam  your ladyships most faithful and obedient servant f somerset  letter lxxiii mr dodsley to w shenstone esquire jan        dear mr shenstone i am very glad that with the return of spring your strength and spirits begin also to revive may they proceed and increase with the season and communicate such health and vigor to your vernal shoots as will encourage and enable them to bud blossom and bear for it is pity that fruit of so exquisite a flavor should be lost to the taste of mankind but your generosity and benevolence lead you to cultivate and improve the barren soil and sorry shrubs of your friends to the neglect of your own rich fields and more excellent plantations you will see in the critical review a character of my fables sufficient to make me excessively proud were i not inwardly checked by considering how much they owe to your correction but i ought to be proud of that and i am so they do not however yet appear to be much taken notice of but it is early days and my friends encourage me to hope that when they are known they will not be neglected i am much pleased with the further honor you have done them in getting new head and tail pieces executed and shall be very impatient till i see your list of the subjects  as to your picture you may be sure i long to receive it as it will at once adorn my room and do honor to myself and i think farther that as it will probably not be much mended by alteration the best way will be to send it up without delay but this however i leave entirely to your determination  i have applied to mr rich in behalf of mr heron but he has no vacancy in his house nor room to employ him as to mr garrick i am not on such terms at present as to ask a favor of him i have spoken also to two or three printers about mr w  but i have not yet been able to hear of any thing for him  but i will not give it up i shall be glad to know what pay he will expect  mr jennynss book will be published in about a fortnight  when mr percys will be ready is uncertain all your letters are very acceptable to me as they assure me of your friendship therefore pray write to me as often as you can though you should have nothing more to say than to give me that assurance  i am dear sir ever affectionately yours r dodsley  letter lxxiv w shenstone esquire to mr dodsley feb         dear mr dodsley i have spoken to mr l  upon the subject of his dedication and he agrees with me that there can be no properer person to procure the leave we want than mr d  suppress therefore if you please my letter to mr l  and engage mr d  as soon as ever you can to do his best offices in this affair they wait only for the plates and my lords answer before they can order his arms to be engraved i blundered in regard to l  s university a blunder so much the more unlucky as they have no masters of arts at edinburgh he was of aberdeen as to the rest you will give mr d  any proper information my letter affords you l  does not expect a present he will be perfectly satisfied if the work entitle him to any degree of lord b  s esteem and this mr d  may say should his lordship give him an opportunity perhaps it need not be mentioned that l  is a scotchman unless my lord should make particular enquiry betwixt friends i believe that having no establishment he means hereafter to ask some little matter by means of a scotch lady who is my lords relation  the smaller drawing you enclosed is really a perfect beauty and must be executed at all events when i return it which i mean to do on saturday i shall give the engraver one or two directions  i wish i could think as highly of the frontispiece in truth it does not please me and what to do i cannot tell the designer does not seem to enter into the spirit of the story and the circumstance of the shield hung upon the pillar a single pillar of the temple had been sufficient with the motto being wholly omitted throws the whole stress upon the merit of the two figures in the fore ground i am sorry to say these do not answer maecenas appears with no dignity and horaces attitude i cannot explain if the floor had been raised one step where the patron sits and his person tall or his chair embellished a little etc and if horace were shorter as his nature was his attitude no way violent and his head downcast it would perhaps have removed some of my objections but if there were no possibility of hanging a shield etc on a piece of a temple and so making the background important as the designer surely might have done yet there evidently were means of rendering it more beautiful than it appears here hayman certainly should have been the man but more of this when i write on saturday  when shall i see baptista porta as also the frontispiece only to the ornaments etc of temples and churches the verses in the london magazine are tolerably well printed though my punctuation is not observed your brother was to send me also the annual registers all except that for the year      i believe w  has or will desire your brothey to supply him with the few magazines he distributes here this letter is written amid much hurry and confusion of brain when i can really express nothing to my mind much less the esteem and affection with which i am  dear sir your most obedient w shenstone  letter lxxv mr w  to w shenstone esquire feb         sir your very obliging letter gave me great pleasure pardon my delay in not returning my thanks for that favor sooner i waited to have offered my small collection to your view at the same time which dr w  genteely excused himself from the trouble of perusing professing he had not leisure or critical skill enough to be of service to the work  when my brother received my papers at birmingham he showed them to dr h  who obligingly asked leave to show them to lord lyttelton which you will imagine was too agreeable an offer not to be accepted the doctor took them to hagley about a fortnight since to be transmitted to his lordship by admiral smith as soon as i receive them i shall immediately do myself the pleasure of sending them to the leasowes  to mr  i find myself indebted for the publication of my verses to miss l  of which and my letter to her she had given him copies i received the first intimation of that affair from you but soon after saw the same incorrect copy together with his absurd and disadvantageous account of me in two different magazines i wrote to him upon that subject he promised to retract what he had asserted upon misinformation but his letters and behavior did not appear quite equal to the amiable idea i had conceived of him i am informed by a friend in town that the same person has sent up a handsome apology to be inserted in the gentlemans magazine for february which as if it were intended purely for the satisfaction of the public and not to do justice to an injured person he did not condescend to honor me with the perusal of  i am extremely obliged to you for the trouble you took in sending a correct copy of those verses to the london magazine which i saw with much satisfaction i am also to acknowledge the favor of your friendly advice in regard to mr w  s papers what you say on that head gives me great pleasure as it entirely coincides with my own sentiments i had no thoughts of inserting those papers in my collection but looked upon them as things of a private nature intended only for the amusement of ourselves  when last i saw that gentleman he mentioned my adding those to the number i intended to print had i directly objected to it i had some reason to think it would disgust him he mentioned referring it to you which i agreed to with pleasure resolving to give it a fair chance not doubting but your judgment and delicacy would disapprove of such an addition to my little volume that is to be i have not yet wrote to mr w  but shall take an early opportunity of letting him know your opinion which cannot i think be any diminution of the pleasure he may take in his composition as it is only the subject which denies it a place in my collection  i am sir with great esteem your much obliged humble servant m w   letter lxxvi mr m  to w shenstone esquire edinburgh april         dear sir it is not in my power to express the grateful sense of the obligations i owe you for your most agreeable letter and for those valuable pieces which accompanied it and your other favors i am sensible that so late a return to such repeated marks of goodness carries with it appearances against me but as i am convinced your goodnature cannot interpret any thing harshly i hold it as almost unnecessary to assure you that neglect was not the cause of my silence that indeed would have been a fault for which i could not have forgiven myself far less could i have asked forgiveness of you the hurry of business during the winter sessions is the only excuse i shall plead in my defense which but too effectually deprived me of the pleasure of corresponding with my friends and cut me off from all communication with elegance or the fine arts  and of late an inflammation in my eyes has much distressed me which at present gives the more pain as it prevents me from the satisfaction of writing so fully as i intended and from giving you any remarks on those pearls you was so good as to send me the chief intention of this is to assure you that i have not been unmindful of your friend mr percy whose design i much approve of and the more especially as he has given you a rejecting power please to let him know that i have written to my friends every where to pick up all the ballads they can while i am searching every part in town where i suspect any thing may be found worthy of publication in a short time i hope to have it in my power to transmit you some pieces which will merit a place in his collection  although it is not without some difficulty that i now write yet i cannot leave off without letting you know how much i was delighted with your excellent verses intended for the pedestal of venus de medicis to venus venus here retired etc see the last composition in the description of the leasowes shenstone s works but all the encomiums that i can give them or your other compositions fall infinitely short of their real value the thoughts are fine and rise naturally from the subject the three first stanzas show indeed the hand of a master nor do i remember any thing of antiquity superior to them for elegance and simplicity of versification justness of sentiment or beauty of allusion nothing can be more happily imagined than the opposition of your bashful beauty to the paphian and phrygian goddess while the choice of words does honor to the truth and beauty of the sentiment the seventh is charming and the epithet meretricious conveys so striking a description of false taste and is so well adapted to the fulsome carving and gilding of chinese baubles that he must be dull indeed who is not struck by it it irks me that i am obliged to defer taking notice of the other pieces till another time  i had lately the pleasure of a visit from your friend mr cooks whose connection with you i wish i had known sooner i shall take the first opportunity of sending you the anandale bronze earth he mentioned in the mean time i have sent you a little provision of the best prestonpans snuff both toasted and untoasted in four bottles with one bottle of highland snishon and four bottle bonnets all packed in a box along with some things for our worthy friend dr roebuck at birmingham which i hope you will accept of as a small stimulus to our friendship please to let me know which sort is most agreeable that i may send you a fresh supply in due time  the good lord alemoor is just now getting the better of a tedious fit of the gout he returns you his kindest respects and bids me assure you in the strongest manner of his most cordial esteem that he would be happy to hear from you but much more to see you in this corner of the world professor smith douglas hume dr robertson now principal of our university here and many other of your friends desire me to return you their compliments centuplicated allow me a small share in your friendship and believe that i am with the utmost esteem dear sir  your much obliged and very sincere servant j m   letter lxxvii mr dodsley to w shenstone esquire sept         dear mr shenstone after i parted from you at broomsgrove i arrived very safe and speedily at worcester as i hope you did at the leasowes i found dr d  in the same infirm state of health in which he has lingered for some years past but by keeping up his spirits and his appetite by great temperance and by taking an airing regularly twice a day in his chaise for six or eight miles at a time he has so nicely trimmed his feeble lamp of life that he has prevented it from going out and may possibly preserve it burning some few years longer i employed mrs d  to get me a pot of lampreys which i sent carriage paid to be left for you at mr hodgetts i hope you received them safe and that they proved good  on the monday following i went from worcester in the birmingham stage to bristol and the next morning in a postchaise to bath i found a letter at leakes which had lain for me eight or ten days and the morning after my arrival received another both earnestly pressing my return i set out again therefore in two or three days for london where without the least fatigue on tuesday last i arrived if i can be of any service to the widow i shall be very glad but i am afraid the father is inclined to take every advantage which the law will allow him  at bath i saw mr melmoth who arrived there with his lady the day before i set out he laments very much his misfortune in missing you at the leasowes but hopes he shall have the pleasure of seeing you some time or other at bath where for the future except two or three months in the winter which he will dedicate to his friends in london he intends to reside i spent a day with mr w  who is meditating an essay on simplicity of which he showed me an imperfect plan and some few sketches of the work he considers it in sentiments language actions and works of art and i fancy will make a good performance of it i spent also a day with mr graves mr allen has built him a good additional room and a handsome school he is very earnest in his wishes that you would pursue your subscription without farther delay and desires that i will press you to it without intermission i told him i had said all i could and hoped you would proceed you are in the meridian of your fame he says and should not let your sun decline one moment before you put your work in agitation  i am dear sir with great truth affectionately yours r dodsley  letter lxxviii mr t l  to w shenstone esquire northfield oct         that the polite must ever please equally in the matter and manner is what i am not now to learn having had convincing proof of it ever since i have had the pleasing honor of being known to mr shenstone to comprehend in a nutshell a volume of ideas is the happy talent of a superior genius which those of the more minute at a distance admire but cannot attain at least in our dull profession the difficulties attending such an attempt are almost insuperable it cannot have escaped so penetrating an observation as mr shenstones that bad men examine every law with no other intention than to reap the benefits and at the same time to evade the equal contributions intended to be levied from all those who as they enjoy the benefits ought in reason to contribute their just proportions of the expenses incurred by those to whom they are indebted for those advantages against such artful and mischievous examiners it is the duty of those of our dull profession to be upon our guard and to protect by all the vigilance we are able the honest and wellmeaning from the artifices and designs of the dishonest and ungenerous few words alas however significcant are not able to effect such a security and though dullness has been the unfortunate cause of introducing a multiplicity of useless tautology in many legal transactions yet the necessary cautions requisite to protect the undesigning from the dangers of fraud from those who are the pests of society have unhappily made some repetitions necessary in many cases where a liberal interpretation and elegance of expression would point them out as unnecessary and place them in a ridiculous and indeed contemptible light in the judgment of a liberal and generous observer unacquainted with the hackneyed ways of bad and designing men but alas such men there are  such must be guarded against and to aid me in such an herculean labor to unite force and introduce at the same time dignity of expression and elegance instead of dull form i took the liberty of requesting the aid of a penshenstonian i return my very sincere thanks for the kind assistance you have been so good as to give me and as far as the cautions i am obliged to observe in order to guard against the inconveniences i have before hinted at will permit me shall profit by them and as i foresee many difficulties that may be likely to arise before the benefits we wish for from the intended act may be brought to perfection i shall take the liberty you so obligingly permit me of desiring the assistance and honor of your advice where i have occasion for it  if i was much susceptible of vanity i should have ample food for it in indulging the belief you flatter me with that a correspondence from  could give you any pleasure or entertainment but i am not yet so vain  plain facts and plain truth and sincerity are all that i can aim at in a correspondence nor can i think that simple narratives unaided with any embellishments of genius or liveliness of fancy can give pleasure to a mind so stored with brilliant ideas as mr shenstones yet permit me to assure you if you honor me with any commands i shall take a very sincere pleasure in obeying them  you have much damped the pleasing expectations i had formed of seeing you in  but i yet cannot help indulging an hope that we yet may by some happy event that may deserve your attention there be gratified with that pleasure the ensuing winter but wherever you are permit me very sincerely to wish you every felicity and to join in a particular assurance with the general assurances which i am desired to add from all this family that they are as i am  dear sir your faithful and obedient servant t l   end of the first volume
