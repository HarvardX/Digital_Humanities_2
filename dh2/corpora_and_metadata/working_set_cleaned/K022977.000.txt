sea command and roll obedient rivers through the land these honors peace to happy britain brings these are imperial works and worthy kings remarks  of taste some of our little secondhand smatterers in criticism will be apt to imagine our author ought to have wrote on taste rather than of taste as if of and on had two different significations but mr pope has declared himself in favor of of and thereby clapped a gag into the mouths of all gainsayers his hoc volo sic jubeo is sufficient to make any expression pass for standard and stet pro ratione voluntas  a it is strange etc this is a vast deal too strange to be true and the misfortune is every common observer knows it to be quite otherwise the misers enjoyment consists in hoarding up his wealth and feasting his eyes with the sight thereof our old friend horace has assured us of this almost two thousand years ago for he introduces a man of this character saying  populus me sibilat at mihi plaudo ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca   a it is less strange etc this assertion is equally weak and inconclusive the prodigal like every body else lays out his money in something which he chooses rather than the money he parts with and though perhaps his taste in painting architecture etc may not be altogether so exquisite as mr popes in philosophy or poetry yet still he certainly tastes the purchase he makes better than the purchase money for otherwise he deserves to be begged for a fool for parting with it  b not for himself he sees or hears or eats if this sentence has any meaning at all it must certainly be either that he sees or hears or eats for somebody else or that somebody else sees or hears or eats for him as for any bodys seeing or hearing for me i might not perhaps scruple it much but for any bodys eating for me i should humbly beg he would not insist upon it my stomach would never consent to it  c artists must choose etc i cannot forbear owning our author perfectly in the right here in allowing the prodigal artists to choose for him when he is incapable of choosing for himself for who in his wits would not rather employ real artists in any affair than a parcel of blunderers and blockheads  d he buys he buys who buys not the miser i hope his money is too fast locked up in his chest ever to be let loose on any such occasions nor the prodigal for he is forced to make use of other peoples eyes and ears to supply some certain deficiencies in his own who can it be then why it must certainly be the artists mentioned in the preceding line but if so why false grammar and why would not they buy have done full as well as he buys this i shall leave to be corrected in his next edition  e for topham fountain and curio what strange gentlemen must these be who cannot go to market and buy these things themselves rather than employ others as their factors and be forced to allow brokerage but the world needs not be informed at this time of day that few of these are the produce of this island how famous soever we may be for modern improvements in mechanics mathematics etc we certainly were never very famous for antiquities drawings and coins greece and italy are well known to be the grand magazines for all these and whoever has not his present residence in these parts must of necessity purchase the produce of them from second or third hands  a rare monkish manuscripts for hearne alone poor tom hearne i dare swear so polite a genius as mr pope never once strained his optic nerves with poring over one of thy monkish manuscripts robert of gloucester and jeffrey of monmouth are quite out of his way and he knows no more of florence of warcester nor the textus roffensis than a dancing master does of algebra or a lawyers clerk of divinity  but to the matter in hand  i cannot imagine mr hearne obliged to trot round the kingdom in quest of manuscripts wherever an old abbey may have stood or to travel into foreign countries wherever such books may have been dispersed at the reformation it is enough if he knows the value of them when they are brought to him and how to oblige the world with them afterward at a proper opportunity  b and books for mead this worthy gentleman has a vast and valuable library stored with all sorts of books foreign and domestic and he is not only a person of extraordinary learning himself but one of the greatest patrons and encouragers of it in this kingdom however it is not impossible but he may have bought books from second and third hands and he may very likely have some among so prodigious a collection which he has hardly deigned a reading but i hope mr popes works are none of that number though he may well save himself the trouble even of looking into them for whether mr pope knows it or no he can read homer and statius nay and chaucer and shakespeare in their originals without recourse either to a rhiming translator or a modernizer to point him out their meaning  but mead is not only famous for books but for several choice curiosities among which is his celebrated head of homer for a copy of which if i mistake not mr pope has been obliged to him to grace his odyssey  and the world tells strange stories if mr pope be not obliged for the best part of his own head to some body else who may not unlikely meet the same treatment in his next performance as these have done in this  c and rarities for sloan whether dr sloan has a full knowledge of the true value of every individual rarity in so extraordinary a collection is what neither mr pope nor i can tell  but to allege that he employs others to choose for him is as much as to say that he is unable to choose for himself or in other words that he has not judgment enough to distinguish a crocodile from a rattle snake sir hans has purchased rarities from all known parts of the globe  but must he travel to all these parts himself to pick them up an age would not bring that about and between mr pope and i he has much better business at home where he has wealth enough to purchase whatever valuable thing is offered him and has at this time the richest private collection in europe or perhaps in the universe  a than his fine wife my lord or finer whore what a spiteful insinuation is here against the poor artists that they keep their whores finer than their wives i am sorry to hear our author is a bachelor or we should see how he would manage in that important affair of life he is certainly an artist for all the world owns him a rhimer and some perhaps may look upon him as a reasoner  but these two faculties do not always go together and if they did  he is not indispensably obliged to reason his best on every little occasion rhyme may sometimes do the business full as well without it  a for what has virro painted built and planted etc what pity it is that virro did not consult our author before he went to work had he done that i dare vouch all would have been well though every thing appeared just as it does but for want of this unum necessarium for want of consulting this universal genius his paintings are monstrous his buildings barbarous his planting ridiculous and he has no taste or what is worse an ill one  b some demon whispered knights should have a taste mr pope has not half the modesty of this good natured demon who only whispered a secret softly into one knights ear  he has proclaimed it to the world how does he know now but squires and private gentlemen may put in for their respective shares if so what an inundation of taste will then break in upon us the nation will be over run with it and the government obliged at last to put a stop to it as a growing evil  c heaven visits with a taste the wealthy fool our author i think is generally supposed to be pretty rich and most people allow him to have a taste at least of something  now as heaven has visited him with a taste how ought he to bless himself that he is no fool for if he had he might have had no more wit than to have fallen to building or something as bad and thereby wasted his wealth as simply as some other people  a that never coxcomb reached magnificence when coxcombs of quality will employ fools of architects they can never reasonably expect to reach magnificence should they lay out their whole estates and indeed the case would be much the same should they take it into their heads to turn architects themselves with a design to save charges  b often have you hinted to your brother peer etc how much had the world been obliged to this noble lord if he had once generously published that grand secret to the world which he so often hinted to his brother peer in private conversation  but if he had others would have been presented with that experience which they have since purchased at so dear a rate and this lords buildings would never have been found nonpareils had not some hundreds fallen short of them out of an ambition of excelling them  c good sense which only is the gift of heaven etc this is a much greater compliment to good sense than ever one would have expected from mr pope but the truth is he has a mind to set sense and the sciences at variance by showing that they have not the least affinity with each other and insinuating that it is no great difficulty for a man to become an adept in any of the seven sciences though he was a changeling himself and his whole family had been fools for fifteen generations  a begin with sense etc it is somewhat odd that mr pope should be capable of giving so good advice to others and mind it so little himself  what a woeful beginning did he make and how miserably did he blunder between his miser and prodigal  but enough of that  i am surpised to find sense here styled the soul of every art or science when there was a strong insinuation not much above a dozen lines before that they had very little business together or in other words that sense might without any detriment to the sciencies be divorced from them and put to a separate maintenance   the seat and gardens of the lord viscount cobham in buckinghamshire  a cut wide views through mountains if ten thousand hands were employed in any work without some good head to direct them it is no wonder if they make mad or foolish work on it but how a mountain in one line should dwindle to a hill in the next without any visible means surpasses my comprehension unless it be merely to answer the measure of the verse  b you will wish your hill and sheltered seat again then he may have it he had a mountain to remove in the former line and without doubt he was at the charge of doing it now he he has only a hill to bring back and all is right again and his house in statu quo and sure less charge will bring a hill home again than would carry a mountain abroad  a the wood supports the plain i have heard of a plain supporting a wood a thousand times because the plain was below and the wood above  but how mr popes wood comes to support his plain i own myself unable to determine unless his was a subterraneous wood which supported the plain above as a convenient number of columns do a stately cupola  b his bloomy beds etc with silver quivering rills maeanderd over this is the most mysterious passage i have lately met with how in the name of goodness can silver quivering rills maeander beds over had it been maeander them through that is divide them with a winding stream it had been sense but then the next rhyme must have suffered  but now i recollect these superterraneous rills were perhaps designed for his subterraneous wood and as such i shall leave them to perform their office  a he finds at last he better likes a field that is he finds at last he likes a field better where is the poetry here where the majesty of thought the sublimity of diction  but to pass these by and proceed to the sentiment i can see no manner of wonder why a gentleman in his declining years should be tired with the diversions of his youth when we find it common for most of us to dislike those things to day which we doted on but yesterday  b his sons fine taste an opner vista loves etc the father was of the same opinion before he died if we may suppose villario and sabinus relations and believe what has been advanced half a dozen lines before but how comes his son to have a taste so much finer than his father the father planted noble gardens in his youth and delighted to walk in the fields in his old age however he had his choice and might have taken a turn in his gardens whenever he had thought fit  the son to show a specimen of his superior taste makes quick work grubs up his fathers woods and converts his thriving plants to broomsticks  a yet hence the poor are clothed etc this would certainly be a fine reflection were it not designed for the sake of a stroke of satyr in the next stanza villario is here brought upon the stage again and accused for what every wise and good man ought to applaud him namely for setting the poor to work and rather choosing to have his money circulate through the neighborhood than suffer it to lie pild up in his chests and see his poor dependants starve for want of employment  b another age shall see etc this is no more than what has ever been common to all nations in all the later ages of the world the stately palaces of the egyptian and persian monarchs lie now buried under huge heaps of dust and rubbish all the pleasant gardens of ancient rome are long since turned to a wilderness nay the very situation of several of the most renowned cities in the world are now become so obscure that travelers into those parts cannot agree where they have formerly stood  in one word the whole of the story rests here villario pleased himself with planting and gardening and by that means kept his poor neighborhood from want a descendant of his of a different taste or if mr pope pleases of a finer taste may possibly some ages hence cut down his shady woods plow up his fine walks and turn the whole to cornground again this will also be employment and bread for the neighborhood whenever it happens  and whether mr pope be sensible of it or no satyr rebounds back upon the author whenever it is pointed at a wrong object  a where all cry out what sums are thrown away etc it is somewhat strange that all should conspire with one voice to blame timons profuseness in building and what is stranger still how it came to our authors knowledge but perhaps this is only his private opinion which he has a mind to father upon the public  be that as it will any other extravagance would have produced as ill an effect and several much worse  but timon has thrown away vast sums in building  the public certainly gathered up as much as he threw away and this was no more than changing hands the whole was undoubtedly given to stonecutters carvers statuaries bricklayers carpenters joyners laborers etc all the materials too were undoubtedly the produce of our own island except a little foreign marble and some other trifles of small importance so that such a private expense is so far from being a public loss that the nation would not be one farthing the poorer if fifty such fabrics were erected every ten or a dozen years  a who but must laugh the master who but must laugh at our poet for writing such barbarous english i am really surpised to think how he suffered such an impropriety to escape him the truth is laugh at the master would have stretched the verse a syllable beyond its ordinary length for which reason he having more regard to sound than sense chose to omit the particles  b a puny insect shivering at a breeze the puny insect in this page is declared a lord in the next and it is undeniable that there may be little lords as well as great ones  every one who has the honor to be acquainted with mr pope owns him to be a fine tall proper wellshapd agreeable jolly gentleman with a constitution strong enough to enable him to defy winds and weather but how he happens here to reflect upon a little lord merely for shrinking at a fit of cold weather is what i cannot well reconcile either to good sense or good manners however if our author has here confined himself to one day a he assures us it seems a little extraordinary methinks that my lord should be taken with a shivering fit when several of his visitors were sweating upon a hot terras but if he takes in the compass of several months it is not unlikely but the whole company might shiver and sweat at different times of the year and by that means keep his lordship in countenance  a a lake behind improves the keenness of the northern wind it is not improbable that the lake mentioned here may be the same with the pond or ocean in the preceding page if so it is no great wonder it should chill the part of the house adjacent to it which our author has assured us was the north side and if the lake lay on the north side of the house then the house most certainly stood on the south side of the lake  b on every side you look behold the wall if a person could behold my lords garden wall on every side from any particular station within it is strange how it was capable of containing that down of a parterre and that ocean of a pond or how that brobdignagian palace or town of a house mentioned about half a score lines ago could lie adjacent to it  a grove nods at grove each ally has a brother etc this is the very first time i ever heard either a house or gardens condemned for regularity groves allys etc are or may be all in their proper places beautiful and agreeable and why an exact regularity should make them otherwise is impossible to know the best of all the gardens as well as fabrics of ancient times were perfectly regular and had mr pope been the designer of these i dare almost venture to assert he would either have planned them out in a regular form or every good judge would have condemned his gothic fancy  b the suffering eye inverted nature sees etc it is a thousand pities one of so exquisite a taste as mr pope is owned to be should meet with any thing disagreeable trees cut to statues are held abominable statues standing too thick detestable a dry fountain insupportable this indeed ought to have been set a playing to welcome so great a personage to lord timons villa and an unshaded summer house an unpardonable object  a and swallows roost in nilus dusty urn these printers are some of the most ignorant and withal the most selfconceited coxcombs breathing one may tell them their faults ten thousand times over yet still they will go on in a millhorse tract and commit the same blunders afresh for swallows roost in nilus dusty urn read sparrows nest in nilus dusty urn if the house was a town a brobdignagian palace or a labored quarry above ground as we are told some lines before then nothing could be more fit than niluss urn to clap up against one of the walls for a birdbottle  b just at his study door he will bless your eyes here we find my lord first of all advancing over the green on purpose to expose his person to view  and now we are told that our eyes must not be blessed with the sight till he appears at his studydoor  quere whereabouts upon the green my lords studydoor stands aliquando bonus dormitat homerus  a in books not authors curious is my lord if mr pope has thoroughly examined my lord in greek latin french italian or any other language and found him defective we may safely take his word for he has already given the world an ample specimen as well of his profound skill in languages as of his extraordinary candor and humanity but should the case prove otherwise and our author takes my lords ignorance as most of the world do his learning merely from hearsay then he will go a great way toward the forfeiting so amiable a character  it is not improbable that he may have seen the dated backs of my lords books and have made no further observations than that some of them were bound in vellum and others in pastboard but that is no argument why my lord should have looked no more upon the insides than he who perhaps was not a full half hour in the place  b for lock or milton it is in vain to look if my lord admits neither lock nor milton how can we reasonably expect he should allow mr popes works a place in his library and this cannot but be a sensible mortification to an author whose ambition prompts him to cry out with aeneas quae regio in terris nostri non plena laboris   a make the soul dance upon a jig this is a palpable mistake they are always minuet or rigadoon aires and the jig is only inserted here to suite the measure of the verse  b and bring all paradise before your eye if by this our author means either mosess or mahomets paradise nothing can be more foreign to his purpose for in the account of either of them we read not one word of silver bells musical quirks dancing souls painted cielings sprawling saints nor gilded clouds and these make up the whole of mr popes paradise which must certainly be a new one different from both the other ignotusque locus graiis simul atque latinis   a a hundred footsteps scrape the marble hall our author it seems was admitted among a vast crowd to a magnificent entertainment how well he requited his benefactor we shall see afterward  b is this a dinner no i will be sworn nor nothing like one as it has been hitherto described we have heard of nothing yet but serpents gracing the buffet and tritons spewing out water and then he calls out  is this a dinner  however i am afraid he cries out before he has occasion  c so quick retires each flying course etc now we come to a dinner in good earnest but our author very justly complains of their taking all his victuals from before him out of an excess of complaisance which indeed was intolerable to one so sharp set howbeit if ever he should have the honor to be admitted to my lords table again i would advise him to copy after his brother durfeys bright example and take a hammer and a tenpenny nail in his pocket to fix the first good plate full of meat he lays his hands on fast to the table  a and complaisantly helped to all i hate i wonder how my lords servants came to know his palate so exquisitely well as to help him to nothing but what he hated  and yet what is strange he complained but a few lines before that the courses were taken too soon away  if we hate every dish upon a table the sooner they are removed the better  but he seems resolved not to be satisfied and therefore i am really of opinion his best way would have been to have dined at home and paid my lord a visit afterward  he would hardly have been chid for coming so late  b and swear no day was ever past so ill so my lord swears too i dare affirm if all the rest of his guests were of his stamp but if the rest were of a different disposition it is not unlikely but mr pope might pass unobserved in the crowd and that may be one grand cause of his uneasiness  a you show us rome was glorious not profuse and pompous buildings once were things of use  the roman buildings were undoubtedly the most expensive upon earth but at the same time they were the least useful whatever mr pope may allege to the contrary  their most noted structures were their circi for horse and chariot races amphitheatres for combats with gladiators and wild beasts theaters for scenical diversions naumachiae for naval exercises baths temples triumphal arches monumental pillars pyramids etc all these were built in the most sumptuous and stately manner possible and it is well known that some of them were of little use to the republic some of no use and others of vast detriment as their own writers allow  b just as they are yet shall your noble rules etc this as it stands is downright nonsense yet shall your noble rules just as they are fill half the land etc that is your noble rules such as they are good or bad rough as they run shall fill  this i dare say is none of your meaning the truth is your design was to have been understood in a sense very different from what the expressions will bear your aim was to have said yet shall your noble rules as just as they are fill etc this would have been sense and something to your purpose but then it would have stretched your verse out a syllable too long and you rather chose to transgress against sense than sound however for once i will help you to an expression which shall suite you exactly just though they be yet shall   c yet shall your noble rules  fill half the land with imitating fools better by half were it for the land that my lords rules how just soever had never been published than they should add such vast numbers to the stock of fools we have already  however i hope my lord had no such design in the publication but what he did was out of a generous principle of serving his country and not with any sinister view of raising himself a name by making half the nation appear ridiculous  a proud to catch cold at a venetian door if either a roman or a gothic door would exempt the master of the house from catching cold no venetian door should ever find a place round my mansion  if otherwise i cannot imagine what business the venetian door has here since the winds roaring through long arcades would cause a man to catch cold at a door of any other form every whit as soon  a yet thou proceed be fallen arts thy care this verse is lame and wants a crutch however i shall overlook it as only a printers error be the fallen arts thy care is the true reading  b and temples worthier of the god to talk of a temple worthy of a god is unworthy any man of sense whether such an idea will go down in poetry i know not i am sure it will never do either in philosophy or divinity why should one temple be worthier of an omnipresent being than another why should a large temple suite him better than a small one a marble fabric than one of free stone or that than one of brick or timber solomon has assured us long enough ago that god dwells not in houses made with hands and though the pagans were taught that their local dieties might he confined within certain limits yet the wiser sort among them condemned the notion and christianity has not only set us free from that but a thousand other fopperies so that whoever advances such doctrine at this time of the day is making a fresh attempt to put a hook in our noses and a bridle in our lips to draw us back to paganism or which is much the same to popery  appendix thus have i given my readers a few plain remarks upon mr popes last doughty performance i shall now add mr congreves epistle to the lord viscount cobham on a subject not much different whereby the world will easily perceive that this work falls as far short of mr congreves as his ode on music did of mr drydens his pastorals of mr philipss his windsor forest of sir john denham coopers hill his first book of homer of that done by mr tickell or his dunciad of the dispensary  but what is most surprising mr pope has not once named nor so much as hinted at his patrons polite taste so well known to all mankind  numb i of retirement and taste an epistle to the right honorable the lord viscount cobham by mr congreve sincerest critic of my prose or rhyme tell how thy pleasing stowe employs thy time say cobham what amuses thy retreat or stratagems of war or schemes of state do thou recall to mind with joy or grief great marlbros actions that immortal chief whose slightest trophy raised in each campaign more than sufficed to signalize a reign does thy remembrance rising warm thy heart with glory past where thou thy self had part or do thou grieve indignant now to see the fruitless end of all thy victory to see thaudacious foe so late subdued dispute those terms for which so long they sud as if britannia now were sunk so low to beg that peace she wonted to bestow be far that guilt be never known that shame that england should retract her righful claim or ceasing to be dreaded and adored stain with her pen the luster of her sword or do thou give the winds afar to blow each vexingthought and heartdevouring woe and fix thy mind alone on rural scenes to turn the levelled lawns to liquid plains to raise the creeping rills from humble beds and force the latent springs to lift their heads on watery colums capitals to rear that mix their flowing curls with upper air or do thou weary grown these works neglect no temples statues obelisks erect but catch the morning breeze from fragrant meads or shun the noontide ray in wholesome shades or slowly walk along the mazy wood to meditate

golden age is but a dream numb ii to the author demitte auriculas at iniquae mentis asellus cum gravius dorso subit onus  hor sir if we will look a little into the conduct and custom of the world it may not appear so extraordinary as some have thought it that mr pope because he cannot be the fountain of honor to mankind should be fond of usurping the fountain of infamy and please himself with dealing out a fund of dirty promotions from that inexhaustible spring and as nothing yields a more sincere delight than to see the workings of a beneficent mind i doubt not but every good man is rejoiced to observe this great prince creating dunces upon dunces of his own free will and motion with so much alacrity and all in a due subordination it is certain i ought to be very well satisfied with my share of honors in this kingdom of dullness since the preamble to my patent is that he could not find one more fit to wear them i would not willingly act like the favorite whom shakespeare somewhere describes who being made proud by his prince advanced his pride against the power that bred it but i would rather like a grateful favorite lay out my talents in asserting the legality of my masters title to those dominions in which he exercises so free a sway and from whence he so unsparingly dispenses his promotions  and since i have mentioned shakespeare one of the tributaries by conquest made subservient to his throne i will attempt to convince unbelievers by some few instances of his prowess with what a strength of arm and fineness of head he has humbled that proud adversary to his scepter or to step out of all metaphor at once i will attempt to show with what fidelity he has performed the dull office of an editor hardly without aiming to understand his author himself or having any ambition that his readers ever should or where he does aim to show he has such a happy fatality at mistaking that we are to wish he would not explain the author into nonsense give me leave to subjoin some examples just as they occur to my observation  i much ado about nothing act   scene   sometimes fashioning them like pharoahs soldiers in the reechy painting sometimes like the god bels priests in the old churchwindow etc  mr pope is pleased to tell us that reechie signifies valuable but the poet had no intention here of complimenting the richness or value of the painting on the other hand he would speak despieably of it as of a common wallpainting as he does in another play of the story of the prodigal and the germanhunting in waterwork we may be pretty sure therefore our author wrote the reechy painting i e smokedryd exposed to weather or reeking and steaming with nastiness there are two other passages where i remember this word again occurrs in our author  coriolanus act   scene    the kitchenmaukin pins her richest lockram bout her reechy neck etc and hamlet act   scene    and let him for a pair of reechy kisses or padling in your neck etc now if reechy in either of these passages signifies valuable i shall be content to allow mr popes gloss upon the passage first quoted  ii henry viii act   scene   one sare that promises no element in such a business here we are told that element is rudiment or beginning but here again the common sense of the passage is explained away shakespeare means no more than that he is one who promises no qualifications no talents for such a business or is not in a sphere for it in these acceptations i think our poet generally uses the phrase so  merry wives of windsor act   scene   and such dawbry as this is beyond our element twelfthnight act   scene   what you would is out of my welkin i might say element but the word is overworn and again act   scene   you are idle shallow things i am not of your element  in every one of which quotations mr popes gloss would be out of the way it were not amiss perhaps that this commentator should remember a man may sometimes be out of his element  iii king lear act   scene   crack natures mould all all relations or kindred elements that compose man as mr pope expounds it but with submission the text must first be slightly amended and we shall easily come at a better explication read   all germins spill at once etc i e germina seeds of matter so again in mackbeth act   scene     though the treasure  germains spill at once that make ungrateful man of natures germins tumble all together even till destruction sicken  for so it must here like wise be corrected and to put this emendation beyond all doubt i will produce one more passage where our author not only uses the same thought again but the word that ascertains my explication into the bargain  winters tale act   scene   let nature crush the sides othearth together and mar the seeds within iv king lear act   scene    wherefore should i stand in the plague of custom and permit the nicety of nations to deprive me etc i would very willingly know as mr pope declares against his having made any innovations from what authority he has adopted this quaint word nicety it is in none of the old copies that ever i have seen and if he derives it either from mr rows edition or mr tates alteration of this play he must give me leave to except against it the old reading which i presume mr pope did not know what to make of it is true is corrupted  the curiosity of nations  but out of it i will venture to restore the poets genuine word  the courtesy of nations to deprive me etc our accurate editor might have observed that his author chooses the very term upon the like occasion in another of his plays as you like it act   scene    the courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the firstborn so in another place he substitutes it for birthright cymbelyne act   scene     aye hopeless to have the courtesy your cradle promised and for the more vulgar use of the phrase i do not doubt but mr pope may have heard that certain lands and honors are held by the courtesy of england  v measure for measure act   scene    say to thyself from their abominable and beastly touches i drink i eat away myself and live this is a very excellent instance of our editors sagacity and i wish heartily he would have obliged us with his physical solution how a man may eat away himself and live till he does this i would crave leave to substitute by conjecture   say to thyself by their abominable and beastly touches i drink i eat array myself and live i e i feed myself and put clothes on my back by exercising the vile trade of a bawd  vi twelfthnight act   scene   sir andr  o had i but followed the arts   sir tob then had thou had an excellent head of hair   sir andr why would that have mended my hair   sir tob past question for thou see it will not cool my nature  prodigious sagacity  the dialogue is of a very light strain here betwixt two foolish knights but i would be very glad to know methinks why sir andrews hair hanging lank should or should not cool sir tobys nature till i can be informed in this point i fancy we may make sense of it thus   sir andr why should that have mended my hair   sir tob past question for thou see it will not curl by nature   vii loves labor lost act   scene   this signior junio giant dwarf dan cupid some readers it is probable would have been glad to know why the poets call cupid signior junio has it an allusion to any old tale or to any charactar in any old play no such thing as there is a contrast of terms in giantdwarf so i have a great suspicion there should be in these other words if we could retrieve the true reading and why might it not have been  this seniorjunior giantdwarf dan cupid i e this old young man i am sure there is a description afterward of him in this very play which will be no bad confirmation of this conjecture  that was the way to make his godhead wax for he has been five thousand years a boy viii ibid act   scene   and why indeed naso but for smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy the jerks of invention imitary is nothing so does the hound his master etc  sagacity with a vengeance what neither osund sense true grammar right inserence pointing or meaning  then what is invention imitary invention and imitation are certainly two distinct things in short is mr pope will not merrily call it pidling i will venture to give light to this very difficult passage the speech is by a pedant who frequently throws in a word of latin amongst his english and he is here flourishing upon the merit of invention beyond that of imitation or copying after another correct it thus and all is plain and intelligible   and why indeed naso but for smelling out the odoriserous flowers of fancy the jerks of invention  imitari is nothing so does the hound his mlaster etc  imitari i e to imitate copy or follow after  ix titus andronicus act   scene   which of your hands has not defended rome and reared alost the bloody battleax writing destruction on the enemies castle sagacity again unless mr pope means an improvement of the art military by teaching us that it was ever a custom to hew down castles with a battleax or how if he should have a mind to tell us that they wore castles formerly upon their heads for defensive armor there is indeed a passage in troilus and cressida which such a commentator might take in such a sense   and diomede stand fast and wear a castle on thy head etc but as i cannot come in to this interpretation i shall venture to read the passage in andronicus thus  writing destruction on the enemies caske  a broken k in the manuscript might be mistaken for a tl and thus a castle was built at once but i think it would be something easier to split an helmet with a battleax than cut down a castle and that is one reason which induces me to propose this reading  i had designed to throw in another emendation upon the word castle but i have already transgressed the limits of a letter and there are two or three topics still behind that i have an occasion to touch upon  mr popes dunciad having lately made its appearance in so pompous a shape with notes variorum i am sorry the editor could not spare us this short scrap in a single language i am very well content to pass over the slander of his wit but ought not as i apprehend to rest silent under that of his malice in which he would fix a pretended charge of ingratitude upon me a vice i hope of all others the least ingrasted in my nature this charge is that during the space of two years while mr pope was preparing his edition of shakespeare i who had then some correspondence with him and was soliciting favors by letters did wholly conceal my design upon that author till after his publication  to one part of this accusation i have replied in a former letter in this paper to say i concealed my design is a slight mistake for i had no such certain design till i saw how incorrect an edition mr pope had given the public to the other part i think i dare securely charge my memory with all the favors that ever i ventured to ask of mr pope and i challenge him to produce my letters against me if he thinks there is any room for it the first favor that i asked was when i introduced a play upon the stage that he would assist me in a few tickets toward my benefit in about a month after this request i received my packet back with this civil excuse that he had been all the while from home and had not my parcel till it was too late to do any thing with it this i confess induced me when i put out my proposals for aeschylus to solicit mr pope for this second favor that he would please to recommend that my design if it did not interfere with his own affair of the odyssey to this mr pope replied by letter that he was glad i had undertaken this work and should be as glad to promote my interest notwithstanding his own subscription to the odyssey that his own awkwardness and indeed inability of soliciting in any kind made him quite useless to his own interest but that he might not be entirely so to mine he would ask those of his friends for me with whom he was familiar enough to ask any thing  but from that day to the publication of my shakespeare restored an interval of above two years i never received one line more from mr pope no intimation of one subscriber by his interest not even an order that i should put his own name down in my list upon this naked fact i submit the censure both of my obligations and ingratitude  the public should not have been troubled with this state of the case had not these insinuations been industriously propagated at this crisis both to hurt my interest in my subscription for my remarks on shakespeare which will now shortly appear in the world and in that play which is designed for my benefit on monday next in the theater at drury lane double falsehood it is my misfortune i can boast but of a very scanty interest and much less merit and consequently both are the more easily to be shocked i had no method but this of appealing to those many whom i have not the honor of approaching for their favor and of humbly hoping it the rather because all my poor attempts in writing are calculated to entertain and none at the expense of
