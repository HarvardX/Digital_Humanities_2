the bastard a poem  by mr richard savage  the bastard a poem inscribed with all due reverence to mrs bret once countess of macclesfield  by richard savage son of the late earl rivers  decet haec dare dona novercam ov met dublin printed by s powell for t benson at shakespeares head in castlestreet and p crampton at addisons head opposite to the horseguard in dames street       the preface the reader will easily perceive these verses were begun when my heart was gayer than it has been of late and finished in hours of the deepest melancholy  i hope the world will do me the justice to believe that no part of this flows from any real anger against the lady to whom it is inscribed whatever undeserved severities i may have received at her hands would she deal so heartily as to acknowledge truth she very well knows by an experience of many years that i have ever behaved myself toward her like one who thought it his duty to support with patience all afflictions from that quarter indeed if i had not been capable of forgiving a mother i must have blushed to receive pardon myself at the hands of my sovereign  neither to say truth were the manner of my birth all should i have any reason from complaint  when i am a little disposed to a gay turn of thinking i consider as i was a derelict from my cradle i have the honor of a lawful claim to the best protection in europe for being a spot of earth to which no body pretends a title i devolve naturally upon the king as one of the rights of his royalty  while i presume to name his majesty i look back with confusion upon the mercy i have lately experienced because it is impossible to remember it but with something i would fain forget for the sake of my future peace and alleviation of my past misfortune  i owe my life to the royal pity if a wretch can with propriety be said to live whose days are fewer than his sorrows and to whom death had been but a redemption from misery  but i will suffer my pardon as my punishment till that life which has so graciously been given me shall become considerable enough not to be useless in his service to whom it was forfeited  under influence of these sentiments with which his majestys great goodness has inspired me i consider my loss of fortune and dignity as my happiness to which as i was born without ambition i am thrown from them without repining  possessing those advantages my care had been perhaps but how to enjoy life by the want of them i am taught this nobler lesson to study how to deserve it  r savage  the bastard a poem in gayer hours when high my fancy run the muse exulting thus her lay begun blessed be the bastards birth through wondrous ways he shines excentric like a comets blaze no sickly fruit of faint compliance he he stamped in natures mint of extacy he lives to build not boast a generous rac no tenth transmitter of a foolish face his daring hope no sires example bounds his firstborn lights no prejudice confounds he kindling from within requires no flame he glories in a bastards glowing name born to himself by no possession led in freedom fostered and by fortune fed nor guides nor rules his sovereign choic control his body independent as his soul loosed to the worlds wide range  enjoined no aim prescribed no duty and assigned no name natures unbounded son he stands alone his heart unbiased and his mind his own o mother yet no mother  it is to you my thanks for such distinguished claims are due you unenslavd to natures narrow laws warm championess for freedoms sacred cause from all the dry devoirs of blood and line from ties maternal moral and divine discharged my grasping soul pushed me from shore and launched me into life without an oar what had i lost if conjugally kind by nature hating yet by vows confined untaught the matrimonial bounds to slight and coldly conscious of a husbands right you had faintdrawn me with a form alone a lawful lump of life by force your own then while your backward will retrenched desire and unconcurring spirits lent no fire i had been born your dull domestic heir load of your life and motive of your care perhaps been poorly rich and meanly great the slave of pomp a cipher in the state lordly neglectful of a worth unknown and slumbering in a seat by chance my own far nobler blessings wait the bastards lot conceived in rapture and with fire begot strong as necessity he starts away climbs against wrongs and brightens into day thus unprophetic lately misinspird i sung gay flattering hope my fancy fired inly secure through conscious scorn of ill nor taught by wisdom how to balance will rashly deceived i saw no pits to shun but thought to purpose and to act were one heedless what pointed cares pervert his way whom caution arms not and whom woes betray but now exposed and shrinking from distress i fly to shelter while the tempests press my muse to grief resigns the varying tone the raptures languish and the numbers groan o memory  thou soul of joy and pain thou actor of our passions over again why do thou aggravate the wretches woe why add continuous smart to every blow few are my joys alas how soon forgot on that kind quarter thou invadst me not while sharp and numberless my sorrows fall yet thou repeatst and multiplyst em all is chance a guilt that my disastrous heart for mischief never meant must ever smart can selfdefence be sin  ah plead no more what though no purposed malice stained thee over had heaven befriended thy unhappy side thou had not been provoked  or thou had died far be the guilt of homeshed blood from all on whom unsought embroiling dangers fall still the pale dead revives and lives to me to me through pitys eye condemned to see remembrance veils his rage but swells his fate grieved i forgive and am grown cool too late young and unthoughtful then who knows one day what ripening virtues might have made their way he might have lived till folly died in shame till kindling wisdom felt a thirst for fame he might perhaps his countrys friend have proved been happy generous candid and beloved he might have saved some worth now doomed to fall and i perchance in him have murdered all o fate of late repentance always vain thy remedies but lull undying pain where shall my hope find rest  no mothers care shielded my infant innocence with prayer no fathers guardian hand my youth maintained called forth my virtues or from vice restrained is it not time to snatch some powerful arm first to advance then screen from future harm am i returned from death to live in pain or would imperial pity save in vain distrust it not  what blame can mercy find which gives at once a life and rears a mind mother miscalled farewell  of soul severe this sad reflection yet may force one tear all i was wretched by to you i owed alone from strangers every comfort flowed lost to the life you gave your son no more and now adopted who was doomed before newborn i may a nobler mother claim but dare not whisper her immortal name supreamly lovely and serenely great majestic mother of a kneeling state queen of a peoples hearts who never before agreed  yet now with one consent adore one contest yet remains in this desire who most shall
