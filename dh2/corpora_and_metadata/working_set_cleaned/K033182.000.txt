conspiracy a tragedy  by r jephson esquire  dublin printed by graisberry and campbell for john archer no  0 damestreet        prologue this night with dread unusual we appear for this has been a very damning year established fame perhaps in vain we bring since rigid justice is an awful thing awful and hateful human but in part all frown an outside man without a heart such you may see in every street you pass just as like men in plaster stone or brass our early prologues in less cautious times railed at the audience in permitted rhymes faults there might be they owned but then would swear of faults or beauties you no judges were as peers by brother peers alone are tried poets alone on poets should decide with surly ben this dogma first began so in succession to pert colley ran john dryden with a crab stick of harsh wit rejoiced to drub the hydra of the pit though little then was right and much amiss not one of all the venomed tongues durst hiss on the tamed spirit of the cudgeld town almanzor and mad maximin went down now by inversion ten times more polite the poets always wrong the critic right nay some have found a more enlightened way and boldly censure who never saw the play this may not perhaps be justice to the letter to see is well but inspirations better of old the vehicles of wit were scarce men judged upon the spot of play or farce by no concocted spite the piece was torn the short lived virus died where it was born no daily column then was gladly seen by envy raised and scribled over by spleen and sure if pleased or grieved we little gain by reasoning back the pleasure or the pain still safely we may trust the feeling part but never set the head against the heart for various causes you frequent the scene some to dispel but more to indulge the spleen some fly a dun and some a railing wise and lose the real in fictitious life a passive mistress many here pursue but most we see have nothing else to do others prefer the days dull business done to yawn in company than quite alone good harmless souls may no rude sounds molest em nor passions feigned or real ever infest em in times not long gone by a noble peer unlike the sprightly race who now trip here four previous footmen his high state express and gorgeous as a satrap was his dress no household fowl on maple perch reposed as innocent of thought more sweetly dozed warm in his muff with periwig for cap here he indulged one discontinuous nap yates woodward cibber garrick charmed in vain kind morpheus held him in his softer chain just as the curtain dropped he heard it said a well known slentor of the stage was dead i am glad on it cries my lord and why do you think he roared so loud i could not sleep one wink this night at times may kinder slumbers seize you sleep when we are dull and wake when we can please you prologue though he pretends no commerce with the skies a perfect stranger to deep mysteries nor is astrologer enough to make predictions for a new years almanac yet for his play the poet sees with sorrow and now foretells what all may see tomorrow though here where genuine sense with candor reigns fair approbation crown his tragic strains for often this favored muse has been before you always to thank but never to implore you a hundred sterner critics still remain to damn his labors and your taste arraign in posts gazettes and chronicles they rage and failing to adorn affright the stage turn to the usual column there you will see what those sage delphic oracles decree first for the fable that is a flimzy tale with unsupported characters dull stale not one generic or original the situations want dramatic art such feeble pathos never can touch the heart next plainly does the plagiary appear this ha is richard and that oh is lear the pshaws and tuts are shakspeare shakspeare clear yet why this rage to damn the thief on shore who eyes the laboring bark when tempests roar and prays that rocks the vessels ribs may break means his own gain in plundering the wreck but though a thousand foundering poets split none thrive and some must lose by shipwrecked wit who steals your fame as shakspeare said of yore enriches not himself but makes you poor the tartar when his comely foe lies slain hopes with his spoils his qualities to gain could critics every excellence destroy they naught inherit but the barbarous joy then of all censors none are so severe as those whose scenes have been exploded here self raised to the tribunal seat of letters as rogues made justices they try their betters unlike the carthage queen the ills they bore but indurate their callous bosoms more should some pert teacher his own worth to enhance decry all rival brothers of the dance swear one was awkward tothers manner coarse another hobbled like a foundered horse say would you not the envious railer blame when once you knew coupee himself was lame some merry idlers to the pen resort and free from malice write at us in sport like the poor pelted frogs we cry out thus alas it is play to you but death to us yet should some genuine critic point a fault our authors not too forward to be taught to sage good counsel thankful he will attend and think who spares him least is most his friend dramatis personae men titus vespasian emperor of rome sextus young patricians annius young patricians publius captain of the praetorian guards lentulus a

notumque surens quid saemina possit virgil v e conspiracy a tragedy act i scene i apartments of vitellia  vitellia sextus vitellia thou do but mock me must i hear for ever how great thy preparations while i know how poor the deeds that follow what avails it that thy deep practices with lentulus inflamed his ardor that the fuels laid to wrap the towering capitol in fire the appointed signal to begin the assault on the unguarded titus that our friends on the right arm display a tyrian scarf amidst the blaze and tumult to distinguish the abettors of our boldness  this dull tale with nauseous iteration ten times boasted indignant i have heard still my revenge preys on itself the tyrant lives to scorn me lives to usurp a throne by right vitellias nay worse to brave me by a public act that gives my scepter and his worthless hand to syrian berenice  sextus worthless hand then wherefore anxious how he give that hand why should you wish it offered  vitellia to reject it what can i plead for thee my own just rage that burns unceasing in this boiling breast at times seems heightened by thy fiercer flame what will not sextus dare at parting from me allegiance danger friendship melt before me but when i fly with ready recompense i find the promised service unperformd some haggard fear arrests thy trembling arm phantoms and doubts and conscience shiver thee how can i reconcile such contraries such ardor with such coldness  sextus i as well might bid the rapid whirlwind give me audience for while intemperate choler   vitellia now i am calm now to thy casuistry  if words have power to reconcile a lovers faith and honor with expectations raised but to be crushed with oaths dissolved even like the breath that formed them thou art a rhetorician subtler far than he of greece or our own smoothtongued tully  sextus i know no art nor does this cause require it if it is a crime to be irresolute where duty honor gratitude combine to bid me not resolve i own the charge nay ought whatever the forfeit glory in it could i at once determine on this deed did no compunctious harrowings within print deep the prohibition on my soul i were a monster madam not a roman  vitellia a roman no give over that empty boast shame of the unworthy  oaths are bonds with romans even at the altar of eternal truth the holy fane clasped by thy outstretchd arms i bound thee by such sacred ceremonies when first i listened to thy wellfeignd passion never to divulge what to thy faith i trusted and next though stygian horrors compassed it to join my vengeance now to hear this sound this windy vaunt that sextus is a roman  sextus whatever be my country or my nature one character i wear indelible thy fond thy faithful lover oh vitellia the wavering of my soul too strongly proves how fierce the storm that shakes me yet alas like the tall pine when caurus takes his top while the sharp axe indents his trunk beneath i struggle but to fall say is it little i can even think to perpetrate a crime to late posterity must damn my fame blanch the dark records of past villainy and make the name of caesars treacherous friend stand single in the abhorred preeminence  vitellia then be the friend of caesar from this hour no more vitellias lover  sextus ever ever my fruitless turmoil in the fatal snare but winds it closer round me urged by thee treason seems justice dark assassination wears the bright robe of honorable vengeance i know the infatuation of my soul there is no crime of deepest ebon dye my prompt obedience would not perpetrate by thee arraigned this gracious emperor seems to deserve the bloodiest tyrants doom but oh when i approach his matchless virtues my fury turns to reverence awe and wonder  vitellia brave when the dangers distant  what more common the courage of our peasants  but go on  sextus unjust vitellia think ere you condemn a heart so torn as mine  you steel my arm to wreak your dire revenge the emperor demands my loyalty thy offered hand impels on one side every tie of honor binds me to titus all my love is thine my duty his to thee when i return some new discovered beauty fires my sense while in the soul of titus i admire some freshly blooming virtue scorned by thee life were a burden yet to pay this price seals me a wretch for ever powers of justice can she hear this and yet reproach her sextus  vitellia assure thyself of no reproach from me scorn and contempt are silent monitors  sextus yet think ere one irrevocable stroke deprive the world of its first ornament rome of a father nature of a friend revolve the heroic spirits of times past see him unparalled  vitellia he has some virtues but men like monsters only are without them nero reigned five years wisely  but my father was there an insult to sink degradation from prides high pinnacle to ignominy unpractised on their emperor hooted dragged the dagger at his throat by dungeon slaves over their polluted pavements o just ate appease his manes with luxuriant slaughter  sextus what justice can involve him in the charge he not contrived nor countenanced the outrage  vitellia no but he profits by it that condemns him  sextus i know him formed with every excellence brave pious merciful benevolent would he reward desert his coffers seem poor to his boundless liberality is he constrained to punish his sweet nature finds some soft palliative for every wretch green inexperience pleads the excuse for one gray hairs absolves another every day that passes over his head unmarked by bounty he calls a blank in life and strikes it off as worthless to be numbered  vitellia grant it all yet still he reigns   sextus he reigns it is true vitellia but all the cares of royalty are his and all the blessings ours  the laurel wreath the imperial purple   vitellia hear majestic juno and do thou come with pomp of sounding words the herald of my foe to trumpet forth his irksome virtues sure thou have forgot this boasted pageant wears the diadem his father tore from mine say should he not had he a monarchs sense of royal justice have shared that diadem his father ravished with her who rightly owned it  sextus ah vitellia is this the proof of hate the vizor falls in vain its outside varnish would display the fathers wrongs the daughters piety revealed beneath the genuine face displays the burning flush of angry jealousy   vitellia jealousy  sextus alas too plain  vitellia how jealousy  sextus and must this desperate hand   vitellia i will hear no more here i absolve thee from thy worthless vows thus give them to the winds soon shall i find a braver arm to vindicate my cause  sextus i cannot bear these frowns  vitellia away unhand me let titus bleed and call vitellia thine  to them annius annius sextus the emperor seeks thee  vitellia quick be gone it is strange he can afford a moments leisure to any but his lovely berenice  annius madam he pays the obedience he exacts governing himself he learns to rule the world within this hour by his especial order the unwilling queen departed  sextus how  vitellia what say thou  annius present i saw the tender separation and scarce could trust the fortitude i witnessed  vitellia my hopes revive aside  sextus o unexampled virtue  vitellia would i had seen it with what extacy could i have heard the proud forsaken wretch reproach her faithless lover  annius tears alone were her upbraidings gently she withdrew convinced the tender soul of titus suffered more than her own by the constrained adieu  vitellia her pride perhaps deceived her  annius no twas plain conflict preceded conquest but the senate and romes repeated wish   vitellia the senate rome it is a kind of mockery to name them did they not flatter nero half the crimes of their mad emperors romes slaves engendered her infancy was savage and unjust polished depravity her riper age with every new refinement some new guilt even in her sports and pleasures barbarous but now her rank maturity arrived she soaks and fattens in gross infamy if there were any righteous jupiter his thunder would proclaim him this vile city this stew of sordid vice and luxury upturnd from its foundations rent and crushed would smoke in frightful piles a monument that there were gods and rome provoked their vengeance  apart to vitellia sextus the object of your hatred changes quickly twas titus now it is rome i see the cause of this so sudden mutability  vitellia you see with jaundiced eye but mark me sextus still apart twere most unwise to prosecute our vengeance till the fresh gloss of this late specious act fades in the public eye  you look mistrust my will you have heard  obey me or resign me  exit vitellia remain annius and sextus annius why droops my friend why over thy laboring brow rides that black tempest while beneath thine eye glares wildly to the center  sextus annius annius i am a wretch whom joves almighty arm could scarce pluck from perdition let me warn thee give not unbounded empire over thy soul to proud revengeful woman  annius nay my friend sink not beneath the scorn of that coy beauty yet full orbd charms like here is though past the bud strike deeper root in the young amorous heart than equal youth in its fresh primy bloom than hebe or janthes orient softness  sextus their smiles are goddesses but once inflamed all good perverted to its opposite keen in the feeling of imagined wrongs they know no ties all duties sink beneath them virtue and vice are shades to fade or glow as their outrageous passions give them color  annius i view them sextus in a brighter mirror a pure expanse unclouded and serene thy lovely sisters charms this day my friend for fair cornelia smiled her approbation knit close the ties of our dear amity and gain the emperors consent to join us  sextus he has heaped his favors on me and i know sighing deeply unworthy as i am will meet my wish united thus to thine with gracious ardor may the soft powers who smile on nuptial bliss lucina hymen and the idalian love strew their unfading roses over your couch and from the brightness of your mutual joy send one kind gleam to warm this chearless breast  annius nay do not wound me with this deep dejection had fortune thus conspired to make thee happy i swear i would have hushed my own complaints nor let one inauspicious thought intrude to cloud my gladness in a friends contentment farewell i will precede thee to the emperor and wait impatient till you crown my wishes  sextus anon i will follow thee farewell one moment exit annius  sextus alone for see the fiery lentulus appears indignant of restraint i know he comes with furious zeal to chide my cold delay and push me to destruction  to him lentulus lent well encountered all is disposed why then this dull suspense our eager friends like staunch hounds in the leash pant for the welcome signal to be loosed and snuff the destined quarry  sextus are they then so eager to embrue their ruthless fangs in the rich blood of titus are they weary unthinking fools to their own happiness blind to the blessings of his gentle reign to heaven ungrateful do they wish to seat a direr nero in the imperial chair and bow the knee to the remorseless brother  lent of that hereafter no they wish to avoid the fate of poor alienus and marcellus who with protracting councils like our own conspired against vespasian and gave time for this his sons preventive vigilance to turn the destined slaughter on themselves  sextus o righteous doom of black conspiracy always abhorred and rarely fortunate the blood that issues from a monarchs wound ensanguines deep the sword which dares to shed it what gained the noblest of conspirers brutus by caesars slaughter but to fall himself by the same steel and dying to profane substantial virtue as an empty shadow  lent he made half work he left a second caesar but like ripe corn beneath the sharpened scythe here the whole flavian line shall down together  sextus o rome preposterous rome how many tyrants smeared with the blood of your best citizens have in their palaces slept undisturbed and sunk in peace to execrated graves while this great paragon   lent for shame forbear these thoughts should have preceded not crept after your bold concurrence in a perilous league like the vile rabble in our warlike triumphs disgracing the proud pomp they howling follow where were these thoughts when thy young ardour found me brooding over muttered threats and unshapd mischief thy forward zeal bad me despise complaint and romanlike trust to my arm for vengeance  sextus oh the more villain i and every tongue like thine should lash me with the memory but you invert the charge black was the hour that knowing thee i shunned not  you received me while yet the embrio guilt but gaspd within me with quick preventive keen malignity   lent and saved thy puny blushes but no matter with pride i wear the wreath pale fear casts from thee be it thine to praise him sextus and betray mine to avow my anger and chastise in thee it may be guilt in me it is justice  sextus the difference i doubt it is yours to explain it  lent when the worlds wonder sions haughty temple smokd on the ground an undistinguished ruin fast by his side i fought there he beheld how this good arm scarce second to his own dealt death among his foes but when i asked to rule the province i had helped to conquer he durst deny me  what the reason think you because those outcasts of the peopled world the scum and scorn of nations jews vile jews accused me of extortion in his absence  sextus was that the cause o godlike emperor how shall the breath of friendship raise thy name when hate itself brings wreaths to thy renown and points its accusation from thy virtue  lent thou pale cold medler in a manly danger go with thy palsied conscience aspen traitor fall at the tyrants foot reveal thy plot but cast the blame on me or some brave roman seduced by thy false tongue and now betrayed  sextus rail on  i have deserved it   lent be a man and what you durst contrive dare execute the dull are unsuspicious this good emperor whom our prone senate have already godded for reptiles can make gods is penetrable by any gallant steel  sextus and know thou not that she who set thee on  i blush to name her that beauteous mischief would suspend the blow  lent be thou the floating feather of her whim move or be still as her caprice ordains it i shall plow on with my broad canvass spread too full to waver with a womans breath though she indeed deserves a firmer sex woman in beauty but a bold she falcon that masculinely soars on female pinions our clelias portias arrias rise in her  sextus and can thou do this deed  lent and can thou ask it i am weary of this wrangling freeze thou here while i go send him to enjoy his godship his apotheosis on earth is little above our heads throned near immortal jove with pity he will look down on this dim earth and thank me for his passport to the skies  exit lentulus sextus alone these are the bitter fruits of treachery this thing of malice i myself have hatched this viper of my treason with foul breath casts back the venom he imbibed from me and stings while he obeys me shame and ruin i have stepped midway in the swelling tide while the loud torrent thunders from above wherever i turn grim horror sits arrayed and shakes a dreadful dart i dare not pass nor can regain the shore avenging jove bare thy red arm choose out thy hottest bolt and headlong hurl me to the hell i merit  exit end of first act act ii scene i the temple of jupiter titus with guards lictors etc  publius with several senators and the deputies of the subject provinces bringing the accustomed tribute sextus and annius come forward from the opposite sides among the rest lentulus publius o father of thy country thus the senate with general voice salute their emperor nor ever did their awful rolls contain a vote more just a title so deserved  annius o titus not alone thy countrys father she deems thee more her guardian deity as such decrees thee temples and hereafter means as a god to invoke thy sacred name  publius this annual tribute of the subject states to that great work she dedicates and prays thy kind acceptance of the offered homage  lent now the god speaks and now for oracles aside but thy celestial panoply shall yield to one good stroke from this poor mortal arm  titus hear me ye romans to deserve your love is the first wish that animates my breast let not that love exceed its modest bounds to stain the emperors cheek and yours with blushes how would the eternal movers of the world smile to behold my puny godhead shake when the norths icy arrows searched my breast or while my altars smoked with sacrifice should fevers riot in my burning veins to hear my prostrate deity implore some friendly hand to moisten my parched lip to extend a little tiber in a cup and comfort immortality with water  annius thus greatly to deserve and greater still decline the tribute of your subjects praise casts deeper shame on their preposterous zeal who lavished on imperial tyranny and monsters miscalled men the praise of gods  titus i not reject the offerings of your love but would apply them to a worthier purpose vesuvius late eruption has laid waste tremendous visitation the fair country a prodigy reserved for this ill time that loudly warns for some new expiation the neighboring cities lie one cumbrous mass of hideous ruin whom the fiery wave spared to destroy pale famine now devours this gold may bring relief to misery these be my temples thus be titus worshipped  publius such temples are indeed more durable than pyramids whose proud tops pierce the sky no storm can shake them nor no time destroy their altars rise in every virtuous breast and their rich incense is the overflowing heart  titus enough enough  i would be private friends annius stay thou approach come near my sextus  exeunt publius and others titus sextus annius annius now sextus warmly urge my dearest interest  sextus ah sir i dread to speak  your berenice   titus oh spare me spare me twas a painful struggle rome and the emperor saw with different eyes rome that she was a stranger and a queen and i her truth and beauty  sextus yet she left you  titus reluctantly alas as i endured it the senate pressed me long to native nuptials i interposed as long with feigned delays while one dear image mistress of my soul in silent soft security reigned there to dictate all which caution seemed to utter  sextus twas most unjust and cruel so to urge you  titus the chambers next to these were once the queens nor eye nor foot but mine shall visit them since she forsakes them there i will give my soul its burst of anguish there i will hear her voice there her enchanting form shall smile before me in all her soft luxuriancy of beauty the lute she touched the flowers her needle painted now mute or scattered as she cast them from her remind me of the dear delicious hours when my enamored heart spoke out and owned her thy master there will be no emperor  sextus yet in the senate be an emperor the name of queen we know is alien to them such is the force of rooted prejudice though in the imperial title they endure more subjugation than romes seven kings had all been tarquins could impose upon them they tremble at the shade but hug the substance  titus i rule their will but cannot remove their error fatal to my repose or shade or substance a prey to cankerous regret within i strive against the feeling which consumes me my reason disesteems my hearts desire condemns the choice and yet adores the object  sextus thus princes are but subjects to opinion  titus new importunity each hour assails me to fix the scepter in the flavian line and with some daughter of patrician blood to share the imperial purple warm esteem since rome will have me wived with calmer fires must light the torch of hymen this my sextus pleads for thy sister most dear by that tie and in herself unrivaled  sextus how my sister cornelia sir  titus cornelia  annius dire election aside  titus thou annius bear my greetings to cornelia the senate have my promise ere the sun sunk in his western tent their new augusta should be proclaimed so tell them of my choice my heart can form no new engagement sextus to loose the bonds of friendship names alone the emperor and the subject must not weaken strict amity like ours  sextus oh sir consider an humbler lot will suit my sisters fortune besides your bounties showerd upon our house will fall in envious curses on my head and sink my name but to exalt your error  titus let rome be envious not thy prince unjust the friend adopted thus holds not his place by the light tenure of the popular breath but by my weighed selection  sextus it is too much stop this profusion of unbounded goodness unless you mean to swell the mighty debt beyond my power to thank you lest you turn the feelings of a heart that knows its frailty to undeserving and ingratitude  titus i cannot taste a rough unsocial joy nor trust me would it stir my blood one jot though at my nod the necks of rome should bow like willows to the wind one good mans thanks the warm effusions of a soul obliged to me are more than all the pageantry my heart partakes not though my power commands  exeunt titus and sextus annius alone cursed be my fortune cursed the meddling senate that in the blindness of their busy zeal thus goad him to my ruin slavish drones that buzzing search their musty registers to find some record of past turpitude a sanction for the meditated shame an earlier precedent of ignominy then dawb their volume with some worse disgrace some fouler stain of manhoods dignity and call the enrollment sacred  yet why curse them hence from my breast this selfish vile alloy debasing genuine passion let her glory be now thy mistress bow to that my soul and worship her at distance yet it is hard to cast away affection like a garment to tame young blood by cold necessity and love for thy untutored fervency to learn the icy lesson of respect but see she comes  oh never did my eyes behold her half so beauteous as this moment a dear thing lost thus puts forth all its value  to him cornelia cornelia my annius  annius soft cornelia it is a crime to use endearments now  cornelia a crime amazement  annius yes a most dangerous crime a new made crime a crime within this hour no less than treason know thou art destined to ascend the throne of romes great master  can i utter it thou art his choice the empress of caesar and would thou think it he to me assigned the barbarous task as such to greet thee for him going  cornelia the empress of caesar which way wherefore  annius because my destiny but toiled to plague me because thy virtues beauty were too bright to bless these humble arms  farewell for ever i could but give a heart and he the world oh i shall grow disloyal if i gaze and curse the man my duty bids me honor  exit annius cornelia alone me caesars empress can that name alone turn oaths to air and melt the souls affections and can the generous titus  no i wrong him he knows not our engagements he is too good too gentle thus with tyrannous violence rudely to seize involuntary vows and force by power what is due alone to love  exit cornelia scene  an apartment in the palace titus meeting publius who holds a paper shouts heard titus whence this rude dissonance whose barbarous roar shakes to the center these tall battlements  publius loud as a stormy sea the people rush promiscuous to the temples and with shouts deafning the sky implore the gods to guard you  titus such clamorous prayers are impiety they do instruct the gods and not adore them there is more worship in one contrite sigh breathed from the breast of humble penitence than in whole hecatombs and clouds of incence if heaven will grant me length of days it is well but the last blessing i should beg from heaven  publius it is the wan cast of transient melancholy a momentary shade that comes and passes can make great titus speak thus to his romans  titus survey mans little state through every age and tell me wherefore should we fear to change it when children all our wishes gape at manhood and that arrived we sigh to recollect the lively blossom of our greener years swearing our school days were the happiest then frowns ambitions strife and disappointment or friendships brow estranged or luckless love unblessed thus in the past or present hour no center fixed for fleeting happiness old age creeps joyless on with envious step stealing us further from each sweet remembrance till all that ministerd our brief delight whether from pampered sense or flattering hope lies buried in that mouldering monument is that for my inspection the paper held by publius  publius it contains the names of those rash citizens who dared with calumny licentious to traduce the fame of our great emperors before you  titus a barbarous register which naught avails to the departed and administers unnumberd wiles for treachery and fraud to ensnare the living so henceforth remember to pluck the root up of this dangerous evil the informer not the accused shall meet my wrath  publius yet sir it is but just  titus were justice urged to rigors iron verge the peopled earth would swarm with herds not men for who has found in frail humanity the faultless monster guilt steels itself and hardens in society besides it is dangerous trust me to divulge the world contains so little virtue publius  publius but sir there are who with foul breath will dare even to traduce your name  titus why let them publius if levity give breath to foul discourse it matters not if folly i lament it if men complain with reason i should thank them and profit by reproof does malice blame me i know my innocence and scorn the slander to them cornelia my fair one my elect my lovely empress  cornelia suspend a while that title hear me first a secret presses on this anxious breast to you and only you i can discover  titus publius farewell now freely speak cornelia  exit publius cornelia that you have deigned from all the maids of rome to choose cornelia to partake your throne o emperor i own the bright distinction deemed worthy of thy choice my conscious soul rises in self esteem this prompts my tongue to trust thy goodness to conceal no thought whose reservation might upbraid my weakness with mean suspicion of thy matchless justice  titus speak freely speak  cornelia first let me swear there lives not who more than i do venerates thy name and owns thy wondrous virtue yet my heart  i fear to move your anger   titus pray go on  cornelia it is not mine to give an early flame felt ere i knew to name it burned for annius if so you will accept my hand  it is yours  titus perish so base a thought for once i see rare sight for kings the visage of bright truth unmasked and genuine thou have nobly ventured even when it might offend the emperor to show her undisguisd my best cornelia how much am i thy debtor could thou fear i would disturb your loves  cornelia bursting into tears i knew you would not if lost in admiration of thy goodness my words but poorly thank you o believe it too big for speech my swelling gratitude beggars the weak expression of my tongue most thankful when most silent  titus dear cornelia would thou indeed be grateful teach to others sincerity like thine bid wholesome truth coy visitant of courts return secure even in her homeliest garb she shall be welcome more welcome than the practiced harlot smiles the ambushd lie of guileful flattery soft are her blandishments the vizor fair but underneath  oh how unlike the varnish  exit titus to cornelia vitellia vitellia may i without offense presume to offer my early homage to my sovereign may i adore that beauty whose bright beams thus shine superior with unrivaled radiance and charm the soul of titus roman ladies though paragons before must humbly seek espousals in the senate must submit to match with praetors or poor deputies and leave the only caesar for cornelia but one can be augusta  cornelia insolent aside but let her be deceived such scorn deserves it farewell vitellia going  vitellia this disdain becomes you once we at least were equal time has been though now the giddy wheels fantastic round has whirled thee highest that romes proudest she even sextus sister even the elect of titus had statuelike stood still at my command and blushed obedience to the emperors daughter  cornelia enraptured with the sense of boundless joy my transports might seem insult  let me fly from that stern brow where smiles and love await me  exit cornelia vitellia alone must i endure it bear with tame submission this contumelious superiority with what disdain the haughty minion eyed me may their false hymen wave alectos torch to scatter discord hate and barrenness may furies yell around their nuptial couch and joves red lightning in the embrace consume them yawn gaping hell ingulf them from my sight to hide in tartarus the bliss that blasts me tremble ingrate tremble at my roused fury thy blood this very hour   to her sextus sextus i joy to meet thee my sun but rises to renew that hope and his sloped beam that dims the shadowy world takes nothing but thy beauty from my sight to sadden his decline   vitellia is rome on fire the capitol in ashes where is lentulus does titus bleed say is the tyrant dead  sextus suspension of the deed you last commanded  vitellia the deed suspended yet dare thou presume thus boldly to approach me thus to greet me as if secure thy presence would be welcome  sextus i heard no revocation of the order  vitellia have thou not heard the insult of this hour cruel unparalleled and do thou wait a signal less equivocal oh fool to take him for a lover who thus poorly can know my wrongs nor think they cry for vengeance  sextus oh could i find a single specious cause to varnish over the act   vitellia a single cause i will give thee thousands one for every impulse that can excite a noble mind to daring does freedom charm thee tear away the shackles that clank at the degraded senates heels and rise the brutus of these servile times does bright ambition fire thee open lies the broad strait road to empire all my train my friends my title to the imperial rule all shall be thine say can my hand my heart crown thy desires fly to the enterprise let me behold thee crimsoned in the blood of this perfidious to my arms i will clasp thee with fervor juno like is it not enough can thou still hesitate know then till now i loved this titus  still i may return i dare not trust my heart again to love him now fly if thou can poorly shrink insensible to all the charms of glory empire love if thou can bear a rival who disputes usurps and violates vitellias heart thou art the last the meanest of mankind  sextus o thou have found the way to rouse my fury love and a rival both shall justify i feel thy rage infused yes thou shall see yon stately pile yon capitol in flames this sword shall blush with rich imperial blood my own runs back and curdles at the thought  vitellia doubt but a moment and no more behold me  sextus then vanish doubt and may thy scorn repay me and aggravate my shame if i obey not  exit sextus vitellia alone yes titus thou shall feel me feel too late the power of this despised rejected beauty too late shall thou repent   to her publius publius princess your pardon my tidings will i hope excuse the intrusion for sure they should be welcome through the palace the emperor seeks you madam  vitellia seeks me publius not so not so  why should he seek vitellia  publius can it be possible you know not why to make you partner of his throne and greatness  vitellia what have i done that thou shoudst dare to mock me  publius to mock you lady by my life i swear he bad me in his name salute you empress  vitellia

thy hand and pour the balm of comfort over my anguish  vitellia what balm what comfort can vitellia give thee ask it from roaring seas or burning aetna their rage is calm as slumbering infancy to the wild passion of this stormy breast these hornet sounds already buzz around me an emperor might be spared but not a titus the land just panting with recovered breath raw from the lash of gory tyranny a balmy prince healing and merciful snatched from the bliss of sweet benevolence to satiate an alectos jealous fury  sextus twas fear twas phantom when i urged his virtues  vitellia oh let us meet no more each time i view thee again i seem to urge he bleeds again thou were too quick too ready to obey me would i had found some dilatory slave insensible and cold he would have soothed promised but not performed saved me from crimes heavens mercy cannot absolve nor hell can punish  vitellia rushes out sextus alone all is accomplished i have passed the brink of every hope and fear does ought remain is there a friend to trust and be betrayed a mistress to impel my hand to murder and then disclaim revile me and avoid ye thoughts that drive my whirling brain to madness ye vengeful furies that besiege my soul i will not wait your tardy ministry but leap the gulf and plunge at once to darkness  going to slab himself annius enters annius hold thy rash hand the emperor requires  sextus requires my blood he shall be satisfied  struggling annius requires to see thee   sextus where in heaven to see me no those bright portals are for ever barred there throned with demigods the hero sits nor bends his glorious eyes to earth and me but i am doomed to tread the dreary realms where sad cocytus rolls his sullen wave where phlegeton boils over with livid fires where guilty ghosts shall hiss me from their haunts and yelling furies through the gloom pursue me  annius thy reason is disturbed rouse rouse for shame decline not thus thy drooping brow to earth why roll thy wandering eyes on vacant air shaping a hideous host of threatening forms from the black coinage of distempered fancy  sextus think thou these horrors are fantastical i feel them here here is substantial hell here ever whirling wheels and gnawing vultures  striking his breast annius come banish in the emperors embrace this gloomy brood of thickeyed melancholy now while the busy throng surround his throne when even indifference wears the face of zeal and feels or feigns officious loyalty he wonders much thou art not by his side that thou could leave him in the hour of peril  sextus that i could leave him how is he not slain  annius forbid it heaven no he returns unhurt safe from the wild commotion  sextus can it be are my eyes false sure i beheld him fall pierced by the assassins dagger  annius where beheld him  sextus in the frequented pass that leads from hence to the flaminian  annius then thy eyes deceived thee some other in the throng and wild confusion thy sight mistook for titus  sextus how some other say who could dare to assume the imperial robe the sacred laurel and the sovereign ensigns worn by the emperor only  annius nay i know not but titus lives praise to kind heaven unhurt i left him but this moment and to seek thee  sextus did i hear right all gracious jove i thank thee falling on his knees sound it to lands remote to air and skies transporting word again again repeat it hushed be the winds no accent breathe but this o muchloved prince unfold thy arms receive me thou ever kind and welcome now more dear than all the blessings love could shower upon me running into his arms teach me to bear this joy thou do not mock me  annius what still incredulous convince thyself trust thy own sense and see if i deceive thee this moment come before him  sextus come before him show him the vile perfidious who betrayed him  annius amazement  thou  sextus yes i twas i betrayed him i the prime mover of the foul sedition the master demon i go get thee from me contagion strikes from my infectious touch my breath will blast thee  annius i am lost in wonder thou sextus thou betray the emperor  sextus ask me no more spare the reiteration one fatal moment annius has undone me farewell a long a last adieu to rome think sometimes of thy friend not what he is but what he was and if his crimes will rise to blot the kind remembrance oh forget not these bitter tears that scald his burning cheek how sharp his sufferings how sincere his sorrow  annius this is indeed a dreadful cause for sorrow  sextus ay is it not for never ceasing sorrow farewell once more i go for ever from thee to mourn and hide my guilt in solitude to fall by my own hand were cowardice may every god who sees my deep remorse guard him whom i no more must dare to name thou annius with thy courage and thy faith against foreign danger and domestic treason by day by night in peace in war defend him defend him from the inconstancy of rome but most defend him from his treacherous friends  annius another time explain this mystery now let me think the plot is yet unknown the flames it is thought were spread by accident but thy precipitate flight unhappy friend will six on thee the stain  sextus what can thou counsel  annius do not withdraw but keep the secret close attend the emperor  think all passed a dream when dusky spirits ruled the unwholesome air and from their vaprous pinions dipped in styx shook phantoms round thy head  sextus the wounded wretch whoever he was that fell beneath the stroke ere this perhaps has given me up to shame  annius i will to the place where you beheld him fall examine who he was and bring thee tidings of all that may concern thy life or safety before the breast of titus can admit suspicion of thy faith there will be time to apprise thee of the danger then withdraw uncertain is the peril if you stay but certain if you fly  sextus my scattered sense scarce comprehends thy reason though my heart acknowledges the kindness guide me annius i go since you advise it  but these cheeks stripped of their wholesome hue these haggard eyes loud as the heralds throat will publish me  annius the least delay may bring destruction now  sextus i go this bloody mantle will betray me  annius whence is that blood  sextus it spouted from the veins of the unhappy man i mourned for titus  annius hide it with strictest care from every eye hold as we pass we may exchange our robes i will take thine these crimson drops washed out my chambers near i will meet thee with the emperor the presence of a friend may bring thee comfort  sextus it is all i have left  will thou still call me friend as just awakened from a hideous trance the dreadful phantoms still encompass me i tread with fear and doubting every step am lost in the delirium  annius oh be gone  end of third act act iv scene i an apartment in the palace  titus cornelia titus conspire against my life said you not so  cornelia hoping my intercession might prevail to obtain his pardon from your clemency one of the traitors made confession full the man you know and like the chief he followed a worthless object of your frequent bounty yet to be praised in this  titus then lentulus is guilty that bad man unfit for trust checked by my power in his rapacity would wipe the memory out of past offense but by transgressing deeper in the account of foes like him i count my own desert his enmitys a laurel but what further  cornelia lentulus the impious lentulus devised the enterprise with mad design to wrest romes scepter from thy sacred hand he sired the capitol to raise the tumult and in the imperial robe and wreath expected the giddy crowd for ever fond of change and ever for the worst should shout him up a sovereign for his plumage but the robe how just is heaven assumed for thy perdition assured his own one of the desperate band mistaking the impostor for the prince drenched in the blood of lentulus his steel deceived but by that garment  titus is he dead  cornelia of that i am yet to learn  titus methinks it is strange they could so long conceal the bold design  cornelia oh generous prince thou art not yet secure treason is round thee see this crimson badge a riband such as this binds up the robe over the right arm of every daring villain showing a riband observe it and be cautious  titus my fair friend these are the joys of empire judge me truth have i not held my peoples happiness much dearer than my own yet all my cares are sown in barrenness or shoot rank weeds choking the soil that nursed them from my brow one desperate hand would tear this hardearnd wreath to wear it on his own and still more strange he finds abettors can it be in rome does rome then hate thee titus  cornelia think not so think it a monster which the matron rome against natures course shook in convulsions forth which when the startled parent found to swell with venom dangerous to her proper life with her own hands she strangled  titus heavenly synod you know if i have served her you beheld when on the banks of ister or of nile patient i felt the changing seasons rage or scorched in sultry syria for her glory for her indulgence cruel to myself i stifled my affections banished from me the first dear object of a mutual passion and thus my tears will fall ungrateful rome even thus am i requited  cornelia never yet was man so vile or enterprise so wild scorned or detested by the general sense as to want followers from vice or folly though hopeless still the issue  to them sextus sextus oh that face i dare not look upon it  titus sextus welcome how often have we reproved our satyrists for darkning nature with black characters impressed but by their spleen nor could believe the principles of ill so widely sown in human bosoms to give countenance for such irreverence against our common parent but farewell now fond plausibility our milkiness be henceforth turned to gall for woudst thou think it titus is betrayed  sextus alas too well i know it aside  titus woudst thou think titus is romes abhorrence thou can tell for thou have visited my inmost soul have i deserved to be abhorred by rome  sextus abhorred  titus nay tell me friend   sextus i cannot speak  titus thy tears speak for thee come to my embrace why this is retribution these console me such tender proofs of thy unshaken faith for romes ingratitude  sextus i cannot bear it aside my silence is a second treachery  to them vitellia vitellia ha sextus here then all is secret yet aside  sextus i will shake off this load aside  vitellia victorious caesar advancing the gods still guard thee this auspicious hour thy country midst her happiest registers shall keep enrolled for ever our glad altars when the revolving sun renews this day smoke with rich incense and large hecatombs attesting thee preserved and heaven propitious  titus thanks for this pious wish yet trust me princess nor life nor empire do i prize so high to think them worth a struggle for themselves let heaven reclaim my life and rome her empire thankful for their short date i will resign them but go my sextus in the emperors name send to their homes the astonished citizens tell them the dangers past and thank their love that made my safety their peculiar care when peril was to all as imminent that done return a grateful labor sextus bears its own thanks  sextus oh janus what an office aside  exit sextus at the opposite door enter annius in the robe of sextus annius order resumes its place the flames are quelled but would our gilded palaces had choked their masters with their ashes ere the shame of spreading them to catch the life of titus had stained our annals therefore sir take heed there are who seek thy death  titus too plain i see it i read it with broad eyes yet still my heart combats the witness and would fain disprove the palpable conviction of their sense while you like an ambiguous sorcerer show me at once my fate and warn against it it is past all doubt  cornelia look behold the very badge the traitorous ensign see hangs on the arm of annius  cornelia ha it blinds me  titus too plain too plain the very form the color  vitellia he in our league i have destroyed him too aside  cornelia traitor  annius amazement and from thee cornelia  titus and woudst thou shed my blood my son my annius  annius sooner let furies seize or lightning blast me  titus dissembling now is vain that crimson flag that blushing symbol is the kindred badge of perfidy and murder the riband on the robe of annius  annius this what is this you make me wonder by my soul i swear i know of no device this silk contains  vitellia distraction comes for thought o pitying powers aside suggest some lucky artifice to save him  annius but sir forgive my honest indignation my conscious innocence assumes the license had any tongue  but thine  thus dared to accuse me i should not tamely stand to expostulate nor put my well tried truth on affirmation but my quick sword had started from my side and stabbed the lie in the foul slanderers throat  titus the injured must complain nor would i check a decent freedom in the meanest tongue such passion should have praise with honesty yet think not loudness can outorganize the silent crimination of that silk why do thou wear it  annius wear it sir this silk unhappy friend no sextus i will spare thee aside  vitellia oh that the earth would yawn and swallow me aside  titus it is manifest guilt chokes his utterance  vitellia heart heart be still thy throbbing will betray me aside  titus cornelia pity me all men but me make friends by bounties when i pray the gods i must not pray against mine enemies who meet me in the glittering files of war but that the bosom of the friend i cherish and strain to mine may not hide daggers against me that every benefit my hand confers by transformation most unnatural become not like the ooze of ebbing nile a bed to engender asps and crocodiles  cornelia medusas severed head that brewed a pest with every drop that fell produced no fang no viper keen as this ingratitude  titus may thunder strike me if i would not rather had i unnumberd lives at once resign them than hold one fitful feverish being thus with such vile thoughts and such detested caution  vitellia oh for an age of bliss i would not endure aside the hell of this distraction in my bosom  titus now own the improvidence of persidy if trifles make men jealous oftener still trifles betray the deep concerted wile with all black powers of night evoked to hide it behold him there the lover for whose arms thy constancy refused romes diadem  cornelia oh add not to my sorrow on this cheek deep glows the unextinguishable shame which that proud front still bold and unabashd though native to his crime disdains to wear  titus yet answer me say most ungrateful man how could thy bosom harbor the foul thought to murder him who loved thee answer me  annius appearances condemn me let your wisdom against this fluttering frivolous levity the riband weigh the whole tenor of my life my truth protested strongly this increasing wonder that almost strangles utterance then determine which scale preponderates  titus so may it prove publius i grieve to see his conscious pangs my presence doubles his distress and shame see him secured and straight instruct the senate to examine his design and find its source i leave thee to thy heart a keener monitor than my reproaches which henceforth i spare thee proportion but thy sorrow to thy sin and life will prove thy heaviest punishment  exit titus publius signs to an officer who puts chains on annius and exit remain annius vitellia and cornelia annius all is not lost thou ever kind and gentle my rest my harbor from the storms of fate my tempest beaten bosom flies to thee and longs to be enfolded by thy softness what means this scorn  cornelia away and come not near me unless thou mean still deeper to impress my rooted detestation witness dian had fortune emptied her whole quiver on thee stripped thee of wealth and honors changed thy form thus goodly as it is to loathsome foulness my constancy had triumphed over her malice and woes on woes had more endeared thee to me but now to love thee treacherous base ungrateful were to forget myself renounce my honor and make me share the persidy i scorn  exit cornelia annius vitellia annius yet innocent i will abide it all princess you gaze as i were dangerous yet seeming not reality confounds me as from the eclipse of black surrounding clouds the suns effulgence breaks with double luster so shall my truth cast off this veil of shame and shine more bright from base obscurity  vitellia o rank not me with those obdurate hearts which always frail and often hypocrite less adverse to the crime than the detection would sharpen hard afflictions keenest pang as they were charterd against mortal frailty i have a thousand things to say to thee i staid not to upbraid but give thee comfort know annius  to them sextus

forfeit of my crime  vitellia how shall i swear by heaven by all my hopes i will preserve him  sextus but what avails my flight  vitellia is that a question my honor and thy life are both secure discovery must destroy thee and my secret becomes as public as the capitol  sextus no fear not by my life and all things sacred here shall it rest deep buried in my bosom to death i will conceal it  vitellia i could trust thee if less thy love to titus against his rigor thy courage would sustain thee but his mercy his gentleness and friendship must subdue and melt thy soul to weakness hear oh

recall time past secure my honor seal up the senates ears or break thy fall when the grim lictor drags thee to the rock thy mildest doom to hurl thee down for ever  sextus thy counsels have been ever fatal to me and shall i trust them now my deafend ears still ring with thy reproach thy love avowed even for the man you raised my arm to murder  vitellia these were the rash effusions of despair the last i ever shall utter from this hour let peace and gentleness unite our hearts sorrow and shame have so subdued me since scarce have i power enough to ask forgiveness yet listen to my suit thy softened eyes beam sweet compliance yes thou do consent i read it in thy looks thy softening brow turn not away say do my hopes deceive me with my hearts wings spread over thee i wait pity my anguish speak oh speak and ease me  sextus i can forgive my wrongs and mourn thy sorrow i would obey thee too but my poor friend my generous annius he forbids my flight bids me sustain a thousand lingering deaths rather than poorly fly and let him perish  vitellia inexorable still then take thy fate my fears were most for thee i have a heart can give bold counsel in extremity a hand can execute and each resolved this dagger ends our strife draws a dagger  sextus for pity hold depend upon my faith  again i swear no torture from my breast shall wring the secret  to them publius with a guard publius i

hollow caverns and viewless winds stocks stones and natures basest vermin tribes endued with organs to proclaim the offense and hiss the treason to sure punishment break open the chambers of a furys den and find the inside of conspiracy to vitellia zanthia i sent thee to the senate thy sad looks like sorrows ushers ere i hear thy tale bid me forbode the worst  nay dry thine eyes despair in this

swarms to cluster in the forum the robed fathers as if they sat not judges of the crime but pale and anxious were themselves arraigned even breathing seemed suppressed by expectation and every eyeball shot beyond its sphere  vitellia shall i hear more or bid thee spare the rest my boasted resolution dies within me and like an untraind soldier ere the sight shrinks at the distant sounding of the charge but tell me all  i wish yet dread to hear thee  zanthia soon was the unhappy youth mournful abashed remorse not fear stamped on his gracious visage his pale cheek resting on his iron chain led forth to judgment while his stern accuser with eyes all fire though feeble from his wound flung heavy treasons on him  vitellia oh that tiger rash incapacity yet driving ever the wiser who should guide him to their ruin name him no more  but sextus  zanthia meek and sad he neither strove to palliate or deny but earnest begged as all the guilt was his he only he might bide the punishment

torn alive  vitellia barbarians monsters why revile the senate they sentence but the crime i made him guilty have thou more torture for me  zanthia thus condemned a general groan as if the mingled throng had but one breast shook all the spacious dome in copious streams tears gushed from every eye he only unappalld with modest grace in reverent silence bowed to own their justice the assembly rising his attendant guard led him to caesar who has since confirmed the sentence of the fathers and this hour illfated sextus dies  vitellia led him to caesar then hopes last ray is quenched my shame revealed his fate inevitable bastard conscience that dreading the detection urged the deed repentance for a child  enough retire  zanthia pardon your faithful slave i dare not leave you there is a

volleying sires pursued their speed nor cast one look behind  annius his blood this hour will glut their savage curiosity the surly keepers by the senates order from the gaunt lions hold their wonted food to whet their fierceness for the barbarous meal i saw their glaring eyes heard the deep growl portentous of the carnage they expected  cornelia i am most miserible my exulting heart beat high with joy to find thee innocent but oh i little thought a husbands honor could be redeemed but by a brothers death is no way left to save him  annius none but one and that he has rejected i was present a weeping witness of the interview softened almost to tears the gracious prince by the dear memory of their early friendship by duty faith and gratitude adjured him to make a full confession of the cause which wrought him to the attempt by such compliance deep in oblivion to entomb offense and give him back the wonted place he held first in his souls affection  cornelia could my brother hear it unmoved  annius oh no his streaming eyes his breast convulsed with passion deep fetched groans proclaimed the unutterable agony prostrate to earth he fell avowed his crime and in the frantic vehemence of grief called blessings on his injured masters head and curses on his own but to reveal the cause of his revolt nor threats nor prayers favor nor life nor fear of death could move him  cornelia then what remains for me i vainly hoped a sisters tears might move him from our infancy the tenderest union twined our hearts in love like blossoms from one parent stock we grow put forth the opening buds of youth together and both at once must wither oh believe it so dear so vital is my fondness for him to save my brothers blood i would meet pale death and clasp him like a bridegroom my next hope was in the emperors pity he alas forbids my intercession  annius never saw i passion so shake him his last wrathful words i hear their thunder still hence to thy doom unnatural were thy deeds thy end be dreadful  cornelia i rack my thoughts in vain yet oh i know were he not bound by some delusive tie of spurious honor to this fatal silence his soul would yield to friendships sympathy nor hide this secret canker which within consumes his life in silence  annius thine too with it but when were crimes confined in consequence yet leave me naught untried go seek the emperor again embrace his knees show thy sad eyes there is in womans tears a melting power mans nature cannot attain nor man resist perhaps he may relent  cornelia he must he shall god of persuasion with prevailing sounds endue thy suppliants tongue such as may wrest the brandished bolt from this imperial jove quench the red lightning of his terrible eye and for the fiery shaft of ruthless ire infuse sweet peace and melting clemency  exeunt scene  the circus titus publius senators lictors guards etc  lentulus and other conspirators in chains at the bottom of the stage  annius and cornelia following titus titus before the games begin lead sextus hither  cornelia and annius oh thou whose godlike nature never in vain kneeling together affliction kneeled to at your feet behold   titus cornelia rise think not the soul of caesar keeps one unshaken tenor while thy breast is heaved with anguish or that thick ribd ice surrounds a heart cold and insensible not to be thawed but by the melting power of drops from womans eyes  cornelia oh for my brother let my tears stream for ever the cold ground be channeld by my knees no accent heard but my perpetual prayer  titus a soundless voice beyond the tongues of romes best orators gesture or hybla periods here within pleads for him deep so trust me all offense against titus is absolved  cornelia why then with all is he absolved for you and only you has he offended   titus with the emperor the abstract of romes state and majesty who chiefly stands responsive for her weal some commutation must be made for mercy improvident to leave a noxious spring to burst out on the general health unsearchd would ill become my prudence or my fanctions observe him pray be silent  sextus brought forward by publius cornelia for a moment  but for a little moment  oh my brother seize now the trembling crisis of thy fate cast from thy soul this obstinate disease this vice of honor shameful in the extreme oaths with the wicked in themselves are void what is holy made unholy heaven adjurd against itself it cannot be in reason in virtue less  disclaim it oh disclaim it or reprobate at once both truth and wisdom  titus once more we meet the senate have condemned thee to a sore punishment romes peace disturbed offended majesty the laws infringed friendship betrayed both earth and heaven cry out for justice on thee  sextus both shall be appeased make my dire sentence still more horrible oh had i lives unnumberd as thy virtues and all paid down how poor the expiation  titus then hear my last award publius go thou pronounce to lentulus and his followers forgiveness life and freedom romans mark i know i pardon and forget their crimes  cornelia how my heart throbs o gods look down on sextus  titus i would not mix thee with the common herd to sextus the subjects of the state not caesars friends but wishing to restore thee to my heart would make thee worthy of it  sextus that vast treasure lost in a sea of guilt and sunk for ever no more must call me master  titus one condition so often proposed even now accept from titus and if in all our days of life to come one semblance of enstrangement from my brow reprove thee by its coldness call me loudly vindictive base  ascribe the good i mean thee not to my kindness but my fear to punish  sextus new torture new distraction how determine aside my silence will offend the generous prince and if i speak i must destroy vitellia  titus have you a care more instant than your life have you a bond more sacred than your duty have you a friend more cordial than your prince what no reply is then my pity for thee not worth the stooping for take heed rash man wake not again my anger  cornelia sextus brother pull not the unwilling thunder on thy head but stop it yet suspended  sextus extrication aside is most impossible i cannot it is in vain  titus proceed what do thou mean to tell me  sextus that the fates avenging fates have hurled their curses on me that i no longer can sustain the load of my sad destiny that i proclaim myself a traitor villain that i merit death and as the last the greatest boon implore it  cornelia not all the gods can save him  titus from this hour all pressures of affection quit my breast make it a plate of iron no soft touch to leave a print more than the reptiles trail wiped off with scorn and loathing armed files observant of my danger watch my steps place them around my table and my couch my food be tasted all my chambers searched for kindness is a fool dulleyed and dim losing the dolt who trusts him  annius emperor  titus away away i shall mistrust myself suspect my head may plot against my heart my hand be armed against both my natures frame is wrenchd by this convulsion  sextus deaths worst pang to cornelia in his enkindled wrath i have proved already then welcome all to come  titus hear me ungrateful though justice well might bid thy treacherous blood stream over these sands and from her steady throne unshaken hear thee howling yet for these unworthy as thou art who mourn thy folly i spare thy life but from my sight for ever from the wide precincts of imperial rome i banish thee approach no more this city nor me thy injured master else thy life with treble vengeance pays the disobedience sue not in vain for by olympian jove to cornelia this stands immutable  publius lead on  vitelia entering attended by zanthia vitellia stand off and give me way this is no time for forms and maiden coldness view me rome behold the bridal of your destined empress new pomp new triumphs wait your new augusta no hymen now shall wave his sprightly torch nor choral virgins strew my paths with flowers but the fell sisters wind the thin spun thread and death and horror deck my funeral couch  titus whence is that voice that makes my bosoms chords turning vibrate its mournful music ha our empress  vitellia where is the senate that condemned young sextus where he who durst accuse him turn to me ye undiscerning judges saw ye not a womans rage a womans jealousy kindled this brand of discord  titus do i wake sure the red sirius from his fiery orb scattering contagious frenzy through the air has smote the general reason all is infection  vitellia oh sextus sextus grovelling at thy feet thus prostrate on the ground let me approach thee pardon thy murdress whose fleeting soul just hovers at her lips to catch that sound and soon in nights eternal shade shall join thee  sextus stop this wild frenzy to the world proclaim not   vitellia o glorious frenzy would this feeble voice were loud as jove in thunder that the poles the high raised heaven might hear me i proclaim your cruel sentence void can they condemn the obedient hand the senseless instrument and let the forming head the prompting heart that instigate the crime pass by unpunished such sextus is the hand of my device by love well feigned by siren slattery by tears by soothing every wile i wrought him to plot his masters death is sextus guilty no i and only i revoke his doom if roman blood must gorge your lions maws cast forth vitellia to them  titus both i look at till wonder stifles anger  thou vitellia with rancorous hate to raise the assassins arm against my life  vitellia far dearer than my own thy native inborn gentleness deceived me and heightened kindness to a warmer flame oh it is the weakness of oerweening love to think a passion mutual where it is hoped i hoped thy hand thy throne but twice postponed i could not bear the affront and sought thy ruin i had no sex my heart was adamant  titus then thus the long sought mysterys revealed and thou the cause of all restore his sword the guilt which sprung from love i pardon freely and thus embrace thee for that perilous honor that nobly riskd thy life and braved my anger  embracing sextus vitellia then i have saved him every bounteous god on that forgiving head send blessings down may laureled victory grace thy arms in war and peace in soft security enfold thee for me a draught of deadly aconite winds its cold current through my freezing veins sextus farewell this serpent drinks my blood caesar i die  sextus what is this her quivering lips grow pale her gleaming eyes  vitellia shoot their last sires ere this i had been dust but hope to save thy forfeit life like a strong antidote a little while kept in the struggling soul  titus poisoned  zanthia too sure and by her own rash hand  vitellia a fathers gift more dear than life he gave me  titus unhappy fair one  vitellia oh let none lament me i was not formed for happiness on earth downy it rests on the soft texturd mind repelled from throbbing sensibility passions too strong a pride implacable had kept me restless even with all i wished one glance from thee to any other woman had i once called thee mine had fired my brain to some mad act to end like this in ruin light swims before me  titus  oh farewell dies  titus sextus delusions victim this way turn my heart once more is open to receive thee let friendships gentler steadier flame dispel the sad remembrance of that fatal passion  sextus may the black hour when first my heart conceived it be blotted from the roman calendar or if it circles with the round of time disasters mark it all things thought or done in that ill season like my luckless love find shame their issue till the dire increase of multiplied distractions end like this in blindfold rage and desperate self destruction  stabs himself cornelia horror on horror annius publius all arrest his furious arm he bleeds he dies  titus all but this blow i could have pardoned sextus this deed was all thy own it proudly spurns the life my friendship gave my heart rejoiced in  sextus my prince my friend my father benefactor most dear by every name though wronged in all ask thy great heart could i survive this shame has not this gazing city seen me shackled heard me pronounced a traitor doomed to die and worse than death have not my deeds deserved it there was no way but this i can no more oh would the darkness that invites my eyes might hide my name for ever oh dies  annius he is gone wringing his hands  titus annius i owe more tears to that pale corpse than rome shall see me shed break off the games let every sad and honorable rite hallow their urns farewell ill fated pair my sorrow shall embalm your memory and with your ashes be your frailties buried  curtain falls finis epilogue such is the force of customs powerful sway an epilogue must finish every play but when or where or why the mode began tell it some stageread scholar if he can i know enough for me that it is the fashion which governs this and every other nation and yet to try with some poor paltry jest to chase all tragic feelings from the breast appears to my weak judgment let me own like filling of the pail to kick it down nor less absurd than if some beauteous queen with mantle flowing and majestic mein more admiration of her charms to gain should choose a monkey to bear up her train pray tell would handels oratorios please if closed with bobbin joan or buttered peace yet since the tyrant custom bids us try to make you laugh whom we before made cry i wish with all my heart our proteus poet had rhymd me something merry that would do it no matter what of homely gills or jacks or beaux with spider legs and lizard backs how the bold spirit of the modern dame throned in her car drives the high road to fame while more delight the labor can afford to rule four coursers than obey one lord behold incumbent over her ponies backs the sounding lash our female jehu smacks through her small fingers plys her skilful reins and cheers the nags with hoarse equestrian strains gee rainbow peacock button gee along then squares her elbows and confounds the throng while her soft bosom too robustly feels a man like glory from her kindling wheels at these perhaps you have sometimes laughed before yet faith i wish you would laugh at them once more i would do my best to oblige you as i live then in return for once to oblige me strive nor now to modern france can we resort murder and crimes make melancholy sport once twas a happy land for all conditions now all is assignats and requisitions nor does the war with holland promise much for who ever brought home fancy from the dutch pepper and cheese they had let us not wrong em but scarce one sprig of bays ever grew among em the use of language as most travelers tell they think was only given to buy and sell and when three weighty words the price is spoke mynheer sinks down again to mum and smoke but now it is time to drop the mimic art and breathe one wish that swells each honest heart may britains sons with victory by their side make holland shake and humble gallias pride the god of battle through all dangers guard em and their best meed a nations thanks reward em
