patience for a few minutes    olivia most readily child what are your commands   clara i am an unhappy woman and as such have a claim to your compassion   olivia i have conceived a very good opinion of you clara and am sincerely sorry for any misfortune that may have happened to you i hope the hurt that you received by your fall has had no worse effects than you at first apprehended   clara alas madam my injuries are of a different nature the fall that i feigned to have received from my horse as i was traveling homewards was nothing more than a contrived excuse for concealing myself in these parts in short madam i am not what i seem   olivia that i have long suspected though i forbore to be inquisitive   clara you must know then madam that i am a woman of good birth and considerable fortune my name amelia the daughter of sir william hartley persecuted by my family who would have driven me into the arms of a man who is my mortal aversion i have taken refuge here under the disguise that you now see me wear   olivia really miss hartley your distresses affect me and i think you justified in the step you have taken give me leave to ask you what preference directed you to this neighborhood   amelia alas madam your question is a natural one but the severest that can be asked me what preference directed me hither it was a passion so deeply rooted in my heart that no time no injury can displace it twas love  how shall i excuse it to you  unhappy disappointed love  o frederick frederick dear false forgetful youth  air iv russell while on earths soft lap descending lightly falls the feathered snow nature awefully attending each rude wind forbids to blow white and pure awhile appearing earth her virgin mantle wears soon the fickle season veering her deluded bosom bares thus my foolish heart believing listened to his artful tongue all his vows of love receiving on each flattering accent hung fondly for a time mistaken love and joy concealed my fate now alas at length forsaken sad experience comes too late  olivia what do i hear was frederick was young withers thus ungrateful thus insensible let me hope amelia there is some misapprehension in this matter i know his intimacy with your brother and that he made him a visit this summer of some continuance   amelia it was then madam that my poor bosom lost that peaceful indifference it had ever before enjoyed my family were then in treaty with the person i mentioned to you before intoxicated with his extravagant offers they omitted no measures to engage me to accept his addresses nay they were desperate enough to employ frederick to solicit me but alas their advocate ruined their cause my heart first conceived a distaste to lord wealthy and the interposition of young withers confirmed me in my aversion   olivia but did frederick betray his commission by turning it to his own advantage   amelia i cannot charge him with that dishonor therein i must condemn myself it was my own fond unguarded heart that told him too plainly what it felt till one fatal moment my father surpised him kneeling at my feet and the next transported him from my sight for ever   olivia your relation my dear amelia is truly pitiable but as you know not what motives frederick had for so abruptly leaving you so i think you cannot positively charge him with infidelity   amelia dear madam how kindly you console me i own to you i have some hopes that frederick still remembers me and still loves me those hopes conducted me hither i find he is this day expected home this event and sir antonys ridiculous assiduities make it no longer possible for me to conceal myself at his tenants i must therefore retire till by some means i can discover the real state of fredericks heart what i have to entreat of you madam is for a short time to afford me the protection of your house   olivia most gladly my dear let us betake ourselves thither this instant before he comes and surprises you come my chariot is now at the door   amelia permit me madam to step as far as the garden gate and excuse myself to the young farmer who is waiting for me there with my cloak i will make haste and attend you   olivia at your own time  exeunt scene iv the outside of sir antonys garden henry is discovered sitting and composing a garland of flowers he rises i have made free with some of his worships flowers there is no robbery

henry believe me nor will i press it further upon you as i see it hurts you   henry it does indeed  and not that only but your leaving us mrs clara i know it will not arguefy what such a simple clown as i am can say to a person of your breeding  but i beseech you to tell me wherein father or mother or i have offended you if any things amiss that they can remedy they will be proud to do it i will vouch for them  and as for me if i be in fault i ask your pardon heartily on my knees   amelia nothing is amiss nothing kneel not to me young man your humility your tenderness oppresses me neither thou nor thy father nor mother nor any of you have ever offended me on the contrary i owe you all especially thee henry my thanks for a thousand services which are ten times more valuable as i am sure

it resolved   frederick sure i have not made a conquest of this poor wenchs heart without knowing it her enquiries would almost lead me to suspect it aside well i know no reason there is for concealing my mistresss name since she is now anothers  it was amelia hartley  you are now possessed of my story which i know not how you have drawn from me i must now leave you if you have any afflictions i sincerely compassionate you but insanity i hope is not amongst them there is my purse much may it comfort you so farewell    amelia hold sir your liberality is truly amiable but i need
