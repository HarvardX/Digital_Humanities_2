a sermon preached before the archbishop bishops and clergy of the province of canterbury met in convocation at the cathedral church of st paul on monday february  0   00  by w hayley dd dean of chichester  published by command of his grace the archbishop of canterbury  done into english from the latin original by w jones ab  london printed for j tonson under graysinngate in graysinnlane mdcci  the translator to the reader the following discourse having been delivered in a learned language to a learned and venerable auditory and upon a solemn occasion many welldisposed persons who are not acquainted with the latin tongue may be curious of knowing what is contained in it for the satisfaction of these men and for the sake of those two most desirable things which are here treated of peace and edification i have ventured to hand it into the world in our mother tongue  w j  a sermon preached to the convocation romans xiv    let us follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another these words of st paul recommend two things to us peace and mutual edification very proper to be discoursed of at this time as well as to be pursued throughout our whole lives to the one we owe whatever is pleasant and grateful to us in this life and to the other all the happiness we hope to enjoy in the next  nor does the apostle alone join these two together but even god himself and the nature of things require such a connection for while we live in peace we are more ready in finding out more happy in executing and more successful in promoting those things that tend to edification and whilst we study edification tranquillity of mind and brotherly love flow in of course from hence it seems very evident that he will never attain to either who does not prosecute both and that the one can never be true and genuine without the other that peace is false and impious which obstructs edification and he is not the servant of christ but of satan who under pretense of edification violates peace for thus st james argues jam iii v          who says he is a wise man and endued with knowledge amongst you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descends not from above but is earthly sensual devilish  that therefore peace and edification should every where and in all ages of the church go hand in hand together is highly necessary and our apostle in this his epistle to the romans recommends both for a special reason for the church planted at rome was then but young and tender its root not firm and deep and yet was exposed to the insults both of jews and gentiles there were in that city several weak brethren who were not well acquainted with the true bounds of a christian liberty v   v   one believed that he might eat all things another who was weak eat herbs and one man esteemed every day alike whilst another esteemed one day above another having not as yet sufficiently shaken off the yoke of the mosaical dispensation from both these extremes therefore very dangerous consequences were to be expected on one side it was to be feared lest the better instructed christians should by a vain ostentation of their liberty draw over the weaker to do that with which their conscience could not as yet comply which could never be consistent with edification hence the apostle advises v          judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brothers way i know adds he and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there is nothing unclean of it self but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walk thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom christ died  the danger that threatened on the other hand was lest the mutual contests and offenses arising about these matters should both disturb the peace of the church and give the common enemy an opportunity of scattering the flock of christ for it was very natural for the weak to condemn those as sinners who made use of a liberty which they looked upon as criminal and it was as natural for those who were puffed up with knowledge to despise them as ignorant who declined that liberty which they knew to be allowed by christ himself now what else would have been the issue of these contests but that the weakerminded would either have returned back again to judaism or have torn the church to pieces by schism and that the enemies of christianity would have taken occasion from the censure which each party passed upon the other to have crushed them both cutting off those who made use of their liberty as being wicked men by the testimony of the weak and oppressing the weak who in the judgment of their brethren were a foolish and inconsiderable sort of people for how mean an opinion must the infidels needs have conceived of that church which by the confession of christians themselves was made up of ignorant and impious persons  hence it is that st paul as a faithful minister of christ and one who regarded the salvation of both parties earnestly exhorts them in the first place to a mutual forbearance v    0       let every man says he be fully persuaded in his own mind but why do thou judge thy brother or why do thou set at naught thy brother every one of us shall give account of himself to god let us not therefore judge one another any more then he persuades those who had a right notion of christian liberty not to put it on as a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of god so to temper it with charity that disregarding matters of lesser moment they would chiefly mind those things that promote the glory of god and the good of souls after this he tells them that by these means the church would gain to it self protection from god and good will from men v          let not then says he your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost for he that in these things serves christ is acceptable to god and approved of men and then he subjoins the admonition here in the text let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another  the christian religion through the goodness of god was planted very early in these british islands and the same good hand of divine providence to the glory of god be it spoken has conveyed it down to us reformed in the last age rescued from imminent danger in our times and at present established and in a flourishing condition these are such instances of the divine favor as cannot be sufficiently acknowledged or proclaimed however the present state of our church is not so much better than that of the roman in the primitive times but that this advice of the apostle may be as applicable to us as it was to those romans the church of rome has so far departed from the ancient doctrine of st paul that having trampled under foot that true faith for which that church was formerly so famous throughout the whole world it is now become the bitterest enemy of our pure and primitive religion heathen rome it self not being more inveterate against the first christians than christian rome with shame be it spoken is at present against the modern asserters and maintainers of that ancient faith it seems to be the sole end and design of the abetters of that tyrannical see either to reduce the purer churches of christ to slavery and error or else to extirpate them by conspiracies war and bloodshed in the mean time into how many sects and parties are we protestants crumbled too secure alas under all those dangers that hang over our heads with how many contests and disputes many of which are of the same nature with those treated of by st paul in this epistle are we constantly perplexed and all this while the enemies both of the christian and reformed religion triumph openly the one railing against religion it self as the source of contentions and the others arming protestants against one another that so all of them in their turn may at last without the interposition of providence fall a sacrifice to roman cruelty  not one of us therefore singly can employ his private thoughts and endeavors better nor can all of us together who are met in this venerable synod direct our joint wishes and counsels to a nobler end than the following those things which make for peace and mutual edification if we neglect the latter we shall have a corrupt church and if we take no care of the former we shall have a divided and weak one or perhaps none at all  wherefore my main design at present is to lay before you fathers and brethren these things which are more especially necessary being recommended by the authority of the great apostle that upon a thorough view of their weight and value in the church we may all of us be constantly so far concerned for them as to seek them with our prayers promote them by our counsels and prosecute them by our endeavors and to this end i shall make use only of such arguments as occur to my thoughts upon considering the nature of the things themselves and the present state of the reformed church i shall speak first of those that relate to peace and secondly of such as belong to edification  i in discoursing of peace these two things deserve our particular enquiry   what sort of peace that is which we ought to follow   of what moment such a peace is our present circumstances considered  i first for the right understanding what sort of peace that is which we ought to follow we must distinctly consider with whom it is to be made because the bonds or obligations of peace vary according to the variety of the persons with whom we are to make it for by how much the closer men are apt to be united by having the same country or faith or discipline so much the more intimate ought to be their union who have all these things in common provided always that we take care if we meet with any with whom we cannot agree in all things yet we be still ready to agree with them as far as we can following herein the apostles rule phil      nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing and then it is to be hoped that at last if in any thing we be otherwise minded god shall even reveal this unto us  that there are some even among those who call themselves christians unworthy of peace the holy scriptures inform us and these the apostle both by precept and example orders to be cast out of the church such for instance are they who deny the fundamental articles of our faith or who openly allow of practices contrary to the christian profession of the former kind were hymeneus and alexander   timothy      who opposed the doctrine of the resurrection and whom st paul himself delivered unto satan   timothy    0 that by being chastised they might learn not to blaspheme of the latter was that corinthian teacher who was guilty of incest whom the apostle ordered to be punished after the same manner   cor        let such an one i say be delivered unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus therefore put away from among your selves that wicked person  we have too many of such christians falsely so called among our selves who not only deny the resurrection of the flesh but even that christ is come in the flesh who do not acknowledge father son and holy ghost the one true god of the christians in whose name we were baptized some we have who take away the merits and satisfaction of our savior and others who pretend their own are equal to his on one side we meet with those that reject the authority of the scriptures on the other with those that make their own traditions equal with them and impose upon us their private fictions of purgatory worshipping of saints and images and the infallibility of the pope as articles of faith necessary to salvation nor is it any wonder that the manners of these men are like their doctrines hence it is that the church of god has been either rent into factions or oppressed by a tyrannical power that magistrates have been divested of their authority though derived to them from god himself that the innocent have been exiled tortured and put to death and lastly that at the will and pleasure of the bishop of rome kings have been deposed the people robbed of their laws and estates and at last massacred but such doctrines and such practices can never belong to the church of god nor can any peace be observed with those who teach and avow such things but the utmost care ought to be taken that the peace of the church be not destroyed by their contrivances  i own indeed that a christian charity is to be exercised even toward these men how little soever they may deserve it and that all methods ought to be used to bring them to a better mind it is the part of a goodnatured man and a christian pastor to convince such persons of their error to represent the danger they are in and to admonish exhort and beseech them to return into the right way and such of them who through an invincible ignorance or the prejudice of education or the craftiness of their teachers have been so far seduced as to do they know not what may lay claim to a gentler sort of usage herein we follow the rule prescribed us by st jude while jud v    we save them with fear plucking them out of the fire though hating even the garment spotted by the flesh nor is it to be denied but that a man who is a true christian may in some cases act in conjunction with the enemies of his religion as for instance in trade civil offices the defense of ones country and the like neither will it be unbecoming us to carry our selves peaceably toward them in common conversation and the affairs of this life for this will make them sensible that the reason why we differ from them in matters of religion is the obligation of conscience and not a humor of opposition however they are to be excluded from the communion of our church from partaking with us in our sacraments and from joining with us in our public prayers for neither our temples nor the worship of god are to be profaned by the enemies of our religion according to that precept of the apostle   cor         be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion has light with darkness and what concord has christ with belial or what part has he that believes with an infidel  the apostle therefore does not admonish us to follow peace with those that subvert either the faith or manners of christians but with such who agreeing with us in the fundamentals of religion are of different opinions from us in other matters of lesser moment with these he persuades us to maintain as strict an union as possible and not to divide into parties but to stand by one another in a mutual defense against the common enemies of christianity he informs us that such weak persons as these are to be esteemed as brethren and that provided the substance of religion be secured we should not give way to passion and dissension upon the account of some trivial differences in opinions  but because as was hinted before in the same church some may happen to be united to others with more and closer ties than ordinary we are to consider what sort of peace is to be kept according to the variety of the several persons with whom it is to be maintained    in the first place then it certainly becomes us who are pastors of the same flock and ministers attending at the same altar not only to be united together by the bonds of peace but by the closest ties of love and affection by this means we shall be the more firm and constant in opposing the enemies of our religion and function and teach our respective flocks to demean themselves after the same manner toward all of us as we behave our selves toward one another for what thoughts would an atheist or an infidel or a weaker christian have of the whole body of the clergy if there should scarce be found one among them famous for his writings his dignity or the post he holds in the church whom some of his equals do not charge with ignorance craft or impiety and how can it be expected that the people should esteem us as pious and faithful ministers of christ unless we our selves who it is reasonable to suppose should know one another best testify to the world both by word and deed that we have really the same thoughts of one another  the church of england by the special providence of god has a double advantage which the unhappiness of the times in the beginning of the reformation denied to many of our neighbors the one that episcopacy is preserved among us the other that our ordination is in all respects perfect and handed down to us from the apostles themselves to testify how much we prize the former advantage let us honor respect and obey our bishops and that they may govern and protect us with the affection of fathers let us behave our selves toward them with the affection and duty of sons if as it sometimes happens in human affairs we should engage in any controversy with them let us beware lest by any undecent reflections on their persons we vilify their order bearing all due respect to the dignity of their station and being fully persuaded that whatever disgrace is cast upon the fathers will reflect upon the sons  and that the christian world may perceive how highly we value our ordination let us honor and esteem all those who have received the same holy orders with our selves let us imitate our ancestors on whom the apostles laid their hands and let us be animated by the same spirit of mutual love with which they were romans     0 being kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another as st paul expresses himself so long as we all preach sound doctrine let us neither envy nor censure those who do it either more or less dexterously than our selves nor let us account him as an enemy who when his belief of what god has revealed to us be the same with ours yet is not so happy as to explain himself exactly in the same terms with us but above all things this caution is more especially necessary that when we engage in any controversy in divinity we do not come to it with exasperated minds if any doubts arise let them be seriously weighed accurately discussed solidly handled and let truth be established by dint of argument not by opprobrious language but in case as it often happens that neither party can be convinced by the force of the arguments on the other side it will become them both to consider that being members of a well regulated church they ought to lay aside all contention and reflections and leave the point in question to be examined and determined by their superiors in doing thus we shall follow the apostles advice ephesians         let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying  and again let all bitterness and wrath and clamor and evilspeaking be put away from you with all malice    for the maintaining sincere peace among all those who profess themselves sons of our church it is necessary that they as members of the same body should be so intimately united as both to join with their pastors and with one another as well in the public worship as in brotherly love true it is that the variety of customs the several ways of living the particular constitution of our bodies and the like do occasion variety of opinions and different modes of acting in diverse instances one is for leading a life of austerity whilst another thinks that he may take his freedom in those things that are innocent some are for the exercise of a severer discipline toward offenders whilst others would have gentler methods to be applied some are of opinion that it would be best for the security of the church if those things that are established already remain as they are and those persons be kept at a distance from her who are not fully satisfied in every particular whilst others on the contrary think it more advisable that things should be varied according to the diversity of times and occasions that some allowances should be made to mens prejudices and that the terms of communion should be enlarged for the reception of weaker brethren into the bosom of the church but in these and such like instances which are matters of prudence rather than religion we may easily bear with one another whilst we all hold the same faith and all make use of the same prayers sacraments worship and discipline the church is but little beholden to those men who are for excluding out of it all that cannot in every thing think as they do and look upon them as enemies who are not friends just in their own way besides there are many things which god has not been pleased to reveal to us several others which perhaps it is our interest to be ignorant of and some still wherein we have no concern on which side the truth lies in such cases if men differ in their opinions it is not to be wondered at nor ought any offense to be taken from thence such varieties of opinions should not divide us into sects and parties for the church suffers no real detriment by them they seem to be too fond of quarrelling who upon the account of such trivial matters violate brotherly love and christian communion    there are many protestant churches abroad who hold the same fundamental articles of faith as we do though they make use of different ceremonies and discipline it were to be wished that they were better united among themselves and that all of them were in a closer union with the church of england than hitherto they have been that so though distant one from another in place and differing in some things yet they might be truly joined together in christian peace and communion it is indeed to be owned that some of these might rectify their sentiments in particular instances and it is matter of great concern that some others of them are so unhappy as to want that ecclesiastical hierarchy which has flourished down from the apostles times hence it comes to pass that they commonly decline communion with one another and if at any time the members of those churches happen in the same places to meet with the members of our church they do not without some difficulty join together in the same external worship and hence arises that alienation of affections that disunion of strength and that unsteady friendship which is to be observed among protestants it would certainly be worth our while and perhaps not unworthy the thoughts of this holy synod to consider how we might all become one body but by what means this might be effected what abatements or allowances in order thereunto might be made on either side is not mine nor any private mans province to determine only thus much we may be allowed to wish that for the honor of the christian and the safety of the reformed religion such an union may some time be brought about and that god in his mercy would teach all the protestant churches in general luke xix    to know at least in this their day the things that belong to their mutual peace before they be hid from their eyes that so at length that reproach may be removed which is so often cast upon us by the romanists of our not being the sons of peace who cannot tell how to agree even among our selves and that other means proving ineffectual we may at last be instructed by our misfortunes with brotherly love and united force to defend one another against the subtilty and power of the common enemy or if at any time which god prevent the same calamity should overtake any other of the reformed churches which has in our days befaln the french that in such case the dispersed and exiled brethren may by a communion both in temporals and spirituals find their own country and church in every protestant region into which they come    but the most difficult question is still behind viz what sort of peace is to be maintained with those who having the same country laws and religion in common with us yet for some reasons not proper to be enquired into at present are dissatisfied with our discipline or our liturgy and upon that account divide into parties choose themselves pastors and form themselves into separate communions their case is different from that of the foreign protestants these latter would have been glad of our church government if they could have had it at least they do not condemn it they are at liberty to use their own customs and ceremonies whilst the former withdraw themselves from the pastors of their own church and oppose that discipline which is established by lawful authority  we do indeed maintain some sort of peace with these for no open war or persecution is carried on against them and herein the truly laudable charity and moderation of the church of england is made manifest to the christian world that constant pains are taken by preaching writing and conference to satisfy the weaker of them and matters are managed with so much gentleness toward our dissenting brethren that without exasperating their minds we choose rather to gain them over into a willing compliance with the meekness of wisdom and yet there are still remaining separate congregations distinct pastors and a different sort of discipline however it does not seem advisable or christianlike to cast off so great a body of our people as lost and undone that they are not as yet past reclaiming is the opinion of many good men and that they may be reclaimed is the hearty desire of all let us therefore put up our constant petitions to the father of lights that he would at last vouchsafe to open their eyes that they may see what a gross error they lie under with what a deep wound they tear and weaken the church and what encouragement they give to our common enemies by their separation  nor ought we to despair but still to add our farther endeavors that at one time or other this so pious and beneficial a design may be accomplished the happy day may come which may produce what an age has denied us and at last a way be opened to us whereby we may satisfy the scruples of the dissenters without prejudicing the doctrine authority or discipline of the church and they may return into the bosom of their mother after too long an alienation from her than which nothing certainly could be more desirable to a christian or more fortunate to this church then we should have perfect and entire peace among our selves which is at present so lamentably broken and disturbed by separate assemblies and mutual jealousies  it is not my present business to enquire by what methods this most desirable peace may be obtained this is to be left to the piety and prudence of this venerable synod under the divine conduct of the spirit of peace and the author of concord whenever they shall think fit to enter upon the consideration of these weighty concerns having thus shown what sort of peace is to be followed and with whom all that remains under this head is to excite you to a vigorous prosecution of it which i cannot do better than by desiring you according to my proposed method  ii to observe of what great moment this peace is to us our present circumstances considered now it is of so great moment that almost the whole of religion depends upon it nor can it rationally be expected according to the present state of affairs that we should long have any church at all but by the means of unity and peace for the confirmation of this among many other arguments which the time does not permit me to run through i shall only produce these four    the church of rome most implacable to protestants has never shown her self more eager in contriving our ruin both by secret conspiracies and open force than at this time i need not tell you what fury it has exercised against some nor what arts it makes use of against others of the reformed churches these things are but too manifest to every one who reads any thing of the transactions of europe in france in bearne and in piedmont the very name of protestant is almost extinct every day we hear of many in those places condemned to prisons to galleys and to tortures the rest who have made their escape are reduced to live upon charity and compelled to seek new places of abode either here or elsewhere nor are we ignorant of the danger which threatens the protestants of the palatinate hungary and transylvania by these disasters we have lost some of the reformed churches and from these dangers we are in fear for others and if once the ruin of those remoter churches shall be totally accomplished this of ours will become an easy prey to the tyranny of rome nor can we otherwise be safe unless with united force we make so vigorous an opposition as to let our enemies know that whilst they exercise their cruelty toward our brethren we look upon it as if done to our selves  that such a peace and intimate union among protestants is highly necessary is what hardly any one can be insensible of but some perhaps will be apt to suspect that now it is too late and so it is to be feared it will be if in such a weighty concern we do not take some early care let us then be prevailed upon without delay to do our part toward the attaining of this end that by being at peace among our selves we may open a way to an universal peace if ever by the providence of god the churches abroad should unite one may very fairly suppose that such a thing would hardly be done but by the mediation of the church of england but how shall others make use of our counsels for the composing their differences if we can find out no remedy to our own gal v       all the law as the apostle speaks and all our safety is fulfilled in one word thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self but if instead of mutual love we bite and devour one another let us take heed that we be not consumed one of another and all of us together by our common enemy matt xii    for every kingdom divided against it self is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against it self shall not stand    the faith it self is endangered by mutual contentions and whilst warm debates and angry disputes are carried on among brethren about the punctilios of religion the blow really though not designedly falls upon religion it self it often happens that they who believe one and the same article of faith do differ in their manner of explaining it and whilst both are pleased with their own explanation one contends that it cannot be true in the others way of expressing it and the other that it must be true his way or not at all in the mean time the enemies of religion borrowing arguments from each party do infer that it must be certainly false and cannot be at all thus whilst some contend about the shadow they occasion others to lose the substance it would certainly be much better when the substance of our doctrine is the same to be less solicitous about other matters for whilst we are agreed in those things which god himself teaches it is not becoming either a modest man or a christian to contend eagerly about his own illustrations let the enemies of our faith rather perceive that we aim not at our own but at the glory of god and that we never fall out with those who together with our selves embrace the scripture revelation upon the account of our own private opinions  but from these contentions if they happen among pastors themselves a farther danger arises to the faith for we know that religion is planted increases and flourishes by their care and labors and that the greater esteem men have for them the more easily will they be persuaded by them now if they themselves charge each other with ignorance and error what else can be the issue but that the people moved by these reflections will despise or hate them and by degrees fall from despising the pastor to contemn religion it self it would certainly be more advisable for both sides to consult their mutual honor and reputation and if there should be a mistake in any case to conceal it rather than by exposing the weakness of particular persons to frustrate the success of their common endeavors    unless we maintain peace farewell to discipline and goodmanners without which the church cannot stand long for whilst factions prevail justice for fear it should seem to be severer on one side than the other is apt to proceed too timerously and ill men either conceal their vices in the mist of contention or if they be too manifest to be concealed then they shelter em by their zeal for one of the contending parties whilst the quarrel on both sides is managed with an immoderate heat neither party examines of what life or faith the men of their own side are but only how they stand affected toward the party nor is there any concern whether they be good men or no but only whether they be on our side but if these contentions are heightened into schisms the case is still worse for then the worst of men even the corrupters of our faith and manners by leaving one communion for another as occasion serves equally escape the censure of all but what sort of manners can we expect where there is no discipline and what sort of face is the church like to have when it is stained with corrupt manners how valuable soever a pure faith is yet a pure life will be always brighter and more esteemed vices pollute the soil in which they grow nor will any church preserve its honor whose members are christians by name but infidels in practice peace therefore is to be followed that we may prosecute vice and friendship maintained among good men that we may turn our whole force against impiety an enemy both to the salvation of our souls and to the peace of the church for neither can a church flourish or be secure unless care be taken of mens manners nor can there be any regulation of manners unless peace be preserved    by the loss of peace we together with it lose edification for there is no room for persuasion in the midst of heat and passion nor do those whose minds are possessed with the prejudices of contending parties easily attend to him that preaches faith in christ or piety toward god or the love of virtue when passion is laid the understanding is more apt to receive the truth and the will is the more easily moved by the weight of arguments if one side is angry so is the other nor does either of them consider what becomes themselves but what may prejudice their adversaries there is therefore need of peace both for the planting faith in our minds and also for promoting the fruits of faith integrity of life and the care of our souls conformable to this is what we meet with in scripture act ix    then had the churches rest throughout all judea and galilee and samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy ghost were multiplied whilst we enjoy the gentle gale of peace unbelievers are easily persuaded to embark in the same bottom with us if we are driven to and fro by our differences they had rather be at quiet in their own errors than be tossed about by our contentions nor can the church it self in the midst of perpetual storms hold out always against the violence of the waves it must sometimes come into port to refit it will want frequent repair to secure it from shipwreck and the care and vigilance of the builder must be constantly employed for its safety and preservation and this brings me to the other general head of my discourse viz to treat of the edification of the church  ii this edification has a regard to two things faith and manners both of them absolutely necessary to our salvation we have already seen that whilst we follow peace we take the wisest course to secure both our faith and manners but it still remains under this head of edification that we enquire how much it is our interest to take care of these things and by what other methods they may be preserved and maintained  i as to faith the more it is in danger the greater care ought to be taken of it but hardly in any age of the church have we heard of more shipwrecks made of the faith than are to be seen in our days to call in question the doctrines of the gospel to throw aside all revelation as a cheat nay to deny the existence of god or which amounts to the same thing to disown his providence is grown so fashionable that those who openly do so are no longer as formerly they were looked upon as monsters that only is reckoned liberty to think not what is most probable but what every one has the most mind to every man sets up his own private opinion for his religion and it is reckoned a meanness of spirit to suffer ones self to be directed by the word of god and the light of revelation  n so corrupt a state of things it is somewhat heroical to be inspired with the warmth of elijah and while almost all the house of israel follow after baal to be very jealous for the lord god of hosts   kin     0 patiently to suffer so many souls in danger to be fainthearted or to permit the lords vineyard to be trodden under foot of wild beasts this i say is a false way of following peace our force and courage is rather to be rallied under such an imminent danger and it will be our duty as becomes the soldiers of christ to find out attempt and execute to the utmost of our power whatever may reduce men to a sounder mind and to the communion of the church  for the more remiss we are in defending the faith the more will the enemies and corrupters of our religion exalt themselves the more securely will satan the betrayer of mans salvation sow his tares in the field of christ and it may be at last just with god in judgment to take away from us that faith which we have been so negligent in keeping and the light of the gospel being removed to suffer this ungrateful nation to fall back again into the darkness of infidelity or popery  but that we may escape such an unspeakable calamity having called upon god for his assistance that he would be pleased to enlighten those who are in error with the grace of his holy spirit    in the first place we must endeavor by conference by persuasion   timothy     by preaching the word by being instant in season out of season by reproving rebuking exhorting with all longsuffering and doctrine to convince the erroneous and reclaim them to the truth    we must endeavor to return such answers to the corrupt books which wicked men disperse abroad as may at once show our temper and their fallacies detect their errors instruct our flock and defend religion how successfully this was done in the late times when popery was growing upon us and upon other occasions we have found by experience to the great honor of our clergy and to the good of the church    we should very plainly and clearly in our discourses from the pulpit explain the articles of our faith to the people prove them out of the scriptures themselves and constantly teach of what use these doctrines are in this and how much they conduce to the happiness of the other life    we should take care as far as in us lies to encourage the setting up of schools wherein the poorer youth may be taught to read the bible and to understand the first rudiments of religion and to retain them in their memory    that those of riper years be more fully instructed in order to their being confirmed by the benediction of the bishop   pet      that they may be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks them a reason of the hope that is in them and that they may not for want of a solid foundation be born down by the attempts of deceivers ephesians      nor be any more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive  and all these things by the blessing of god are generally practiced among us both to the good of souls and the honor of this church one thing is still to be wished and how it might be obtained i leave to the judgment and prudence of my superiors viz that some method may be found out whereby all those who are eminent for their birth station or wealth may be obliged to instill betimes these important matters into the minds of their children and to instruct them thoroughly as they grow up in the christian religion to teach them what the articles of our faith are on what foundations they are built and by what arguments defended against atheists heretics and infidels for the rise and growth of our misfortune is chiefly owing to this that these young gentlemen except some few on whom the care of their parents or the discipline of an university bestow a more happy education neglecting the business of religion conform themselves to the manners of the age and being furnished with a little humane learning or rendered more confident by a smattering in philosophy think it genteel to doubt of sacred truths to laugh at revelation and to form each for himself a new or no religion as the fancy takes him from these the infection descends to the people for they are the persons whom when young those of the same age imitate and whom when grown up all men make their court to god grant that some suitable remedy may be applied to this unhappiness that religion may not be run down chiefly by those who are more indebted to god than others by whose authority the vulgar ought to be kept within the bounds of their duty and by whose example they should be taught to lead regular lives and to reverence things sacred  ii the second and withal the most necessary part of edification is that which relates to manners for let our faith be never so sound and orthodox if in our manners we act counter thereto our church will never be esteemed as truly christian all men cannot pretend to judge of opinions but all may be judges of our lives the wiser sort may perhaps come over to us for the sake of truth but to win over the vulgar we must adorn the purity of our doctrine by integrity of life it is true indeed in the reformation of manners we are to struggle with a very corrupt age but the more corrupt the age is the more occasion is there for us to endeavor in the first place that things may not grow worse and then that they may alter for the better nor can we bestow our pains on a work more acceptable to god more becoming our selves or more beneficial to our flocks the church of england was reformed by our ancestors from the corruptions of popery in matters of faith how much will it be for our glory to be instrumental in transmitting it down to posterity purged at last from a practice unsuitable to its doctrine  but that these our attempts may meet with a happy issue endeavors ought to be used    that ecclesiastical discipline may be restored that we may obtain this favor at least of the secular power that they would not weaken but rather strengthen our hands whilst they are employed in promoting the public safety for the corruption which we labor under both in faith and manners is to be imputed to the loss of our discipline    that we procure as far as may be good laws to be enacted against public and scandalous vices especially and that such men may be afraid of the civil sword who do not stand in awe of the censure of the church    that magistrates be excited to add life to the laws already in force against ill manners by putting them into execution that they may not by their remissness suffer vice to grow headstrong whilst the remedy grows weak    that we constantly show the people the necessity of a holy life in our discourses writings and preaching and fully convince them that there is no hope of pardon without a sincere repentance nor any way to salvation but by holiness of life  i shall add only this one thing more which is of the highest importance that the clergy would by their examples give life and strength to all these things and stir up the people committed to their charge by showing that themselves are concerned for these weighty matters not only in their preaching but in their hearts and practice nothing will have a greater influence upon the common people to incline them to perform all the parts of a good life piety toward god obedience toward the king justice and charity toward their neighbors and sobriety and modesty toward themselves than the perceiving that all these duties are not only recommended by the discourses of their pastors but visibly proposed to our imitation in their lives and actions  let me therefore reverend fathers and brethren exhort you i do not say to do these things for i am fully persuaded that this is your constant practice and i make no question but your flocks will readily acknowledge it but rather that you would be earnest in your prayers to god that all these things may be constantly and steadfastly performed both by our selves and through the influence of our example by the whole body of the clergy    that our piety may be eminently conspicuous to our flocks through all the parts of the sacred ministry that in celebrating the public prayers in the administration of the sacraments in preaching the word of god and in all the other divine offices we may demean our selves with so much care gravity and diligence as may make it appear that we have always god in our view that we make his glory our only aim and that as becomes faithful ministers of christ we look upon no labor and vigilance too much that is bestowed in the taking care of souls    that we still may preserve that reputation of loyalty toward our king for which the church of england has been so famous throughout the whole world we do not find in all our history that god ever blessed us before with a prince who deserved more of the reformed religion in general and of our church in particular may there not be met with in the annals of posterity any instance of a more grateful and dutiful clergy we are sufficiently sensible of the envy of ill men and have found by experience that there are some who would have us pass for suspected persons and such as have not a steady affection for the government let us by an openhearted loyalty and obedience stop the mouths of these malicious persons and let it appear that they are only the enemies of religion it self who calumniate the ministers of our religion as defective in their love affection and duty to their prince    that we may recommend justice and mutual love to our people it is to be wished that we may always demean our selves justly and affectionately one toward another that we who are sons may be ready to pay all due obedience and honor to our fathers in christ and that the fathers themselves may not oppress those who are under them but govern them with kindness and lenity   pet v   not as being lords over gods heritage but being ensamples to the flock that if at any time it shall happen that we meet and consult together in one body matters may be discussed calmly and deliberately without noise or clamor and that it may be evident that the sole good of the church not any private disgust does influence our debates and that whilst we act separately in our ordinary stations we may always be so far united in mutual kindness affection and assistance that our hearts may conspire in finding out and our hands be ready to join in executing whatever conduces to the honor of god and the salvation of souls    lastly let us beseech god that he would vouchsafe to grant us all the special grace of his holy spirit that sobriety modesty temperance and the contempt of worldly things may shine forth in us that our flocks may be convinced that we are heartily solicitous about our own souls and are not overfond of this world whilst we preach to them of another to come but that   cor      we bring into subjection our bodies and desires lest that by any means when we have preached to others we our selves should be castaways let us walk before them with such uprightness of manners and sanctity of life that they may say that god is in us of a truth such manners will give weight to our sermons and counsels by this means whatever we jointly decree will carry its authority whatever we publicly preach will have its force and whatever private admonitions we give will be accompanied with a pleasing sort of command over the minds of men by such an example as this we shall truly edify the church render it flourishing in our times and durable to afterages and every one of us after the finishing of his pious labors in the lords vineyard shall close his days with the same consolation wherewith our holy apostle st paul says that he supported himself   timothy       i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day  to whom with the father and the holy ghost the one true and eternal god be praise and glory for ever and ever amen finis
