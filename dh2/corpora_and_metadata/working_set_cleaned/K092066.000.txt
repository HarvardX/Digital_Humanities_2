an account of a new poorhouse erected in the parish of boldre in new forest near lymington       london printed at the philanthropic reform st georges fields  an account etc the following account of the erection of a poorhouse in the parish of boldre in new forest is intended to show how cheaply and yet how comfortably the poor of a parish may be maintained with good management under the present poor laws  the old poorhouse of boldre being a wretched place and managed without any economy at a great expense it was determined at a vestry held in the year      to build a new one on a better site to put in a respectable master and mistress and to give the overlooking of it to a monthly committee of the gentlemen and farmers of the parish  accordingly they borrowed the sum of  00 l and bought a piece of ground about two acres and an half elevated dry and airy here they built their house at a little distance from the road and yet near enough to be under the constant eye of observation it is built substantially of brick single that the air may have a free passage through it and extending about eightytwo feet in front and twenty in breadth these dimensions give an excellent workroom on the right as you enter and on the left a kitchen and back kitchen the masters room which is also the committeeroom about eighteen feet by fourteen occupies the center and has a window on one side inspecting the workroom and another on the opposite side inspecting the kitchen above stairs the sleeping chambers are separated nearly as those are below only as there are commonly more women and children in a poorhouse than men a room at the end of the mens apartment is taken off for a sick room with a separate staircase above the chambers are excellent garrets behind the kitchenpart of the house are the pantries and other conveniences among which is a storeroom thirty feet long  the ground between the house and the road which is a falling space of about sixty yards is divided first into a dry convenient playyard for the children and the remainder about half an acre running down to the road is a garden the larger garden which is about an acre lies behind the house  the house being thus erected and sufficiently dry the inhabitants of the old house consisting of nine or ten men and women and between twenty and thirty children were brought into it on the   th of may      and the whole put under the care of mr and mrs salter whose characters will hereafter be shown at large in the excellent management of every part of the institution  a more disorderly set in every particular than this family was when mr salter received it first under his care cannot easily be conceived when he had brought them a little into order and shown them it was his wish to be kind and friendly to them he got them by degrees to go on regularly in the business and duties of the house both he and his wife are well acquainted with the whole business of spinning and weaving and having set up a couple of looms and a number of spinning wheels he generally presides over this part of the business himself and mrs salter over the economy and management of the house both departments are admirably conducted the inhabitants are all employed in that business they are most fit for some of the old women in cooking mending and washing the old men in the garden the children and some of the women in spinning and weaving children even of four or five years of age are employed and earn about a penny a day in summer they come into the workroom at six in winter as soon as it is light at breakfast they have an hours respite and the same at dinner they have all tasks which are so easy that if they work hard they can finish them by two in the afternoon but without any exertion by six  with regard to their food on sunday they have beef pork or veal as each happens to be cheapest with plenty of vegetables and four ounces of bread for grown persons and three for children on monday they have the remains warmed with vegetables and bread on tuesday each grown person has a pound of pudding and the children three quarters of a pound on wednesday beef or pork or veal as on sunday on thursday the remains as on monday on friday they have generally soup made of a bullocks head with vegetables and bread as usual on saturday a clearance is made of all the remains in the house and if they fall short the deficiency is made up with bread and cheese for breakfast beefbroth or milkbroth is provided and at supper the regular meal is six ounces of bread and an ounce of cheese for every grown person and for children four ounces of bread and three quarters of an ounce of cheese this is some times varied with potatoes which the children like better every thing is good in its kind the children seldom eat up all they are helped to and the remainder is fried up again the next day among the remains during the present scarcity of breadcorn mrs salter has used a less proportion of wheat and a larger of potatoes particularly for supper during the winter of the year      the boiled potatoes and onions and mixing them well together fried them with a little lard the people were in general fonder of this dish than of their usual meal  four bushels and a half of malt are allowed each month for beer i must add that the master and mistress generally fare as the family does though it is not required by the committee  the clothing of the poor is equally good every one has a new suit for sunday generally spun and woven in the house it is carefully hung up at night and the old clothes produced for the week  thus the poor are well lodged well fed and well clothed and yet on deducting their earnings at less than half the expense they cost the parish before their food upon an average is scarcely ever estimated at so much as nine pence a head weekly whereas in the old house with continual complaint the allowance was just double though provisions at that time were much cheaper than they are now  in the article of clothing much more is saved though the poor are now so decently clad yet by care and management the whole expense of the clothing this last year including shoes amounted only to    l   s   d whereas the expense of clothing the poor in the old house did not amount to less one year with another than  0 l annually in one year it reached  0 l and this might possibly be without any dishonesty on the part of the parishofficers for as there was no care taken to keep the clothes in repair nor any distinction made between old and new the poor were always in rags and yet always craving for new clothes  another great saving where there is a well regulated house is made in the article of outdoorspoor there are numbers of people in every parish who are too proud to go into a poorhouse or may perhaps be under no necessity who are yet very ready to receive a weekly dole of a shilling or eighteen pence a week their plea is if you cannot take us into a house you must maintain us out of one when this plea is cut off numbers of them find the means of maintaining themselves several indeed under the character of outdoorspoor every parish must maintain but the offer of a good house draws a line between those who ought and those who ought not to have this indulgence in the old house the expense of the outdoorspoor was about   or   pounds monthly it is at this time only   l    s  another article of saving is in the health of the poor in the other house there were often contagious fevers and other disorders from the closeness and nastiness of the place and its inhabitants and though a parishdoctor was regularly paid yet the expense for wine and other cordials whether necessary or unnecessary was often considerable whereas the airiness and cleanliness of the present house  the good clothing  the wholsomeness and plenty of provisions together with the care taken in keeping the family clean have under god such an effect upon their health that no epidemical disorder or indeed disorder of any kind has appeared among them the face of the parishdoctor is hardly known  to all these articles of saving may be added the care and integrity of the master and mistress every thing makes the best end the very crumbs from cutting the bread for each meal are put into the milk or broth or whatever is next prepared and this is the more praise worthy as neither the bread nor meat is in any shape farmed to the master so that what he does is done entirely from an honest principle of serving the parish it would not indeed be difficult for him if he were so disposed to turn much to his own advantage especially as he keeps the accounts of the parish for which he is well qualified both by his skill and his integrity  by all these modes of care economy and integrity together with the profits of the houselabour a saving in the poor rates of the parish was made this year of     l   s   d notwithstanding the advanced price of provisions and a variety of expenses necessary in a new establishment  without doors things are managed with the same care and order both the gardens belonging to the house are in highest degree of cultivation and bear such quantities of potatoes and cabbage the chief vegetables used in the family that the master finds he is not only sufficiently supplied but has enough to feed his hogs and often to give away to his poor neighbors a theft one night was committed in the gardens and at least two hundred weight of cabbages carried off when somebody was bemoaning the loss to the master it was a pitiful thing he observed to steal from a parish workhouse but in the light of an inconvenience to him it would have been none if they had carried off twice as much his ground is so well dunged and so productive that among a number of large cabbages he had the curiosity to weigh one that seemed larger than the rest and found its weight to be twentyseven pounds after the outside leaves had been stripped off during the scarcity of the year      he was obliged indeed to purchase potatoes  but the economy of this excellent institution is not more pleasing than the cheerfulness and happy air with which every thing is conducted the old women when they behave well have little indulgences of tea and snuff which they value much the men of tobacco and the childrens tasks are made pleasing by giving them little gratuities out of their earnings the master has the art of turning even their playhours to use and yet making them more happy than if they were left to themselves if he want the stones for instance picked out of the garden with a small gratuity to those who pick the most he sets uch a number of little hands at work that the business is soon accomplished or if he want dung brought into the garden he yokes half a dozen of them to a wheelbarrow and makes one of them the waggoner with a long whip but without the power of exercising it this employment is very pleasing it is good exercise and presently dispatches the business if the master happen to have no emloyment for them during their playhours e often makes it he will send for instance hree or four of them if the afternoon be e to some distant part of the parish with  letter of no consequence but to amuse them with a walk and teach them to be trusty in a charge or in nuttingseason he will send three or four of such as he can best depend on to gather nuts in the forest but with condition that whatever quantity they gather shall be divided with those who stay at home this year      was so abundant in nuts and such quantities were gathered that mrs salter thought it prudent to take the management of so large a store under her care and distribute it in doles  but none of these amusements are allowed till theirs task are performed sometimes in a fine morning the master signifies his intention of thus employing three or four of them on which the wheels run with prodigious rapidity and all business is over by two in the afternoon he suffers them also in summer to rise very early in the morning before the family is up and go down quietly to their work which they are very eager to do such work appears like voluntary labor the condition on these occasions is not to speak a word till the clock strike six which is the appointedhour and this condition the master says he believes is punctually complied with he often hears the whirling of the wheels but no other sound these little restraints are very useful in habituating children to order and decency  to exemplify the happiness which the individuals of this wellregulated house enjoy i might produce several instances i shall specify a few  two old women reduced to the lowest degree of penury and really starving if their neighbors had not assisted them resolutely held out and declared that they would rather die under a hedge than go into the poorhouse if such a declaration had been made in the time of the old poorhouse they might still have been objects of pity but at this time it rather cooled the charity of their friends who indeed thought that maintaining them out of the house was encouraging a discontented spirit against an institution so well conducted and in every light so advantageous to the poor this had it is effect as winter came on and fuel grew scarce their pride which had a great share in their resistance gave way and they were driven to seek the comforts of a warm kitchen fire at the house a very short time convinced them of their folly and they soon declared they had never lived so comfortably before  there was an elderly man in the parish of the name of brown he had been bred a thatcher but was able to work at any kind of labor he was sensible honest and goodnatured in a great degree and being a stout robust fellow he might have made a very good livelihood but he was so totally careless of wha he earned so thoughtless and imprudent it every respect that he went about in rags an never knew where to get a dinner at noon or a bed at night indeed he had reduced himself at length to such a degree of weakness and wretchedness that he could hardly craw about in this necessity hunger at length drove him into the house here plenty o good provision soon recruited him and he be came a useful member to work of no kin he has objection he digs the garden h carries out work he brings meat from the market often mr salter lets him out to work on account of the parish in thatching ricks and cottages he is particularly useful the money he earns he always brings honestly home out of which he receives for his own use a penny in the shilling in the mean time he is perfectly happy he is well clothed well fed and well lodged and as to money as he never knew the advantages of it the want of it is no distress the few halfpence he receives he never keeps in his pocket longer than till he has an opportunity of distributing them among the children and old women of the house among whom he is so great a favorite that the latter show their gratitude to him by tricking him out on sundays with all the neatness they are able he who used to go about the parish in rags not worth picking off a dunghill now goes to church in a good suit of clothes his breast is unbuttoned and displays a deep ruffle hanging out neatly plaited his cravat is well washed and a black ribband is tied round his neck his ambition and consequence were one day raised when a stranger coming out of the church and looking with pleasure on the orderly procession of the workhouse family pointed to brown and asked if he was not the master of the house it should be remembered however that with all his profuseness he was mindful with the first money he received to pay his debts these amounted to fourpence which in some pressure of his affairs he had formerly borrowed and now remembered this singular character though he is so industrious that mr salter thinks he maintains at least four people by his labor is yet so attached to the house that nothing could prevail with him to leave it his neighbors often tell him what a fool he is thus to work for other people when he might earn his own money but brown is philosopher enough to know himself and has had sufficient experience of the extent of his own prudence not to trust himself under its direction again while he can live under the care of so kind a master  but the great merit of the master and mistress of this well established house consists in instructing the ignorant and reforming the abandoned every morning when the bell rings for breakfast the family all assemble in the kitchen each knows his place so there is no confusion and a strict silence is injoined soon after the master comes in and reads and generally explains which he is very able to do some easy and practical part of the new testament after this they all join in prayer on sunday morning and evening these exercises are enlarged and accompanied often with singing hymns in which the children join they sometimes sing hymns also at their work when twenty or thirty spinning wheels are all going together the master says he would oftener introduce singing hymns at their work but he judiciously observes that the slowness of the measure is too apt to introduce slowness in their hands one tune however has particular credit with him the movements of which are well adapted to the motion of the wheel and for that reason it goes among them by the name of the spinningwheel tune all other singing the master forbids which appeared rather hard his reason for it however is good he has no objection to innocent songs but as he found he could not draw a line between them and such as were corrupting he thought it necessary to forbid all together the penalty is the forfeiture of the little earnings of the day from their labor they regulatly attend church on sundays and it is a pleasing sight to see so many well clothed figures happy faces and healthy countenances issuing from a parishworkhouse in the afternoon on sunday the children attend the school where they are catechized with the other children of the neighborhood the old people also attend with them  the good order of the house is preserved rather by rewards than punishments when this family was first received from the old house the master had occasion for all his prudence to manage and bring them into order their habits of idleness and wickedness were so strong and their ideas of order and discipline so weak that he had great difficulty in preserving the true medium between too lax and too strict a government if he had corrected every thing he saw amiss he must have been continually correcting and might have irritated and hardened his great art therefore was to find excuses for passing over many faults and yet to make the children believe he would pass over none when he had informed a boy for instance that he meant to punish him in the evening his wife as if ignorant of the matter would send him to bed with the rest in the morning he would call up the boy and let him know how angry he was with him and how severely he would have punished him if his mistress had not sent him to bed however as the matter was now over he would pass it by this time sometimes however to show he was in earnest he would punish an extraordinary offense with severity at the same time he endeavored to show that he was much readier to reward than punish when any thing was done which he approves thus by keeping a steady hand and not hastening the work of reformation too quickly he brought them by degrees into good order and when he had once gotten his first set orderly it was easy to keep up an orderly family such as came in afterward though obstinate and refractory could not fight against so disciplined an establishment like headstrong bullocks yoked in an orderly team they could not well be mischievous as his plan is to rule rather by affection than fear in which he has been very successful his punishments when he has now brought his establisment to this orderly state are very few and gentle they consist chiefly in locking up delinquents in a room by themslves or abridging them of a meal but these happen rarely when he thinks himself under a necessity of punishing a boy corporally knowing the illfame which masters of workhouses commonly lie under he chooses to have some respectable person present but he is never driven to this extremity but in cases of theft or other atrocious wickedness  in this orderly house where all bad examples are removed and scenes only of piety industry and regularity are before the eye several refractory and some abandoned people have been reclaimed among the children it is hoped these instructive lessons will have the best effect but among the old people some who had led loose disorderly lives as a forest is not the best nursery of virtue have acknowledged themselves much happier in a state of decency regularity and virtue and have accordingly changed their manners and become orderly people of this two or three instances might be given  one of the greatest instances of the happy influence of this house in reclaiming obstinate wickedness was shown in a woman of the name of young her father a reprobate fellow had been thrown into winchester jail for deersteeling and as he could not pay his fine which was thirty pounds he was tempted to obtain his liberty by accepting the post of countyhangman which he held till his death her mother was a noisy bawling woman who neglecting her family used to beset all passengers at the bridge and clamor loud of the hardness of the times and the necessities of her family two or three of whom she used generally to produce in rags to confirm her distress the children of such parents could hardly be supposed to turn out well the girl of whom we now speak had been put to school with a view to teach her some good and keep her out of more harm but it had little effect as soon as she could use her hands dexterously she began to pilfer and with such ingenuity that it is probable she had learned some lessons from her fathers conversation who had always lodgings among his old friends in the jail during his periodical excursions to winchester to do him justice however he showed a laudable fear lest his daughter should come judicially under his hands and has been known to tie her up and correct her very severely his severity however only turned her from one kind of wickedness to another she next introduced herself to a regiment of soldiers who were marching through the country with whom she lived till disease sent her back to her parish she had now no home her father and mother being dead she was sent therefore to the old poorhouse which has been described as a place not much calculated to produce reformation when she was cured of her disorder she went off again leading the same profligate life she had led before and this was repeated two or three times in this state she was brought to the new house which at first was a state of uneasy confinement to her but by degrees the comfortable life she now led  the recollection of what she had suffered  and the scenes she had gone through though she was yet only a young woman gave her mind a new turn and she became a thorough penitent her credit indeed is now so great that the master has made her one of his superintendants over the children at work  thus a happy and useful society for such it may be called is formed out of the dregs of the parish the old people having all their wants well supplied feel themselves happier than they ever did before and are glad to render cheerfully in return what little services they can and the children bred to industry and virtue stand a good chance of being formed from little profligates into useful members of society  the parish of boldre will long remember the humanity and integrity the judicious management and the religious care of the master and mistress by whose means chiefly this excellent establishment has been so happily completed  the truth of the above particulars is attested by the three following members of the committee two of whom are in his majestys commission of the peace for hampshire and the other is minister of the parish of boldre  john walter thomas robbins william gilpin vicar
