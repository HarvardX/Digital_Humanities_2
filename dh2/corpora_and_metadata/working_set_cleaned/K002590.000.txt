methodism displayed and enthusiasm detected intended as an antidote against and a preservative from the delusive principles and unscriptural doctrines of a modern set of seducing preachers and as a defense of our regular and orthodox clergy from their unjust reflections  hold fast the form of sound words   timothy i    be no more tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive ephesians iv    believe not every spirit  many false prophets are gone out into the world   john iv   london printed for henry cook under the royal exchange m dcc lvi  price sixpence  it being presumed this short address is calculated to preserve the wellmeaning and unwary from being misled and deluded therefore such of the clergy etc who are inclined to give them away may have them at   s per hundred  pro bono publico  methodism displayed and enthusiasm detected etc christianity is a pure perfect rational consistent system it is a revelation worthy the god of truth and wisdom to dispense its doctrines have a direct tendency to moralize the powers and faculties and to enoble and dignify the human nature it sets its true professors free from ridiculous absurdities and enthusiastic delusions for its divine author taught no doctrines enjoined no precepts but such as will bear the strictest scrutiny and must be owned by every truly wise and judicious person to be well adapted and nicely calculated at once to display the power and mercy of god as well as to enrich consolate and make happy the mind of every true christian  but how an institution thus wisely designed ordered and established should be so greatly mistaken so unhappily perverted and so grossly misrepresented is no less surprising than true and therefore how much to be deplored and lamented but why is this how must we account for the many delusive tenets and destructive errors which are industriously propagated by a set of modern teachers and readily embraced by so many professors of christianity how why as the papists mistakenly assert ignorance to be the mother of devotion we may truly say ignorance is the parent of error folly and delusion  but to what kind of ignorance may we ascribe the mistakes of the teachers and the folly of the people in being thus deceived doubtless to an ignorance of the word of god the holy scriptures which are the only sure guide the best standard and the most certain criterion whereby to discern truth from falsehood right from wrong but through neglect of searching those sacred pages the poor people easily become a prey to every ignorant enthusiastic preacher that comes in their way hence we see such a plentiful production of novel doctrines and such an abundant fruitfulness of extravagant follies and destructive errors which are so prevalent among us at this day  men brethren and fathers see ye not what an inundation of error and delusion has broken in upon us observe you not the overflowings of immorality and vice which like a torrent is overspreading our land can you be unconcerned when the dreadful effects and baneful consequences are so visible and evident alas virtue reclines her fainting head morality is almost banished but in name the golden rule of doing to others as we would be done by is neglected and disregarded how few advert to the plain requisition of the prophet to do justly love mercy and walk humbly before the lord surely it is too plain to be denied we have forsaken the true principles of the gospel christianity has lost its powerful influence upon us and therefore the practice of morality and good works is so much neglected so little attended to o ye ministers ye professed teachers and instructors of mankind will not ye attempt to stem the rapid torrent which threatens to carry all before it there is no way left but to retreat to the primitive doctrines of the gospel the established principles of the reformation these these constantly insisted on and powerfully inculcated will nay these only can be attended with the happy effects of reclaiming the people from error rectifying their principles and effectually producing christian practices as for you my brethren brethren professors of the same gospel let me entreat and conjure you if ye would be true protestants against the fallacy and deceit of the church of rome as you would desire to be proof against all doctrines of novelty all erroneous principles all dangerous and delusive tenets would you perceive and detect and so beware of deceiving teachers false prophets hypocritical and pretended ministers in one word are ye sollicitous to come to the knowledge of the truth as it is in jesus that so ye may be saved search the scriptures make this your constant practice for be assured ye are in the utmost danger of being missed and deceived never more so than at present on the one hand by the proud selfpresuming godresisting infidel on the other by the credulous unscriptural unmeaning enthusiast while the former is an open enemy to the doctrines of the gospel totally rejects every article of the christian faith acts as far wide from the moralizing precepts of the gospel as from humility the latter the enthusiast deceives himself and others by his mere pretenses to inspiration professes to have received the gifts of the spirit but gives no evidence to ascertain the truth of it makes solemn declarations of being inwardly moved by the holy ghost to preach to you and only pretends to pray to god for spiritual operations influences and impressions but after all it is plain to the eye of discerning reason he means nothing but to make gain of his pretensions to godliness for contrary to his most solemn pretensions and professions he utterly denies any true real inward motion operation and influence of the spirit and hence does he bewilder amuse and perplex the ignorant and unwary by teaching unsound unscriptural doctrine  take heed to yourselves beware of such pretended teachers for you are liable to be led by such into a maze of antichristian errors and a wilderness of unscriptural perplexities so as that your danger through their means may not easily be escaped nor ever rectified it is not a trifling affair i am now addressing you about but it is my brethren of the utmost concern and of the greatest importance no less than your souls are at stake nothing less than an eternity depends upon your being wise unto salvation for your sakes and in regard to your safety suffer me here to introduce some of the truly scriptural orthodox articles of the established church of england which as they are a kind of epitome or abridgment of the gospel i shall select such of them as may best serve our present purpose namely to try and examine doctrines and teachers by to detect error and discover truth by these let us determine our assent to or dissent from such doctrines as are proposed to us and i am verily persuaded we shall escape error avoid delusion and be freed from mistakes  perhaps a fond attachment to our excellent established church of which i am a member may influence me rather to fix on this form of sound words than any other of human composition be it so i am i think herein justified forasmuch as these articles are supported by and built upon the holy scriptures therefore i am unconcerned what our modern teachers and new pretended divines think or say of me if they dislike and are ashamed of our articles i am not for all our christian bishops heavens bless them and all our church parsons lord have mercy on them they all own them and subscribe to them ay and swear to them too and they are publicly printed in all our common prayer books for what use think ye but that we should read them know them be instructed in them and always abide in them god grant brethren that we may for if we are happily interested in the great truths they contain vain will be all the artful attempts subtle designs and nefarious stragems of men destitute of the truth to mislead pervert or delude us  to this end i shall now lay the articles before you make some strictures upon them and draw some applications from them as i go along god give us a right judgment we begin with the doctrine of original or birth sin article the  th  original sin stands not in the following of adam as the pelagians do vainly talk but it is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man that is gendered of the offspring of adam whereby man is far gone from original righteousness and is of his own nature inclined to evil  this the pelagians of old denied and this the modern pelagians who pretend to great knowledge while ignorant of themselves and strangers to the corruption and depravity of their own hearts disown at the same time they are standing monuments of the truth of this doctrine and whether they believe or confess it or not their outward actions plainly evince the inhering power of original sin their not seeing not knowing and not feeling it is only one of the strongest proofs of their being under original blindness and insensibility and yet such as these truly set up for guides and teachers of others know them brethren discern them you may you ought and for your souls sake avoid such attend not to their sweet sirens songs lest you are thereby lulled asleep upon the waves of destruction take these marks with you yourselves brethren judge of their doctrines by them for our articles plainly declare the miserable state and condition of man of every man that is born into this world first in the loss of original righteousness or the image of god and secondly as possessed with a contrary image therefore is of his own nature inclined to evil here behold the true picture of the so much boasted dignity of human nature thus is man painted out by our article thus is man described by the oracles of truth and to this melancholy account does every true christian readily subscribe and every carnal natural mans actions fully demonstrate it ay but say our new doctors and modern teachers this is too dark a shade too sable a dress too degrading of the human nature and therefore they tickle the ears please the pride and flatter the vanity of the human mind with their unedifying jargon unscriptural harangues and false encomiums on the moral rectitude virtue and dignity of man but brethren would ye avoid an unskilful quack in surgery who instead of searching and probing a wound in order to procure the soundness and health of the body should slightly heal and skin over the parts aggrieved while putrefaction and rottenness is at the bottom whereby the life of the patient is destroyed so these quacks in divinity are much more to be dreaded inasmuch as the life of the soul is of infinitely more value than that of the body i have heard our true staunch church ministers distinguish such flatterers of human nature by the appellations of sleek divines downy doctors and velvetmouthed preachers pretty and significant truly and the apostle describes such as serve not the lord jesus but their own bellies with fine words and fair speeches deceiving the hearts of the simple for as they dont preach agreeable to the articles so neither do they choose scripture language nor apostolic diction in their compositions for our article next declares  therefore in every person born into the world it deserves gods wrath and damnation  what a strange phrase is here gods wrath and damnation ah say our newfangled teachers our flimsy divines thank god we are not so uncharitable to suppose any person in the world deserving of gods wrath and damnation what unpolite uncouth set of men were the compilers of these articles  say ye so pray let me observe that however unfashionable this doctrine may be thought by some however obsolete and harsh the expressions may seem to others of our airy fashionable preachers truth it is it is the doctrine of scripture and those venerable compilers spoke as the oracles of god and is it not better far better for the sinner to hear and be made sensible of his danger and deserving of gods wrath and damnation so as to escape it now than to be blinded by flattering deceivers till he falls a sacrifice to gods wrath and damnation in dreadful eternity hereafter this you must assent to this you will not deny  but our article farther declares this infection of nature does remain yea in them that are regenerated regenerated how by infant baptism only no the regenerate have received not the outward and visible sign only but are made partakers of the inward and spiritual grace also by the quickening and purifying operations of the holy spirit a principle of spiritual life is implanted in them and take this by the way without experiencing this infant baptism will not cannot profit any person to salvation so that such and such only are sensible of the different lustings of the flesh and of the spirit and though there is no condemnation for such as believe with a faith of divine operation and are baptized with the baptism of the holy ghost yet concupisence and lust says the apostle that is inward desires and lustings has the nature of sin  but alas in these days of modification and refinement if so be the outward actions are somewhat decent moral and regular no thought or concern is taken about inward depravity and heartwickedness but what amazing horror what trembling dread will seize on such when a heartsearching god shall discover before angels and men the vileness hypocrisy and deceitfulness of the heart and to the speechless condemnation of all miserable dawbers and souldeceivers they shall be forced to own when too late to be rectified that their inward parts were very wickedness and therefore stood in need of being changed and renewed as well as the outward actions to be reformed and moralized  and as the former article shows the wretchedness and sinfulness of our estate by nature the next article  0 asserts the helplessness and insufficiency of our condition  the condition of man since the fall of adam is such that he cannot turn and prepare himself by his own natural strength and good works to faith and calling upon god wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to god without the grace of god by christ preventing us that we may have a good will and working with us when we have that good will  deceivers will come says the scripture we believe it says our church and therefore we establish articles at once to settle the judgment of our members and to guard them from erroneous novelty and are not these deceivers already come is not their name legion do not arminian teachers swarm among us who teach that man has free will and power to turn and prepare himself and to do good works by which he is to recommend himself to the favor of god are not these the favorite doctrines of this day dont we constantly hear such unscriptural antichristian tenets daily advanced both from pulpit and press ask that reverend gentleman in black sir what must i do to be saved and you will find his answer as novel and as modish as the fashion of his periwig he is too polite to dictate the old scriptural answer believe on the lord jesus but practice morality and do good works and you are safe was you to reply sir i have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to god without the grace of god by christ  psha psha prithee dont tire and teaze me with your methodistical rant and enthusiastical nonsense would be your answer from his orthodox reverendship mans power natural ability and free will are his favorite themes instead of free grace supernatural power divine and spiritual assistance lord have mercy on the sheep that are under the care of such a shepherd  but brethren let me plainly and briefly apply myself to you on the two foregoing articles do ye know yourselves are ye sensible of your real state are ye made acquainted with your true condition do ye know and feel your misery and want as sinners are ye sensible of your own weakness and insufficiency to turn and prepare yourselves do you see your inclination and proneness to all evil and sin and your aversion and disaffection to all holiness and godliness if you do not have not thus seen yourselves stripped of all good and full of all evil deserving gods wrath and damnation it is plain you are blind even unto this day and farther you never prayed in all your life nay dont start it is plain truth you cannot you dare not deny it before god and your own conscience if you consider prayer as a breathing out the wants of the soul before god in and under a sense of the same and an humble dependence on him for relief and redress but how could you pray to be delivered from sin evil and danger when you never saw it never felt it and was never sensible of it and consequently could have no desire to be delivered from it  but you say you have gone to church and prayed  that you have gone to church and repeated the solemn words of our excellent liturgy is not denied but even then and there you offered the sacrifice of fools and solemnly mocked god while you pretended to address and worship him else how could you dare to tell god you was a miserable sinner desire him to have mercy upon you tell him there is no health in you that you are tied and bound with the chain of your sins and that the remembrance of your sins is grievous unto you and the burden is intolerable while you neither feel nor experience such a state surely the most dreadful hypocrisy this the most fatal and dangerous delusion possible  but if not only your heads are enlightened and your judgment informed but your hearts also truly convicted and humbled before the lord with a view of yourselves as described by our scripture articles blessed knowledge happy sensibility for this you are indebted to the divine grace and heavenly teachings of the holy spirit of whom you learn to cast away all human confidence all dependence on the arm of fesh only and to fly to christ for help and succor  with a lord save or we perish for the heart of man by nature is estranged and alienated from god and christ would try every other means and seek for salvation in any way rather than accept it as a free gift from christ to cast away all selfrighteousness is grievous to the heart in its natural state of pride and affectation of independency man would still be as god still work out and merit for himself his own salvation and he must be driven to the last extremity see the insufficiency of law and self of morality and works before he can cast away all other confidence and apply to jesus with a lord save or i perish it is faith alone which can avail the soul and thus we must apply if we would obtain the gift of god in christ utterly renouncing all selfdependence and perfectly assured that he is able and willing to save to the uttermost these truly spiritual and experimental sentences i have taken the liberty to extract from the  th discourse of the rev and pious mr dod who is obliging the world with a set of sermons in which inward vital christianity is insisted on the religion of the heart and the experience of divine grace in the soul are scripturally and beautifully displayed and in these sermons we may observe ministers will not be ashamed of the gospel of christ when they experience it in their own souls to be the power of god unto salvation  yea god for christs sake will enrich your souls and comfort your spirits with the abundant consolations administered in the   th article which runs thus  we all true believers are accounted righteous before god only for the merit of our lord and savior jesus christ by faith and not for our own works and deservings wherefore that we are justified by faith only is a most wholesome doctrine and very full of comfort as more largely is expressed in the homily of justification  here is true protestant antiromish doctrine blessed are the ministers of our church that know and preach thus happy every soul that can set to his seal to the truth of these words god will suffer no flesh to glory in his presence therefore in the justification pardon or acceptance of a sinner he will magnify the riches of his free grace to be justified freely through the redemption that is in christ jesus and to be accounted righteous for the righteousness of jesus christ only is the only doctrine that can yield comfort and consolation to penitent humble sinners and glory and praise to the god of mercy and grace but no say our modern theologists it is by our own good works and faith christs blood righteousness and merits are not sufficient of themselves to avert the wrath procure the favor and recommend our persons to the acceptance of god be astonished o heavens be amazed o ye sons of god be confounded o ye enemies of all righteousness at the blindness vanity and pride of relying on or joining the imperfect works and sullied obedience of fallen man with the perfect righteousness allatoning merits and allsufficient sacrifice of the infinitely divine and holy jesus o how long will ye thus pervert the right ways of the lord how long will ye trample on the precious blood depreciate the onlyavailing righteousness and set at naught the allprevailing merits of the sinners friend the dear and loving jesus be filled o my soul be warmed o my friends with a holy indignation at the daring insult and impious affronts that are offered to jesus your savior and your god whose blood and righteousness is your only plea we dont preach justification by faith only say the papists we are agreed with you say their confederates in error our pretended protestant but seducing preachers but why because it tends to destroy good works say both it is false says our church we experience the contrary say all its true christian members but truly the papists teachers are honest upright men when compared with these modern deceivers for it is the avowed tenet of their church to deny and explode the doctrine of justification by faith only and the imputed righteousness and merits of jesus christ  but our only pretended protestant teachers assent to it in the articles of our church as a most wholesome doctrine and very full of godly comfort and yet afterward publicly preach and inveigh against it and brand and stigmatize the contenders for this scripture truth as a set of madmen enthusiasts and deceivers pretty this truly thus to cry out w  e first surprising is such a share of assurance amazing such want of modesty is this a specimen of their good works alas alas where is common honesty candid judgment and impartial determination fled o ye selfconfident souldeceiving teachers how can ye look on this article without being filled with shame and confusion of face if conscience performed its office blush ye must ye would at such a monstrous behavior and inconsistent practice  but does our church depreciate good works or deny their usefulness no neither do any of its true ministers or members they all assent to the doctrines of the   th article that  good works are the fruit of faith and follow after justification not go before in order to procure justification they cannot put away our sins nor endure the severity of gods judgment yet are they pleasing and acceptable to god in christ and do spring out necessarily of a true faith inasmuch as by them a lively faith may be as evidently known as a tree by its fruit  o brethren what a consistency of doctrine what a harmony of divine truth what a chain of scripture tenets do our excellent articles afford us thank god for ancient orthodox christian compilers from modern heterodox unchristian teachers good lord deliver us and let all our church members say amen  you see brethren that good works are the fruits of faith have you received of god the gift of faith faith in our lord jesus christ whereby you are justified is the condemnation and guilt of your sins taken away and do ye possess pardon and peace from god then i am sure you must love god and love is the most powerful and availing principle to produce good works pleasant and acceptable to god in christ for only in christ jesus is it our works are accepted the best work we can perform cannot put away our sins and endure the severity of gods judgment but good works spring out necessarily of a true faith they are true marks and evidences of a lively faith as the fruitfulness of a tree is an unanswerable proof of the life and soundness of the root hence ye see brethren by the plain sense of the articles that without a true justifying faith in our lord jesus no good works can be produced and yet truly we find many who pretend to be the only true orthodox teachers of our church constantly exploding and vehemently denying the doctrine of justification by faith only therefore it is a plain consequence and natural deduction that the only marks such give of their orthodoxy is that they have neither faith nor good works notwithstanding all that prating and noise they make about good works and this is more fully proved by article    which assures us  all works done before the grace of christ and the inspiration of his spirit are not pleasant to god forasmuch as they spring not of faith in jesu christ neither do they make men meet to receive grace or as the school authors say deserve grace of congruity rather for that they are not done as god has willed and commanded them to be done we doubt not but they have the nature of sin  the grace of christ and the inspiration of the spirit why this is the very mark and characteristic of an enthusiast to talk of being inspired say our new lights and modern deceivers but no it is the only principle of true christian practices he is not a christian who is not inspired by the spirit of god neither are any works pleasant and acceptable to god but what spring from inspiration says our church inspiration signifies a breathing inward what why the vitality power and graces of the holy spirit and from this inward principle only outward actions good and pleasant to god and profitable to man flow  but to avoid prolixity i shall not enlarge as i find i have much exceeded my first intentions but really our excellent articles afford such a field of argument to support truth and detect error that they are pleasing and delightful themes to dwell on though i doubt not but what i have advanced is sufficient in the judgments of the ignorant and prejudiced professors of christianity to determine me a methodist and an enthusiast reader let me appeal to thee have i strained one sentence of our articles from its natural sense and plain meaning well if for a steady adherence and firm attachment to the doctrines of the church of england i am accounted a methodist i am content may i live and die a church of england methodist a methodist why really its a simple and inoffensive name and i dont see much reason to be ashamed of it for i have often thought and its well worth notice that the world dont usually fix this apellation upon persons of an openly wicked and scandalously finful life hence a gaming pleasuretaking playhousefrequenting person who lives in debauchery and excess of drinking is sure to escape the name of methodist  nor has a minister that name given him who notwithstanding his solemn declarations subscriptions and oaths to assent to and abide by the articles of our church preaches contrary to them denies the fall of man original sin contends for justification by works instead of faith is an enemy to the doctrine of imputed righteousness from whose sermons you seldom or never hear the name of jesus nor the agency and influence of the holy spirit unless utterly to deny inveigh against and explode all spiritual inspiration and inward feeling these and such sort of preachers escape free from the imputation of methodism  so again that decent regular person who freed from the irksome care of souls comfortably lolls in his chariot thinks it is time for him to have done with the labor and fatigue of praying and preaching for he is turned of forty therefore has left off trade is content with a bare single  000l per annum church preferment he loves wishes well to the church not without reason by the by rails at your popular mobdriving preachers as he terms them is sure they would not take half the pains they do if views of moneygetting were not at the bottom these sort of gentlemen too stand very clear of being deemed methodists  reader what do thou think of all such i appeal to thee and every honest mind and unprejudiced judgment to determine whether a worse name does not properly belong to them  well it is plain that principles and practices such as are contrary to the ignorant formal sinful antichristian ministers and professors of the age and to abide by and contend for the orthodox articles of our church is thought sufficient to constitute a person a methodist therefore reader let me here present thee with a just and plain description of what the world mean by a methodist he is one whom god has chosen in christ out of mankind to deliver from curse and damnation and to bring by christ to everlasting salvation he is called according to gods purpose by his spirit working in due season he through grace obeys the calling he is justified freely he is made a son of god by adoption he feels in himself the working of the spirit of christ none but methodists indeed talk thus say the formal professors mortifying the works of the flesh and his earthly members and drawing up his mind to high and heavenly things he is made like the image of christ walks religiously in good works and at length by gods mercy attains everlasting felicity  o happy methodists blessed description those who choose to give a better are at their liberty for my part i am tenaciously fond of our church language and therefore have transcribed the words of our   th article  and here brethren may we not observe how highly dignified how undesignedly honored all the faithful scriptural orthodox ministers of our church are by ministers and persons of a contrary character  tell me ye blinded by prejudice ye heated with resentment ye pretended ministers and members of our church tell prove to the world if ye can wherein the ingenious roman the judicious murden the zealous and laborious jones the learned and muchadmired dod and such like conscientious ministers have departed from or advanced any one tenet contrary to the orthodox articles of our church if they have look them in the face and by the judgment and determination of the scripture and articles correct and refute them  but if not and no such charge has hitherto appeared how mean base and despicable is it to attempt to load them with odium contempt and infamy behind their backs is it their crime to be so unpolite as to make conscience of their oaths and subscriptions and to preach and abide by the excellent and apostolic doctrines of our church is it for their love to and zeal for the salvation of precious and immortal souls is it because the sheep know their voice and follow them as true shepherds therefore do ye hirelings hate contemn and despise them weep o my soul in secret before the lord on account of that opposition to the gospel of jesus and unkindness to his ministers rejoice o my soul be thankful o my fellow sinners to the great shepherd and bishop of our souls in thus careing for and sending forth these best friends truest sons and most faithful ministers of our church  and blessed be the name of the lord for enduing them with that spirit of boldness and constancy whereby they declare the whole counsel of god no man making them afraid i know and am persuaded all that love our lord jesus in sincerity will feel the same warmth of zeal and fervent affection to these and all such true ministers and will as i do from my heart honor reverence and esteem them highly in love for their works sake  it matters very little to hear the many envenomed throats croaking out enthusiasm reader take knowledge of that thing he is parson of st  s church and lest the people should be seduced and deceived by hearing the doctrines of the church of england preached he denies these true ministers the pulpit and says they are enthusiasts and the people as ignorant as himself join the cry  an enthusiast what is that o it is the cant word of the day for the manyheaded monster the bugbear of the times  ah says a constant churchgoer i heard one of these preachers at our church he preached such a sermon almost an hour long and said downright that all unconverted people were in a state of damnation and would go to hell if they did not believe on the lord jesus truly he set the parish in an uproar for we are not used to such sort of preaching thank god for a good parson say i for next sunday our parson god bless him preached a sermon against such doctrine and though he was no longer than a quarter of an hour yet he made us all easy again he told us we were in no danger of going to hell and that there was no fear of our being damned for we were all good christians if we pay every one their own and do as we would be done by  why truly reader such is the preaching of too many who call themselves ministers of our church but beware of them for they are heathens in disguise  but your ethusiasts pretend to and contend for inspiration of the spirit a heavy charge this indeed and is this what you mean by enthusiasm are all that pretend to be inspired by the spirit enthusiasts o yes doubtless say our modern teachers and unchristian professors why then if so is not every minister of our church an enthusiast or a deceiver for they all at their ordination solemnly profess to be inwardly moved by the holy ghost to take on them the holy function and also the bishop pronounces on them receive ye the holy ghost hence it is plain our church prerequires the necessity of an inward call and inspiration of the spirit to the work of the ministry which if they pretend to and have not they are deceivers and therefore it is expected they receive the powerful influences and operations of the holy ghost as though without them they could not be true ministers of the gospel of jesus christ and it has been before proved from the plain declarations of our articles that without the inspiration of the holy spirit none can be a true christian or do any good works  but if by an enthusiast is meant a deceiver one that fancies himself and pretends to be what in reality he is not i declare to you reader i do not know a worse sort of enthusiasm nor a more dangerous set of enthusiasts and deceivers deceivers both of themselves and others let common sense and right reason determine the point than those ministers who solemnly profess to be inwardly moved by the holy ghost pretend to receive the gift of the holy spirit at their ordination assent subscribe and swear to the articles of our church in which the necessity of inspiration is so strongly insisted on use the most excellent form of our church liturgy constantly pray to god for the inspiration guidance and operations of the holy spirit and yet after all this o dreadful hypocrisy before god o amazing souldelusion can jest jeer at and ridicule all spiritual influences and inward operations despise and contemn the honest faithful spiritual ministers of our church surely an honest heathen would blush at such behavior no wonder such are so much despised and set at naught who make themselves by their absurdity contemptible in the sight of men  but it is farther urged against our truly reverend and gospel ministers that they are not content with the common and ordinary operations of the spirit but they talk of and contend for the extraordinary and miraculous gifts of the holy ghost therefore they are enthusiasts this is false they neither expect nor see any necessity for the miraculous gifts of the holy ghost but they contend for agreeable to scripture the promised inward gifts and graces of the holy spirit to enlighten convince convert and make happy the true christian by his indwelling witness and comfortable presence to the soul  neither is their pretensions to inspiration ungrounded and unwarranted as others object and therefore say they are enthusiasts this kind of pretension may be reduced to two sorts for matter and for manner for matter when persons pretend to inspiration of god for things contrary to scripture which god has given us as a standing rule to the worlds end but our ministers pretend to no such inspiration seeing they constantly inculcate the doctrines of our church which are agreeable to the scriptures yea they preach such inspiration only which the word of god promises to every true christian therefore they are not enthusiasts  for manner when inspirations are expected to exclude and supersede the use of reason scripture and all divine ordinances such as pretend to these are proper enthusiasts but our faithful and orthodox ministers preach the rational scripture doctrines of the gospel only they dont set up heathen morality instead of christian practices nor do they teach mans natural ability to the exclusion of gods divine grace nor the works of righteousness of sinful man in order to supersede and set at naught the meritorious sacrifice and righteousness of jesus christ no but they insist on the reasonableness of being endued with spiritual life and spiritual power in order to produce spiritual actions they scripturally teach that faith and every other good gift and grace is of the spirits inspiration and they therefore direct souls to a diligent attendance and constant waiting on the ordinances and to esteem them as channels wherein god is usually pleased to inspire into the soul divine grace and spiritual influences therefore they are not enthusiasts  and now reader by such plain scriptural and infallible marks we may know and discern the true gospel ministers of our church from enthusiasts because they assert and preach that true christianity is wrought in the soul by the infusion and inspiration of the spirit only authorized by the word of god and agreeable to the voice of our church they constantly declare no one can be a minister of christ without being called to and qualified for the preaching of the gospel by the spirit of christ only neither can any person be a true christian but through the animating power and agency of the blessed spirit for all godly ministers and christians do enjoy this in the working and increase of supernatural grace for grace is not the work of nature and reason let heretical pelagians and modern graceless seducers say what they please but of the spirit only  the gifts and graces of the holy spirit are promised in the gospel to be with christs church through all the succeeding ages to what end but to carry on and effectuate and apply the blessings and comforts of christs redemption to the soul of every member to give them an earnest of the purchased inheritance in their hearts here and to qualify and prepare them for the enjoyment of the kingdom of our lord jesus in a blessed eternity hereafter this the word of god assures us of this every true christian happily knows by blessed experience and this our truly christian church teaches us constantly to pray for and expect in her offices and institutions yea in the communion service it is asserted of all her true members we dwell in christ and christ in us we are one with christ and christ with us  but by men of corrupt minds destitute of the truth these ancient doctrines of the bible and of our church now are deemed new doctrines the preachers of them railed against as innovators and from many pulpits the people are told by way of prejudice against them that they draw people away from the church and cause schism and division draw people from the church and cause schism might they not with equal propriety call them presbyterian papists and say they set the stone walls of the church on fire for  nonsense can never be understood but the discerning and judicious will always reject absurdity and falsehood is it schism constantly to preach and inculcate the avowed doctrines and tenets of the church and it is obvious even to an offense to some that at whatever church the faithful gospel ministers preach numerous and crowded congregations attend now is not this a strange way of drawing people from the church  but then who are those that follow them why perhaps many of your parishioners go to hear them ay that is it they draw people away from their own parish churches do they so why really mr parson truth is a very desirable thing and never more so than when religion is concerned now the case is plainly this when a person is not content to take up his religion upon trust but reads with attention and discernment the word of god compares the doctrines of our church with the bible and observes the great and fundamental truths therein contained either not preached at all in his own parish church or what is worse openly inveighed against denied and exploded such as the doctrines of original sin the insufficiency of works to justify the sinner the merits and righteousness of the lord jesus and justification through the same by faith the necessity of inward holiness and sanctification by the holy spirit etc i say when a person sees the weight and importance of these sacred scripture truths it is the very delight of his soul to hear them preached he becomes a church of england man not by profession merely but on principle chiefly  and it is easy to be accounted for that he takes some pains to follow the voice of the church and to attend the sound of her doctrines at other churches and even thinks it an unhappiness he cannot hear them preached at his own parish church  now doctor you say it is wrong and you blame people for rambling away from their own churches but is it not worse in you to forsake your own church doctrines it is true they sometimes forsake the stone walls and buildings of their parish churches but why for this very reason because their own parish priests have departed from the constituent principles and established doctrines of our articles homilies and liturgy and pray now who is in fault not those ministers who preach the doctrines of the church of england nor those who are so attached to the same as to follow them but those who drive them away from their own stated parish churches by preaching contrary to the venerable scripture truths and cannot be content with the religion of their forefathers the doctrines of the reformation but must broach some newfangled tenets and preach only the poor dry unavailing system of heathenish morality instead of the lively animating powerful trulymoralizing truths of the gospel  therefore let clericus and his brethren who are so often haranguing against schism and separation know that the schism reverberates and the charge of separation recoils back upon themselves while they are guilty of schism in doctrine and separate from the precious truths the avowed tenets of our excellent establishment  but there is one expedient which from my hearty zeal for our church and warm affection to the clergy i would humbly recommend to them and may the almighty god who alone works great marvels incline them all to put it in practice it is this to preach constantly maintain steadily inculcate fervently the established doctrines of our church the glorious truths of the reformation now who would think there could be any objection against this method nay there can be none and i am sure it will be practiced by those who have so much conscience as to believe solemn promises oaths and subscriptions are binding and obligatory upon them  besides this consider reverend sirs pray consider that besides discharging your conscience in the sight of god clearing yourselves from the imputation of schism and disaffection to the truths of our establishment you may also assure yourselves these happy effects will be the consequence of such a practice your respective flocks will be kept together they will punctually attend their ministers at their own parish churches ignorant professors will be instructed in the saving doctrines of the gospel established in the truth as it is in jesus and will be thereby preserved from being misled by error and perverted by delusion a glorious spirit of reformation will overspread our land the practice of morality and good works will abound and our church will soon become the glory of the whole earth  o happy period a time how much to be desired may the god of truth and power hasten it for his mercys sake  finis
