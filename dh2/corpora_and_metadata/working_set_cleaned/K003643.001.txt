lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres  by hugh blair dd one of the ministers of the high church and professor of rhetoric and belles lettres in the university of edinburgh  in three volumes  vol i  dublin printed for messrs whitestone colles burnet moncrieffe gilbert walker exshaw white beatty burton byrne parker and cash mdcclxxxiii  preface the following lectures were read in the university of edinburgh for twentyfour years the publication of them at present was not altogether a matter of choice imperfect copies of them in manuscript from notes taken by students who heard them read were first privately handed about and afterward frequently exposed to public sale when the author saw them circulate so currently as even to be quoted in print biographia britannica article addison  and found himself often threatened with surreptitious publications of them he judged it to be high time that they should proceed from his own hand rather than come into public view under some very defective and erroneous form  they were originally designed for the initiation of youth into the study of belles lettres and of composition with the same intention they are now published and therefore the form of lectures in which they were at first composed is still retained the author gives them to the world neither as a work wholly original nor as a compilation from the writings of others on every subject contained in them he has thought for himself he consulted his own ideas and reflections and a great part of what will be found in these lectures is entirely his own at the same time he availed himself of the ideas and reflections of others as far as he thought them proper to be adopted to proceed in this manner was his duty as a public professor it was incumbent on him to convey to his pupils all the knowledge that could improve them to deliver not merely what was new but what might be useful from whatever quarter it came he hopes that to such as are studying to cultivate their taste to form their style or to prepare themselves for public speaking or composition his lectures will afford a more comprehensive view of what relates to these subjects than as far as he knows is to be received from any one book in our language  in order to render his work of greater service he has generally referred to the books which he consulted as far as he remembers them that the readers might be directed to any farther illustration which they afford but as such a length of time has elapsed since the first composition of his lectures he may perhaps have adopted the sentiments of some author into whose writings he had then looked without now remembering whence he derived them  in the opinions which he has delivered concerning such a variety of authors and of literary matters as come under his consideration he cannot expect that all his readers will concur with him the subjects are of such a nature as allow room for much diversity of taste and sentiment and the author will respectfully submit to the judgment of the public  retaining the simplicity of the lecturing style as best fitted for conveying instruction he has aimed in his language at no more than perspicuity if after the liberties which it was necessary for him to take in criticizing the style of the most eminent writers in our language his own style shall be thought open to reprehension all that he can say is that his book will add one to the many proofs already afforded to the world of its being much easier to give instruction than to set example  contents of the first volume lect i introduction page

which providence has conferred upon mankind is the power of communicating their thoughts to one another destitute of this power reason would be a solitary and in some measure an unavailing principle speech is the great instrument by which man becomes beneficial to man and it is to the intercourse and transmission of thought by means of speech that we are chiefly indebted for the improvement of thought itself small are the advances which a single unassisted individual can make toward perfecting any of his powers what we call human reason is not the effort or ability of one so much as it is the result of the reason of many arising from lights mutually communicated in consequence of discourse and writing  it is obvious then that writing and discourse are objects entitled to the highest attention whether the influence of the speaker or the entertainment of the hearer be consulted whether utility or pleasure be the principal aim in view we are prompted by the strongest motives to study how we may communicate our thoughts to one another with most advantage accordingly we find that in almost every nation as soon as language had extended itself beyond that scanty communication which was requisite for the supply of mens necessities the improvement of discourse began to attract regard in the language even of rude uncultivated tribes we can trace some attention to the grace and force of those expressions which they used when they sought to persuade or to affect they were early sensible of a beauty in discourse and endeavored to give it certain decorations which experience had taught them it was capable of receiving long before the study of those decorations was formed into a regular art  but among nations in a civilized state no art has been cultivated with more care than that of language style and composition the attention paid to it may indeed be assumed as one mark of the progress of society toward its most improved period for according as society improves and flourishes men acquire more influence over one another by means of reasoning and discourse and in proportion as that influence is felt to enlarge it must follow as a natural consequence that they will bestow more care upon the methods of expressing their conceptions with propriety and eloquence hence we find that in all the polished nations of europe this study has been treated as highly important and has possessed a considerable place in every plan of liberal education  indeed when the arts of speech and writing are mentioned i am sensible that prejudices against them are apt to rise in the minds of many a sort of art is immediately thought of that is ostentatious and deceitful the minute and trifling study of words alone the pomp of expression the studied fallacies of rhetoric ornament substituted in the room of use we need not wonder that under such imputations all study of discourse as an art should have suffered in the opinion of men of understanding and i am far from denying that rhetoric and criticism have sometimes been so managed as to tend to the corruption rather than to the improvement of good taste and true eloquence but sure it is equally possible to apply the principles of reason and good sense to this art as to any other that is cultivated among men if the following lectures have any merit it will consist in an endeavor to substitute the application of these principles in the place of artificial and scholastic rhetoric in an endeavor to explode false ornament to direct attention more toward substance than show to recommend good sense as the foundation of all good composition and simplicity as essential to all true ornament  when entering on the subject i may be allowed on this occasion to suggest a few thoughts concerning the importance and advantages of such studies and the rank they are entitled to possess in academical education the author was the first who read lectures on this subject in the university of edinburgh he began with reading them in a private character in the year      in the following year he was chosen professor of rhetoric by the magistrates and towncouncil of edinburgh and in      his majesty was pleased to erect and endow a profession of rhetoric and belles lettres in that university and the author was appointed the first regius professor  i am under no temptation for this purpose of extolling their importance at the expense of any other department of science on the contrary the study of rhetoric and belles lettres supposes and requires a proper acquaintance with the rest of the liberal arts it embraces them all within its circle and recommends them to the highest regard the first care of all such as wish either to write with reputation or to speak in public so as to command attention must be to extend their knowledge to lay in a rich store of ideas relating to those subjects of which the occasions of life may call them to discourse or to write hence among the ancients it was a fundamental principle and frequently inculcated quod omnibus disciplinis et artibus debet esse instructus orator that the orator ought to be an accomplished scholar and conversant in every part of learning it is indeed impossible to contrive an art and very pernicious it were if it could be contrived which should give the stamp of merit to any composition rich or splendid in expression but barren or erroneous in thought they are the wretched attempts toward an art of this kind which have so often disgraced oratory and debased it below its true standard the graces of composition have been employed to disguise or to supply the want of matter and the temporary applause of the ignorant has been courted instead of the lasting approbation of the discerning but such imposture can never maintain its ground long knowledge and science must furnish the materials that form the body and substance of any valuable composition rhetoric serves to add the polish and we know that none but firm and solid bodies can be polished well  of those who peruse the following lectures some by the profession to which they addict themselves or in consequence of their prevailing inclination may have the view of being employed in composition or in public speaking others without any prospect of this kind may wish only to improve their taste with respect to writing and discourse and to acquire principles which will enable them to judge for themselves in that part of literature called the belles lettres  with respect to the former such as may have occasion to communicate their sentiments to the public it is abundantly clear that some preparation of study is requisite for the end which they have in view to speak or to write perspicuously and agreeably with purity with grace and strength are seize of the utmost consequence to all who purpose either by speech or writing to address the public for without being master of those seize no man can do justice to his own conceptions but how rich soever he may be in knowledge and in good sense will be able to avail himself less of those treasures than such as possess not half his store but who can display what they possess with more propriety neither are these seize of that kind for which we are indebted to nature merely nature has indeed conferred upon some a very favorable distinction in this respect beyond others but in these as in most other talents she bestows she has left much to be wrought out by every mans own industry so conspicuous have been the effects of study and improvement in every part of eloquence such remarkable examples have appeared of persons surmounting by their diligence the disadvantages of the most untoward nature that among the learned it has long been a contested and remains still an undecided point whether nature or art confer most toward excelling in writing and discourse  with respect to the manner in which art can most effectually furnish assistance for such a purpose there may be diversity of opinions i by no means pretend to say that mere rhetorical rules how just soever are sufficient to form an orator supposing natural genius to be favorable more by a great deal will depend upon private application and study than upon any system of instruction that is capable of being publicly communicated but at the same time though rules and instructions cannot do all that is requisite they may however do much that is of real use they cannot it is true inspire genius but they can direct and assist it they cannot remedy barrenness but they may correct redundancy they point out proper models for imitation they bring into view the chief beauties that ought to be studied and the principal faults that ought to be avoided and thereby tend to enlighten taste and to lead genius from unnatural deviations into its proper channel what would not avail for the production of great excellencies may at least serve to prevent the commission of considerable errors  all that regards the study of eloquence and composition merits the higher attention upon this account that it is intimately connected with the improvement of our intellectual powers for i must be allowed to say that when we are employed after a proper manner in the study of composition we are cultivating reason itself true rhetoric and sound logic are very nearly allied the study of arranging and expressing our thoughts with propriety teaches to think as well as to speak accurately by putting our sentiments into words we always conceive them more distinctly every one who has the slightest acquaintance with composition knows that when he expresses himself ill on any subject when his arrangement becomes loose and his sentences turn feeble the defects of his style can almost on every occasion be traced back to his indistinct conception of the subject so close is the connection between thoughts and the words in which they are clothed  the study of composition important in itself at all times has acquired additional importance from the taste and manners of the present age it is an age wherein improvements in every part of science have been prosecuted with ardour to all the liberal arts much attention has been paid and to none more than to the beauty of language and the grace and elegance of every kind of writing the public ear is become refined it will not easily bear what is slovenly and incorrect every author must aspire to some merit in expression as well as in sentiment if he would not incur the danger of being neglected and despised  i will not deny that the love of minute elegance and attention to inferior ornaments of composition may at present have engrossed too great a degree of the public regard it is indeed my opinion that we lean to this extreme often more careful of polishing style than of storing it with thought yet hence arises a new reason for the study of just and proper composition if it be requisite not to be deficient in elegance or ornament in times when they are in such high estimation it is still more requisite to attain the power of distinguishing false ornament from true in order to prevent our being carried away by that torrent of false and frivolous taste which never fails when it is prevalent to sweep along with it the raw and the ignorant they who have never studied eloquence in its principles nor have been trained to attend to the genuine and manly beauties of good writing are always ready to be caught by the mere glare of language and when they come to speak in public or to compose have no other standard on which to form themselves except what chances to be fashionable and popular how corrupted soever or erroneous that may be  but as there are many who have no such objects as either composition or public speaking in view let us next consider what advantages may be derived by them from such studies as form the subject of these lectures to them rhetoric is not so much a practical art as a speculative science and the same instructions which assist others in composing will assist them in judging of and relishing the beauties of composition whatever enables genius to execute well will enable taste to criticize justly  when we name criticizing prejudices may perhaps arise of the same kind with those which i mentioned before with respect to rhetoric as rhetoric has been sometimes thought to signify nothing more than the scholastic study of words and phrases and tropes so criticism has been considered as merely the art of finding faults as the frigid application of certain technical terms by means of which persons are taught to cavil and censure in a learned manner but this is the criticism of pedants only true criticism is a liberal and humane art it is the offspring of good sense and refined taste it aims at acquiring a just discernment of the real merit of authors it promotes a lively relish of their beauties while it preserves us from that blind and implicit veneration which would confound their beauties and faults in our esteem it teaches us in a word to admire and to blame with judgment and not to follow the crowd blindly  in an age when works of genius and literature are so frequently the subjects of discourse when every one erects himself into a judge and when we can hardly mingle in polite society without bearing some share in such discussions studies of this kind it is not to be doubted will appear to derive part of their importance from the use to which they may be applied in furnishing materials for those fashionable topics of discourse and thereby enabling us to support a proper rank in social life  but i should be sorry if we could not rest the merit of such studies on somewhat of solid and intrinsical use independent of appearance and show the exercise of taste and of sound criticism is in truth one of the most improving employments of the understanding to apply the principles of good sense to composition and discourse to examine what is beautiful and why it is so to employ ourselves in distinguishing accurately between the specious and the solid between affected and natural ornament must certainly improve us not a little in the most valuable part of all philosophy the philosophy of human nature for such disquisitions are very intimately connected with the knowledge of ourselves they necessarily lead us to reflect on the operations of the imagination and the movements of the heart and increase our acquaintance with some of the most refined feelings which belong to our frame  logical and ethical disquisitions move in a higher sphere and are conversant with objects of a more severe kind the progress of the understanding in its search after knowledge and the direction of the will in the proper pursuit of good in these they point out to man the improvement of his nature as an intelligent being and his duties as the subject of moral obligation belles lettres and criticism chiefly consider him as a being endowed with those powers of taste and imagination which were intended to embellish his mind and to supply him with rational and useful entertainment they open a field of investigation peculiar to themselves all that relates to beauty harmony grandeur and elegance all that can sooth the mind gratify the fancy or move the affections belongs to their province they present human nature under a different aspect from that which it assumes to the view of other sciences they bring to light various springs of action which without their aid might have passed unobserved and which though of a delicate nature frequently exert a powerful influence on several departments of human life  such studies have also this peculiar advantage that they exercise our reason without fatiguing it they lead to enquiries acute but not painful profound but not dry nor abstruse they strew flowers in the path of science and while they keep the mind bent in some degree and active they relieve it at the same time from that more toilsome labor to which it must submit in the acquisition of necessary erudition or the investigation of abstract truth  the cultivation of taste is farther recommended by the happy effects which it naturally tends to produce on human life the most busy man in the most active sphere cannot be always occupied by business men of serious professions cannot always be on the stretch of serious thought neither can the most gay and flourishing situations of fortune afford any man the power of filling all his hours with pleasure life must always languish in the hands of the idle it will frequently languish even in the hands of the busy if they have not some employment subsidiary to that which forms their main pursuit how then shall these vacant spaces those unemployed intervals which more or less occur in the life of every one be filled up how can we contrive to dispose of them in any way that shall be more agreeable in itself or more consonant to the dignity of the human mind than in the entertainments of taste and the study of polite literature he who is so happy as to have acquired a relish for these has always at hand an innocent and irreproachable amusement for his leisure hours to save him from the danger of many a pernicious passion he is not in hazard of being a burden to himself he is not obliged to fly to low company or to court the riot of loose pleasures in order to cure the tediousness of existence  providence seems plainly to have pointed out this useful purpose to which the pleasures of taste may be applied by interposing them in a middle station between the pleasures of sense and those of pure intellect we were not designed to grovel always among objects so low as the former nor are we capable of dwelling constantly in so high a region as the latter the pleasures of taste refresh the mind after the toils of the intellect and the labors of abstract study and they gradually raise it above the attachments of sense and prepare it for the enjoyments of virtue  so consonant is this to experience that in the education of youth no object has in every age appeared more important to wise men than to tincture them early with a relish for the entertainments of taste the transition is commonly made with ease from these to the discharge of the higher and more important duties of life good hopes may be entertained of those whose minds have this liberal and elegant turn many virtues may be grafted upon it whereas to be entirely devoid of relish for eloquence poetry or any of the fine arts is justly constructed to be an unpromising symptom of youth and raises suspicions of their being prone to low gratifications or destined to drudge in the more vulgar and illiberal pursuits of life  there are indeed few good dispositions of any kind with which the improvement of taste is not more or less connected a cultivated taste increases sensibility to all the tender and humane passions by giving them frequent exercise while it tends to weaken the more violent and fierce emotions  ingenuas didicisse fideliter arts emollit mores nec sinit esse feros these polished arts have humanizd mankind softened the rude and calmed the boisterous mind   the elevated sentiments and high examples which poetry eloquence and history are often bringing under our view naturally tend to nourish in our minds public spirit the love of glory contempt of external fortune and the admiration of what is truly illustrious and great  i will not go so far as to say that the improvement of taste and of virtue is the same or that they may always be expected to coexist in an equal degree more powerful correctives than taste can apply are necessary for reforming the corrupt propensities which too frequently prevail among mankind elegant speculations are sometimes found to float on the surface of the mind while bad passions possess the interior regions of the heart at the same time this cannot but be admitted that the exercise of taste is in its native tendency moral and purifying from reading the most admired productions of genius whether in poetry or prose almost every one rises with some good impressions left on his mind and though these may not always be durable they are at least to be ranked among the means of disposing the heart to virtue one thing is certain and i shall hereafter have occasion to illustrate it more fully that without possessing the virtuous affections in a strong degree no man can attain eminence in the sublime parts of eloquence he must feel what a good man feels if he expects greatly to move or to interest mankind they are the ardent sentiments of honor virtue magnanimity and public spirit that only can kindle that fire of genius and call up into the mind those high ideas which attract the admiration of ages and if this spirit be necessary to produce the most distinguished efforts of eloquence it must be necessary also to our relishing them with proper taste and feeling  on these general topics i shall dwell no longer but proceed directly to the consideration of the subjects which are to employ the following lectures they divide themselves into five parts first some introductory dissertations on the nature of taste and upon the sources of its pleasures secondly the consideration of language thirdly of style fourthly of eloquence properly so called or public speaking in its different kinds lastly a critical examination of the most distinguished species of composition both in prose and verse  lecture ii taste the nature of the present undertaking leads me to begin with some enquiries concerning taste as it is this faculty which is always appealed to in disquisitions concerning the merit of discourse and writing  there are few subjects on which men talk more loosely and indistinctly than on taste few which it is more difficult to explain with precision and none which in this course of lectures will appear more dry or abstract what i have to say on the subject shall be in the following order i shall first explain the nature of taste as a power or faculty in the human mind i shall next consider how far it is an improveable faculty i shall show the sources of its improvement and the characters of taste in its most perfect state i shall then examine the various fluctuations to which it is liable and enquire whether there be any standard to which we can bring the different tastes of men in order to distinguish the corrupted from the true  taste may be defined the power of receiving pleasure from the beauties of nature and of art the first question that occurs concerning it is whether it is to be considered as an internal sense or as an exertion of reason reason is a very general term but if we understand by it that power of the mind which in speculative matters discovers truth and in practical matters judges of the fitness of means to an end i apprehend the question may be easily answered for nothing can be more clear than that taste is not resolveable into any such operation of reason it is not merely through a discovery of the understanding or a deduction of argument that the mind receives pleasure from a beautiful prospect or a fine poem such objects often strike us intuitively and make a strong impression when we are unable to assign the reasons of our being pleased they sometimes strike in the same manner the philosopher and the peasant the boy and the man hence the faculty by which we relish such beauties seems more akin to a feeling of sense than to a process of the understanding and accordingly from an external sense it has borrowed its name that sense by which we receive and distinguish the pleasures of food having in several languages given rise to the word taste in the metaphorical meaning under which we now consider it however as in all subjects which regard the operations of the mind the inaccurate use of words is to be carefully avoided it must not be inferred from what i have said that reason is excluded from the exertions of taste though taste beyond doubt be ultimately founded on a certain natural and instinctive sensibility to beauty yet reason as i shall show hereafter assists taste in many of its operations and serves to enlarge its power se dr gerards essay on taste  dalemberts reflections on the use and abuse of philosophy in matters which relate to taste  reflections critiques sur la poesy et sur la peinture tom ii chapter        elements of criticism chap     mr humes essay on the standard of taste  introduction to the essay on the sublime and beautiful   taste in the sense in which i have explained it is a faculty common in some degree to all men nothing that belongs to human nature is more universal than the relish of beauty of one kind or other of what is orderly proportioned grand harmonious new or sprightly in children the rudiments of taste discover themselves very early in a thousand instances in their fondness for regular bodies their admiration of pictures and statues and imitations of all kinds and their strong attachment to whatever is new or mavelous the most ignorant peasants are delighted with ballads and tales and are struck with the beautiful appearances of nature in the earth and heavens even in the deserts of america where human nature shows itself in its most uncultivated state the savages have their ornaments of dress their war and their death songs their harangues and their orators we must therefore conclude the principles of taste to be deeply founded in the human mind it is no less essential to man to have some discernment of beauty than it is to possess the attributes of reason and of speech on the subject of taste considered as a power or faculty of the mind much less is to be found among the ancient than among the modern rhetorical and critical writers the following remarkable passage in cicero serves however to show that his ideas on this subject agree perfectly with what has been said above he is speaking of the beauties of style and numbers illud autem nequis admiretur quonam modo haec vulgus imperitorum in audiendo notet cum in omni genere tum in hoc ipso magna quaedam est vis incredibilisque naturae omnes enim tacito quodam sensu sine ulla art aut ratione quae sint in artibus de rationibus recta et prava dijudicant idque cum faciunt in picturis et in signis et in aliis operibus ad quorum intelligentiam a natura minus habent instrumenti tum multo ostendunt magis in verborum numerorum vocumque judicio quod ea sunt in communibus infixa sensibus neque earum rerum quenquam funditus natura voluit esse expertem cic de orat lib iii cap  0 edit gruteri  quinctilian seems to include taste for which in the sense which we now give to that word the ancients appear to have had no distinct name under what he calls judicium locus de judicio mea quidem opinione adeo partibus hujus operis omnibus connectus ac mistus est ut ne a sententiis quidem aut verbis faltem singulis possit separari nec magis art traditur quam gustus aut odor  ut contraria vitemus et communia ne quid in eloquendo corruptum obscurumque sit referatur oportet ad sensus qui non docentur institut lib vi cap   edit obrechti   but although none be wholly devoid of this faculty yet the degrees in which it is possessed are widely different in some men only the feeble glimmerings of taste appear the beauties which they relish are of the coarsest kind and of these they have but a weak and confused impression while in others taste rises to an acute discernment and a lively enjoyment of the most refined beauties in general we may observe that in the powers and pleasures of taste there is a more remarkable inequality among men than is usually found in point of common sense reason and judgment the constitution of our nature in this as in all other respects discovers admirable wisdom in the distribution of those talents which are necessary for mans wellbeing nature has made less distinction among her children but in the distribution of those which belong only to the ornamental part of life she has bestowed her favors with more frugality she has both sown the seeds more sparingly and rendered a higher culture requisite for bringing them to perfection  this inequality of taste among men is owing without doubt in part to the different frame of their natures to nicer organs and finer internal powers with which some are endowed beyond others but if it be owing in part to nature it is owing to education and culture still more the illustration of this leads to my next remark on this subject that taste is a most improveable faculty if there be any such in human nature a remark which gives great encouragement to such a course of study as we are now proposing to pursue of the truth of this assertion we may easily be convinced by only reflecting on that immense superiority which education and improvement give to civilized above barbarous nations in refinement of taste and on the superiority which they give in the same nation to those who have studied the liberal arts above the rude and untaught vulgar the difference is so great that there is perhaps no one particular in which these two classes of men are so far removed from each other as in respect of the powers and the pleasures of taste and assuredly for this difference no other general cause can be assigned but culture and education  i shall now proceed to show what the means are by which taste becomes so remarkably susceptible of cultivation and progress  reflect first upon that great law of our nature that exercise is the chief source of improvement in all our faculties this holds both in our bodily and in our mental powers it holds even in our external senses although these be less the subject of cultivation than any of our other faculties we see how acute the senses become in persons whose trade or business leads to nice exertions of them touch for instance becomes infinitely more exquisite in men whose employment requires them to examine the polish of bodies than it is in others they who deal in microscopical observations or are accustomed to engrave on precious stones acquire surprising accuracy of sight in discerning the minutest objects and practice in attending to different flavours and tastes of liquors wonderfully improves the power of distinguishing them and of tracing their composition placing internal taste therefore on the footing of a simple sense it cannot be doubted that frequent exercise and curious attention to its proper objects must greatly heighten its power of this we have one clear proof in that part of taste which is called an ear for music experience every days shows that nothing is more improveable only the simplest and plainest compositions are relished at first use and practice extend our pleasure teach us to relish finer melody and by degrees enable us to enter into the intricate and compounded pleasures of harmony so an eye for the beauties of painting is never all at once acquired it is gradually formed by being conversant among pictures and studying the works of the best masters  precisely in the same manner with respect to the beauty of composition and discourse attention to the most approved models study of the best authors comparisons of lower and higher degrees of the same beauties operate toward the refinement of taste when one is only beginning his acquaintance with works of genius the sentiment which attends them is obscure and confused he cannot point out the several excellencies or blemishes of a performance which he peruses he is at a loss on what to rest his judgment all that can be expected is that he should tell in general whether he be pleased or not but allow him more experience in works of this kind and his taste becomes by degrees more exact and enlightened he begins to perceive not only the character of the whole but the beauties and defects of each part and is able to describe the peculiar qualities which he praises or blames the mist dissipates which seemed formerly to hang over the object and he can at length pronounce firmly and without hesitation concerning it thus in taste considered as mere sensibility exercise opens a great source of improvement  but although taste be ultimately founded on sensibility it must not be considered as instinctive sensibility alone reason and good sense as i before hinted have so extensive an influence on all the operations and decisions of taste that a thorough good taste may well be considered as a power compounded of natural sensibility to beauty and of improved understanding in order to be satisfied of this let us observe that the greater part of the productions of genius are no other than imitations of nature representations of the characters actions or manners of men the pleasure we receive from such imitations or representations is founded on mere taste but to judge whether they be properly executed belongs to the understanding which compares the copy with the original  in reading for instance such a poem as the aeneid a great part of our pleasure arises from the plan or story being well conducted and all the parts joined together with probability and due connection from the characters being taken from nature the sentiments being suited to the characters and the style to the sentiments the pleasure which arises from a poem so conducted is felt or enjoyed by taste as an internal sense but the discovery of this conduct in the poem is owing to reason and the more that reason enables us to discover such propriety in the conduct the greater will be our pleasure we are pleased through our natural sense of beauty reason shows us why and upon what grounds we are pleased wherever in works of taste any resemblance to nature is aimed at wherever there is any reference of parts to a whole or of means to an end as there is indeed in almost every writing and discourse there the understanding must always have a great part to act  here then is a wide field for reasons exerting its powers in relation to the objects of taste particularly with respect to composition and works of genius and hence arises a second and a very considerable source of the improvement of taste from the application of reason and good sense to such productions of genius spurious beauties such as unnatural characters forced sentiments affected style may please for a little but they please only because their opposition to nature and to good sense has not been examined or attended to once show how nature might have been more justly imitated or represented how the writer might have managed his subject to greater advantage the illusion will presently be dissipated and those false beauties will please no more  from these two sources then first the frequent exercise of taste and next the application of good sense and reason to the objects of taste taste as a power of the mind receives its improvement in its perfect state it is undoubtedly the result both of nature and of art it supposes our natural sense of beauty to be refined by frequent attention to the most beautiful objects and at the same time to be guided and improved by the light of the understanding  i must be allowed to add that as a sound head so likewise a good heart is a very material requisite to just taste the moral beauties are not only in themselves superior to all others but they exert an influence either more near or more remote on a great variety of other objects of taste wherever the affections characters or actions of men are concerned and these certainly afford the noblest subjects to genius there can be neither any just or affecting description of them nor any thorough feeling of the beauty of that description without our possessing the virtuous affections he whose heart is indelicate or hard he who has no admiration of what is truly noble or praiseworthy nor the proper sympathetic sense of what is soft and tender must have a very imperfect relish of the highest beauties of eloquence and poetry  the characters of taste when brought to its most perfect state are all reducible to two delicacy and correctness  delicacy of taste respects principally the perfection of that natural sensibility on which taste is founded it implies those finer organs or powers which enable us to discover beauties that lie hid from a vulgar eye one may have strong sensibility and yet be deficient in delicate taste he may be deeply impressed by such beauties as he perceives but he perceives only what is in some degree coarse what is bold and palpable while chaster and simpler ornaments escape his notice in this state taste generally exists among rude and unrefined nations but a person of delicate taste both feels strongly and feels accurately he sees distinctions and differences where others see none the most latent beauty does not escape him and he is sensible of the smallest blemish delicacy of taste is judged of by the same marks that we use in judging of the delicacy of an external sense as the goodness of the palate is not tried by strong flavours but by a mixture of ingredients where notwithstanding the confusion we remain sensible of each in like manner delicacy of internal taste appears by a quick and lively sensibility to its finest most compounded or most latent objects  correctness of taste respects chiefly the improvement which that faculty receives through its connection with the understanding a man of correct taste is one who is never imposed on by counterfeit beauties who carries always in his mind that standard of good sense which he employs in judging of every thing he estimates with propriety the comparative merit of the several beauties which he meets with in any work of genius refers them to their proper classes assigns the principles as far as they can be traced whence their power of pleasing us flows and is pleased himself precisely in that degree in which he ought and no more  it is true that these two qualities of taste delicacy and correctness mutually imply each other no taste can be exquisitely delicate without being correct nor can be thoroughly correct without being delicate but still a predominancy of one or other quality in the mixture is often visible the power of delicacy is chiefly seen in discerning the true merit of a work the power of correctness in rejecting false pretensions to merit delicacy leans more to feeling correctness more to reason and judgment the former is more the gift of nature the latter more the product of culture and art among the ancient critics longinus possessed most delicacy aristotle most correctness among the moderns mr addison is a high example of delicate taste dean swift had he written on the subject of criticism would perhaps have afforded the example of a correct one  having viewed taste in its most improved and perfect state i come next to consider its deviations from that state the fluctuations and changes to which it is liable and to enquire whether in the midst of these there be any means of distinguishing a true from a corrupted taste this brings us to the most difficult part of our task for it must be acknowledged that no principle of the human mind is in its operations more fluctuating and capricious than taste its variations have been so great and frequent as to create a suspicion with some of its being merely arbitrary grounded on no foundation ascertainable by no standard but wholly dependent on changing fancy the consequence of which would be that all studies or regular enquiries concerning the objects of taste were vain in architecture the grecian models were long esteemed the most perfect in succeeding ages the gothic architecture alone prevailed and afterward the grecian taste revived in all its vigor and engrossed the public admiration in eloquence and poetry the asiatics at no time relished any thing but what was full of ornament and splendid in a degree that we would denominate gaudy whilst the greeks admired only chaste and simple beauties and despised the asiatic ostentation in our own country how many writings that were greatly extolled two or three centuries ago are now fallen into entire disrepute and oblivion without going back to remote instances how very different is the taste of poetry which prevails in great britain now from what prevailed there no longer ago than the reign of king charles ii which the authors too of that time deemed an augustan age when nothing was in vogue but an affected brilliancy of wit when the simple majesty of milton was overlooked and paradise lost almost entirely unknown when cowleys labored and unnatural conceits were admired as the very quintessence of genius wallers gay sprightliness was mistaken for the tender spirit of love poetry and such writers as suckling and etheridge were held in esteem for dramatic composition  the question is what conclusion we are to form from such instances as these is there any thing that can be called a standard of taste by appealing to which we may distinguish between a good and a bad taste or is there in truth no such distinction and are we to hold that according to the proverb there is no disputing of tastes but that whatever pleases is right for that reason that it does please this is the question and a very nice and subtle one it is which we are now to discuss  i begin by observing that if there be no such thing as any standard of taste this consequence must immediately follow that all tastes are equally good a position which though it may pass unnoticed in slight matters and when we speak of the lesser differences among the tastes of men yet when we apply it to the extremes its absurdity presently becomes glaring for is there any one who will seriously maintain that the taste of a hottentot or a laplander is as delicate and as correct as that of a longinus or an addison or that he can be charged with no defect or incapacity who thinks a common newswriter as excellent an historian as tacitus as it would be held downright extravagance to talk in this manner we are led unavoidably to this conclusion that there is some foundation for the preference of one mans taste to that of another or that there is a good and a bad right and a wrong in taste as in other things  but to prevent mistakes on this subject it is necessary to observe next that the diversity of tastes which prevails among mankind does not in every case infer corruption of taste or oblige us to seek for some standard in order to determine who are in the right the tastes of men may differ very considerably as to their object and yet none of them be wrong one man relishes poetry most another takes pleasure in nothing but history one prefers comedy another tragedy one admires the simple another the ornamented style the young are amused with gay and sprightly compositions the elderly are more entertained with those of a graver cast some nations delight in bold pictures of manners and strong representations of passion others incline to more correct and regular elegance both in description and sentiment though all differ yet all pitch upon some one beauty which peculiarly suits their turn of mind and therefore no one has a title to condemn the rest it is not in matters of taste as in questions of mere reason where there is but one conclusion that can be true and all the rest are erroneous truth which is the object of reason is one beauty which is the object of taste is manifold taste therefore admits of latitude and diversity of objects in sufficient consistency with goodness or justness of taste  but then to explain this matter thoroughly i must observe farther that this admissible diversity of tastes can only have place where the objects of taste are different where it is with respect to the same object that men disagree when one condemns that as ugly which another admires as highly beautiful then it is no longer diversity but direct opposition of taste that takes place and therefore one must be in the right and another in the wrong unless that absurd paradox were allowed to hold that all tastes are equally good and true one man prefers virgil to homer suppose that i on the other hand admire homer more than virgil i have as yet no reason to say that our tastes are contradictory the other person is most struck with the elegance and tenderness which are the characteristics of virgil i with the simplicity and fire of homer as long as neither of us deny that both homer and virgil have great beauties our difference falls within the compass of that diversity of tastes which i have showed to be natural and allowable but if the other man shall assert that homer has no beauties whatever that he holds him to be a dull and spiritless writer and that he would as soon peruse any old legend of knighterrantry as the iliad then i exclaim that my antagonist either is void of all taste or that his taste is corrupted in a miserable degree and i appeal to whatever i think the standard of taste to show him that he is in the wrong  what that standard is to which in such opposition of tastes we are obliged to have recourse remains to be traced a standard properly signifies that which is of such undoubted authority as to be the test of other things of the same kind thus a standard weight or measure is that which is appointed by law to regulate all other measures and weights thus the court is said to be the standard of good breeding and the scripture of theological truth  when we say that nature is the standard of taste we lay down a principle very true and just as far as it can be applied there is no doubt that in all cases where an imitation is intended of some object that exists in nature as in representing human characters or actions conformity to nature affords a full and distinct criterion of what is truly beautiful reason has in such cases full scope for exerting its authority for approving or condemning by comparing the copy with the original but there are innumerable cases in which this rule cannot be at all applied and conformity to nature is an expression frequently used without any distinct or determinate meaning we must therefore search for somewhat that can be rendered more clear and precise to be the standard of taste  taste as i before explained it is ultimately founded on an internal sense of beauty which is natural to men and which in its application to particular objects is capable of being guided and enlightened by reason now were there any one person who possessed in full perfection all the powers of human nature whose internal senses were in every instance exquisite and just and whose reason was unerring and sure the determinations of such a person concerning beauty would beyond doubt be a perfect standard for the taste of all others wherever their taste differed from his it could be imputed only to some imperfection in their natural powers but as there is no such living standard no one person to whom all mankind will allow such submission to be due what is there of sufficient authority to be the standard of the various and opposite tastes of men most certainly there is nothing but the taste as far as it can be gathered of human nature that which men concur the most in admiring must be held to be beautiful his taste must be esteemed just and true which coincides with the general sentiments of men in this standard we must rest to the sense of mankind the ultimate appeal must ever lie in all works of taste if any one should maintain that sugar was bitter and tobacco was sweet no reasonings could avail to prove it the taste of such a person would infallibly be held to be diseased merely because it differed so widely from the taste of the species to which he belongs in like manner with regard to the objects of sentiment or internal taste the common feelings of men carry the same authority and have a title to regulate the taste of every individual  but have we then it will be said no other criterion of what is beautiful than the approbation of the majority must we collect the voices of others before we form any judgment for ourselves of what deserves applause in eloquence or poetry by no means there are principles of reason and sound judgment which can be applied to matters of taste as well as to the subjects of science and philosophy he who admires or censures any work of genius is always ready if his taste be in any degree improved to assign some reasons of his decision he appeals to principles and points out the grounds on which he proceeds taste is a sort of compound power in which the light of the understanding always mingles more or less with the feelings of sentiment  but though reason can carry us a certain length in judging concerning works of taste it is not to be forgotten that the ultimate conclusions to which our reasonings lead refer at last to sense and perception we may speculate and argue concerning propriety of conduct in a tragedy or an epic poem just reasonings on the subject will correct the caprice of unenlightened taste and establish principles for judging of what deserves praise but at the same time these reasonings appeal always in the last resort to feeling the foundation upon which they rest is what has been found from experience to please mankind most universally upon this ground we prefer a simple and natural to an artificial and affected style a regular and wellconnected story to loose and scattered narratives a catastrophe which is tender and pathetic to one which leaves us unmoved it is from consulting our own imagination and heart and from attending to the feelings of others that any principles are formed which acquire authority in matters of taste the difference between the authors who found the standard of taste upon the common feelings of human nature ascertained by general approbation and those who found it upon established principles which can be ascertained by reason is more an apparent than a real difference like many other literary controversies it turns chiefly on modes of expression for they who lay the greatest stress on sentiment and feeling make no scruple of applying argument and reason to matters of taste they appeal like other writers to established principles in judging of the excellencies of eloquence or poetry and plainly show that the general approbation to which they ultimately recur is an approbation resulting from discussion as well as from sentiment they on the other hand who in order to vindicate taste from any suspicion of being arbitrary maintain that it is ascertainable by the standard of reason admit nevertheless that what pleases universally must on that account be held to be truly beautiful and that no rules or conclusions concerning objects of taste can have any just authority if they be found to contradict the general sentiments of men these two systems therefore differ in reality very little from one another sentiment and reason enter into both and by allowing to each of these powers its due place both systems may be rendered consistent accordingly it is in this light that i have endeavored to place the subject   when we refer to the concurring sentiments of men as the ultimate test of what is to be accounted beautiful in the arts this is to be always understood of men placed in such situations as are favorable to the proper exertions of taste every one must perceive that among rude and uncivilized nations and during the ages of ignorance and darkness any loose notions that are entertained concerning such subjects carry no authority in those states of society taste has no materials on which to operate it is either totally suppressed or appears in its lowest and most imperfect form we refer to the sentiments of mankind in polished and flourishing nations when arts are cultivated and manners refined when works of genius are subjected to free discussion and taste is improved by science and philosophy  even among nations at such a period of society i admit that accidental causes may occasionally warp the proper operations of taste sometimes the state of religion sometimes the form of government may for a while pervert it a licentious court may introduce a taste for false ornaments and dissolute writings the usage of one admired genius may procure approbation for his faults and even render them fashionable sometimes envy may have power to bear down for a little productions of great merit while popular humor or party spirit may at other times exalt to a high though shortlived reputation what little deserved it but though such casual circumstances give the appearance of caprice to the judgments of taste that appearance is easily corrected in the course of time the genuine taste of human nature never fails to disclose itself and to gain the ascendant over any fantastic and corrupted modes of taste which may chance to have been introduced these may have currency for a while and mislead superficial judges but being subjected to examination by degrees they pass away while that alone remains which is founded on sound reason and tha native feelings of men  i by no means pretend that there is any standard of taste to which in every particular instance we can resort for clear and immediate determination where indeed is such a standard to be found for deciding any of those great controversies in reason and philosophy which perpetually divide mankind in the present case there was plainly no occasion for any such strict and absolute provision to be made in order to judge of what is morally good or evil of what man ought or ought not in duty to do it was fit that the means of clear and precise determination should be afforded us but to ascertain in every case with the utmost exactness what is beautiful or elegant was not at all necessary to the happiness of man and therefore some diversity in feeling was here allowed to take place and room was left for discussion and debate concerning the degree of approbation to which any work of genius is entitled  the conclusion which it is sufficient for us to rest upon is that taste is far from being an arbitrary principle which is subject to the fancy of every individual and which admits of no criterion for determining whether it be false or true its foundation is the same in all human minds it is built upon sentiments and perceptions which belong to our nature and which in general operate with the same uniformity as our other intellectual principles when these sentiments are perverted by ignorance and prejudice they are capable of being rectified by reason their sound and natural state is ultimately determined by comparing them with the general taste of mankind let men declaim as much as they please concerning the caprice and the uncertainty of taste it is found by experience that there are beauties which if they be displayed in a proper light have power to command lasting and general admiration in every composition what interests the imagination and touches the heart pleases all ages and all nations there is a certain string which being properly struck the human heart is so made as to answer to it  hence the universal testimony which the most improved nations of the earth have conspired throughout a long tract of ages to give to some few works of genius such as the iliad of homer and the aeneid of virgil hence the authority which such works have acquired as standards in some degree of poetical composition since from them we are enabled to collect what the sense of mankind is concerning those beauties which give them the highest pleasure and which therefore poetry ought to exhibit authority or prejudice may in one age or country give a temporary reputation to an indifferent poet or a bad artist but when foreigners or when posterity examine his works his faults are discerned and the genuine taste of human nature appears opinionum commenta delet dies naturae judicia confirmat time overthrows the illusions of opinion but establishes the decisions of nature  lecture iii criticism  genius  pleasures of taste  sublimity in objects taste criticism and genius are words currently employed without distinct ideas annexed to them in beginning a course of lectures where such words must often occur it is necessary to ascertain their meaning with some precision having in the last lecture treated of taste i proceed to explain the nature and foundation of criticism true criticism is the application of taste and of good sense to the several fine arts the object which it proposes is to distinguish what is beautiful and what is faulty in every performance from particular instances to ascend to general principles and so to form rules or conclusions concerning the several kinds of beauty in works of genius  the rules of criticism are not formed by any induction a priori as it is called that is they are not formed by a train of abstract reasoning independent of facts and observations criticism is an art founded wholly on experience on the observation of such beauties as have come nearest to the standard which i before established that is of such beauties as have been found to please mankind most generally for example aristotles rules concerning the unity of action in dramatic and epic composition were not rules first discovered by logical reasoning and then applied to poetry but they were drawn from the practice of homer and sophocles they were founded upon observing the superior pleasure which we receive from the relation of an action which is one and entire beyond what we receive from the relation of scattered and unconnected facts such observations taking their rise at first from feeling and experience were found on examination to be so consonant to reason and to the principles of human nature as to pass into established rules and to be conveniently applied for judging of the excellency of any performance this is the most natural account of the origin of criticism  a masterly genius it is true will of himself untaught compose in such a manner as shall be agreeable to the most material rules of criticism for as these rules are founded in nature nature will often suggest them in practice homer it is more than probable was acquainted with no systems of the art of poetry guided by genius alone he composed in verse a regular story which all posterity has admired but this is no argument against the usefulness of criticism as an art for as no human genius is perfect there is no writer but may receive assistance from critical observations upon the beauties and faults of those who have gone before him no observations or rules can indeed supply the defect of genius or inspire it where it is wanting but they may often direct it into its proper channel they may correct its extravagancies and point out to it the most just and proper imitation of nature critical rules are designed chiefly to show the faults that ought to be avoided to nature we must be indebted for the production of eminent beauties  from what has been said we are enabled to form a judgment concerning those complaints which it has long been fashionable for petty authors to make against critics and criticism critics have been represented as the great abridgers of the native liberty of genius as the imposers of unnatural shackles and bonds upon writers from whose cruel persecution they must fly to the public and implore its protection such supplicatory prefaces are not calculated to give very favorable ideas of the genius of the author for every good writer will be pleased to have his work examined by the principles of sound understanding and true taste the declamations against criticism commonly proceed upon this supposition that critics are such as judge by rule not by feeling which is so far from being true that they who judge after this manner are pedants not critics for all the rules of genuine criticism i have shown to be ultimately founded on feeling and taste and feeling are necessary to guide us in the application of these rules to every particular instance as there is nothing in which all sorts of persons more readily affect to be judges than in works of taste there is no doubt that the number of incompetent critics will always be great but this affords no more foundation for a general invective against criticism than the number of bad philosophers or reasoners affords against reason and philosophy  an objection more plausible may be formed against criticism from the applause that some performances have received from the public which when accurately considered are found to contradict the rules established by criticism now according to the principles laid down in the last lecture the public is the supreme judge to whom the last appeal must be made in every work of taste as the standard of taste is founded on the sentiments that are natural and common to all men but with respect to this we are to observe that the sense of the public is often too hastily judged of the genuine public taste does not always appear in the first applause given upon the publication of any new work there are both a great vulgar and a small apt to be catched and dazzled by very superficial beauties the admiration of which in a little time passes away and sometimes a writer may acquire great temporary reputation merely by his compliance with the passions or prejudices with the partyspirit or superstitious notions that may chance to rule for a time almost a whole nation in such cases though the public may seem to praise true criticism may with reason condemn and it will in progress of time gain the ascendant for the judgment of true criticism and the voice of the public when once become unprejudiced and dispassionate will ever coincide at last  instances i admit there are of some works that contain gross transgressions of the laws of criticism acquiring nevertheless a general and even a lasting admiration such are the plays of shakespeare which considered as dramatic poems are irregular in the highest degree but then we are to remark that they have gained the public admiration not by their being irregular not by their transgressions of the rules of art but in spite of such transgressions they possess other beauties which are conformable to just rules and the force of these beauties has been so great as to overpower all censure and to give the public a degree of satisfaction superior to the disgust arising from their blemishes shakespeare pleases not by his bringing the transactions of many years into one play not by his grotesque mixtures of tragedy and comedy in one piece nor by the strained thoughts and affected witticisms which he sometimes employs these we consider as blemishes and impute them to the grossness of the age in which he lived but he pleases by his animated and masterly representations of characters by the liveliness of his descriptions the force of his sentiments and his possessing beyond all writers the natural language of passion beauties which true criticism no less teaches us to place in the highest rank than nature teaches us to feel  this much it may suffice to have said concerning the origin office and importance of criticism  i proceed next to explain the meaning of another term which there will be frequent occasion to employ in these lectures that is genius  taste and genius are two words frequently joined together and therefore by innaccurate thinkers confounded they signify however two quite different things the difference between them can be clearly pointed out and it is of importance to remember it taste consists in the power of judging genius in the power of executing one may have a considerable degree of taste in poetry eloquence or any of the fine arts who has little or hardly any genius for composition or execution in any of these arts but genius cannot be found without including taste also genius therefore deserves to be considered as a higher power of the mind than taste genius always imports something inventive or creative which does not rest in mere sensibility to beauty where it is perceived but which can moreover produce new beauties and exhibit them in such a manner as strongly to impress the minds of others refined taste forms a good critic but genius is farther necessary to form the poet or the orator  it is proper also to observe that genius is a word which in common acceptance extends much farther than to the objects of taste it is used to signify that talent or aptitude which we receive from nature for excelling in any one thing whatever thus we speak of a genius for mathematics as well as a genius for poetry of a genius for war for politics or for any mechanical employment  this talent or aptitude for excelling in some one particular is i have said what we receive from nature by art and study no doubt it may be greatly improved but by them alone it cannot be acquired as genius is a higher faculty than taste it is ever according to the usual frugality of nature more limited in the sphere of its operations it is not uncommon to meet with persons who have an excellent taste in several of the polite arts such as music poetry painting and eloquence altogether but to find one who is an excellent performer in all these arts is much more rare or rather indeed such an one is not to be looked for a fort of universal genius or one who is equally and indifferently turned toward several different professions and arts is not likely to excel in any although there may be some few exceptions yet in general it holds that when the bent of the mind is wholly directed toward some one object exclusive in a manner of others there is the fairest prospect of eminence in that whatever it be the rays must converge to a point in order to glow intensely this remark i here choose to make on account of its great importance to young people in leading them to examine with care and to pursue with ardour the current and pointing of nature toward those exertions of genius in which they are most likely to excel  a genius for any of the fine arts as i before observed always supposes taste and it is clear that the improvement of taste will serve both to forward and to correct the operations of genius in proportion as the taste of a poet or orator becomes more refined with respect to the beauties of composition it will certainly assist him to produce the more finished beauties in his work genius however in a poet or orator may sometimes exist in a higher degree than taste that is genius may be bold and strong when taste is neither very delicate nor very correct this is often the case in the infancy of arts a period when genius frequently exerts itself with great vigor and executes with much warmth while taste which requires experience and improves by slower degrees has not yet attained its full growth homer and shakespeare are proofs of what i now assert in whose admirable writings are found instances of rudeness and indelicacy which the more refined taste of later writers who had far inferior genius to them would have taught them to avoid as all human perfection is limited this may very probably be the law of our nature that it is not given to one man to execute with vigor and fire and at the same time to attend to all the lesser and more refined graces that belong to the exact perfection of his work while on the other hand a thorough taste for those inferior graces is for the most part accompanied with a diminution of sublimity and force  having thus explained the nature of taste the nature and importance of criticism and the distinction between taste and genius i am now to enter on considering the sources of the pleasures of taste here opens a very extensive field no less than all the pleasures of the imagination as they are commonly called whether afforded us by natural objects or by the imitations and descriptions of them but it is not necessary to the purpose of my lectures that all these should be examined fully the pleasure which we receive from discourse or writing being the main object of them all that i purpose is to give some openings into the pleasures of taste in general and to insist more particularly upon sublimity and beauty  we are far from having yet attained to any system concerning this subject mr addison was the first who attempted a regular enquiry in his essay on the pleasures of the imagination published in the sixth volume of the spectator he has reduced these pleasures under three heads beauty grandeur and novelty his speculations on this subject if not exceedingly profound are however very beautiful and entertaining and he has the merit of having opened a tract which was before unbeaten the advances made since his time in this curious part of philosophical criticism are not very considerable though some ingenious writers have pursued the subject this is owing doubtless to that thinness and subtility which are found to be properties of all the feelings of taste they are engaging objects but when we would lay firm hold of them and subject them to a regular discussion they are always ready to elude our grasp it is difficult to make a full enumeration of the several objects that give pleasure to taste it is more difficult to define all those which have been discovered and to reduce them under proper classes and when we would go farther and investigate the efficient causes of the pleasure which we receive from such objects here above all we find ourselves at a loss for instance we all learn by experience that certain figures of bodies appear to us more beautiful than others on enquiring farther we find that the regularity of some figures and the graceful variety of others are the foundation of the beauty which we discern in them but when we attempt to go a step beyond this and enquire what is the cause of regularity and variety producing in our minds the sensation of beauty any reason we can assign is extremely imperfect those first principles of internal sensation nature seems to have covered with an impenetrable veil  it is some comfort however that although the efficient cause be obscure the final cause of those sensations lies in many cases more open and in entering on this subject we cannot avoid taking notice of the strong impression which the powers of taste and imagination are calculated to give us of the benignity of our creator by endowing us with such powers he has widely enlarged the sphere of the pleasures of human life and those too of a kind the most pure and innocent the necessary purposes of life might have been abundantly answered though our senses of seeing and hearing had only served to distinguish external objects without conveying to us any of those refined and delicate sensations of beauty and grandeur with which we are now so much delighted this additional embellishment and glory which for promoting our entertainment the author of nature has poured forth upon his works is one striking testimony among many others of benevolence and goodness this thought which mr addison first started dr akenside in his poem on the pleasures of the imagination has happily pursued  not content with every food of life to nourish man by kind illusions of the wondering sense thou make all nature beauty to his eye or music to his ear    i shall begin with considering the pleasure which arises from sublimity or grandeur of which i propose to treat at some length both as this has a character more precise and distinctly marked than any other of the pleasures of the imagination and as it coincides more directly with our main subject for the greater distinctness i shall first treat of the grandeur or sublimity of external objects themselves which will employ the rest of this lecture and afterward of the description of such objects or of what is called the sublime in writing which shall be the subject of a following lecture i distinguish these two things from one another the grandeur of the objects themselves when they are presented to the eye and the description of that grandeur in discourse or writing though most critics inaccurately i think blend them together and i consider grandeur and sublimity as terms synonymous or nearly so if there be any distinction between them it arises from sublimitys expressing grandeur in its highest degree see a philosophical inquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautiful dr gerard on taste section ii elements of criticism chap iv   it is not easy to describe in words the precise impression which great and sublime objects make upon us when we behold them but every one has a conception of it it consists in a kind of admiration and expansion of the mind it raises the mind much above its ordinary state and fills it with a degree of wonder and astonishment which it cannot well express the emotion is certainly delightful but it is altogether of the serious kind a degree of awfulness and solemnity even approaching to severity commonly attends it when at its height very distinguishable from the more gay and brisk emotion raised by beautiful objects  the simplest form of external grandeur appears in the vast and boundless prospects presented to us by nature such as wide extended plains to which the eye can see no limits the firmament of heaven or the boundless expanse of the ocean all vastness produces the impression of sublimity it is to be remarked however that space extended in length makes not so strong an impression as height or depth though a boundless plain be a grand object yet a high mountain to which we look up or an awful precipice or tower whence we look down on the objects which lie below is still more so the excessive grandeur of the firmament arises from its height joined to its boundless extent and that of the ocean not from its extent alone but from the perpetual motion and irresistible force of that mass of waters wherever space is concerned it is clear that amplitude or greatness of extent in one dimension or other is necessary to grandeur remove all bounds from any object and you presently render it sublime hence infinite space endless numbers and eternal duration fill the mind with great ideas  from this some have imagined that vastness or amplitude of extent is the foundation of all sublimity but i cannot be of this opinion because many objects appear sublime which have no relation to space at all such for instance is great loudness of sound the burst of thunder or of cannon the roaring of winds the shouting of multitudes the sound of vast cataracts of water are all incontestibly grand objects i heard the voice of a great multitude as the sound of many waters and of mighty thunderings saying allelujah in general we may observe that great power and force exerted always raise sublime ideas and perhaps the most copious source of these is derived from this quarter hence the grandeur of earthquakes and burning mountains of great conflagrations of the stormy ocean and overflowing waters of tempests of wind of thunder and lightning and of all the uncommon violence of the elements nothing is more sublime than mighty power and strength a stream that runs within its banks is a beautiful object but when it rushes down with the impetuosity and noise of a torrent it presently becomes a sublime one from lions and other animals of strength are drawn sublime comparisons in poets a race horse is looked upon with pleasure but it is the warhorse whose neck is clothed with thunder that carries grandeur in its idea the engagement of two great armies as it is the highest exertion of human might combines a variety of sources of the sublime and has accordingly been always considered as one of the most striking and magnificent spectacles that can be either presented to the eye or exhibited to the imagination in description  for the farther illustration of this subject it is proper to remark that all ideas of the solemn and awful kind and even bordering on the terrible tend greatly to assist the sublime such as darkness solitude and silence what are the scenes of nature that elevate the mind in the highest degree and produce the sublime sensation not the gay landscape the flowery field or the flourishing city but the hoary mountain and the solitary lake the aged forest and the torrent falling over the rock hence too nightscenes are commonly the most sublime the firmament when filled with stars scattered in such vast numbers and with such magnificent profusion strikes the imagination with a more awful grandeur than when we view it enlightened by all the splendor of the sun the deep sound of a great bell or the striking of a great clock are at any time grand but when heard amid the silence and stillness of the night they become doubly so darkness is very commonly applied for adding sublimity to all our ideas of the deity he makes darkness his pavilion he dwells in the thick cloud so milton  how often amidst thick clouds and dark does heavens allruling sire choose to reside his glory unobscured and with the majesty of darkness round circles his throne  book ii     observe with how much art virgil has introduced all those ideas of silence vacuity and darkness when he is going to introduce his hero to the infernal regions and to disclose the secrets of the great deep dii quibus imperium est animarum umbraeque silentes et chaos et phlegethon loca nocte silentia late sit mihi fas audita loqui sit numine vestro pandere res alta terra and caligine mersas ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram perque domos ditis vacuos et inania regna quale per incertam lunam sub luce maligna est iter in sylvis  ye subterranean gods whose awful sway the gliding ghosts and silent shades obey o chaos hear and phlegethon profound whose solemn empire stretches wide around give me ye great tremendous powers to tell of scenes and wonders in the depths of hell give me your mighty secrets to display from those black realms of darkness to the day pit obscure they went through dreary shades that led along the waste dominions of the dead as wander travelers in woods by night by the moons doubtful and malignant light dryden  these passages i quote at present not so much as instances of sublime writing though in themselves they truly are so as to show by the effect of them that the objects which they present to us belong to the class of sublime ones  obscurity we are farther to remark is not unfavourable to the sublime though it render the object indistinct the impression however may be great for as an ingenious author has well observed it is one thing to make an idea clear and another to make it affecting to the imagination and the imagination may be strongly affected and in fact often is so by objects of which we have no clear conception thus we see that almost all the descriptions given us of the appearances of supernatural beings carry some sublimity though the conceptions which they afford us be confused and indistinct their sublimity arises from the ideas which they always convey of superior power and might joined with an awful obscurity we may see this fully exemplified in the following noble passage of the book of job in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep falls upon men fear came upon me and trembling which made all my bones to shake then a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood up it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof an image was before mine eyes there was silence and i heard a voice  shall mortal man be more just than god the picture which lucretius has drawn of the dominion of superstition over mankind representing it as a portentous spectre showing its head from the clouds and dismaying the whole human race with its countenance together with the magnanimity of epicurus in raising himself up against it carries all the grandeur of a sublime obscure and awful image humana ante oculos foede cum vita jaceret in terris oppressa gravi sub religione quae caput a coeli regionibus ostendebat horribili super aspectu mortalibus instans primum graius homo mortales tollere contra est oculos ausus  lib i  job iv    no ideas it is plain as are so sublime as those taken from the supreme being the most unknown but the greatest of all objects the infinity of whose nature and the eternity of whose duration joined with the omnipotence of his power though they surpass our conceptions yet exalt them to the highest in general all objects that are greatly raised above us or far removed from us either in space or in time are apt to strike us as great our viewing them as through the mist of distance or antiquity is favorable to the impressions of their sublimity  as obscurity so disorder too is very compatible with grandeur nay frequently heightens it few things that are strictly regular and methodical appear sublime we see the limits on every side we feel ourselves confined there is no room for the minds exerting any great effort exact proportion of parts though it enters often into the beautiful is much disregarded in the sublime a great mass of rocks thrown together by the hand of nature with wildness and confusion strike the mind with more grandeur than if they had been adjusted to each other with the most accurate symmetry  in the feeble attempts which human art can make toward producing grand objects feeble i mean in comparison with the powers of nature greatness of dimensions always constitutes a principal part no pile of building can convey any idea of sublimity unless it be ample and lofty there is too in architecture what is called greatness of manner which seems chiefly to arise from presenting the object to us in one full point of view so that it shall make its impression whole entire and undivided upon the mind a gothic cathedral raises ideas of grandeur in our minds by its size its height its awful obscurity its strength its antiquity and its durability  there still remains to be mentioned one class of sublime objects what may be called the moral or sentimental sublime arising from certain exertions of the human mind from certain affections and actions of our fellow creatures these will be found to be all or chiefly of that class which comes under the name of magnanimity or heroism and they produce an effect extremely similar to what is produced by the view of grand objects in nature filling the mind with admiration and elevating it above itself a noted instance of this quoted by all the french critics is the celebrated quil mourut of corneille in the tragedy of horace in the famous combat betwixt the horatii and the curiatii the old horatius being informed that two of his sons are slain and that the third had betaken himself to flight at first will not believe the report but being thoroughly assured of the fact is fired with all the sentiments of high honor and indignation at this supposed unworthy behavior of his surviving son he is reminded that his son stood alone against three and asked what he would have had him to have done  to have died  he answers in the same manner porus taken prisoner by alexander after a gallant defense and asked in what manner he would be treated answering like a king and caesar chiding the pilot who was afraid to set out with him in a storm quid times caesarem vehis are good instances of this sentimental sublime wherever in some critical and high situation we behold a man uncommonly intrepid and resting upon himself superior to passion and to fear animated by some great principle to the contempt of popular opinion of selfish interest of dangers or of death there we are struck with a sense of the sublime the sublime in natural and in moral objects is brought before us in one view and compared together in the following beautiful passage of akensidess pleasures of the imagination look then abroad through nature to the range of planets suns and adamantine spheres wheeling unshaken through the void immense and speak o man does this capacious scene with half that kindling majesty dilate thy strong conception as when brutus rose refulgent from the stroke of caesars fate amid the crowd of patriots and his arm aloft extending like eternal jove when guilt brings down the thunder called aloud on tullys name and shook his crimson steel and bade the father of his country hail for lo the tyrant prostrate on the dust and rome again is free book i   high virtue is the most natural and fertile source of this moral sublimity however on some occasions where virtue either has no place or is but imperfectly displayed yet if extraordinary vigor and force of mind be discovered we are not insensible to a degree of grandeur in the character and from the splendid conqueror or the daring conspirator whom we are far from approving we cannot withold our admiration silius italicus has studied to give an august idea of hannibal by representing him as surrounded with all his victories in the place of guards one who had formed a design of assassinating him in the midst of a feast is thus addressed fallit te mensas inter quod credis inermem tot bellis quaesita viro tot coedibus armat majestas aeterna ducem si admoveris ora cannas and trebiam ante oculos trasymenaque busta et pauli stare ingentem miraberis umbram a thought somewhat of the same nature occurs in a french author il se cache mais sa reputation le decouvre il march sans suite and sans equipage mais chacun dans son esprit le met sur un char de triomphe on compte en le voiant les ennemis quil a vaincus non pas les serviteurs qui le suivent tout seul quil est on se figure autour de lui ses vertus and ses victoires que laccompagnent moins il est superbe plus il devient venerable oraison funebre de m de turenne par m flechier  both these passages are splendid rather than sublime in the first there is a want of justness in the thought in the second of simplicity in the expression   i have now enumerated a variety of instances both in inanimate objects and in human life wherein the sublime appears in all these instances the emotion raised in us is of the same kind although the objects that produce the emotion be of widely different kinds a question next arises whether we are able to discover some one fundamental quality in which all these different objects agree and which is the cause of their producing an emotion of the same nature in our minds various hypotheses have been formed concerning this but as far as appears to me hitherto unsatisfactory some have imagined that amplitude or great extent joined with simplicity is either immediately or remotely the fundamental quality of whatever is sublime but we have seen that amplitude is confined to one species of sublime objects and cannot without violent straining be applied to them all the author of a philosophical enquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautiful to whom we are indebted for several ingenious and original thoughts upon this subject proposes a formal theory upon this foundation that terror is the source of the sublime and that no objects have this character but such as produce impressions of pain and danger it is indeed true that many terrible objects are highly sublime and that grandeur does not refuse an alliance with the idea of danger but though this is very properly illustrated by the author many of whose sentiments on that head i have adopted yet he seems to stretch his theory too far when he represents the sublime as consisting wholly in modes of danger or of pain for the proper sensation of sublimity appears to be very distinguishable from the sensation of either of those and on several occasions to be entirely separated from them in many grand objects there is no coincidence with terror at all as in the magnificent prospect of wide extended plains and of the starry firmament or in the moral dispositions and sentiments which we view with high admiration and in many painful and terrible objects also it is clear there is no sort of grandeur the amputation of a limb or the bite of a snake are exceedingly terrible but are destitute of all claim whatever to sublimity i am inclined to think that mighty force or power whether accompanied with terror or not whether employed in protecting or in alarming us has a better title than any thing that has yet been mentioned to be the fundamental quality of the sublime as after the review which we have taken there does not occur to me any sublime object into the idea of which power strength and force either enter not directly or are not at least intimately associated with the idea by leading our thoughts to some astonishing power as concerned in the production of the object however i do not insist upon this as sufficient to found a general theory it is enough now to have given this view of the nature and different kinds of sublime objects by which i hope to have laid a proper foundation for discussing with greater accuracy the sublime in writing and composition  lecture iv the sublime in writing having treated of grandeur or sublimity in external objects the way seems now to be cleared for treating with more advantage of the description of such objects or of what is called the sublime in writing though it may appear early to enter on the consideration of this subject yet as the sublime is a species of writing which depends less than any other on the artificial embellishments of rhetoric it may be examined with as much propriety here as in any subsequent part of the lectures  many critical terms have unfortunately been employed in a sense too loose and vague none more so than that of the sublime every one is acquainted with the character of caesars commentaries and of the style in which they are written a style remarkably pure simple and elegant but the most remote from the sublime of any of the classical authors yet this author has a german critic johannes gulielmus bergerus who wrote no longer ago than the year    0 pitched upon as the perfect model of the sublime and has composed a quarto volume entitled de naturali pulchritudine orationis the express intention of which is to show that caesars commentaries contain the most complete exemplification of all longinuss rules relating to sublime writing this i mention as a strong proof of the confused ideas which have prevailed concerning this subject the true sense of sublime writing undoubtedly is such a description of objects or exhibition of sentiments which are in themselves of a sublime nature as shall give us strong impressions of them but there is another very indefinite and therefore very improper sense which has been too often put upon it when it is applied to fignify any remarkable and distinguishing excellency of composition whether it raise in us the ideas of grandeur or those of gentleness elegance or any other sort of beauty in this sense caesars commentaries may indeed be termed sublime and so may many sonnets pastorals and love elegies as well as homers iliad but this evidently confounds the use of words and marks no one species or character of composition whatever  i am sorry to be obliged to observe that the sublime is too often used in this last and improper sense by the celebrated critic longinus in his treatise on this subject he sets out indeed with describing it in its just and proper meaning as something that elevates the mind above itself and fills it with high conceptions and a noble pride but from this view of it he frequently departs and substitutes in the place of it whatever in any strain of composition pleases highly thus many of the passages which he produces as instances of the sublime are merely elegant without having the most distant relation to proper sublimity witness sapphos famous ode on which he descants at considerable length he points out five sources of the sublime the first is boldness or grandeur in the thoughts the second is the pathetic the third the proper application of figures the fourth the use of tropes and beautiful expressions the fifth musical structure and arrangement of words this is the plan of one who was writing a treatise of rhetoric or of the beauties of writing in general not of the sublime in particular for of these five heads only the two first have any peculiar relation to the sublime boldness and grandeur in the thoughts and in some instances the pathetic or strong exertions of passion the other three tropes figures and musical arrangement have no more relation to the sublime than to other kinds of good writing perhaps less to the sublime than to any other species whatever because it requires less the assistance of ornament from this it appears that clear and precise ideas on this head are not to be expected from that writer i would not however be understood as if i meant by this censure to represent his treatise as of small value i know no critic ancient or modern that discovers a more lively relish of the beauties of fine writing than longinus and he has also the merit of being himself an excellent and in several passages a truly sublime writer but as his work has been generally considered as a standard on this subject it was incumbent on me to give my opinion concerning the benefit to be derived from it it deserves to be consulted not so much for distinct instruction concerning the sublime as for excellent general ideas concerning beauty in writing  i return now to the proper and natural idea of the sublime in composition the foundation of it must always be laid in the nature of the object described unless it be such an object as if presented to our eyes if exhibited to us in reality would raise ideas of that elevating that awful and magnificent kind which we call sublime the description however finely drawn is not entitled to come under this class this excludes all objects that are merely beautiful gay or elegant in the next place the object must not only in itself be sublime but it must be set before us in such a light as is most proper to give us a clear and full impression of it it must be described with strength with conciseness and simplicity this depends principally upon the lively impression which the poet or orator has of the object which he exhibits and upon his being deeply affected and warmed by the sublime idea which he would convey if his own feeling be languid he can never inspire us with any strong emotion instances which are extremely necessary on this subject will clearly show the importance of all those requisites which i have just now mentioned  it is generally speaking among the most ancient authors that we are to look for the most striking instances of the sublime i am inclined to think that the early ages of the world and the rude unimproved state of society are peculiarly favorable to the strong emotions of sublimity the genius of men is then much turned to admiration and astonishment meeting with many objects to them new and strange their imagination is kept glowing and their passions are often raised to the utmost they think and express themselves boldly and without restraint in the progress of society the genius and manners of men undergo a change more favorable to accuracy than to strength or sublimity  of all writings ancient or modern the sacred scriptures afford us the highest instances of the sublime the descriptions of the deity in them are wonderfully noble both from the grandeur of the object and the manner of representing it what an assemblage for instance of awful and sublime ideas is presented to us in that passage of the xviiith psalm where an appearance of the almighty is described in my distress i called upon the lord he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills were moved because he was wroth he bowed the heavens and came down and darkness was under his feet and he did ride upon a cherub and did fly yea he did fly upon the wings of the wind he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the sky here agreeably to the principles established in the last lecture we see with what propriety and success the circumstances of darkness and terror are applied for heightening the sublime so also the prophet habakkuk in a similar passage he stood and measured the earth he beheld and drove asunder the nations the everlasting mountains were scattered the perpetual hills did bow his ways are everlasting the mountains saw thee and they trembled the overflowing of the water passed by the deep uttered his voice and lifted up his hands on high  the noted instance given by longinus from moses god said let there be light and there was light is not liable to the censure which i passed on some of his instances of being foreign to the subject it belongs to the true sublime and the sublimity of it arises from the strong conception it gives of an exertion of power producing its effect with the utmost speed and facility a thought of the same kind is magnificently amplified in the following passage of isaiah chap xxiv          thus says the lord thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord that makes all things that stretches forth the heavens alone that spreads abroad the earth by myself  that says to the deep be dry and i will dry up thy rivers that says of cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou shall be built and to the temple thy foundation shall be laid there is a passage in the psalms which deserves to be mentioned under this head god says the psalmist stilleth the noise of the seas the noise of their waves and the tumults of the people the joining together two such grand objects as the ragings of the waters and the tumults of the people between which there is so much resemblance as to form a very natural association in the fancy and the representing them both as subject at one moment to the command of god produces a noble effect  homer is a poet who in all ages and by all critics has been greatly admired for sublimity and he owes much of his grandeur to that native and unaffected simplicity which characterises his manner his descriptions of hosts engaging the animation the fire and rapidity which he throws into his battles present to every reader of the iliad frequent instances of sublime writing his introduction of the gods tends often to heighten in a high degree the majesty of his warlike scenes hence longinus bestows such high and just commendations on that passage in the xvth book of the iliad where neptune when preparing to issue forth into the engagement is described as shaking the mountains with his steps and driving his chariot along the ocean minerva arming herself for fight in the vth book and apollo in the xvth leading on the trojans and flashing terror with his aegis on the face of the greeks are similar instances of great sublimity added to the description of battles by the appearances of those celestial beings in the xxth book where all the gods take part in the engagement according as they severally favor either the grecians or the trojans the poet seems to put forth one of his highest efforts and the description rises into the most awful magnificence all nature is represented as in commotion jupiter thunders in the heavens neptune strikes the earth with his trident the ships the city and the mountains shake the earth trembles to its center pluto starts from his throne in dread lest the secrets of the infernal region should be laid open to the view of mortals the passage is worthy of being inserted                 but when the powers descending swelled the fight then tumult rose fierce rage and pale affright now through the trembling shores minerva calls and now she thunders from the grecian walls mars hovering over his troy his terror shrouds in gloomy tempests and a night of clouds now through each trojan heart he fury pours with voice divine from ilions topmost towers  above the sire of gods his thunder rolls and peals on peals redoubled rend the poles beneath stern neptune shakes the solid ground the forests wave the mountains nod around through all her summits tremble idas woods and from their sources boil her hundred floods troys turrets totter on the rocking plain and the tossed navies beat the heaving main deep in the dismal region of the dead the infernal monarch reared his horrid head leapt from his throne lest neptunes arm should lay his dark dominions open to the day and pour in light on plutos drear abodes abhorred by men and dreadful even to gods such wars the immortals wage such horrors rend the worlds vast concave when the gods contend pope  iliad  0    etc  the works of ossian as i have elsewhere shown abound with examples of the sublime the subjects of that author and the manner in which he writes are particularly favorable to it he possesses all the plain and venerable manner of the ancient times he deals in no superfluous or gaudy ornaments but throws forth his images with a rapid conciseness which enable them to strike the mind with the greatest force among poets of more polished times we are to look for the graces of correct writing for just proportion of parts and skilfully conducted narration in the midst of smiling scenery and pleasurable themes the gay and the beautiful will appear undoubtedly to more advantage but amidst the rude scenes of nature and of society such as ossian describes amidst rocks and torrents and whirlwinds and battles dwells the sublime and naturally associates itself with that grave and solemn spirit which distinguishes the author of fingal as autumns dark storms pour from two echoing hills so toward each other approached the heroes as two dark streams from high rocks meet and mix and roar on the plain loud rough and dark in battle met lochlin and inisfail chief mixed his strokes with chief and man with man steel clanging sounded on steel helmets are cleft on high blood bursts and smokes around as the troubled noise of the ocean when roll the waves on high as the last peal of the thunder of heaven such is the noise of battle the groan of the people spread over the hills it was like the thunder of night when the cloud bursts on cona and a thousand ghosts shriek at once on the hollow wind never were images of more awful sublimity employed to heighten the terror of battle  i have produced these instances in order to demonstrate how essential conciseness and simplicity are to sublime writing simplicity i place in opposition to studied and profuse ornament and conciseness to superfluous expression the reason why a defect either in conciseness or simplicity is hurtful in a peculiar manner to the sublime i shall endeavor to explain the emotion occasioned in the mind by some great or noble object raises it considerably above its ordinary pitch a sort of enthusiasm is produced extremely agreeable while it lasts but from which the mind is tending every moment to fall down into its ordinary situation now when an author has brought us or is attempting to bring us into this state if he multiplies words unnecessarily if he decks the sublime object which he presents to us round and round with glittering ornaments nay if he throws in any one decoration that sinks in the least below the capital image that moment he alters the key he relaxes the tension of the mind the strength of the feeling is emasculated the beautiful may remain but the sublime is gone  when julius caesar said to the pilot who was afraid to put to sea with him in a storm quid times caesarem vehis we are struck with the daring magnanimity of one relying with such confidence on his cause and his fortune these few words convey every thing necessary to give us the impression full lucan resolved to amplify and adorn the thought observe how every time he twists it round it departs farther from the sublime till it end at last in tumid declamation sperne minas inquit pelagi ventoque furenti trade sinum italiam si coelo auctore recusas me pete sola tibi causa haec est justa timoris victorem non nosse tuum quem numina nunquam destituunt de quo male tunc fortuna meretur cum post vota venit medias perrumpe procellas tutela secure mea coeli isti fretique non puppis nostrae labor est hanc caesare pressam a fluctu defendet onus nam proderit undis iste ratis  quid tanta strage paratur ignoras quaerit pelagi coelique tumultu quid praestet fortuna mihi but caesar still superior to distress fearless and confident of sure success thus to the pilot loud  the seas despise and the vain threatening of the noisy skies though gods deny thee yon ausonian strand yet go i charge you go at my command thy ignorance alone can cause thy fears thou know not what a freight thy vessel bears thou know not i am he to whom it is given never to want the care of watchful heaven obedient fortune waits my humble thrall and always ready comes before i call let winds and seas loud wars at freedom wage and waste upon themselves their empty rage a stronger mightier demon is thy friend thou and thy bark on caesars fate depend thou standst amazed to view this dreadful scene and wonderst what the gods and fortune mean but artfully their bounties thus they raise and from my danger arrogate new praise amidst the fears of death they bid me live and still enhance what they are sure to give row   phars v      on account of the great importance of simplicity and conciseness i conceive rhyme in english verse to be if not inconsistent with the sublime at least very unfavourable to it the constrained elegance of this kind of verse and studied smoothness of the sounds answering regularly to each other at the end of the line though they be quite consistent with gentle emotions yet weaken the native force of sublimity besides that the superfluous words which the poet is often obliged to introduce in order to fill up the rhyme tend farther to enfeeble it homers description of the nod of jupiter as shaking the heavens has been admired in all ages as highly sublime literally translated it runs thus he spoke and bending his sable brows gave the awful nod while he shook the celestial locks of his immortal head all olympus was shaken mr pope translates it thus he spoke and awful bends his sable brows shakes his ambrosial curls and gives the nod the stamp of fate and sanction of a god high heaven with trembling the dread signal took and all olympus to its center shook   the image is spread out and attempted to be beautified but it is in truth weakened the third line  the stamp of fate and sanction of a god is merely expletive and introduced for no other reason but to fill up the rhyme for it interrupts the description and clogs the image for the same reason out of mere compliance with the rhyme jupiter is represented as shaking his locks before he gives the nod  shakes his ambrosial curls and gives the nod which is trifling and without meaning whereas in the original the hair of his head shaken is the effect of his nod and makes a happy picturesque circumstance in the description see webb on the beauties of poetry   the boldness freedom and variety of our blank verse is infinitely more favorable than rhyme to all kinds of sublime poetry the fullest proof of this is afforded by milton an author whose genius led him eminently to the sublime the whole first and second books of paradise lost are continued instances of it take only for an example the following noted description of satan after his fall appearing at the head of the infernal hosts  he above the rest in shape and gesture proudly eminent stood like a tower his form had not yet lost all her original brightness nor appeared less than archangel ruined and the excess of glory obscured as when the sun new risen looks through the horizontal misty air shorn of his beams or from behind the moon in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds on half the nations and with fear of change perplexes monarchs darkened so yet shone above them all the archangel  here concur a variety of sources of the sublime the principal object eminently great a high superior nature fallen indeed but erecting itself against distress the grandeur of the principal object heightened by associating it with so noble an idea as that of the sun suffering an eclipse this picture shaded with all those images of change and trouble of darkness and terror which coincide so finely with the sublime emotion and the whole expressed in a style and versification easy natural and simple but magnificent  i have spoken of simplicity and conciseness as essential to sublime writing in my general description of it i mentioned strength as another necessary requisite the strength of description arises in a great measure from a simple conciseness but it supposes also something more namely a proper choice of circumstances in the description so as to exhibit the object in its full and most striking point of view for every object has several faces so to speak by which it may be presented to us according to the circumstances with which we surround it and it will appear eminently sublime or not in proportion as all these circumstances are happily chosen and of a sublime kind here lies the great art of the writer and indeed the great difficulty of sublime description if the description be too general and divested of circumstances the object appears in a faint light it makes a feeble impression or no impression at all on the reader at the same time if any trivial or improper circumstances are mingled the whole is degraded  a storm or tempest for instance is a sublime object in nature but to render it sublime in description it is not enough either to give us mere general expressions concerning the violence of the tempest or to describe its common vulgar effects in overthrowing trees and houses it must be painted with such circumstances as fill the mind with great and awful ideas this is very happily done by virgil in the following passage ipse pater media nimborum in nocte corusca fulmina molitur dextra quo maxima motu terra tremit fugere ferae and mortalia corda per gentes humilis stravit pavor ille flagranti aut atho aut rhodopen aut alta ceraunia telo dejicit the father of the gods his glory shrouds involved in tempests and a night of clouds and from the middle darkness flashing out by fits he deals his fiery bolts about earth feels the motions of her angry god her intrails tremble and her mountains nod and flying beasts in forests seek abode deep horror seizes every human breast their pride is humbled and their fears confessed while he from high his rolling thunders throws and fires the mountains with repeated blows the rocks are from their old foundations rent the winds redouble and the rain augment dryden   georg i  every circumstance in this noble description is the production of an imagination heated and astonished with the grandeur of the object if there be any defect it is in the words immediately following those i have quoted ingeminant austri et densissimus imber where the transition is made too hastily i am afraid from the preceding sublime images to a thick shower and the blowing of the south wind and shows how difficult it frequently is to descend with grace without seeming to fall  the high importance of the rule which i have been now giving concerning the proper choice of circumstances when description is meant to be sublime seems to me not to have been sufficiently attended to it has however such a foundation in nature as renders the least deflexion from it fatal when a writer is aiming at the beautiful only his descriptions may have improprieties in them and yet be beautiful still some trivial or misjudged circumstances can be overlooked by the reader they make only the difference of more or less the gay or pleasing emotion which he has raised subsists still but the case is quite different with the sublime there one trifling circumstance one mean idea is sufficient to destroy the whole charm this is owing to the nature of the emotion aimed at by sublime description which admits of no mediocrity and cannot subsist in a middle state but must either highly transport us or if unsuccessful in the execution leave us greatly disgusted and displeased we attempt to rise along with the writer the imagination is awakened and put upon the stretch but it requires to be supported and if in the midst of its effort you desert it unexpectedly down it comes with a painful shock when milton in his battle of the angels describes them as tearing up the mountains and throwing them at one another there are in his description as mr addison has observed no circumstances but what are properly sublime from their foundations loosning to and fro they plucked the seated hills with all their load rocks waters woods and by the shaggy tops uplifting bore them in their hands  whereas claudian in a fragment upon the war of the giants has contrived to render this idea of their throwing the mountains which is in itself so grand burlesque and ridiculous by this single circumstance of one of his giants with the mountain ida upon his shoulders and a river which flowed from the mountain running down along the giants back as he held it up in that posture there is a description too in virgil which i think is censurable though more slightly in this respect it is that of the burning mountain aetna a subject certainly very proper to be worked up by a poet into a sublime description  horrificis juxta tonat aetna ruinis interdumque atram prorumpit ad aethera nubem turbine fumantem piceo and candente favilla attollitque globos flammarum and sidera lambit interdum scopulos avulsaque viscera montis erigit eructans liquefactaque saxa sub auras cum gemitu glomerat fundoque exaestuat imo the port capacious and seeure from wind is to the foot of thundering aetna joined by turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high by turns hot embers from her entrails fly and flakes of mounting flames that lick the sky often from her bowels massy rocks are thrown and shivered by the force come piecemeal down often liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow fed from the fiery springs that boil below dryden in this translation of drydens the debasing circumstance to which i object in the original is with propriety omitted  aen iii     here after several magnificent images the poet concludes with personifying the mountain under this figure eructans viscera cum gemitu belching up its bowels with a groan which by likening the mountain to a sick or drunk person degrades the majesty of the description it is to no purpose to tell us that the poet here alludes to the fable of the giant enceladus lying under mount aetna and that he supposes his motions and tossings to have occasioned the fiery eruptions he intended the description of a sublime object and the natural ideas raised by a burning mountain are infinitely more lofty than the belchings of any giant how huge soever the debasing effect of the idea which is here presented will appear in a stronger light by seeing what figure it makes in a poem of sir richard blackmores who through a monstrous perversity of taste had chosen this for the capital circumstance in his description and thereby as dr arbuthnot humourously observes in his treatise on the art of sinking had represented the mountain as in a fit of the cholic aetna and all the burning mountains find their kindled stores with inbred storms of wind blown up to rage and roaring out complain as torn with inward gripes and torturing pain laboring they cast their dreadful vomit round and with their melted bowels spread the ground such instances show how much the sublime depends upon a just selection of circumstances and with how great care every circumstance must be avoided which by bordering in the least upon the mean or even upon the gay or the trifling alters the tone of the emotion  if it shall now be enquired what are the proper sources of the sublime my answer is that they are to be looked for every where in nature it is not by hunting after tropes and figures and rhetorical assistances that we can expect to produce it no it stands clear for the most part of these labored refinements of art it must come unsought if it come at all and be the natural offspring of a strong imagination est deus in nobis agitante calescimus illo wherever a great and awful object is presented in nature or a very magnanimous and exalted affection of the human mind is displayed thence if you can catch the impression strongly and exhibit it warm and glowing you may draw the sublime these are its only proper sources in judging of any striking beauty in composition whether it is or is not to be referred to this class we must attend to the nature of the emotion which it raises and only if it be of that elevating solemn and awful kind which distinguishes this feeling we can pronounce it sublime  from the account which i have given of the nature of the sublime it clearly follows that it is an emotion which can never be long protracted the mind by no force of genius can be kept for any considerable time so far raised above its common tone but will of course relax into its ordinary situation neither are the abilities of any human writer sufficient to supply a continued run of unmixed sublime conceptions the utmost we can expect is that this fire of imagination should sometimes flash upon us like lightning from heaven and then disappear in homer and milton this effulgence of genius breaks forth more frequently and with greater luster than in most authors shakespeare also rises often into the true sublime but no author whatever is sublime throughout some indeed there are who by a strength and dignity in their conceptions and a current of high ideas that runs through their whole composition preserve the readers mind always in a tone nearly allied to the sublime for which reason they may in a limited sense merit the name of continued sublime writers and in this class we may justly place demosthenes and plato  as for what is called the sublime style it is for the most part a very bad one and has no relation whatever to the real sublime persons are apt to imagine that magnificent words accumulated epithets and a certain swelling kind of expression by rising above what is usual or vulgar contributes to or even forms the sublime nothing can be more false in all the instances of sublime writing which i have given nothing of this kind appears god said let there be light and there was light this is striking and sublime but put it into what is commonly called the sublime style the sovereign arbiter of nature by the potent energy of a single word commanded the light to exist and as boileau has well observed the style indeed is raised but the thought is fallen in general in all good writing the sublime lies in the thought not in the words and when the thought is truly noble it will for the most part clothe itself in a native dignity of language the sublime indeed rejects mean low or trivial expressions but it is equally an enemy to such as are turgid the main secret of being sublime is to say great things in few and plain words it will be found to hold without exception that the most sublime authors are the simplest in their style and wherever you find a writer who affects a more than ordinary pomp and parade of words and is always endeavoring to magnify his subject by epithets there you may immediately suspect that feeble in sentiment he is studying to support himself by mere expression  the same unfavourable judgment we must pass on all that labored apparatus with which some writers introduce a passage or description which they intend shall be sublime calling on their readers to attend invoking their muse or breaking forth into general unmeaning exclamations concerning the greatness terribleness or majesty of the object which they are to describe mr addison in his campaign has fallen into an error of this kind when about to describe the battle of blenheim but o my muse what numbers will thou find to sing the furious troops in battle joined methinks i hear the drums tumultuous sound the victors shouts and dying groans confound etc introductions of this kind are a forced attempt in a writer to spur up himself and his reader when he finds his imagination flagging in vigor it is like taking artificial spirits in order to supply the want of such as are natural by this observation however i do not mean to pass a general censure on mr addisons campaign which in several places is far from wanting merit and in particular the noted comparison of his hero to the angel who rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm is a truly sublime image  the faults opposite to the sublime are chiefly two the frigid and the bombast the frigid consists in degrading an object or sentiment which is sublime in itself by our mean conception of it or by our weak low and childish description of it this betrays entire absence or at least great poverty of genius of this there are abundance of examples and these commented upon with much humor in the treatise on the art of sinking in dean swifts works the instances taken chiefly from sir richard blackmore one of these i had occasion already to give in relation to mount aetna and it were needless to produce any more the bombast lies in forcing an ordinary or trivial object out of its rank and endeavoring to raise it into the sublime or in attempting to exalt a sublime object beyond all natural and reasonable bounds into this error which is but too common writers of genius may sometimes fall by unluckily losing sight of the true point of the sublime this is also called fustian or rant shakespeare a great but incorrect genius is not unexceptionable here dryden and lee in their tragedies abound with it  thus far of the sublime of which i have treated fully because it is so capital an excellency in fine writing and because clear and precise ideas on this head are as far as i know not to be met with in critical writers  before concluding this lecture there is one observation which i choose to make at this time i shall make it once for all and hope it will be afterward remembered it is with respect to the instances of faults or rather blemishes and imperfections which as i have done in this lecture i shall hereafter continue to take when i can from writers of reputation i have not the least intention thereby to disparage their character in the general i shall have other occasions of doing equal justice to their beauties but it is no reflection on any human performance that it is not absolutely perfect the task would be much easier for me to collect instances of faults from bad writers but they would draw no attention when quoted from books which nobody reads and i conceive that the method which i follow will contribute more to make the best authors be read with pleasure when one properly distinguishes their beauties from their faults and is led to imitate and admire only what is worthy of imitation and admiration  lecture v beauty and other pleasures of taste as sublimity constitutes a particular character of composition and forms one of the highest excellencies of eloquence and of poetry it was proper to treat of it at some length it will not be necessary to discuss so particularly all the other pleasures that arise from taste as some of them have less relation to our main subject on beauty only i shall make several observations both as the subject is curious and as it tends to improve taste and to discover the foundation of several of the graces of description and of poetry see hutchinsons enquiry concerning beauty and virtue  gerard on taste chap iii  enquiry into the origin of the ideas of the sublime and beautiful  elements of criticism chap iii  spectator vol vi essay on the pleasures of taste   beauty next to sublimity affords beyond doubt the highest pleasure to the imagination the emotion which it raises is very distinguishable from that of sublimity it is of a calmer kind more gentle and soothing does not elevate the mind so much but produces an agreeable serenity sublimity raises a feeling too violent as i showed to be lasting the pleasure arising from beauty admits of longer continuance it extends also to a much greater variety of objects than sublimity to a variety indeed so great that the feelings which beautiful objects produce differ considerably not in degree only but also in kind from one another hence no word in the language is used in a more vague signification than beauty it is applied to almost every external object that pleases the eye or the ear to a great number of the graces of writing to many dispositions of the mind nay to several objects of mere abstract science we talk currently of a beautiful tree or flower a beautiful poem a beautiful character and a beautiful theorem in mathematics  hence we may easily perceive that among so great a variety of objects to find out some one quality in which they all agree and which is the foundation of that agreeable sensation they all raise must be a very difficult if not more probably a vain attempt objects denominated beautiful are so different as to please not in virtue of any one quality common to them all but by means of several different principles in human nature the agreeable emotion which they all raise is somewhat of the same nature and therefore has the common name of beauty given to it but it is raised by different causes  hypotheses however have been framed by ingenious men for assigning the fundamental quality of beauty in all objects in particular uniformity amidst variety has been insisted on as this fundamental quality for the beauty of many figures i admit that this accounts in a satisfying manner but when we endeavor to apply this principle to beautiful objects of some other kind as to color for instance or motion we shall soon find that it has no place and even in external figured objects it does not hold that their beauty is in proportion to their mixture of variety with uniformity seeing many please us as highly beautiful which have almost no variety at all and others which are various to a degree of intricacy laying systems of this kind therefore aside what i now propose is to give an enumeration of several of those classes of objects in which beauty most remarkably appears and to point out as far as i can the separate principles of beauty in each of them  color affords perhaps the simplest instance of beauty and therefore the fittest to begin with here neither variety nor uniformity nor any other principle that i know can be assigned as the foundation of beauty we can refer it to no other cause but the structure of the eye which determines us to receive certain modifications of the rays of light with more pleasure than others and we see accordingly that as the organ of sensation varies in different persons they have their different favorite colors it is probable that association of ideas has influence in some cases on the pleasure which we receive from colors green for instance may appear more beautiful by being connected in our ideas with rural prospects and scenes white with innocence blue with the serenity of the sky independent of associations of this kind all that we can farther observe concerning colors is that those chosen for beauty are generally delicate rather than glaring such are those paintings with which nature has ornamented some of her works and which art strives in vain to imitate as the feathers of several kinds of birds the leaves of flowers and the fine variation of colors exhibited by the sky at the rising and setting of the sun these present to us the highest instances of the beauty of coloring and have accordingly been the favorite subjects of poetical description in all countries  from color we proceed to figure which opens to us forms of beauty more complex and diversified regularity first occurs to be noticed as a source of beauty by a regular figure is meant one which we perceive to be formed according to some certain rule and not left arbitrary or loose in the construction of its parts thus a circle a square a triangle or a hexagon please the eye by their regularity as beautiful figures we must not however conclude that all figures please in proportion to their regularity or that regularity is the sole or the chief foundation of beauty in figure on the contrary a certain graceful variety is found to be a much more powerful principle of beauty and is therefore studied a great deal more than regularity in all works that are designed merely to please the eye i am indeed inclined to think that regularity appears beautiful to us chiefly if not only on account of its suggesting the ideas of fitness propriety and use which have always a greater connection with orderly and proportioned forms than with those which appear not constructed according to any certain rule it is clear that nature who is undoubtedly the most graceful artist has in all her ornamental works pursued variety with an apparent neglect of regularity cabinets doors and windows are made after a regular form in cubes and parallelograms with exact proportion of parts and by being so formed they please the eye for this good reason that being works of use they are by such figures the better suited to the ends for which they were designed but plants flowers and leaves are full of variety and diversity a straight canal is an insipid figure in comparison of the maeanders of rivers cones and pyramids are beautiful but trees growing in their natural wildness are infinitely more beautiful than when trimmed into pyramids and cones the apartments of a house must be regular in their disposition for the convenience of its inhabitants but a garden which is designed merely for beauty would be exceedingly disgusting if it had as much uniformity and order in its parts as a dwellinghouse  mr hogarth in his analysis of beauty has observed that figures bounded by curve lines are in general more beautiful than those bounded by straight lines and angles he pitches upon two lines on which according to him the beauty of figure principally depends and he has illustrated and supported his doctrine by a surprising number of instances the one is the waving line or a curve bending backwards and forwards somewhat in the form of the letter s this he calls the line of beauty and shows how often it is found in shells flowers and such other ornamental works of nature as is common also in the figures designed by painters and sculptors for the purpose of decoration the other line which he calls the line of grace is the former waving curve twisted round some solid body the curling worm of a common jack is one of the instances he gives of it twisted pillars and twisted horns also exhibit it in all the instances which he mentions variety plainly appears to be so material a principle of beauty that he seems not to err much when he defines the art of drawing pleasing forms to be the art of varying well for the curve line so much the favorite of painters derives according to him its chief advantage from its perpetual bending and variation from the stiff regularity of the straight line  motion furnishes another source of beauty distinct from figure motion of itself is pleasing and bodies in motion are caeteris paribus preferred to those in rest it is however only gentle motion that belongs to the beautiful for when it is very swift or very forcible such as that of a torrent it partakes of the sublime the motion of a bird gliding through the air is extremely beautiful the swiftness with which lightning darts through the heavens is magnificent and astonishing and here it is proper to observe that the sensations of sublime and beautiful are not always distinguished by very distant boundaries but are capable in several instances of approaching toward each other thus a smooth running stream is one of the most beautiful objects in nature as it swells gradually into a great river the beautiful by degrees is lost in the sublime a young tree is a beautiful object a spreading ancient oak is a venerable and a grand one the calmness of a fine morning is beautiful the universal stillness of the evening is highly sublime but to return to the beauty of motion it will be found i think to hold very generally that motion in a straight line is not so beautiful as in an undulating waving direction and motion upwards is commonly too more agreeable than motion downwards the easy curling motion of flame and smoke to be instanced as an object singularly agreeable and here mr hogarths waving line recurs upon us as a principle of beauty that artist observes very ingeniously that all the common and necessary motions for the business of life are performed by men in straight or plain lines but that all the graceful and ornamental movements are made in waving lines an observation not unworthy of being attended to by all who study the grace of gesture and action  though color figure and motion be separate principles of beauty yet in many beautiful objects they all meet and thereby render the beauty both greater and more complex thus in flowers trees animals we are entertained at once with the delicacy of the color with the gracefulness of the figure and sometimes also with the motion of the object although each of these produce a separate agreeable sensation yet they are of such a similar nature as readily to mix and blend in one general perception of beauty which we ascribe to the whole object as its cause for beauty is always conceived by us as something residing in the object which raises the pleasant sensation a sort of glory which dwells upon and invests it perhaps the most complete assemblage of beautiful objects that can any where be found is presented by a rich natural landscape where there is a sufficient variety of objects fields in verdure scattered trees and flowers running water and animals grazing if to these be joined some of the productions of art which suit such a scene as a bridge with arches over a river smoke rising from cottages in the midst of trees and the distant view of a fine building seen by the rising sun we then enjoy in the highest perfection that gay cheerful and placid sensation which characterises beauty to have an eye and a taste formed for catching the peculiar beauties of such scenes as these is a necessary requisite for all who attempt poetical description  the beauty of the human countenance is more complex than any that we have yet considered it includes the beauty of color arising from the delicate shades of the complexion and the beauty of figure arising from the lines which form the different features of the face but the chief beauty of the countenance depends upon a mysterious expression which it conveys of the qualities of the mind of good sense or good humor of sprightliness candor benevolence sensibility or other amiable dispositions how it comes to pass that a certain conformation of features is connected in our idea with certain moral qualities whether we are taught by instinct or by experience to form this connection and to read the mind in the countenance belongs not to us now to enquire nor is indeed easy to resolve the fact is certain and acknowledged that what gives the human countenance its most distinguishing beauty is what is called its expression or an image which it is conceived to show of internal moral dispositions  this leads to observe that there are certain qualities of the mind which whether expressed in the countenance or by words or by actions always raise in us a feeling similar to that of beauty there are two great classes of moral qualities one is of the high and the great virtues which require extraordinary efforts and turn upon dangers and sufferings as heroism magnanimity contempt of pleasures and contempt of death these as i have observed in a former lecture excite in the spectator an emotion of sublimity and grandeur the other class is generally of the social virtues and such as are of a softer and gentler kind as compassion mildness friendship and generosity these raise in the beholder a sensation of pleasure so much akin to that produced by beautiful external objects that though of a more dignified nature it may without impropriety be classed under the same head  a species of beauty distinct from any i have yet mentioned arises from design or art or in other words from the perception of means being adapted to an end or the parts of any thing being well fitted to answer the design of the whole when in considering the structure of a tree or a plant we observe how all the parts the roots the stem the bark and the leaves are suited to the growth and nutriment of the whole much more when we survey all the parts and members of a living animal or when we examine any of the curious works of art such as a clock a ship or any nice machine the pleasure which we have in the survey is wholly founded on this sense of beauty it is altogether different from the perception of beauty produced by color figure variety or any of the causes formerly mentioned when i look at a watch for instance the case of it if finely engraved and of curious workmanship strikes me as beautiful in the former sense bright color exquisite polish figures finely raised and turned but when i examine the construction of the spring and the wheels and praise the beauty of the internal machinery my pleasure then arises wholly from the view of that admirable art with which so many various and complicated parts are made to unite for one purpose  this sense of beauty in fitness and design has an extensive influence over many of our ideas it is the foundation of the beauty which we discover in the proportion of doors windows arches pillars and all the orders of architecture let the ornaments of a building be ever so fine and elegant in themselves yet if they interfere with this sense of fitness and design they lose their beauty and hurt the eye like disagreeable objects twisted columns for instance are undoubtedly ornamental but as they have an appearance of weakness they always displease when they are made use of to support any part of a building that is massy and that seemed to require a more substantial prop we cannot look upon any work whatever without being led by a natural association of ideas to think of its end and design and of course to examine the propriety of its parts in relation to this design and end when their propriety is clearly discerned the work seems always to have some beauty but when there is a total want of propriety it never fails of appearing deformed our sense of fitness and design therefore is so powerful and holds so high a rank among our perceptions as to regulate in a great measure our other ideas of beauty an observation which i the rather make as it is of the utmost importance that all who study composition should carefully attend to it for in an epic poem a history an oration or any work of genius we always require as we do in other works a fitness or adjustment of means to the end which the author is supposed to have in view let his description be ever so rich or his figures ever so elegant yet if they are out of place if they are not proper parts of that whole if they suit not the main design they lose all their beauty nay from beauties they are converted ino deformities such power has our sense of fitness and congruity to produce a total transformation of an object whose appearance otherwise would have been beautiful  after having mentioned so many various species of beauty it now only remains to take notice of beauty as it is applied to writing or discourse a term commonly used in a sense altogether loose and undetermined for it is applied to all that pleases either in style or in sentiment from whatever principle that pleasure flows and a beautiful poem or oration means in common language no other than a good one or one well composed in this sense it is plain the word is altogether indefinite and points at no particular species or kind of beauty there is however another sense somewhat more definite in which beauty of writing characterises a particular manner when it is used to signify a certain grace and amaenity in the turn either of style or sentiment for which some authors have been peculiarly distinguished in this sense it denotes a manner neither remarkably sublime nor vehemently passionate nor uncommonly sparkling but such as raises in the reader an emotion of the gentle placid kind similar to what is raised by the contemplation of beautiful objects in nature which neither lifts the mind very high nor agitates it very much but diffuses over the imagination an agreeable and pleasing serenity mr addison is a writer altogether of this character and is one of the most proper and precise examples that can be given of it fenelon the author of the adventures of telemachus may be given as another example virgil too though very capable of rising on occasions into the sublime yet in his general manner is distinguished by the character of beauty and grace rather than of sublimity among orators cicero has more of the beautiful than demosthenes whose genius led him wholly toward vehemence and strength  this much it is sufficient to have said upon the subject of beauty we have traced it through a variety of forms as next to sublimity it is the most copious source of the pleasures of taste and as the consideration of the different appearances and principles of beauty tends to the improvement of taste in many subjects  but it is not only by appearing under the forms of sublime or beautiful that objects delight the imagination from several other principles also they derive their power of giving it pleasure  novelty for instance has been mentioned by mr addison and by every writer on this subject an object which has no merit to recommend it except its being uncommon or new by means of this quality alone produces in the mind a vivid and an agreeable emotion hence that passion of curiosity which prevails so generally among mankind objects and ideas which have been long familiar make too faint an impression to give an agreeable exercise to our faculties new and strange objects rouse the mind from its dormant state by giving it a quick and pleasing impulse hence in a great measure the entertainment afforded us by fiction and romance the emotion raised by novelty is of a more lively and pungent nature than that produced by beauty but much shorter in its continuance for if the object have in itself no charms to hold our attention the shining gloss thrown upon it by novelty soon wears off  besides novelty imitation is another source of pleasure to taste this gives rise to what mr addison terms the secondary pleasures of imagination which form doubtless a very extensive class for all imitation affords some pleasure not only the imitation of beautiful or great objects by recalling the original ideas of beauty or grandeur which such objects themselves exhibited but even objects which have neither beauty nor grandeur nay some which are terrible or deformed please us in a secondary or represented view  the pleasures of melody and harmony belong also to taste there is no agreeable sensation we receive either from beauty or snblimity but what is capable of being heightened by the power of musical sound whence the delight of poetical numbers and even of the more concealed and looser measures of prose wit humor and ridicule likewise open a variety of pleasures to taste quite distinct from any that we have yet considered  at present it is not necessary to pursue any farther the subject of the pleasures of taste i have opened some of the general principles it is time now to make the application to our chief subject if the question be put to what class of those pleasures of taste which i have enumerated that pleasure is to be referred which we receive from poetry eloquence or fine writing my answer is not to any one but to them all this singular advantage writing and discourse possess that they encompass so large and rich a field on all sides and have power to exhibit in great perfection not a single set of objects only but almost the whole of those which give pleasure to taste and imagination whether that pleasure arise from sublimity from beauty in its different forms from design and art from moral sentiment from novelty from harmony from wit humor and ridicule to whichsoever of these the peculiar bent of a persons taste lies from some writer or other he has it always in his power to receive the gratification of it  now this high power which eloquence and poetry possess of supplying taste and imagination with such a wide circle of pleasures they derive altogether from their having a greater capacity of imitation and description than is possessed by any other art of all the means which human ingenuity has contrived for recalling the images of real objects and awakening by representation similar emotions to those which are raised by the original none is so full and extensive as that which is executed by words and writing through the assistance of this happy invention there is nothing either in the natural or moral world but what can be represented and set before the mind in colors very strong and lively hence it is usual among critical writers to speak of discourse as the chief of all the imitative or mimetic arts they compare it with painting and with sculpture and in many respects prefer it justly before them  this style was first introduced by aristotle in his poetics and since his time has acquired a general currency among modern authors but as it is of consequence to introduce as much precision as possible into critical language i must observe that this manner of speaking is not accurate neither discourse in general nor poetry in particular can be called altogether imitative arts we must distinguish betwixt imitation and description which are ideas that should not be confounded imitation is performed by means of somewhat that has a natural likeness and resemblance to the thing imitated and of consequence is understood by all such are statues and pictures description again is the raising in the mind the conception of an object by means of some arbitrary or instituted symbols understood only by those who agree in the institution of them such are words and writing words have no natural resemblance to the ideas or objects which they are employed to signify but a statue or a picture has a natural likeness to the original and therefore imitation and description differ considerably in their nature from each other  as far indeed as a poet or a historian introduces into his work persons actually speaking and by the words which he puts into their mouths represents the discourse which they might be supposed to hold so far his art may more accurately be called imitative and this is the case in all dramatic composition but in narrative or descriptive works it can with no propriety be called so who for instance would call virgils description of a tempest in the first aeneid an imitation of a storm if we heard of the imitation of a battle we might naturally think of some mock fight or representation of a battle on the stage but would never apprehend that it meant one of homers descriptions in the iliad i admit at the same time that imitation and description agree in their principal effect of recalling by external signs the ideas of things which we do not see but though in this they coincide yet it should not be forgotten that the terms themselves are not synonymous that they import different means of effecting the same end and of course make different impressions on the mind though in the execution of particular parts poetry is certainly descriprive rather than imitative yet there is a qualified sense in which poetry in the general may be termed an imitative art the subject of the poet as dr gerard has shown in the appendix to his essay on taste is intended to be an imitation not of things really existing but of the course of nature that is a feigned representation of such events or such scenes as though they never had a being yet might have existed and which therefore by their probability bear a resemblance to nature it was probably in this sense that aristotle termed poetry a mimetic art how far either the imitation or the description which poetry employs is superior to the imitative powers of painting and music is well shown by mr harris in his treatise on music painting and poetry the chief advantage which poetry or discourse in general enjoys is that whereas by the nature of his art the painter is confined to the representation or a single moment writing and discourse can trace a transaction through its whole progress that moment indeed which the painter pitches upon for the subject of his picture he may be said to exhibit with more advantage than the poet or the orator inasmuch as he sets before us in one view all the minute concurrent circumstances of the event which happen in one individual point of time as they appear in nature while discourse is obliged to exhibit them in succession and by means of a detail which is in danger of becoming tedious in order to be clear or if not tedious is in danger of being obscure but to that point of time which he has chosen the painter being entirely confined he cannot exhibit various stages of the same action or event and he is subject to this farther defect that he can only exhibit objects as they appear to the eye and can very imperfectly delineate characters and sentiments which are the noblest subjects of imitation or description the power of representing these with full advantage gives a high superiority to discourse and writing above all other imitative arts   whether we consider poetry in particular and discourse in general as imitative or descriptive it is evident that their whole power in recalling the impressions of real objects is derived from the significancy of words as their excellency flows altogether from this source we must in order to make way for further enquiries begin at this fountain head i shall therefore in the next lecture enter upon the consideration of language of the origin the progress and construction of which i purpose to treat at some length  lecture vi rise and progress of language having finished my observations on the pleasures of taste which were meant to be introductory to the principal subject of these lectures i now begin to treat of language which is the foundation of the whole power of eloquence this will lead to a considerable discussion and there are few subjects belonging to polite literature which more merit such a discussion i shall first give a history of the rise and progress of language in several particulars from its early to its more advanced periods which shall be followed by a similar history of the rise and progress of writing i shall next give some account of the construction of language or the principles of universal grammar and shall lastly apply these observations more particularly to the english tongue see dr adam smiths dissertation on the formation of languages  treatise of the origin and progress of language in   vols  harriss hermes or a

of our ideas by certain articulate sounds which are used as the signs of those ideas by articulate sounds are meant those modulations of simple voice or of sound emitted from the thorax which are formed by means of the mouth and its several organs the teeth the tongue the lips and the palate how far there is any natural connection between the ideas of the mind and the sounds emitted will appear from what i am afterward to offer but as the natural connection can upon any system affect only a small part of the fabric of language the connection between words and ideas may in general be considered as arbitrary and conventional owing to the agreement of men among themselves the clear proof of which is that different nations have different languages or a different set of articulate sounds which they have chosen for communicating their ideas  this artificial method of communicating thought we now behold carried to the highest perfection language is become a vehicle by which the most delicate and refined emotions of one mind can be transmitted or if we may so speak transfused into another not only are names given to all objects around us by which means an easy and speedy intercourse is carried on for providing the necessaries of life but all the relations and differences among these objects are minutely marked the invisible sentiments of the mind are described the most abstract notions and conceptions are rendered intelligible and all the ideas which science can discover or imagination create are known by their proper names nay language has been carried so far as to be made an instrument of the most refined luxury not resting in mere perspicuity we require ornament also not satisfied with having the conceptions of others made known to us we make a farther demand to have them so decked and adorned as to entertain our fancy and this demand it is found very possible to gratify in this state we now find language in this state it has been found among many nations for some thousand years the object is become familiar and like the expanse of the firmament and other great objects which we are accustomed to behold we behold it without wonder  but carry your thoughts back to the first dawn of language among men reflect upon the feeble beginnings from which it must have arisen and upon the many and great obstacles which it must have encountered in its progress and you will find reason for the highest astonishment on viewing the height which it has now attained we admire several of the inventions of art we plume ourselves on some discoveries which have been made in latter ages serving to advance knowledge and to render life comfortable we speak of them as the boast of human reason but certainly no invention is entitled to any such degree of admiration as that of language which too must have been the product of the first and rudest ages if indeed it can be considered as a human invention at all  think of the circumstances of mankind when languages began to be formed they were a wandering scattered race no society among them except families and the family society too very imperfect as their method of living by hunting or pasturage must have separated them frequently from one another in this situation when so much divided and their intercourse so rare how could any one set of sounds or words be generally agreed on as the signs of their ideas supposing that a few whom chance or necessity threw together agreed by some means upon certain signs yet by what authority could these be propagated among other tribes or families so as to spread and grow up into a language one would think that in order to any language fixing and extending itself men must have been previously gathered together in considerable numbers society must have been already far advanced and yet on the other hand there seems to have been an absolute necessity for speech previous to the formation of society for by what bond could any multitude of men be kept together or be made to join in the prosecution of any common interest until once by the intervention of speech they could communicate their wants and intentions to each other so that either how society could form itself previously to language or how words could rise into a language previously to society formed seem to be points attended with equal difficulty and when we consider farther that curious analogy which prevails in the construction of almost all languages and that deep and subtle logic on which they are founded difficulties increase so much upon us on all hands that there seems to be no small reason for referring the first origin of all language to divine teaching or inspiration  but supposing language to have a divine original we cannot however suppose that a perfect system of it was all at once given to man it is much more natural to think that god taught our first parents only such language as suited their present occasions leaving them as he did in other things to enlarge and improve it as their future necessities should require consequently those first rudiments of speech must have been poor and narrow and we are at full liberty to enquire in what manner and by what steps language advanced to the state in which we now find it the history which i am to give of this progress will suggest several things both curious in themselves and useful in our future disquisitions  if we should suppose a period before any words were invented or known it is clear that men could have no other method of communicating to others what they felt than by the cries of passion accompanied with such motions and gestures as were farther expressive of passion for these are the only signs which nature teaches all men and which are understood by all one who saw another going into some place where he himself had been frightened or exposed to danger and who sought to warn his neighbor of the danger could contrive no other way of doing so than by uttering those cries and making those gestures which are the signs of fear just as two men at this day would endeavor to make themselves be understood by each other who should be thrown together on a desolate island ignorant of one anothers language those exclamations therefore which by grammarians are called interjections uttered in a strong and passionate manner were beyond doubt the first elements or beginnings of speech  when more enlarged communication became necessary and names began to be assigned to objects in what manner can we suppose men to have proceeded in this assignation of names or invention of words undoubtedly by imitating as much as they could the nature of the object which they named by the sound of the name which they gave to it as a painter who would represent grass must employ a green color so in the beginnings of language one giving a name to any thing harsh or boisterous would of course employ a harsh or boisterous sound he could not do otherwise if he meant to excite in the hearer the idea of that thing which he sought to name to suppose words invented or names given to things in a manner purely arbitrary without any ground or reason is to suppose an effect without a cause there must have always been some motive which led to the assignation of one name rather than another and we can conceive no motive which would more universally operate upon men in their first efforts toward language than a desire to paint by speech the objects which they named in a manner more or less complete according as the vocal organs had it in their power to effect this imitation  wherever objects were to be named in which sound noise or motion were concerned the imitation by words was abundantly obvious nothing was more natural than to imitate by the sound of the voice the quality of the sound or noise which any external object made and to form its name accordingly thus in all languages we find a multitude of words that are evidently constructed upon this principle a certain bird is termed the cuckoo from the sound which it emits when one sort of wind is said to whistle and another to roar when a serpent is said to hiss a fly to buz and falling timber to crash when a stream is said to flow and hail to rattle the analogy between the word and the thing signified is plainly discernible  in the names of objects which address the sight only where neither noise nor motion are concerned and still more in the terms appropriated to moral ideas this analogy appears to fail many learned men however have been of opinion that though in such cases it becomes more obscure yet it is not altogether lost but that throughout the radical words of all languages there may be traced some degree of correspondence with the object signified witn regard to moral and intellectual ideas they remark that in every language the terms significant of them are derived from the names of sensible objects to which they are conceived to be analogous and with regard to sensible objects pertaining merely to sight they remark that their most distinguishing qualities have certain radical sounds appropriated to the expression of them in a great variety of languages stability for instance fluidity hollowness smoothness gentleness violence etc they imagine to be painted by the sound of certain letters or syllables which have some relation to those different states of visible objects on account of an obscure resemblance which the organs of voice are capable of assuming to such external qualities by this natural mechanism they imagine all languages to have been at first constructed and the roots of their capital words formed the author who has carried his speculations on this subject the farthest is the president des brosses in his traite de la formation mechanique des langues some of the radical letters or syllables which he supposes to carry this expressive power in most known languages are st to signify stability or rest fl to denote fluency cl a gentle descent r what relates to rapid motion c to cavity or hollowness etc a century before his time dr wallis in his grammar of the english language had taken notice of these significant roots and represented it as a peculiar excellency of our tongue that beyond all others it expressed the nature of the objects which it names by employing sounds sharper softer weaker stronger more obscure or more stridulous according as the idea which is to be suggested requires he gives various examples thus words formed upon st always denote firmness and strength analogous to the latin sto as stand stay

split spill spring terminations in ash indicate something acting nimbly and sharply as crash gash rash flash lash slash terminations in ush something acting more obtusely and dully as crush brush hush gush blush the learned author produces a great many more examples of the same kind which seem to leave no doubt that the analogies of sound have had some influence on the formation of words at the same time in all speculations of this kind there is so much room for fancy to operate that they ought to be adopted with much caution in forming any general theory   as far as this system is founded in truth language appears to be not altogether arbitrary in its origin among the ancient stoic and platonic philosophers it was a question much agitated utrum nomina rerum sint natura an impositione  by which they meant whether words were merely conventional symbols of the rise of which no account could be given except the pleasure of the first inventors of language or whether there was some principle in nature that led to the assignation of particular names to particular objects and those of the platonic school favored the latter opinion vid plat in cratylo nomina verbaque non posita fortuito sed quadam vi and ratione naturae facta esse p nigidius in grammaticis commentariis docet rem sane in philosophiae differtationibus celebrem in eam rem multa argumenta dicit cur videri

principle however of a natural relation between words and objects can only be applied to language in its most simple and primitive state though in every tongue some remains of it as i have shown above can be traced it were utterly in vain to search for it throughout the whole construction of any modern language as the multitude of terms increase in every nation and the immense field of language is filled up words by a thousand fanciful and irregular methods of derivation and composition come to deviate widely from the primitive character of their roots and to lose all analogy or resemblance in sound to the things signified in this state we now find language words as we now employ them taken in the general may be considered as symbols not as imitations as arbitrary or instituted not natural signs of ideas but there can be no doubt i think that language the nearer we remount to its rise among men will be found to partake more of a natural expression as it could be originally formed on nothing but imitation it would in its primitive state be more picturesque much more barren indeed and narrow in the circle of its terms than now but so far as it went more expressive by sound of the thing signified this then may be assumed as one character of the first state or beginnings of language among every savage tribe  a second character of language in its early state is drawn from the manner in which words were at first pronounced or uttered by men interjections i showed or passionate exclamations were the first elements of speech men labored to communicate their feelings to one another by those expressive cries and gestures which nature taught them after words or names of objects began to be invented this mode of speaking by natural signs could not be all at once disused for language in its infancy must have been extremely barren and there certainly was a period among all rude nations when conversation was carried on by a very few words intermixed with many exclamations and earnest gestures the small stock of words which men as yet possessed rendered those helps absolutely necessary for explaining their conceptions and rude uncultivated men not having always at hand even the few words which they knew would naturally labor to make themselves understood by varying their tones of voice and accompanying their tones with the most significant gesticulations they could make at this day when persons attempt to speak in any language which they possess imperfectly they have recourse to all these supplemental methods in order to render themselves more intelligible the plan too according to which i have shown that language was originally constructed upon resemblance or analogy as far as was possible to the thing signified would naturally lead men to utter their words with more emphasis and force as long as language was a sort of painting by means of sound for all those reasons this may be assumed as a principle that the pronunciation of the earliest languages was accompanied with more gesticulation and with more and greater inflexions of voice than what we now use there was more action in it and it was more upon a crying or singing tone  to this manner of speaking necessity first gave rise but we must observe that after this necessity had in a great measure ceased by language becoming in process of time more extensive and copious the ancient manner of speech still subsisted among many nations and what had arisen from necessity continued to be used for ornament wherever there was much fire and vivacity in the genius of nations they were naturally inclined to a mode of conversation which gratified the imagination so much for an imagination which is warm is always prone to throw both a great deal of action and a variety of tones into discourse upon this principle dr warburton accounts for so much speaking by action as we find among the old testament prophets as when jeremiah breaks the potters vessel in sight of the people throws a book into the euphrates puts on bonds and yokes and carries out his household stuff all which he imagines might be significant modes of expression very natural in those ages when men were accustomed to explain themselves so much by actions and gestures in like manner among the northern american tribes certain motions and actions were found to be much used as explanatory of their meaning on all their great occasions of intercourse with each other and by the belts and strings of wampum which they gave and received they were accustomed to declare their meaning as much as by their discourses  with regard to inflexions of voice these are so natural that to some nations it has appeared easier to express different ideas by varying the tone with which they pronounced the same word than to contrive words for all their ideas this is the practice of the chinese in particular the number of words in their language is said not to be great but in speaking they vary each of their words on no less than five different tones by which they make the same word signify five different things this must give a great appearance of music or singing to their speech for those inflexions of voice which in the infancy of language were no more than harsh or dissonant cries must as language gradually polishes pass into more smooth and musical sounds and hence is formed what we call the prosody of a language  it is remarkable and deserves attention that both in the greek and roman languages this musical and gesticulating pronunciation was retained in a very high degree without having attended to this we will be at a loss in understanding several passages of the classics which relate to the public speaking and the theatrical entertainments of the ancients it appears from many circumstances that the prosody both of the greeks and romans was carried much farther than ours or that they spoke with more and stronger inflexions of voice than we use the quantity of their syllables was much more fixed than in any of the modern languages and rendered much more sensible to the ear in pronouncing them besides quantities or the difference of short and long accents were placed upon most of their syllables the acute grave and circumflex the use of which accents we have now entirely lost but which we know determined the speakers voice to rise or fall our modern pronunciation must have appeared to them a lifeless monotony the declamation of their orators and the pronunciation of their actors upon the stage approached to the nature of recitative in music was capable of being marked in notes and supported with instruments as several learned men have fully proved and if this was the case as they have shown among the romans the greeks it is well known were still a more musical people than the romans and carried their attention to tone and pronunciation much farther in every public exhibition aristotle in his poetics considers the music of tragedy as one of its chief and most essential parts  the case was parallel with regard to gestures for strong tones and animated gestures we may observe always go together action is treated of by all the ancient critics as the chief quality in every public speaker the action both of the orators and the players in greece and rome was far more vehement than what we are accustomed to roscius would have seemed a madman to us gesture was of such consequence upon the ancient stage that there is reason for believing that on some occasions the speaking and the acting part were divided which according to our ideas would form a strange exhibition one player spoke the words in the proper tones while another performed the corresponding motions and gestures we learn from cicero that it was a contest between him and roscius whether he could express a sentiment in a greater variety of phrases or roscius in a greater variety of intelligible significant gestures at last gesture came to engross the stage wholly for under the reigns of augustus and tiberius the favorite entertainment of the public was the pantomime which was carried on entirely by mute gesticulation the people were moved and wept at it as much as at tragedies and the passion for it became so strong that laws were obliged to be made for restraining the senators from studying the pantomime art now though in declamations and theatrical exhibitions both tone and gesture were doubtless carried much farther than in common discourse yet public speaking of any kind must in every country bear some proportion to the manner that is used in conversation and such public entertainments as i have now mentioned could never have been relished by a nation whose tones and gestures in discourse were as languid as ours  when the barbarians spread themselves over the roman empire these more phlegmatic nations did not retain the accents the tones and gestures which necessity at first introduced and custom and fancy afterward so long supported in the greek and roman languages as the latin tongue was lost in their idioms so the character of speech and pronunciation began to be changed throughout europe nothing of the same attention was paid to the music of language or to the pomp of declamation and theatrical action both conversation and public speaking became more simple and plain such as we now find it without that enthusiastic mixture of tones and gestures which distinguished the ancient nations at the restoration of letters the genius of language was so much altered and the manners of the people become so different that it was no easy matter to understand what the ancients had said concerning their declamations and public spectacles our plain manner of speaking in these northern countries expresses the passions with sufficient energy to move those who are not accustomed to any more vehement manner but undoubtedly more varied tones and more animated motions carry a natural expression of warmer feelings accordingly in different modern languages the prosody of speech partakes more of music in proportion to the liveliness and sensibility of the people a frenchman both varies his accents and gesticulates while he speaks much more than an englishman an italian a great deal more than either musical pronunciation and expressive gesture are to this day the distinction of italy  from the pronunciation of language let us proceed in the third place to consider of the style of language in its most early state and of its progress in this respect also as the manner in which men at first uttered their words and maintained conversation was strong and expressive enforcing their imperfectly expressed ideas by cries and gestures so the language which they used could be no other than full of figures and metaphors not correct indeed but forcible and picturesque  we are apt upon a superficial view to imagine that those modes of expression which are called figures of speech are among the chief refinements of speech not invented till after language had advanced to its later periods and mankind were brought into a polished state and that then they were devised by orators and rhetoricians the quite contrary of this is the truth mankind never employed so many figures of speech as when they had hardly any words for expressing their meaning  for first the want of proper names for every object obliged them to use one name for many and of course to express themselves by comparisons metaphors allusions and all those substituted forms of speech which render language figurative next as the objects with which they were most conversant were the sensible material objects around them names would be given to those objects long before words were invented for signifying the dispositions of the mind or any sort of moral and intellectual ideas hence the early language of men being entirely made up of words descriptive of sensible objects it became of necessity extremely metaphorical for to signify any desire or passion or any act or feeling of the mind they had no precise expression which was appropriated to that purpose but were under a necessity of painting the emotion or passion which they felt by allusion to those sensible objects which had most relation to it and which could render it in some sort visible to others  but it was not necessity alone that gave rise to this figured style other circumstances also at the commencement of language contributed to it in the infancy of all societies men are much under the dominion of imagination and passion they live scattered and dispersed they are unacquainted with the course of things they are every day meeting with new and strange objects fear and surprise wonder and astonishment are their most frequent passions their language will necessarily partake of this character of their minds they will be prone to exaggeration and hyperbole they will be given to describe every thing with the strongest colors and most vehement expressions infinitely more than men living in the advanced and cultivated periods of society when their imagination is more chastened their passions are more tamed and a wider experience has rendered the objects of life more familiar to them even the manner in which i before showed that the first tribes of men uttered their words would have considerable influence on their style wherever strong exclamations tones and gestures enter much into conversation the imagination is always more exercised a greater effort of fancy and passion is excited consequently the fancy kept awake and rendered more sprightly by this mode of utterance operates upon style and enlivens it more  these reasonings are confirmed by undoubted facts the style of all the most early languages among nations who are in the first and rude periods of society is found without exception to be full of figures hyperbolical and picturesque in a high degree we have a striking instance of this in the american languages which are known by the most authentic accounts to be figurative to excess the iroquois and illinois carry on their treaties and public transactions with bolder metaphors and greater pomp of style than we use in our poetical productions thus to give an instance of the singular style of these nations the five nations of canada when entering on a treaty of peace with us expressed themselves by their chiefs in the following language we are happy in having buried under ground the red axe that has so often been dyed with the blood of our brethren now in this fort we inter the axe and plant the tree of peace we plant a tree whose top will reach the sun and its branches spread abroad so that it shall be seen afar off may its growth never be stifled and choked but may it shade both your country and ours with its leaves let us make fast its roots and extend them to the utmost of your colonies if the french should come to shake this tree we would know it by the motion of its roots reaching into our country may the great spirit allow us to rest in tranquillity upon our matts and never again dig up the axe to cut down the tree of peace let the earth be trod hard over it where it lies buried let a strong stream run under the pit to wash the evil away out of our sight and remembrance  the fire that had long burned in albany is extinguished the bloody bed is washed clean and the tears are wiped from our eyes we now renew the covenent chain of friendship let it be kept bright and clean as silver and not suffered to contract any rust let not any one pull away his arm from it these passages are extracted from cadwallader coldens history of the five indian nations where it appears from the authentic documents he produces that such is their genuine style   another remarkable instance is the style of the old testament which is carried on by constant allusions to sensible objects iniquity or guilt is expressed by a spotted garment misery by drinking the cup of astonishment vain pursuits by feeding on ashes a sinful life by a crooked path prosperity by the candle of the lord shining on our head and the like in innumerable instances hence we have been accustomed to call this sort of style the oriental style as fancying it to be peculiar to the nations of the east whereas from the american style and from many other instances it plainly appears not to have been peculiar to any one region or climate but to have been common to all nations in certain periods of society and language  hence we may receive some light concerning that seeming paradox that poetry is more ancient than prose i shall have occasion to discuss this point fully hereafter when i come to treat of the nature and origin of poetry at present it is sufficient to observe that from what has been said it plainly appears that the style of all language must have been originally poetical strongly tinctured with that enthusiasm and that descriptive metaphorical expression which distinguishes poetry  as language in its progress began to grow more copious it gradually lost that figurative style which was its early character when men were furnished with proper and familiar names for every object both sensible and moral they were not obliged to use so many circumlocutions style became more precise and of course more simple imagination too in proportion as society advanced had less influence over mankind the vehement manner of speaking by tones and gestures became not so universal the understanding was more exercised the fancy less intercourse among mankind becoming more extensive and frequent clearness of style in signifying their meaning to each other was the chief object of attention in place of poets philosophers became the instructors of men and in their reasonings on all different subjects introduced that plainer and simpler style of composition which we now call prose among the greeks pherecydes of scyros the master of pythagoras is recorded to have been the first who in this sense composed any writing in prose the ancient metaphorical and poetical dress of language was now laid aside from the intercourse of men and reserved for those occasions only on which ornament was professedly studied  thus i have pursued the history of language through some of the variations it has undergone i have considered it in the first structure and composition of words in the manner of uttering or pronouncing words and in the style and character of speech i have yet to consider it in another view respecting the order and arrangement of words when we shall find a progress to have taken place similar to what i have been now illustrating  lecture vii rise and progress of language and of writing when we attend to the order in which words are arranged in a sentence or significant proposition we find a very remarkable difference between the ancient and the modern tongues the consideration of this will serve to unfold farther the genius of language and to show the causes of those alterations which it has undergone in the progress of society  in order to conceive distinctly the nature of that alteration of which i now speak let us go back as we did formerly to the most early period of language let us figure to ourselves a savage who beholds some object such as fruit which raises his desire and who requests another to give it to him supposing our savage to be unacquainted with words he would in that case labor to make himself be understood by pointing earnestly at the object which he desired and uttering at the same time a passionate cry supposing him to have acquired words the first word which he uttered would of course be the name of that object he would not express himself according to our english order of construction give me fruit but according to the latin order fruit give me fructum da mihi for this plain reason that his attention was wholly directed toward fruit the desired object this was the exciting idea the object which moved him to speak and of course would be the first named such an arrangement is precisely putting into words the gesture which nature taught the savage to make before he was acquainted with words and therefore it may be depended upon as certain that he would fall most readily into this arrangement  accustomed now to a different method of ordering our words we call this an inversion and consider it as a forced and unnatural order of speech but though not the most logical it is however in one view the most natural order because it is the order suggested by imagination and desire which always impel us to mention their object in the first place we might therefore conclude a priori that this would be the order in which words were most commonly arranged at the beginnings of language and accordingly we find in fact that in this order words are arranged in most of the ancient tongues as in the greek and the latin and it is said also in the russian the the sclavonic the gaelic and several of the american tongues  in the latin language the arrangement which most commonly obtains is to place first in the sentence that word which expresses the principal object of the discourse together with its circumstances and afterward the person or the thing that acts upon it thus sallust comparing together the mind and the body animi imperio corporis servitio magis utimur which order certainly renders the sentence more lively and striking than when it is arranged according to our english construction we make most use of the direction of the soul and of the service of the body the latin order gratifies more the rapidity of the imagination which naturally runs first to that which is its chief object and having once named it carries it in view throughout the rest of the sentence in the same manner in poetry justum and tenacem propositi virum non civium ardor prava jubentium non vultus instantis tyranni mente quatit solida  every person of taste must be sensible that here the words are arranged with a much greater regard to the figure which the several objects make in the fancy than our english construction admits which would require the justum and tenacem propositi virum though undoubtedly the capital object in the sentence to be thrown into the last place  i have said that in the greek and roman languages the most common arrangement is to place that first which strikes the imagination of the speaker most i do not however pretend that this holds without exception sometimes regard to the harmony of the period requires a different order and in languages susceptible of so much musical beauty and pronounced with so much tone and modulation as were used by those nations the harmony of periods was an object carefully studied sometimes too attention to the perspicuity to the force or to the artful suspension of the speakers meaning alter this order and produce such varieties in the arrangement that it is not easy to reduce them to any one principle but in general this was the genius and character of most of the ancient languages to give such full liberty to the collocation of words as allowed them to assume whatever order was most agreeable to the speakers imagination the hebrew is indeed an exception which though not altogether without inversions yet employs them less frequently and approaches nearer to the english construction than either the greek or the latin  all the modern languages of europe have adopted a different arrangement from the ancient in their prose compositions very little variety is admitted in the collocation of words they are mostly fixed to one order and that order is what may be called the order of the understanding they place first in the sentence the person or thing which speaks or acts next its action and lastly the object of its action so that the ideas are made to succeed to one another not according to the degree of importance which the several objects carry in the imagination but according to the order of nature and of time  an english writer paying a compliment to a great man would say thus it is impossible for me to pass over in silence such remarkable mildness such singular and unheard of clemency and such unusual moderation in the exercise of supreme power here we have first presented to us the person who speaks it is impossible for me next what that person is to do impossible for him to pass over in silence and lastly the object which moves him so to do the mildness clemency and moderation of his patron cicero from whom i have translated these words just reverses this order beginning with the object placing that first which was the exciting idea in the speakers mind and ending with the speaker and his action tantam mansuetudinem tam inusitatam inauditamque clementiam tantumque in summa potestate rerum omnium modum tacitus multo modo praeterire possum orat pro marcell  the latin order is more animated the english more clear and distinct the romans generally arranged their words according to the order in which the ideas rose in the speakers imagination we arrange them according to the order in which the understanding directs those ideas to be exhibited in succession to the view of another our arrangement therefore appears to be the consequence of greater refinement in the art of speech as far as clearness in communication is understood to be the end of speech  in poetry where we are supposed to rise above the ordinary style and to speak the language of fancy and passion our arrangement is not altogether so limited but some greater liberty is allowed for transposition and inversion even there however that liberty is confined within narrow bounds in comparison of the ancient languages the different modern tongues vary from one another in this respect the french language is of them all the most determinate in the order of its words and admits the least of inversion either in prose or poetry the english admits it more but the italian retains the most of the ancient transpositive character though one is apt to think at the expense of a little obscurity in the style of some of their authors who deal most in these transpositions  it is proper next to observe that there is one circumstance in the structure of all the modern tongues which of necessity limits their arrangement in a great measure to one fixed and determinate train we have disused those differences of termination which in the greek and latin distinguished the several cases of nouns and tenses of verbs and which thereby pointed out the mutual relation of the several words in a sentence to one another though the related words were disjoined and placed in different parts of the sentence this is an alteration in the structure of language of which i shall have occasion to say more in the next lecture one obvious effect of it is that we have now for the most part no way left us to show the close relation of any two words to one another in meaning but by placing them close to one another in the period for instance the romans could with propriety express themselves thus extinctum nymphae crudeli funere daphnim flebant  because extinctum and daphnim being both in the accusative case this showed that the adjective and the substantive were related to each other though placed at the two extremities of the line and that both were governed by the active verb flebant to which nymphae plainly appeared to be the nominative the different terminations here reduced all into order and made the connection of the several words perfectly clear but let us translate these words literally into english according to the latin arrangement dead the nymphs by a cruel fate daphnis lamented and they become a perfect riddle in which it is impossible to find any meaning  it was by means of this contrivance which obtained in almost all the ancient languages of varying the termination of nouns and verbs and thereby pointing out the concordance and the government of the words in a sentence that they enjoyed so much liberty of transposition and could marshal and arrange their words in any way that gratified the imagination or pleased the ear when language came to be modelled by the northern nations who overran the empire they dropped the cases of nouns and the different termination of verbs with the more ease because they placed no great value upon the advantages arising from such a structure of language they were attentive only to clearness and copiousness of expression they neither regarded much the harmony of sound nor sought to gratify the imagination by the collocation of words they studied solely to express themselves in such a manner as should exhibit their ideas to others in the most distinct and intelligible order and hence if our language by reason of the simple arrangement of its words possesses less harmony less beauty and less force than the greek or latin it is however in its meaning more obvious and plain  thus i have shown what the natural progress of language has been in several material articles and this account of the genius and progress of language lays a foundation for many observations both curious and useful from what has been said in this and the preceding lecture it appears that language was at first barren in words but descriptive by the sound of these words and expressive in the manner of uttering them by the aid of significant tones and gestures style was figurative and poetical arrangement was fanciful and lively it appears that in all the successive changes which language has undergone as the world advanced the understanding has gained ground on the fancy and imagination the progress of language in this respect resembles the progress of age in man the imagination is most vigorous and predominant in youth with advancing years the imagination cools and the understanding ripens thus language proceeding from sterility to copiousness has at the same time proceeded from vivacity to accuracy from fire and enthusiasm to coolness and precision those characters of early language descriptive sound vehement tones and gestures figurative style and inverted arrangement all hang together have a mutual influence on each other and have all gradually given place to arbitrary sounds calm pronunciation simple style plain arrangement language is become in modern times more correct indeed and accurate but however less striking and animated in its ancient state more favorable to poetry and oratory in its present to reason and philosophy  having finished my account of the progress of speech i proceed to give an account of the progress of writing which next demands our notice though it will not require so full a discussion as the former subject  next to speech writing is beyond doubt the most useful art of which men are possessed it is plainly an improvement upon speech and therefore must have been posterior to it in order of time at first men thought of nothing more than communicating their thoughts to one another when present by means of words or sounds which they uttered afterward they devised this further method of mutual communication with one another when absent by means of marks or characters presented to the eye which we call writing  written characters are of two sorts they are either signs for things or signs for words of the former sort signs of things are the pictures hieroglyphics and symbols employed by the ancient nations of the latter sort signs for words are the alphabetical characters now employed by all europeans these two kinds of writing are generically and essentially distinct  pictures were undoubtedly the first essay toward writing imitation is so natural to man that in all ages and among all nations some methods have obtained of copying or tracing the likeness of sensible objects those methods would soon be employed by men for giving some imperfect information to others at a distance of what had happened or for preserving the memory of facts which they sought to record thus to signify that one man had killed another they drew the figure of one man stretched upon the earth and of another standing by him with a deadly weapon in his hand we find in fact that when america was first discovered this was the only sort of writing known in the kingdom of mexico by historical pictures the mexicans are said to have transmitted the memory of the most important transactions of their empire these however must have been extremely imperfect records and the nations who had no other must have been very gross and rude pictures could do no more than delineate external events they could neither exhibit the connections of them nor describe such qualities as were not visible to the eye nor convey any idea of the dispositions or words of men  to supply in some degree this defect there arose in process of time the invention of what are called hieroglyphical characters which may be considered as the second stage of the art of writing hieroglyphics consist in certain symbols which are made to stand for invisible objects on account of an analogy or resemblance which such symbols were supposed to bear to the objects thus an eye was the hieroglyphical symbol of knowledge a circle of eternity which has neither beginning nor end hieroglyphics therefore were a more refined and extensive species of painting pictures delineated the resemblance of external visible objects hieroglyphics painted invisible objects by analogies taken from the external world  among the mexicans were found some traces of hieroglyphical characters intermixed with their historical pictures but egypt was the country where this sort of writing was most studied and brought into a regular art in hieroglyphics was conveyed all the boasted wisdom of their priests according to the properties which they ascribed to animals or the qualities with which they supposed natural objects to be endowed they pitched upon them to be the emblems or hieroglyphics of moral objects and employed them in their writing for that end thus ingratitude was denominated by a viper imprudence by a fly wisdom by an ant victory by a hawk a dutiful child by a stork a man universally shunned by an eel which they supposed to be found in company with no other fish sometimes they joined together two or more of these hieroglyphical characters as a serpent with a hawks head to denote nature with god presiding over it but as many of those properties of objects which they assumed for the foundation of their hieroglyphics were merely imaginary and the allusions drawn from them were forced and ambiguous as the conjunction of their characters rendered them still more obscure and must have expressed very indistinctly the connections and relations of things this sort of writing could be no other than aenigmatical and confused in the highest degree and must have been a very imperfect vehicle of knowledge of any kind  it has been imagined that hieroglyphics were an invention of the egyptian priests for concealing their learning from common view and that upon this account it was preferred by them to the alphabetical method of writing but this is certainly a mistake hieroglyphics were undoubtedly employed at first from necessity not from choice or refinement and would never have been thought of if alphabetical characters had been known the nature of the invention plainly shows it to have been one of those gross and rude essays toward writing which were adopted in the early ages of the world in order to extend some farther the first method which they had employed of simple pictures or representations of visible objects indeed in aftertimes when alphabetical writing was introduced into egypt and the hieroglyphical was of course fallen into disuse it is known that the priests still employed the hieroglyphical characters as a sacred kind of writing now become peculiar to themselves and serving to give an air of mystery to their learning and religion in this state the greeks found hieroglyphical writing when they began to have intercourse with egypt and some of their writers mistook this use to which they found it applied for the cause that had given rise to the invention  as writing advanced from pictures of visible objects to hieroglyphics or symbols of things invisible from these latter it advanced among some nations to simple arbitrary marks which stood for objects though without any resemblance or analogy to the objects signified of this nature was the method of writing practiced among the peruvians they made use of small cords of different colors and by knots upon these of various sizes and differently ranged they contrived signs for giving information and communicating their thoughts to one another  of this nature also are the written characters which are used to this day throughout the great empire of china the chinese have no alphabet of letters or simple sounds which compose their words but every single character which they use in writing is significant of an idea it is a mark which stands for some one thing or object by consequence the number of these characters must be immense it must correspond to the whole number of objects or ideas which they have occasion to express that is to the whole number of words which they employ in speech nay it must be greater than the number of words one word by varying the tone with which it is spoken may be made to signify several different things they are said to have seventy thousand of those written characters to read and write them to perfection is the study of a whole life which subjects learning among them to infinite disadvantage and must have greatly retarded the progress of all science  concerning the origin of these chinese characters there have been different opinions and much controversy according to the most probable accounts the chinese writing began like the egyptian with pictures and hieroglyphical figures these figures being in progress abbreviated in their form for the sake of writing them easily and greatly enlarged in their number passed at length into those marks or characters which they now use and which have spread themselves through several nations of the east for we are informed that the japanese the tonquinese and the coroeans who speak different languages from one another and from the inhabitants of china use however the same written characters with them and by this means correspond intelligibly with each other in writing though ignorant of the language spoken in their several countries a plain proof that the chinese characters are like hieroglyphics independent of language are signs of things not of words  we have one instance of this sort of writing in europe our ciphers as they are called or arithmetical figures         etc which we have derived from the arabians are significant marks precisely of the same nature with the chinese characters they have no dependence on words but each figure represents an object represents the number for which it stands and accordingly on being presented to the eye is equally understood by all the nations who have agreed in the use of these ciphers by italians spaniards french and english however different the languages of those nations are from one another and whatever different names they give in their respective languages to each numerical cipher  as far then as we have yet advanced nothing has appeared which resembles our letters or which can be called writing in the sense we now give to that term what we have hitherto seen were all direct signs for things and made no use of the medium of sound or words either signs by representation as the mexican pictures or signs by analogy as the egyptian hieroglyphics or signs by institution as the peruvian knots the chinese characters and the arabian ciphers  at length in different nations men became sensible of the imperfection the ambiguity and the tediousness of each of these methods of communication with one another they began to consider that by employing signs which should stand not directly for things but for the words which they used in speech for naming these things a considerable advantage would be gained for they reflected farther that though the number of words in every language be indeed very great yet the number of articulate sounds which are used in composing these words is comparatively small the same simple sounds are continually recurring and repeated and are combined together in various ways for forming all the variety of words which we utter they bethought themselves therefore of inventing signs not for each word by itself but for each of those simple sounds which we employ in forming our words and by joining together a few of those signs they saw that it would be practicable to express in writing the whole combinations of sounds which our words require  the first step in this new progress was the invention of an alphabet of syllables which probably preceded the invention of an alphabet of letters among some of the ancient nations and which is said to be retained to this day in aethiopia and some countries of india by fixing upon a particular mark or character for every syllable in the language the number of characters necessary to be used in writing was reduced within a much smaller compass than the number of words in the language still however the number of characters was great and must have continued to render both reading and writing very laborious arts till at last some happy genius arose and tracing the sounds made by the human voice to their most simple elements reduced them to a very few vowels and consonants and by affixing to each of these the signs which we now call letters taught men how by their combinations to put into writing all the different words or combinations of sound which they employed in speech by being reduced to this simplicity the art of writing was brought to its highest state of perfection and in this state we now enjoy it in all the countries of europe  to whom we are indebted for this sublime and refined discovery does not appear concealed by the darkness of remote antiquity the great inventor is deprived of those honors which would still be paid to his memory by all the lovers of knowledge and learning it appears from the books which moses has written that among the jews and probably among the egyptians letters had been invented prior to his age the universal tradition among the ancients is that they were first imported into greece by cadmus the phoenician who according to the common system of chronology was contemporary with joshua according to sir isaac newtons system contemporary with king david as the phoenicians are not known to have been the inventors of any art or science though by means of their extensive commerce they propagated the discoveries made by other nations the most probable and natural account of the origin of alphabetical characters is that they took rise in egypt the first civilized kingdom of which we have any authentic accounts and the great source of arts and polity among the ancients in that country the favorite study of hieroglyphical characters had directed much attention to the art of writing their hieroglyphics are known to have been intermixed with abbreviated symbols and arbitrary marks whence at last they caught the idea of contriving marks not for things merely but for sounds accordingly plato in phoedro expressly attributes the invention of letters to theuth the egyptian who is supposed to have been the hermes or mercury of the greeks cadmus himself though he passed from phoenicia to greece yet is affirmed by several of the ancients to have been originally of thebes in egypt most probably moses carried with him the egyptian letters into the land of canaan and there being adopted by the phoenicians who inhabited part of that country they were transmitted into greece  the alphabet which cadmus brought into greece was imperfect and is said to have contained only sixteen letters the rest were afterward added according as signs for proper sounds were found to be wanting it is curious to observe that the letters which we use at this day can be traced back to this very alphabet of cadmus the roman alphabet which obtains with us and with most of the european nations is plainly formed on the greek with a few variations and all learned men observe that the greek characters especially according to the manner in which they are formed in the oldest inscriptions have a remarkable conformity with the hebrew or samaritan characters which it is agreed are the same with the phoenician or the alphabet of cadmus invert the greek characters from left to right according to the phoenician and hebrew manner of writing and they are nearly the same besides the conformity of figure the names or denominations of the letters alpha beta gamma etc and the order in which the letters are arranged in all the several alphabets phoenician hebrew greek and roman agree so much as amounts to a demonstration that they were all derived originally from the same source an invention so useful and simple was greedily received by mankind and propagated with speed and facility through many different nations  the letters were originally written from the right hand toward the left that is in a contrary order to what we now practice this manner of writing obtained among the assyrians phoenicians arabians and hebrews and from some very old inscriptions appears to have obtained also among the greeks afterward the greeks adopted a new method writing their lines alternately from the right to the left and from the left to the right which was called boustrophedon or writing after the manner in which oxen plow the ground of this several specimens still remain particularly the inscription on the famous sigaean monument and down to the days of solon the legislator of athens this continued to be the common method of writing at length the motion from the left hand to the right being found more natural and commodious the practice of writing in this direction prevailed throughout all the countries of europe  writing was long a kind of engraving pillars and tables of stone were first employed for this purpose and afterward plates of the softer metals such as lead in proportion as writing became more common lighter and more portable substances were employed the leaves and the bark of certain trees were used in some countries and in others tablets of wood covered with a thin coat of soft wax on which the impression was made with a stylus of iron in later times the hides of animals properly prepared and polished into parchment were the most common materials our present method of writing on paper is an invention of no greater antiquity than the fourteenth century  thus i have given some account of the progress of these two great arts speech and writing by which mens thoughts are communicated and the foundation laid for all knowledge and improvement let us conclude the subject with comparing in a few words spoken language and written language or words uttered in our hearing with words represented to the eye where we shall find several advantages and disadvantages to be balanced on both sides  the advantages of writing above speech are that writing is both a more extensive and a more permanent method of communication more extensive as it is not confined within the narrow circle of those who hear our words but by means of written characters we can send our thoughts abroad and propagate them through the world we can lift our voice so as to speak to the most distant regions of the earth more permanent also as it prolongs this voice to the most distant ages it gives us the means of recording our sentiments to futurity and of perpetuating the instructive memory of past transactions it likewise affords this advantage to such as read above such as hear that having the written characters before their eyes they can arrest the sense of the writer they can pause and revolve and compare at their leisure one passage with another whereas the voice is fugitive and passing you must catch the words the moment they are uttered or you lose them for ever  but although these be so great advantages of written language that speech without writing would have been very inadequate for the instruction of mankind yet we must not forget to observe that spoken language has a great superiority over written language in point of energy or force the voice of the living speaker makes an impression on the mind much stronger than can be made by the perusal of any writing the tones of voice the looks and gesture which accompany discourse and which no writing can convey render discourse when it is well managed infinitely more clear and more expressive than the most accurate writing for tones looks and gestures are natural interpreters of the sentiments of the mind they remove ambiguities they enforce impressions they operate on us by means of sympathy which is one of the most powerful instruments of persuasion our sympathy is always awakened more by hearing the speaker than by reading his works in our closet hence though writing may answer the purposes of mere instruction yet all the great and high efforts of eloquence must be made by means of spoken not of written language  lecture viii structure of language after having given an account of the rise and progress of language i proceed to treat of its structure or of general grammar the structure of language is extremely artificial and there are few sciences in which a deeper or more refined logic is employed than in grammar it is apt to be slighted by superficial thinkers as belonging to those rudiments of knowledge which were inculcated upon us in our earliest youth but what was then inculcated before we could comprehend its principles would abundantly repay our study in maturer years and to the ignorance of it must be attributed many of those fundamental defects which appear in writing  few authors have written with philosophical accuracy on the principles of general grammar and what is more to be regretted fewer still have thought of applying those principles to the english language while the french tongue has long been an object of attention to many able and ingenious writers of that nation who have considered its construction and determined its propriety with great accuracy the genius and grammar of the english to the reproach of the country have not been studied with equal care or ascertained with the same precision attempts have been made indeed of late toward supplying this defect and some able writers have entered on the subject but much remains yet to be done  i do not propose to give any system either of grammar in general or of english grammar in particular a minute discussion of the niceties of language would carry us too much off from other objects which demand our attention in this course of lectures but i propose to give a general view of the chief principles relating to this subject in observations on the several parts of which speech or language is composed remarking as i go along the peculiarities of our own tongue after which i shall make some more particular remarks on the genius of the english language  the first thing to be considered is the division of the several parts of speech the essential parts of speech are the same in all languages there must always be some words which denote the names of objects or mark the subject of discourse other words which denote the qualities of those objects and express what we affirm concerning them and other words which point out their connections and relations hence substantives pronouns adjectives verbs prepositions and conjunctions must necessarily be found in all languages the most simple and comprehensive division of the parts of speech is into substantives attributives and connectives quinctilian informs us that this was the most ancient division tum videbit quot and quae sunt parts orationis quanquam de numero parum convenit veteres eim quorum fuerant aristoteles atque theodictes verba modo and nomina and convinctiones tradiderunt videlicet quod in verbis vim sermonis in nominibus materiam quia alterum est quod loquimur alterum de quo loquimur in convinctionibus autem complexum eorum esse judicarunt quas conjunctiones a plerisque dici scio sed haec videtur ex  magis propria translatio paulatim a philosophicis ac maxim a stoicis auctus est numerus ac primum convinctionibus articuli adjecti post praepositiones nominibus appellatio deinde pronomen deinde mistum verbo participium ipsis verbis adverbia lib i cap iv  substantives are all the words which express the names of objects or the subjects of discourse attributives are all the words which express any attribute property or action of the former connectives are what express the connections relations and dependencies which take place among them the common grammatical division of speech into eight parts nouns pronouns verbs participles adverbs prepositions interjections and conjunctions is not very logical as might be easily shown as it comprehends under the general term of nouns both substantives and adjectives which are parts of speech generically and essentially distinct while it makes a separate part of speech of participles which are no other than verbal adjectives however as these are the terms to which our ears have been most familiarised and as an exact logical division is of no great consequence to our present purpose it will be better to make use of these known terms than of any other  we are naturally led to begin with the consideration of substantive nouns which are the foundation of all grammar and may be considered as the most ancient part of speech for assuredly as soon as men had got beyond simple interjections or exclamations of passion and began to communicate themselves by discourse they would be under a necessity of assigning names to the objects they saw around them which in grammatical language is called the invention of substantive nouns i do not mean to assert that among all nations the first invented words were simple and regular substantive nouns nothing is more difficult and uncertain than to ascertain the precise steps by which men proceeded in the formation of language names for objects must doubtless have arisen in the most early stages of speech but it is probable as the learned author of the treatise on the origin and progress of language has shown vol i p         that among several savage tribes some of the first articulate sounds that were formed denoted a whole sentence rather than the name of a particular object conveying some information or expressing some desires or fears suited to the circumstances in which that tribe was placed or relating to the business they had most frequent occasion to carry on as the lion is coming the river is swelling etc many of their first words it is likewise probable were not simple substantive nouns but substantives accompanied with some of those attributes in conjunction with which they were most frequently accustomed to behold them as the great bear the little hut the wound made by the hatchet etc of all which the author produces instances from several of the american languages and it is undoubtedly suitable to the natural course of the operations of the human mind thus to begin with particulars the most obvious to sense and to proceed from these to more general expressions he likewise observes that the words of those primitive tongues are far from being as we might suppose them rude and short and crowded with consonants but on the contrary are for the most part long words and full of vowels this is the consequence of their being formed upon the natural sounds which the voice utters with most ease a little varied and distinguished by articulation and he shows this to hold in fact among most of the barbarous languages which are known  and here at our first setting out somewhat curious occurs the individual objects which surround us are infinite in number a savage wherever he looked beheld forests and trees to give separate names to every one of these trees would have been an endless and impracticable undertaking his first object was to give a name to that particular tree whose fruit relieved his hunger or whose shade protected him from the sun but observing that though other trees were distinguished from this by peculiar qualities of size or appearance yet that they also agreed and resembled one another in certain common qualities such as springing from a root and bearing branches and leaves he formed in his mind some general idea of those common qualities and ranging all that possessed them under one class of objects he called that whole class a tree longer experience taught him to subdivide this genus into the several species of oak pine ash and the rest according as his observation extended to the several qualities in which these trees agreed or differed  but still he made use only of general terms in speech for the oak the pine and the ash were names of whole classes of objects each of which included an immense number of undistinguished individuals here then it appears that though the formation of abstract or general conceptions is supposed to be a difficult operation of the mind such conceptions must have entered into the very first formation of language for if we except only the proper names of persons such as caesar john peter all the other substantive nouns which we employ in discourse are the names not of individual objects but of very extensive genera or species of objects as man lion house river etc we are not however to imagine that this invention of general or abstract terms requires any great exertion of metaphysical capacity for by whatever steps the mind proceeds in it it is certain that when men have once observed resemblances among objects they are naturally inclined to call all those which resemble one another by one common name and of course to class them under one species we may daily observe this practiced by children in their first attempts toward acquiring language  but now after language had proceeded as far as i have described the notification which it made of objects was still very imperfect for when one mentioned to another in discourse any substantive noun such as man lion or tree how was it to be known which man which lion or which tree he meant among the many comprehended under one name here occurs a very curious and a very useful contrivance for specifying the individual object intended by means of that part of speech called the article  the force of the article consists in pointing or singling out from the common mass the individual of which we mean to speak in english we have two articles a and the a is more general and unlimited the more definite and special a is much the same with one and marks only any one individual of a species that individual being either unknown or left undertermined as a lion a king the which possesses more properly the force of the article ascertains some known or determined individual of the species as the lion the king  articles are words of great use in speech in some languages however they are not found the greeks have but one article  which answers to our definite or proper article the they have no word which answers to our article a but they supply its place by the absence of their article thus  signifies a king  the king the latins have no article in the room of it they employ pronouns as hic ille iste for pointing out the objects which they want to distinguish noster sermo says quinctilian articulos non desiderat ideoque in alias parts orationis sparguntur this however appears to me a defect in the latin tongue as articles contribute much to the clearness and precision of language  in order to illustrate this remark what difference there is in the meaning of the following expressions in english depending wholly on the different employment of the articles the son of a king  the son of the king  a son of the kings each of these three phrases has an entirely different meaning which i need not explain because any one who understands the language conceives it clearly at first hearing through the different application of the articles a and the whereas in latin filius regis is wholly undetermined and to explain in which of these three senses it is to be understood for it may bear any of them a circumlocution of several words must be used in the same manner are you a king are you the king are questions of quite separate import which however are confounded together in the latin phrase esne tu rex thou art a man is a very general and harmless position but thou art the man is an assertion capable we know of striking terror and remorse into the heart these observations illustrate the force and importance of articles and at the same time i gladly lay hold of any opportunity of showing the advantages of our own language  besides this quality of being particularised by the articie three affections belong to substantive nouns number gender and case which require our consideration  number distinguishes them as one or many of the same kind called the singular and plural a distinction found in all languages and which must indeed have been coeval with the very infancy of language as there were few things which men had more frequent occasion to express than the difference between one and many for the greater facility of expressing it it has in all languages been marked by some variation made upon the substantive noun as we see in english our plural is commonly formed by the addition of the letter s in the hebrew greek and some other ancient languages we find not only a plural but a dual number the rise of which may very naturally be accounted for from separate terms of numbering not being yet invented and one two and many being all or at least the chief numeral distinctions which men at first had any occasion to take notice of  gender is an affection of substantive nouns which will lead us into more discussion than number gender being founded on the distinction of the two sexes it is plain that in a proper sense it can only find place in the names of living creatures which admit the distinction of male and female and therefore can be ranged under the masculine or feminine genders all other substantive nouns ought to belong to what grammarians call the neuter gender which is meant to imply the negation of either sex but with respect to this distribution somewhat singular has obtained in the structure of language for in correspondence to that distinction of male and female sex which runs through all the classes of animals men have in most languages ranked a great number of inaminate objects also under the like distinctions of masculine and feminine thus we find it both in the greek and latin tongues gladius a sword for instance is masculine sagitta an arrow is feminine and this assignation of sex to inanimate objects this distinction of them into masculine and feminine appears often to be entirely capricious derived from no other principle than the casual structure of the language which refers to a certain gender words of a certain termination in the greek and latin however all inanimate objects are not distributed into masculine and feminine but many of them are also classed where all of them ought to have been under the neuter gender as templum a church sedile a seat  but the genius of the french and italian tongues differs in this respect from the greek and latin in the french and italian from whatever cause it has happened so it is that the neuter gender is wholly unknown and that all their names of inanimate objects are put upon the same footing with living creatures and distributed without exception into masculine and feminine the french have two articles the masculine le and the feminine la and one or other of these is prefixed to all substantive nouns in the language to denote their gender the italians make the same universal use of their articles il and lo for the masculine and la for the feminine  in the english language it is remarkable that there obtains a peculiarity quite opposite in the french and italian there is no neuter gender in the english when we use common discourse all substantive nouns that are not names of living creatures are neuter without exception he she and it are the marks of the three genders and we always use it in speaking of any object where there is no sex or where the sex is not known the english is perhaps the only language in the known world except the chinese which is said to agree with it in this particular where the distinction of gender is properly and philosophically applied in the use of words and confined as it ought to be to mark the real distinctions of male and female  hence arises a very great and signal advantage of the english tongue which it is of consequence to remark the following observations on the metaphorical use of genders in the english language are taken from mr harriss hermes  though in common discourse as i have already observed we employ only the proper and literal distinction of sexes yet the genius of the language permits us whenever it will add beauty to our discourse to make the names of inanimate objects masculine or feminine in a metaphorical sense and when we do so we are understood to quit the literal style and to use one of the figures of discourse  for instance if i am speaking of virtue in the course of ordinary conversation or of strict reasoning i refer the word to no sex or gender i say virtue is its own reward or it is the law of our nature but if i choose to rise into a higher tone if i seek to embellish and animate my discourse i give a sex to virtue i say she descends from heaven she alone confers true honor upon man her gifts are the only durable rewards by this means we have it in our power to vary our style at pleasure by making a very slight alteration we can personify any object that we choose to introduce with dignity and by this change of manner we give warning that we are passing from the strict and logical to the ornamented and rhetorical style  this is an advantage which not only every poet but every good writer and speaker in prose is on many occasions glad to lay hold of and improve and it is an advantage peculiar to our tongue no other language possesses it for in other languages every word has one fixed gender masculine femimine or neuter which can upon no occasion be changed  for instance in greek virtus in latin and la virtue in french are uniformly feminine she must always be the pronoun answering to the word whether you be writing in poetry or prose whether you be using the style of reasoning or that of declamation whereas in english we can either express ourselves with the philosophical accuracy of giving no gender to things inanimate or by giving them gender and transforming them into persons we adapt them to the style of poetry and when it is proper we enliven prose  it deserves to be further remarked on this subject that when we employ that liberty which our language allows of ascribing sex to any inanimate object we have not however the liberty of making it of what gender we please masculine or feminine but are in general subjected to some rule of gender which the currency of language has fixed to that object the foundation of that rule is imagined by mr harris in his philosophical enquiry into the principles of grammar to be laid in a certain distant resemblance or analogy to the natural distinction of the two sexes  thus according to him we commonly give the masculine gender to those substantive nouns used figuratively which are conspicuous for the attributes of imparting or communicating which are by nature strong and efficacious either to good or evil or which have a claim to some eminence whether laudable or not those again he imagines to be generally made feminine which are conspicuous for the attributes of containing and of bringing forth which have more of the passive in their nature than the active which are peculiarly beautiful or amiable or which have respect to such excesses as are rather feminine than masculine upon these principles he takes notice that the sun is always put in the masculine gender with us the moon in the feminine as being the receptacle of the suns light the earth is universally feminine a ship a country a city are likewise made feminine as receivers or containers god in all languages is masculine time we make masculine on account of its mighty efficacy virtue feminine from its beauty and its being the object of love fortune is always feminine mr harris imagines that the reasons which determine the gender of such capital words as these hold in most other languages as well as the english this however appears doubtful a variety of circumstances which seem casual to us because we cannot reduce them to principles must unquestionably have influenced the original formation of languages and in no article whatever does language appear to have been more capricious and to have proceeded less according to fixed rule than in the imposition of gender upon things inanimate especially among such nations as have applied the distinction of masculine and feminine to all substantive nouns  having discussed gender i proceed next to another remarkable peculiarity of substantive nouns which in the style of grammar is called their declension by cases let us first consider what cases signify in order to understand this it is necessary to observe that after men had given names to external objects had particularised them by means of the article and distinguished them by number and gender still their language remained extremely imperfect till they had devised some method of expressing the relations which those objects bore one toward another they would find it of little use to have a name for man lion tree river without being able at the same time to signify how these stood with respect to each other whether as approaching to receding from joined with and the like indeed the relations which objects bear to one another are immensely numerous and therefore to devise names for them all must have been among the last and most difficult refinements of language but in its most early periods it was absolutely necessary to express in some way or other such relations as were most important and as occurred most frequently in common speech hence the genitive dative and ablative cases of nouns which express the noun itself together with those relations of to from with and by the relations which of all others we have the most frequent occasion to mention the proper idea then of cases in declension is no other than an expression of the state or relation which one object bears to another denoted by some variation made upon the name of that object most commonly in the final letters and by some languages in the initial  all languages however do not agree in this mode of expression the greek latin and several other languages use declension the english french and italian do not or at most use it very imperfectly in place of the variations of cases these modern tongues express the relations of objects by means of the words called prepositions which are the names of those relations prefixed to the name of the object english nouns have no case whatever except a sort of genitive commonly formed by the addition of the letter s to the noun as when we say drydens poems meaning the poems of dryden our personal pronouns have also a case which answers to the accusative of the latin i me  he him  who whom there is nothing then or at least very little in the grammar of our language which corresponds to declension in the ancient languages  two questions respecting this subject may be put first which of these methods of expressing relations whether that by declension or that by prepositions was the most ancient usage in language and next which of them has the best effect both methods it is plain are the same as to the sense and differ only in form for the significancy of the roman language would not have been altered though the nouns like ours had been without cases provided they had employed prepositions and though to express a disciple of plato they had said discipulus de plato like the modern italians in place of discipulus platonis  now with respect to the antiquity of cases although they may on first view seem to constitute a more artificial method than the other of denoting relations yet there are strong reasons for thinking that this was the earliest method practiced by men we find in fact that declensions and cases are used in most of what are called the mother tongues or original languages as well as in the greek and latin and a very natural and satisfying account can be given why this usage should have early obtained relations are the most abstract and metaphysical ideas of any which men have occasion to form when they are considered by themselves and separated from the related object it would puzzle any man as has been well observed by an author on this subject to give a distinct account of what is meant by such a word as of or from when it stands by itself and to explain all that may be included under it the first rude inventors of language therefore would be long of arriving at such general terms in place of considering any relation in the abstract and devising a name for it they would much more easily conceive it in conjunction with a particular object and they would express their conceptions of it by varying the name of that object through all the different cases hominis of a man homini to a man homine with a man etc  but though this method of declension was probably the only method which men employed at first for denoting relations yet in progress of time many other relations being observed besides those which are signified by the cases of nouns and men also becoming more capable of general and metaphysical ideas separate names were gradually invented for all the relations which occurred forming that part of speech which we now call prepositions prepositions being once introduced they were found to be capable of supplying the place of cases by being prefixed to the nominative of the noun hence it came to pass that as nations were intermixed by migrations and conquests and were obliged to learn and adopt the languages of one another prepositions supplanted the use of cases and declensions when the italian tongue for instance sprung out of the roman it was found more easy and simple by the gothic nations to accommodate a few prepositions to the nominative of every noun and to say di roma al roma di carthago al carthago than to remember all the variety of terminations romae romam carthaginis carthaginem which the use of declensions required in the ancient nouns by this progress we can give a natural account how nouns in our modern tongues come to be so void of declension a progress which is fully illustrated in dr adam smiths ingenious dissertation on the formation of languages  with regard to the other question on this subject which of these two methods is of the greatest utility and beauty we shall find advantages and disadvantages to be balanced on both sides there is no doubt that by abolishing cases we have rendered the structure of modern languages more simple we have disembarrassed it of all the intricacy which arose from the different forms of declension of which the romans had no fewer than five and from all the irregularities in these several declensions we have thereby rendered our languages more easy to be acquired and less subject to the perplexity of rules but though the simplicity and ease of language be great and estimable advantages yet there are also such disadvantages attending the modern method as leave the balance on the whole doubtful or rather incline it to the side of antiquity  for in the first place by our constant use of prepositions for expressing the relations of things we have filled language with a multitude of those little words which are eternally occurring in every sentence and may be thought thereby to have encumbered speech by an addition of terms and by rendering it more prolix to have enervated its force in the second place we have certainly rendered the sound of languge less agreeable to the ear by depriving it of that variety and sweetness which arose from the length of words and the change of terminations occasioned by the cases in the greek and latin but in the third place the most material disadvantage is that by this abolition of cases and by a similar alteration of which i am to speak in the next lecture in he conjugation of verbs we have deprived ourselves of that liberty of transposition in the arrangement of words which the ancient languages enjoyed  in the ancient tongues as i formerly observed the different terminations produced by declension and conjugation pointed out the reference of the several words of a sentence to one another without the aid of juxtaposition suffered them to be placed without ambiguity in whatever order was most suited to give emphasis to the meaning or harmony to the sound but now having none of those marks of relation incorporated with the words themselves we have no other way left us of showing what words in a sentence are most closely connected in meaning than that of placing them close by one another in theperiod the meaning of the sentence is brought out in separate members and portions it is broken down and divided whereas the structure of the greek and roman sentences by the government of their nouns and verbs presented the meaning so interwoven and compounded in all its parts as to make us perceive it in one united view the closing words of the period ascertained the relation of each member to another and all that ought to be connected in our idea appeared connected in the expression hence more brevity more vivacity more force that luggage of particles as an ingenious author happily expresses it which we are obliged always to carry along with us both clogs style and enfeebles sentiment the various terminations of the same word whether verb or noun are always conceived to be more intimately connected with the term which they serve to lengthen than the additional detached and in themselves insignificant particles which we are obliged to employ as connectives to our significant words our method gives almost the same exposure to the one as to the other making the significant parts and the insignificant equally conspicuous theirs much oftener sinks as it were the former into the latter at once preserving their use and hiding their weakness our modern languages may in this respect be compared to the art of the carpenter in its rudest state when the union of the materials employed by the artisan could be effected only by the help of those external and coarse implements pins nails and cramps the ancient languages resemble the same art in its most improved state after the invention of dovetail joints grooves and mortices when thus all the principal junctions are effected by forming properly the extremities or terminations of the pieces to be joined for by means of these the union of the parts is rendered closer while that by which that union is produced is scarcely perceivable the philosophy of rhetoric by dr campbell vol ii p       pronouns are the class of words most nearly related to substantive nouns being as the name imports representatives or substitutes of nouns i thou he she and it are no other than an abridged way of naming the persons or objects with which we have immediate intercourse or to which we are obliged frequently to refer in discourse accordingly they are subject to the same modifications with substantive nouns of number gender and case only with respect to gender we may observe that the pronouns of the first and second person as they are called i and thou do not appear to have had the distinctions of gender given them in any language for this plain reason that as they always refer to persons who are present to each other when they speak their sex must appear and therefore needs not be marked by a masculine or feminine pronoun but as the third person may be absent or unknown the distinction of gender there becomes necessary and accordingly in english it has all the three genders belonging to it he she it as to cases even those languages which have dropped them in substantive nouns sometimes retain more of them in pronouns for the sake of the greater readiness in expressing relations as pronouns are words of such frequent occurrence in discourse in english most of our grammarians hold the personal pronouns to have two cases besides the nominative a genitive and an accusative  i mine me  thou thine thee  he his him  who whose whom  in the first stage of speech it is probable that the places of those pronouns were supplied by pointing to the object when present and naming it when absent for one can hardly think that pronouns were of early invention as they are words of such a particular and artificial nature i thou he it it is to be observed are not names peculiar to any single object but so very general that they may be applied to all persons or objects whatever in certain circumstances it is the most general term that can possibly be conceived as it may stand for any one thing in the universe of which we speak at the same time these pronouns have this quality that in the circumstances in which they are applied they never denote more than one precise individual which they ascertain and specify much in the same manner as is done by the article so that pronous are at once the most general and the most particular words in language they are commonly the most irregular and troublesome words to the learner in the grammar of all tongues as being the words most in common use and subjected thereby to the greatest varieties  adjectives or terms of quality such as great little black white yours ours are the plainest and simplest of all that class of words which are termed attributive they are found in all languages and in all languages must have been very early invented as objects could not be distinguished from each other nor any intercourse be carried on concerning them till once names were given to their different qualities  i have nothing to observe in relation to them except that singularity which attends them in the greek and latin of having the same form given them with substantive nouns being declined like them by cases and subjected to the like distinctions of number and gender whence it has happened that grammarians have made them to belong to the same part of speech and divided the noun into substantive and adjective an arrangement founded more on attention to the external form of words than to their nature and force for adjectives or terms of quality have not by their nature the least resemblance to substantive nouns as they never express any thing which can possibly subsist by itself which is the very essence of the substantive noun they are indeed more akin to verbs which like them express the attribute of some substance  it may at first view appear somewhat odd and fantastic that adjectives should in these ancient languages have assumed so much the form of substantives since neither number nor gender nor cases nor relations have any thing to do in a proper sense with mere qualities such as good or great soft or hard and yet bonus and magnus and tener have their singular and plural their masculine and feminine their genitives and datives like any of the names of substances or persons but this can be accounted for from the genius of those tongues they avoided as much as possible considering qualities separately or in the abstract they made them a part or appendage of the substance which they served to distinguish they made the adjective depend on its substantive and resemble it in termination in number and gender in order that the two might coalesce the more intimately and be joined in the form of expression as they were in the nature of things the liberty of transposition too which those languages indulged required such a method as this to be followed for allowing the related words of a sentence to be placed at a distance from each other it required the relation of adjectives to their proper substantives to be pointed out by such similar circumstances of form and termination as according to the grammatical style should show their concordance when i say in english the beautiful wife of a brave man the juxtaposition of the words prevents all ambiguity but when i say in latin formosa fortis viri uxor it is only the agreement in gender number and case of the adjective  formosa which is the first word of the sentence with the substantive  uxor which is the last word that declares the meaning  lecture ix structure of language english tongue of the whole class of words that are called attributive indeed of all the parts of speech the most complex by far is the verb it is chiefly in this part of speech that the subtle and profound metaphysic of language appears and therefore in examining the nature and different variations of the verb there might be room for ample discussion but as i am sensible that such grammatical discussions when they are pursued far become intricate and obscure i shall avoid dwelling any longer on this subject than seems absolutely necessary  the verb is so far of the same nature with the adjective that it expresses like it an attribute or propriety of some person or thing but it does more than this for in all verbs in every language there are no less than three things implied at once the attribute of some substantive an affirmation concerning that attribute and time thus when i say the sun shines shining is the attribute ascribed to the sun the present time is marked and an affirmation is included that this property of shining belongs at that time to the sun the participle shining is merely an adjective which denotes an attribute or property and also expresses time but carries no affirmation the infinitive mood to shine may be called the name of the verb it carries neither time nor affirmation but simply expresses that attribute action or state of things which is to be the subject of the other moods and tenses hence the infinitive is often akin to a substantive noun and both in english and latin is sometimes constructed as such as scire tuum nihil est dulce et decorum est pro patria mori and in english in the same manner to write well is difficult to speak eloquently is still more difficult but as through all the other tenses and moods the affirmation runs and is essential to them the sun shines was shining shone will shine would have shone etc the affirmation seems to be that which chiefly distinguishes the verb from the other parts of speech and gives it its most conspicuous power hence there can be no sentence or complete proposition without a verb either expressed or implied for whenever we speak we always mean to assert that something is or is not and the word which carries this assertion or affirmation is a verb from this sort of eminence belonging to it this part of speech has received its name verb from the latin verbum or the word by way of distinction  verbs therefore from their importance and necessity in speech must have been coeval with mens first attempts toward the formation of language though indeed it must have been the work of long time to rear them up to that accurate and complex structure which they now possess it seems very probable as dr smith has suggested that the radical verb or the first form of it in most languages would be what we now call the impersonal verb it rains it thunders it is light it is agreeable and the like as this is the very simplest form of the verb and merely affirms the existence of an event or of a state of things by degrees after pronouns were invented such verbs became personal and were branched out into all the variety of tenses and moods  the tenses of the verb are contrived to imply the several distinctions of time of these i must take some notice in order to show the admirable accuracy with which language is constructed we think commonly of no more than the three great divisions of time into the past the present and the future and we might imagine that if verbs had been so contrived as simply to express these no more was needful but language proceeds with much greater subtilty it splits time into its several moments it considers time as never standing still but always flowing things past as more or less perfectly completed and things future as more or less remote by different gradations hence the great variety of tenses in most tongues  the present may indeed be always considered as one indivisible point susceptible of no variety i write or i am writing scribo but it is not so with the past there is no language so poor but it has two or three tenses to express the varieties of it ours has no fewer than four   a past action may be considered as left unfinished which makes the imperfect tense i was writing scribebam   as just now finished this makes the proper perfect tense which in english is always expressed by the help of the auxiliary verb i have written   it may be considered as finished some time ago the particular time left indefinite i wrote scripsi which may either signify i wrote yesterday or i wrote a twelvemonth ago this is what grammarians call an aorist or indefinite past   it may be considered as finished before something else which is also past this is the plusquamperfect i had written scripseram i had written before i received his letter  here we observe with some pleasure that we have an advantage over the latins who have only three varieties upon the past time they have no proper perfect tense or one which distinguishes an action just now finished from an action that was finished some time ago in both these cases they must say  scripsi though there be a manifest difference in the tenses which our language expresses by this variation i have written meaning i have just now finished writing and i wrote meaning at some former time since which other things have intervened this difference the romans have no tense to express and therefore can only do it by a circumlocution  the chief varieties in the future time are two a simple or indefinite future i shall write scribam and a future relating to something else which is also future i shall have written scripsero i shall have written before he arrives on the tenses of verbs mr harriss hermes may be consulted by such as desire to see them scrutinized with metaphysical accuracy and also the treatise on the origin and progress of language vol ii p       besides tenses or the power of expressing time verbs admit the distinction of voices as they are called the active and the passive according as the affirmation respects something that is done or something that is suffered i love or i am loved they admit also the distinction of moods which are designed to express the affirmation whether active or passive under different forms the indicative mood for instance simply declares a proposition i write i have written the imperative requires commands threatens write thou let him write the subjunctive expresses the proposition under the form of a condition or in subordination to some other thing to which a reference is made i might write i could write i should write if the case were so and so this manner of expressing an affirmation under so many different forms together also with the distinction of the three persons i thou and he constitutes what is called the conjugation of verbs which makes so great a part of the grammar of all languages  it now clearly appears as i before observed that of all the parts of speech verbs are by far the most artificial and complex consider only how many things are denoted by this single latin word  amavissem i would have loved first the person who speaks i secondly an attribute or action of that person loving thirdly an affirmation concerning that action fourthly the past time denoted in that affirmation have loved and fifthly a condition on which the action is suspended would have loved it appears curious and remarkable that words of this complex import and with more or less of this artifical structure are to be found as far as we know in all languages of the world  indeed the form of conjugation or the manner of expressing all these varieties in the verb differs greatly in different tongues conjugation is esteemed most perfect in those languages which by varying either the termination or the initial syllable of the verb express the greatest number of important circumstances without the help of auxiliary words in the oriental tongues the verbs are said to have few tenses or expressions of time but then their moods are so contrived as to express a great variety of circumstances and relations in the hebrew for instance they say in one word without the help of any auxiliary not only i have taught but i have taught exactly or often i have been commanded to teach i have taught myself the greek which is the most perfect of all the known tongues is very regular and complete in all the tenses and moods the latin is formed on the same model but more imperfect especially in the passive voice which forms most of the tenses by the help of the auxiliary  sum  in all the modern european tongues conjugation is very defective they admit few varieties in the termination of the verb itself but have almost constant recourse to their auxiliary verbs throughout all the moods and tenses both active and passive language has undergone a change in conjugation perfectly similar to that which i showed in the last lecture it underwent with respect to declension as prepositions prefixed to the noun superseded the use of cases so the two great auxiliary verbs to have and to be with those other auxiliaries which we use in english do shall will may and can prefixed to the participle supersede in a great measure the different terminations of moods and tenses which formed the ancient conjugations  the alteration in both cases was owing to the same cause and will be easily understood from reflecting on what was formerly observed the auxiliary verbs are like prepositions words of a very general and abstract nature they imply the different modifications of simple existence considered alone and without reference to any particular thing in the early state of speech the import of them would be incorporated so to speak with every particular verb in its tenses and moods long before words were invented for denoting such abstract conceptions of existence alone and by themselves but after those auxiliary verbs came in the progress of language to be invented and known and to have tenses and moods given to them like other verbs it was found that as they carried in their nature the force of that affirmation which distinguishes the verb they might by being joined with the participle which gives the meaning of the verb supply the place of most of the moods and tenses hence as the modern tongues began to rise out of the ruins of the ancient this method established itself in the new formation of speech such words for instance as am was have shall being once familiar it appeared more easy to apply these to any verb whatever as i am loved i was loved i have loved than to remember that variety of terminations which were requisite in conjugating the ancient verbs amor amabar amavi etc two or three varieties only in the termination of the verb were retained as love loved loving and all the rest were dropped the consequence however of this practice was the same as that of abolishing declensions it rendered language more simple and easy in its structure but withal more prolix and less graceful this finishes all that seemed most necessary to be observed with respect to verbs  the remaining parts of speech which are called the indeclinable parts or that admit of no variations will not detain as long  adverbs are the first that occur these form a very numerous class of words in every language reducible in general to the head of attributives as they serve to modify or to denote some circumstance of an action or of a quality relative to its time place order degree and the other properties of it which we have occasion to specify they are for the most part no more than an abridged mode of speech expressing by one word what might by a circumlocution be resolved into two or more words belonging to the other parts of speech exceedingly for instance is the same as in a high degree bravely the same as with bravery or valor here the same as in this place often and seldom the same as for many and for few times and so of the rest hence adverbs may be conceived as of less necessity and of later introduction into the system of speech than many other classes of words and accordingly the great body of them are derived from other words formerly established in the language  prepositions and conjunctions are words more essential to discourse than the greatest part of adverbs they form that class of words called connectives without which there could be no language serving to express the relations which things bear to one another their mutual influence dependencies and coherence thereby joining words together into intelligible and significant propositions conjunctions are generally employed for connecting sentences or members of sentences as and because although and the like prepositions are employed for connecting words by showing the relation which one substantive noun bears to another as of from to above below etc of the force of these i had occasion to speak before when treating of the cases and declensions of substantive nouns  it is abundantly evident that all these connective particles must be of the greatest use in speech seeing they point out the relations and transitions by which the mind passes from one idea to another they are the foundation of all reasoning which is no other thing than the connection of thoughts and therefore though among barbarous nations and in the rude uncivilised ages of the world the stock of these words might be small it must always have increased as mankind advanced in the arts of reasoning and reflection the more any nation is improved by science and the more perfect their language becomes we may naturally expect that it will abound the more with connective particles expressing relations of things and transitions of thought which had escaped a grosser view accordingly no tongue is so full of them as the greek in consequence of the acute and subtle genius of that refined people in every language much of the beauty and strength of it depends on the proper use of conjunctions prepositions and those relative pronouns which also serve the same purpose of connecting the different parts of discourse it is the right or wrong management of these which chiefly makes discourse appear firm and compacted or disjointed and loose which causes it to march with a smooth and even pace or with gouty and hobbling steps  i shall dwell no longer on the general construction of language allow me only before i dismiss the subject to observe that dry and intricate as it may seem to some it is however of great importance and very nearly connected with the philosophy of the human mind for if speech be the vehicle or interpreter of the conceptions of our minds an examination of its structure and progress cannot but unfold many things concerning the nature and progress of our conceptions themselves and the operations of our faculties a subject that is always instructive to man nequis says quinctilian an author of excellent judgment nequis tanquam parva fastidiat grammatices elementa non quia magnae sit operae consonantes a vocalibus discernere easque in semivocalium numerum mutarumque partiri sed quia interiora velut sacri hujus adeuntibus apparebit multa rerum subtilitas quae non modo acuere ingenia puerilia sed exercere altissimam quoque eruditionem ac scientiam possit let no man despise as inconsiderable the elements of grammar because it may seem to him a matter of small consequence to show the distinction between vowels and consonants and to divide the latter into liquids and mutes but they who penetrate into the innermost parts of this temple of science will there discover such refinement and subtility of matter as is not only proper to sharpen the understandings of young men but sufficient to give exercise for the most profound knowledge and erudition       let us now come nearer to our own language in this and the preceding lecture some observations have already been made on its structure but it is proper that we should be a little more particular in the examination of it  the language which is at present spoken throughout great britain is neither the ancient primitive speech of the island nor derived from it but is altogether of foreign origin the language of the first inhabitants of our island beyond doubt was the celtic or gaelic common to them with gaul from which country it appears by many circumstances that great britain was peopled this celtic tongue which is said to be very expressive and copious and is probably one of the most ancient languages in the world obtained once in most of the western regions of europe it was the language of gaul of great britain of ireland and very probably of spain also till in the course of those revolutions which by means of the conquests first of the romans and afterward of the northern nations changed the government speech and in a manner the whole face of europe this tongue was gradually obliterated and now subsists only in the mountains of wales in the highlands of scotland and among the wild irish for the irish the welsh and the erse are no other than different dialects of the same tongue the ancient celtic  this then was the language of the primitive britons the first inhabitants that we know of in our island and continued so till the arrival of the saxons in england in the year of our lord   0 who having conquered the britons did not intermix with them but expelled them from their habitations and drove them together with their language into the mountains of wales the saxons were one of those northern nations that overran europe and their tongue a dialect of the gothic or teutonic altogether distinct from the celtic laid the foundation of the present english tongue with some intermixture of danish a language probably from the same root with the saxon it continued to be spoken throughout the southern part of the island till the time of william the conqueror he introduced his norman or french as the language of the court which made a considerable change in the speech of the nation and the english which was spoken afterward and continues to be spoken now is a mixture of the ancient saxon and this norman french together with such new and foreign words as commerce and learning have in progress of time gradually introduced  the history of the english language can in this manner be clearly traced the language spoken in the low countries of scotland is now and has been for many centuries no other than a dialect of the english how indeed or by what steps the ancient celtic tongue came to be banished from the low country in scotland and to make its retreat into the highlands and islands cannot be so well pointed out as how the like revolution was brought about in england whether the southernmost part of scotland was once subject to the saxons and formed a part of the kingdom of northumberland or whether the great number of english exiles that retreated into scotland upon the norman conquest and upon other occasions introduced into that country their own language which afterward by the mutual intercourse of the two nations prevailed over the celtic are uncertain and contested points the discussion of which would lead us too far from our subject  from what has been said it appears that the teutonic dialect is the basis of our present speech it has been imported among us in three different forms the saxon the danish and the norman all which have mingled together in our language a very great number of our words too are plainly derived from the latin these we had not directly from the latin but most of them it is probable entered into our tongue through the channel of that norman french which william the conqueror introduced for as the romans had long been in full possession of gaul the language spoken in that country when it was invaded by the franks and normans was a sort of corrupted latin mingled with celtic to which was given the name of romanshe and as the franks and normans did not like the saxons in england expel the inhabitants but after their victories mingled with them the language of the country became a compound of the teutonic dialect imported by these conquerors and of the former corrupted latin hence the french language has always continued to have a very considerable affinity with the latin and hence a great number of words of latin origin which were in use among the normans in france were introduced into our tongue at the conquest to which indeed many have since been added directly from the latin in consequence of the great diffusion of roman literature throughout all europe  from the influx of so many streams from the junction of so many dissimilar parts it naturally follows that the english like every compounded language must needs be somewhat irregular we cannot expect from it that correspondence of parts that complete analogy in structure which may be found in those simpler languages which have been formed in a manner within themselves and built on one foundation hence as i before showed it has but small remains of conjugation or declension and its syntax is narrow as there are few marks in the words themselves that can show their relation to each other or in the grammatical style point out either their concordance or their government in the sentence our words having been brought to us from several different regions straggle if we may so speak asunder from each other and do not coalesce so naturally in the structure of a sentence as the words in the greek and roman tongues  but these disadvantages if they be such of a compound language are balanced by other advantages that attend it particularly by the number and variety of words with which such a language is likely to be enriched few languages are in fact more copious than the english in all grave subjects especially historical critical political and moral no writer has the least reason to complain of the barrenness of our tongue the studious reflecting genius of the people has brought together great store of expressions on such subjects from every quarter we are rich too in the language of poetry our poetical style differs widely from prose not in point of numbers only but in the very words themselves which shows what a stock and compass of words we have it in our power to select and employ suited to those different occasions herein we are infinitely superior to the french whose poetical language if it were not distinguished by rhyme would not be known to differ from their ordinary prose  it is chiefly indeed on grave subjects and with respect to the stronger emotions of the mind that our language displays its power of expression we are said to have thirty words at least for denoting all the varieties of the passion of anger anger wrath passion rage fury outrage fierceness sharpness animosity choler resentment heat heartburning to fume storm inflame be incensed to vex kindle irritate enrage exasperate provoke fret to be sullen hasty hot rough sour peevish etc preface to greenwoods grammar  but in describing the more delicate sentiments and emotions our tongue is not so fertile it must be confessed that the french language surpasses ours by far in expressing the nicer shades of character especially those varieties of manner temper and behavior which are displayed in our social intercourse with one another let any one attempt to translate into english only a few pages of one of marivauxs novels and he will soon be sensible of our deficiency of expression on these subjects indeed no language is so copious as the french for whatever is delicate gay and amusing it is perhaps the happiest language for conversation in the known world but on the higher subjects of composition the english may be justly esteemed to excel it considerably  language is generally understood to receive its predominant tincture from the national character of the people who speak it we must not indeed expect that it will carry an exact and full impression of their genius and manners for among all nations the original stock of words which they received from their ancestors remain as the foundation of their speech throughout many ages while their manners undergo perhaps very great alterations national character will however always have some perceptible influence on the turn of language and the gaiety and vivacity of the french and the gravity and thoughtfulness of the english are sufficiently impressed on their respective tongues  from the genius of our language and the character of those who speak it it may be expected to have strength and energy it is indeed naturally prolix owing to the great number of particles and auxiliary verbs which we are obliged constantly to employ and this prolixity must in some degree enfeeble it we seldom can express so much by one word as was done by the verbs and by the nouns in the greek and roman languages our style is less compact our conceptions being spread out among more words and split as it were into more parts make a fainter impression when we utter them notwithstanding this defect by our abounding in terms for expressing all the strong emotions of the mind and by the liberty which we enjoy in a greater degree than most nations of compounding words our language may be esteemed to possess considerable force of expression comparatively at least with the other modern tongues though much below the ancient the style of milton alone both in poetry and prose is a sufficient proof that the english tongue is far from being destitute of nerves and energy  the flexibility of a language or its power of accommodation to different styles and manners so as to be either grave and strong or easy and flowing or tender and gentle or pompous and magnificent as occasions require or as an authors genius prompts is a quality of great importance in speaking and writing it seems to depend upon three things the copiousness of a language the different arrangements of which its words are susceptible and the variety and beauty of the sound of those words so as to correspond to many different subjects never did any tongue possess this quality so eminently as the greek which every writer of genius could so mould as to make the style perfectly expressive of his own manner and peculiar turn it had all the three requisites which i have mentioned as necessary for this purpose it joined to these the graceful variety of its different dialects and thereby readily assumed every sort of character which an author could wish from the most simple and most familiar up to the most majestic the latin though a very beautiful language is inferior in this respect to the greek it has more of a fixed character of stateliness and gravity it is always firm and masculine in the tenor of its sound and is supported by a certain senatorial dignity of which it is difficult for a writer to divest it wholly on any occasion among the modern tongues the italian possesses a great deal more of this flexibility than the french by its copiousness its freedom of arrangement and the great beauty and harmony of its sounds it suits itself very happily to most subjects either in prose or in poetry is capable of the august and the strong as well as the tender and seems to be on the whole the most perfect of all the modern dialects which have arisen out of the ruins of the ancient our own language though not equal to the italian in flexibility yet is not destitute of a considerable degree of this quality if any one will consider the diversity of style which appears in some of our classics that great difference of manner for instance which is marked by the style of lord shaftsbury and that of dean swift he will see in our tongue such a circle of expression such a power of accommodation to the different taste of writers as redounds not a little to its honor  what the english has been most taxed with is its deficiency in harmony of sound but though every native is apt to be partial to the sounds of his own language and may therefore be suspected of not being a fair judge in this point yet i imagine there are evident grounds on which it may be shown that this charge against our tongue has been carried too far the melody of our versification its power of supporting poetical numbers without any assistance from rhyme is alone a sufficient proof that our language is far from being unmusical our verse is after the italian the most diversified and harmonious of any of the modern dialects unquestionably far beyond the french verse in variety sweetness and melody mr sheridan has shown in his lectures that we abound more in vowel and diphthong sounds than most languages and these too so divided into long and short as to afford a proper diversity in the quantity of our syllables our consonants he observes which appear so crowded to the eye on paper often form combinations not disagreeable to the ear in pronouncing and in particular the objection which has been made to the frequent recurrence of the hissing consonant s in our language is unjust and illfounded for it has not been attended to that very commonly and in the final syllables especially this letter loses altogether the hissing sound and is transformed into a z which is one of the sounds on which the ear rests with pleasure as in has these those loves hears and innumerable more where though the letter s be retained in writing it has really the power of z not of the common s  after all however it must be admitted that smoothness or beauty of sound is none of the distinguishing properties of the english tongue though not incapable of being formed into melodious arrangements yet strength and expressiveness more than grace form its character we incline in general to a short pronunciation of our words and have shortened the quantity of most of those which we borrow from the latin as orator spectacle theater liberty and such like agreeable to this is a remarkable peculiarity of english pronunciation the throwing the accent farther back that is nearer the beginning of the word than is done by any other nation in greek and latin no word is accented farther back than the third syllable from the end or what is called the antepenult but in english we have many words accented on the fourth some on the fifth syllable from the end as memorable convenience ambulatory profitableness the general effect of this practice of hastening the accent or placing it so near the beginning of a word is to give a brisk and a spirited but at the same time a rapid and hurried and not very musical tone to the whole pronunciation of a people  the english tongue possesses undoubtedly this property of being the most simple in its form and construction of all the european dialects it is free from all intricacy of cases declensions moods and tenses its words are subject to fewer variations from their original form than those of any other language its substantives have no distinction of gender except what nature has made and but one variation in case its adjectives admit of no change at all except what expresses the degree of comparison its verbs instead of running through all the varieties of ancient conjugation suffer no more than four or five changes in termination by the help of a few prepositions and auxiliary verbs all the purposes of significancy in meaning are accomplished while the words for the most part preserve their form unchanged the disadvantages in point of elegance brevity and force which follow from this structure of our language i have before pointed out but at the same time it must be admitted that such a structure contributes to facility it renders the acquisition of our language less laborious the arrangement of our words more plain and obvious the rules of our syntax fewer and more simple  i agree indeed with dr lowth preface to his grammar in thinking that this very simplicity and facility of our language proves a cause of its being frequently written and spoken with less accuracy it was necessary to study languages which were of a more complex and artificial form with greater care the marks of gender and case the varieties of conjugation and declension the multiplied rules of syntax were all to be attended to in speech hence language became more an object of art it was reduced into form a standard was established and any departures from the standard became conspicuous whereas among us language is hardly considered as an object of grammatical rule we take it for granted that a competent skill in it may be acquired without any study and that in a syntax so narrow and confined as ours there is nothing which demands attention hence arises the habit of writing in a loose and inaccurate manner  i admit that no grammatical rules have sufficient authority to control the firm and established usage of language established custom in speaking and writing is the standard to which we must at last resort for determining every controverted point in language and style but it will not follow from this that grammatical rules are superseded as useless in every language which has been in any degree cultivated there prevails a certain structure and analogy of parts which is understood to give foundation to the most reputable usage of speech and which in all cases when usage is loose or dubious possesses considerable authority in every language there are rules of syntax which must be inviolably observed by all who would either write or speak with any propriety for syntax is no other than that arrangement of words in a sentence which renders the meaning of each word and the relation of all the words to one another most clear and intelligible  all the rules of latin syntax it is true cannot be applied to our language many of those rules arose from the particular form of their language which occasioned verbs or prepositions to govern some the genitive some the dative some the accusative or ablative case but abstracting from these peculiarities it is to be always remembered that the chief and fundamental rules of syntax are common to the english as well as the latin tongue and indeed belong equally to all languages for in all languages the parts which compose speech are essentially the same substantives adjectives verbs and connecting particles and wherever these parts of speech are found there are certain necessary relations among them which regulate their syntax or the place which they ought to possess in a sentence thus in english just as much as in latin the adjective must by position be made to agree with its substantive and the verb must agree with its nominative in person and number because from the nature of things a word which expresses either a quality or an action must correspond as closely as possible with the name of that thing whose quality or whose action it expresses two or more substantives joined by a copulative must always require the verbs or pronouns to which they refer to be placed in the plural number otherwise their common relation to these verbs or pronouns is not pointed out an active verb must in every language govern the accusative that is clearly point out some substantive noun as the object to which its action is directed a relative pronoun must in every form of speech agree with its antecedent in gender number and person and conjunctions or connecting particles ought always to couple like cases and moods that is ought to join together words which are of the same form and state with each other i mention these as a few exemplifications of that fundamental regard to syntax which even in such a language as ours is absolutely requisite for writing or speaking with any propriety  whatever the advantages or defects of the english language be as it is our own language it deserves a high degree of our study and attention both with regard to the choice of words which we employ and with regard to the syntax or the arrangement of these words in a sentence we know how much the greeks and the romans in their most polished and flourishing times cultivated their own tongues we know how much study both the french and the italians have bestowed upon theirs whatever knowledge may be acquired by the study of other languages it can never be communicated with advantage unless by such as can write and speak their own language well let the matter of an author be ever so good and useful his compositions will always suffer in the public esteem if his expression be deficient in purity and propriety at the same time the attainment of a correct and elegant style is an object which demands application and labor if any imagine they can catch it merely by the ear or acquire it by a slight perusal of some of our good authors they will find themselves much disappointed the many errors even in point of grammar the many offenses against purity of language which are committed by writers who are far from being contemptible demonstrate that a careful study of the language is previously requisite in all who aim at writing it properly on this subject the reader ought to peruse dr lowths short introduction to english grammar with critical notes which is the grammatical performance of highest authority that has appeared in our time and in which he will see what i have said concerning the inaccuracies in language of some of our best writers fully verified in dr campbells philosophy of rhetoric he will likewise find many acute and ingenious observations both on the english language and on style in general and dr priestleys rudiments of english grammar will also be useful by pointing out several of the errors into which writers are apt to fall   lecture x style  perspicuity and precision having finished the subject of language i now enter on the consideration of style and the rules that relate to it  it is not easy to give a precise idea of what is meant by style the best definition i can give of it is the peculiar manner in which a man expresses his conceptions by means of language it is different from mere language or words the words which an author employs may be proper and faultless and his style may nevertheless have great faults it may be dry or stiff or feeble or affected style has always some reference to an authors manner of thinking it is a picture of the ideas which rise in his mind and of the manner in which they rise there and hence when we are examining an authors composition it is in many cases extremely difficult to separate the style from the sentiment no wonder these two should be so intimately connected as style is nothing else than that sort of expression which our thoughts most readily assume hence different countries have been noted for peculiarities of style suited to their different temper and genius the eastern nations animated their style with the most strong and hyperbolical figures the athenians a polished and acute people formed a style accurate clear and neat the asiatics gay and loose in their manners affected a style florid and diffuse the like sort of characteristical differences are commonly remarked in the style of the french the english and the spaniards in giving the general characters of style it is usual to talk of a nervous a feeble or a spirited style which are plainly the characters of a writers manner of thinking as well as of expressing himself so difficult it is to separate these two things from one another of the general characters of style i am afterward to discourse but it will be necessary to begin with examining the more simple qualities of it from the assemblage of which its more complex denominations in a great measure result  all the qualities of a good style may be ranged under two heads perspicuity and ornament for all that can possibly be required of language is to convey our ideas clearly to the minds of others and at the same time in such a dress as by pleasing and interesting them shall most effectually strengthen the impressions which we seek to make when both these ends are answered we certainly accomplish every purpose for which we use writing and discourse  perspicuity it will be readily admitted is the fundamental quality of style nobis prima sit virtus perspicuitas propria verba rectus ordo non in longum dilata conclusio nihil neque desit neque superfluat quinctil lib viii  a quality so essential in every kind of writing that for the want of it nothing can atone without this the richest ornaments of style only glimmer through the dark and puzzle instead of pleasing the reader this therefore must be our first object to make our meaning clearly and fully understood and understood without the least difficulty oration says quinctilian debet negligenter quoque audientibus esse aperta ut in animum audientis sicut sol in oculos etiamsi in eum non intendatur occurrat quare non solum ut intelligere possit sed ne omnino possit non intelligere curandum discourse ought always to be obvious even to the most careless and negligent hearer so that the sense shall strike his mind as the light of the sun does our eyes though they are not directed upwards to it we must study not only that every hearer may understand us but that it shall be impossible for him not to understand us  if we are obliged to follow a writer with much care to pause and to read over his sentences a second time in order to comprehend them fully he will never please us long mankind are too indolent to relish so much labor they may pretend to admire the authors depth after they have discovered his meaning but they will seldom be inclined to take up his work a second time  authors sometimes plead the difficulty of their subject as an excuse for the want of perspicuity but the excuse can rarely if ever be sustained for whatever a man conceives clearly that it is in his power if he will be at the trouble to put into distinct propositions or to express clearly to others and upon no subject ought any man to write where he cannot think clearly his ideas indeed may very excusably be on some subjects incomplete or inadequate but still as far as they go they ought to be clear and wherever this is the case perspicuity in expressing them is always attainable the obscurity which reigns so much among many metaphysical writers is for the most part owing to the indistinctness of their own conceptions they see the object but in a confused light and of course can never exhibit it in a clear one to others  perspicuity in writing is not to be considered as only a sort of negative virtue or freedom from defect it has higher merit it is a degree of positive beauty we are pleased with an author we consider him as deserving praise who frees us from all fatigue of searching for his meaning who carries us through his subject without any embarrassment or confusion whose style flows always like a limpid stream where we see to the very bottom  the study of perspicuity requires attention first to single words and phrases and then to the construction of sentences i begin with treating of the first and shall confine myself to it in this lecture  perspicuity considered with respect to words and phrases requires these three qualities in them purity propriety and precision  purity and propriety of language are often used indiscriminately for each other and indeed they are very nearly allied a distinction however obtains between them purity is the use of such words and such constructions as belong to the idiom of the language which we speak in opposition to words and phrases that are imported from other languages or that are obsolete or new coined or used without proper authority propriety is the selection of such words in the language as the best and most established usage has appropriated to those ideas which we intend to express by them it implies the correct and happy application of them according to that usage in opposition to vulgarisms or low expressions and to words and phrases which would be less significant of the ideas that we mean to convey style may be pure that is it may all be strictly english without scotticisms or gallicisms or ungrammatical irregular expressions of any kind and may nevertheless be deficient in propriety the words may be ill chosen not adapted to the subject nor fully expressive of the authors sense he has taken all his words and phrases from the general mass of english language but he has made his selection among these words unhappily whereas style cannot be proper without being also pure and where both purity and propriety meet besides making style perspicuous they also render it graceful there is no standard either of purity or of propriety but the practice of the best writers and speakers in the country  when i mentioned obsolete or newcoined words as incongruous with purity of style it will be easily understood that some exceptions are to be made on certain occasions they may have grace poetry admits of greater latitude than prose with respect to coining or at least newcompounding words yet even here this liberty should be used with a sparing hand in prose such innovations are more hazardous and have a worse effect they are apt to give style an affected and conceited air and should never be ventured upon except by such whose established reputation gives them some degree of dictatorial power over language  the introduction of foreign and learned words unless where necessity requires them should always be avoided barren languages may need such assistances but ours is not one of these dean swift one of our most correct writers valued himself much on using no words but such as were of native growth and his language may indeed be considered as a standard of the strictest purity and propriety in the choice of words at present we seem to be departing from this standard a multitude of latin words have of late been poured in upon us on some occasions they give an appearance of elevation and dignity to style but often also they render it stiff and forced and in general a plain native style as it is more intelligible to all readers so by a proper management of words it can be made equally strong and expressive with this latinised english  let us now consider the import of precision in language which as it is the highest part of the quality denoted by perspicuity merits a full explication and the more because distinct ideas are perhaps not commonly formed about it  the exact import of precision may be drawn from the etymology of the word it comes from precidere to cut off it imports retrenching all superfluities and pruning the expression so as to exhibit neither more nor less than an exact copy of his idea who uses it i observed before that it is often difficult to separate the qualities of style from the qualities of thought and it is found so in this instance for in order to write with precision though this be properly a quality of style one must possess a very considerable degree of distinctness and accuracy in his manner of thinking  the words which a man uses to express his ideas may be faulty in three respects they may either not express that idea which the author intends but some other which only resembles or is akin to it or they may express that idea but not quite fully and completely or they may express it together with something more than he intends precision stands opposed to all these three faults but chiefly to the last in an authors writing with propriety his being free of the two former faults seems implied the words which he uses are proper that is they express that idea which he intends and they express it fully but to be precise signifies that they express that idea and no more there is nothing in his words which introduces any foreign idea any superfluous unseasonable accessory so as to mix it confusedly with the principal object and thereby to render our conception of that object loose and indistinct this requires a writer to have himself a very clear apprehension of the object he means to present to us to have laid fast hold of it in his mind and never to waver in any one view he takes of it a perfection to which indeed few writers attain  the use and importance of precision may be deduced from the nature of the human mind it never can view clearly and distinctly above one object at a time if it must look at two or three together especially objects among which there is resemblance or connection it finds itself confused and embarrassed it cannot clearly perceive in what they agree and in what they differ thus were any object suppose some animal to be presented to me of whose structure i wanted to form a distinct notion i would desire all its trappings to be taken off i would require it to be brought before me by itself and to stand alone that there might be nothing to distract my attention the same is the case with words if when you would inform me of your meaning you also tell me more than what conveys it if you join foreign circumstances to the principal object if by unnecessarily varying the expression you shift the point of view and make me see sometimes the object itself and sometimes another thing that is connected with it you thereby oblige me to look on several objects at once and i lose sight of the principal you load the animal you are showing me with so many trappings and collars and bring so many of the same species before me somewhat resembling and yet somewhat differing that i see none of them clearly  this forms what is called a loose style and is the proper opposite to precision it generally arises from using a superfluity of words feeble writers employ a multitude of words to make themselves understood as they think more distinctly and they only confound the reader they are sensible of not having caught the precise expression to convey what they would signify they do not indeed conceive their own meaning very precisely themselves and therefore help it out as they can by this and the other word which may as they suppose supply the defect and bring you somewhat nearer to their idea they are always going about it and about it but never just hit the thing the image as they set it before you is always seen double and no double image is distinct when an author tells me of his heros courage in the day of battle the expression is precise and i understand it fully but if from the desire of multiplying words he will needs praise his courage and fortitude at the moment he joins these words together my idea begins to waver he means to express one quality more strongly but he is in truth expressing two courage resists danger fortitude supports pain the occasion of exerting each of these qualities is different and being led to think of both together when only one of them should be in my view my view is rendered unsteady and my conception of the object indistinct  from what i have said it appears that an author may in a qualified sense be perspicuous while yet he is far from being precise he uses proper words and proper arrangement he gives you the idea as clear as he conceives it himself and so far he is perspicuous but the ideas are not very clear in his own mind they are loose and general and therefore cannot be expressed with precision all subjects do not equally require precision it is sufficient on many occasions that we have a general view of the meaning the subject perhaps is of the known and familiar kind and we are in no hazard of mistaking the sense of the author though every word which he uses be not precise and exact  few authors for instance in the english language are more clear and perspicuous on the whole than archbishop tillotson and sir william temple yet neither of them are remarkable for precision they are loose and diffuse and accustomed to express their meaning by several words which show you fully whereabouts it lies rather than to single out those expressions which would convey clearly the idea they have in view and no more neither indeed is precision the prevailing character of mr addisons style although he is not so deficient in this respect as the other two authors  lord shaftsburys faults in point of precision are much greater than mr addisons and the more unpardonable because he is a professed philosophical writer who as such ought above all things to have studied precision his style has both great beauties and great faults and on the whole is by no means a safe model for imitation lord shaftsbury was well acquainted with the power of words those which he employs are generally proper and well sounding he has great variety of them and his arrangement as shall be afterward shown is commonly beautiful his defect in precision is not owing so much to indistinct or confused ideas as to perpetual affectation he is fond to excess of the pomp and parade of language he is never satisfied with expressing any thing clearly and simply he must always give it the dress of state and majesty hence perpetual circumlocutions and many words and phrases employed to describe somewhat that would have been described much better by one of them if he has occasion to mention any person or author he very rarely mentions him by his proper name in the treatise entitled advice to an author he descants for two or three pages together upon aristotle without once naming him in any other way than the master critic the mighty genius and judge of art the prince of critics the grand master of art and consummate philologist in the same way the grand poetic sire the philosophical patriarch and his disciple of noble birth and lofty genius are the only names by which he condescends to distinguish homer socrates and plato in another passage of the same treatise this method of distinguishing persons is extremely affected but it is not so contrary to precision as the frequent circumlocutions he employs for all moral ideas attentive on every occasion more to the pomp of language than to the clearness which he ought to have studied as a philosopher the moral sense for instance after he had once defined it was a clear term but how vague becomes the idea when in the next page he calls it that natural affection and anticipating fancy which makes the sense of right and wrong self examination or reflection on our own conduct is an idea conceived with ease but when it is wrought into all the forms of a mans dividing himself into two parties becoming a selfdialogist entering into partnership with himself forming the dual number practically within himself we hardly know what to make of it on some occasions he so adorns or rather loads with words the plainest and simplest propositions as if not to obscure at least to enfeeble them  in the following paragraph for example of the inquiry concerning virtue he means to show that by every ill action we hurt our mind as much as one who should swallow poison or give himself a wound would hurt his body observe what a redundancy of words he pours forth now if the fabric of the mind or temper appeared to us such as it really is if we saw it impossible to remove hence any one good or orderly affection or to introduce any ill or disorderly one without drawing on in some degree that dissolute state which at its height is confessed to be so miserable it would then undoubtedly be confessed that since no ill immoral or unjust action can be committed without either a new inroad and breach on the temper and passions or a further advancing of that execution already done whoever did ill or acted in prejudice of his integrity goodnature or worth would of necessity act with greater cruelty toward himself than he who scrupled not to swallow what was poisonous or who with his own hands should voluntarily mangle or wound his outward form or constitution natural limbs or body characterist vol ii p     here to commit a bad action is first to remove a good and orderly affection and to introduce an ill or disorderly one next it is to commit an action that is ill immoral and unjust and in the next line it is to do ill or to act in prejudice of integrity goodnature and worth nay so very simple a thing as a mans wounding himself is to mangle or wound his outward form and constitution his natural limbs or body such superfluity of words is disgustful to every reader of correct taste and serves no purpose but to embarrass and perplex the sense this sort of style is elegantly described by quinctilian est in quibusdam turba inanium verborum qui dum communem loquendi morem reformidant ducti specie nitoris circumeunt omnia copiosa loquacitate quae dicere volunt a crowd of unmeaning words is brought together by some authors who afraid of expressing themselves after a common and ordinary manner and allured by an appearance of splendor surround every thing which they mean to say with a certain copious loquacity  lib vii cap    the great source of a loose style in opposition to precision is the injudicious use of those words termed synonymous they are called synonymous because they agree in expressing one principal idea but for the most part if not always they express it with some diversity in the circumstances they are varied by some accessory idea which every word introduces and which forms the distinction between them hardly in any language are there two words that convey precisely the same idea a person thoroughly conversant in the propriety of the language will always be able to observe something that distinguishes them as they are like different shades of the same color an accurate writer can employ them to great advantage by using them so as to heighten and to finish the picture which he gives us he supplies by one what was wanting in the other to the force or to the luster of the image which he means to exhibit but in order to this end he must be extremely attentive to the choice which he makes of them for the bulk of writers are very apt to confound them with each other and to employ them carelessly merely for the sake of filling up a period or of rounding and diversifying the language as if their signification were exactly the same while in truth it is not hence a certain mist and indistinctness is unwarily thrown over style  in the latin language there are no two words we would more readily take to be synonymous than amare and diligere cicero however has shown us that there is a very clear distinction betwixt them quid ergo says he in one of his epistles tibi commendem eum quem tu ipse diligis sed tamen ut scires eum non a me diligi solum verum etiam amari ob eam rem tibi haec scribo ad famil l    ep     in the same manner tutus and securus are words which we would readily confound yet their meaning is different tutus signifies out of danger securus free from the dread of it seneca has elegantly marked this distinction tuta scelera esse possunt secura non possunt epis     in our own language very many instances might be given of a difference in meaning among words reputed synonymous and as the subject is of importance i shall now point out some of these the instances which i am to give may themselves be of use and they will serve to show the necessity of attending with care and strictness to the exact import of words if ever we would write with propriety or precision  austerity severity rigor austerity relates to the manner of living severity of thinking rigor of punishing to austerity is opposed effeminacy to severity relaxation to rigor clemency a hermit is austere in his life a casuist severe in his application of religion or law a judge rigorous in his sentences  custom habit custom respects the action habit the actor by custom we mean the frequent repetition of the same act by habit the effect which that repetition produces on the mind or body by the custom of walking often on the streets one acquires a habit of idleness  surprised astonished amazed confounded i am surprised with what is new or unexpected i am astonished at what is vast or great i am amazed with what is incomprehensible i am confounded by what is shocking or terrible  desist renounce quit leave off each of these words imply some pursuit or object relinquished but from different motives we desist from the difficulty of accomplishing we renounce on account of the disagreeableness of the object or pursuit we quit for the sake of some other thing which interests us more and we leave off because we are weary of the design a politician desists from his designs when he finds they are impracticable he renounces the court because he has been affronted by it he quits ambition for study or retirement and leaves off his attendance on the great as he becomes old and weary of it  pride vanity pride makes us esteem ourselves vanity makes us desire the esteem of others it is just to say as dean swift has done that a man is too proud to be vain  haughtiness disdain haughtiness is founded on the high opinion we entertain of ourselves disdain on the low opinion we have of others  to distinguish to separate we distinguish what we want not to confound with another thing we separate what we want to remove from it objects are distinguished from one another by their qualities they are separated by the distance

discover we invent things that are new we discover what was before hidden galileo invented the telescope harvey discovered the circulation of the blood  only alone only imports that there is no other of the same kind alone imports being accompanied by no other an only child is one who has neither brother nor sister a child alone is one who is left by itself there is a difference therefore in precise language betwixt these two phrases virtue only makes us happy and virtue alone makes us happy virtue only makes us happy imports that nothing else can do it virtue alone makes us happy imports that virtue by itself or unaccompanied with other advantages is sufficient to do it  entire complete a thing is entire by wanting none of its parts complete by wanting none of the appendages that

most proper means for success a prudent man the safest means for not being brought into danger  enough sufficient enough relates to the quantity which one wishes to have of any thing sufficient relates to the use that is to be made of it hence enough generally imports a greater quantity than sufficient does the covetous man never has enough although he has what is sufficient for nature  to avow to acknowledge to confess each of these words imports the affirmation of a fact but in very different circumstances to avow supposes the person to glory in it to acknowledge supposes a small degree of faultiness which the acknowledgment compensates to confess supposes a higher degree of crime a patriot avows his opposition to a bad minister and is applauded a gentleman acknowledges his mistake and is forgiven a prisoner confesses the crime he is accused of and is punished  to remark to observe we remark in the way of attention in order to remember we observe in the way of examination in order to judge a traveller remarks the most striking object he sees a general observes all the motions of his enemy  equivocal ambiguous an equivocal expression is one which has one sense open and designed to be understood another sense concealed and understood only by the person who uses it an ambiguous expression is one which has apparently two senses and leaves us at a loss which of them to give it an equivocal expression is used with an intention to deceive an ambiguous one when it is used with design is with an intention not to give full information an honest man will never employ an equivocal expression a confused man may often utter ambiguous ones without any design i shall give only one instance more  with by both these particles express the connection between some instrument or means of effecting an end and the agent who employs it but with expresses a more close and immediate connection by a more remote one we kill a man with a sword he dies by violence the criminal is bound with ropes by the executioner the proper distinction in the use of these particles is elegantly marked in a passage of dr robertsons history of scotland when one of the old scottish kings was making an enquiry into the tenure by which his nobles held their lands they started up and drew their swords  by these said they we acquired our lands and with these we will defend them  by these we acquired our lands signifies the more remote means of acquisition by force and martial deeds and  with these we will defend them signifies the immediate direct instrument the sword which they would employ in their defense  these are instances of words in our language which by careless writers are apt to be employed as perfectly synonymous and yet are not so their significations approach but are not precisely the same the more the distinction in the meaning of such words is weighed and attended to the more clearly and forcibly shall we speak or write in french there is a very useful treatise on this subject the abbe girards synonymes francoises in which he has made a large collection of such apparent synonymes in the language and shown with much accuracy the difference in their signification it were much to be wished that some such work were undertaken for our tongue and executed with equal taste and judgment nothing would contribute more to precise and elegant writing in the mean time this french treatise may be perused with considerable profit it will accustom persons to weigh with attention the force of words and will suggest several distinctions betwixt synonymous terms in our own language analogous to those which he has pointed out in the french and accordingly several of the instances above given were suggested by the work of this author   from all that has been said on this head it will now appear that in order to write or speak with precision two things are especially requisite one that an authors own ideas be clear and distinct and the other that he have an exact and full comprehension of the force of those words which he employs natural genius is here required labor and attention still more dean swift is one of the authors in our language most distinguished for precision of style in his writings we seldom or never find vague expressions and synonymous words carelessly thrown together his meaning is always clear and strongly marked  i had occasion to observe before that though all subjects of writing or discourse demand perspicuity yet all do not require the same degree of that exact precision which i have endeavored to explain it is indeed in every sort of writing a great beauty to have at least some measure of precision in distinction from that loose profusion of words which imprints no clear idea on the readers mind but we must at the same time be on our guard lest too great a study of precision especially in subjects where it is not strictly requisite betray us into a dry and barren style lest from the desire of pruning too closely we retrench all copiousness and ornament some degree of this failing may perhaps be remarked in dean swifts serious works attentive only to exhibit his ideas clear and exact resting wholly on his sense and distinctness he appears to reject disdainfully all embellishment which on some occasions may be thought to render his manner somewhat hard and dry to unite together copiousness and precision to be flowing and graceful and at the same time correct and exact in the choice of every word is no doubt one of the highest and most difficult seize in writing some kinds of composition may require more of copiousness and ornament others more of precision and accuracy nay in the same composition the different parts of it may demand a proper variation of manner but we must study never to sacrifice totally any one of these qualities to the other and by a proper management both of them may be made fully consistent if our own ideas be precise and our knowledge and stock of words be at the same time extensive  lecture xi structure of sentences having begun to treat of style in the last lecture i considered its fundamental quality perspicuity what i have said of this relates chiefly to the choice of words from words i proceed to sentences and as in all writing and discourse the proper composition and structure of sentences is of the highest importance i shall treat of this fully though perspicuity be the general head under which i at present consider language i shall not confine myself to this quality alone in sentences but shall enquire also what is requisite for their grace and beauty that i may bring together under one view all that seems necessary to be attended to in the construction and arrangement of words in a sentence  it is not easy to give an exact definition of a sentence or period farther than as it always implies some one complete proposition or enunciation of thought aristotles definition is in the main a good one  a form of speech which has a beginning and an end within itself and is of such a length as to be easily comprehended at once this however admits of great latitude for a sentence or period consists always of component parts which are called its members and as these members may be either few or many and may be connected in several different ways the same thought or mental proposition may often be either brought into one sentence or split into two or three without the material breach of any rule  the first variety that occurs in the consideration of sentences is the distinction of long and short ones the precise length of sentences as to the number of words or the number of members which may enter into them cannot be ascertained by any definite measure only it is obvious there may be an extreme on either side sentences immoderately long and consisting of too many members always transgress some one or other of the rules which i shall mention soon as necessary to be observed in every good sentence in discourses that are to be spoken regard must be had to the easiness of pronunciation which is not consistent with too long periods in compositions where pronunciation has no place still however by using long periods too frequently an author overloads the readers ear and fatigues his attention for long periods require evidently more attention than short ones in order to perceive clearly the connection of the several parts and to take in the whole at one view at the same time there may be an excess in too many short sentences also by which the sense is split and broken the connection of thought weakened and the memory burdened by presenting to it a long succession of minute objects  with regard to the length and construction of sentences the french critics make a very just distinction of style into style periodique and style coupe the style periodique is where the sentences are composed of several members linked together and hanging upon one another so that the sense of the whole is not brought out till the close this is the most pompous musical and oratorical manner of composing as in the following sentence of sir william temple if you look about you and consider the lives of others as well as your own if you think how few are born with honor and how many die without name or children how little beauty we see and how few friends we hear of how many diseases and how much poverty there is in the world you will fall down upon your knees and instead of repining at one affliction will admire so many blessings which you have received from the hand of god letter to lady essex cicero abounds with sentences constructed after this manner  the style coupe is where the sense is formed into short independent propositions each complete within itself as in the following of mr pope i confess it was want of consideration that made me an author i writ because it amused me i corrected because it was as pleasant to me to correct as to write i published because i was told i might please such as it was a credit to please preface to his works this is very much the french method of writing and always suits gay and easy subjects the style periodique gives an air of gravity and dignity to composition the style coupe is more lively and striking according to the nature of the composition therefore and the general character it ought to bear the one or other may be predominant but in almost every kind of composition the great rule is to intermix them for the ear tires of either of them when too long continued whereas by a proper mixture of long and short periods the ear is gratified and a certain sprightliness is joined with majesty in our style non semper says cicero describing very expressively these two different kinds of styles of which i have been speaking non semper utendum est perpetuitate and quasi conversione verborum sed saepe carpenda membris minutioribus oration est it is not proper always to employ a continued train and a sort of regular compass of phrases but style ought to be often broken down into smaller members   this variety is of so great consequence that it must be studied not only in the succession of long and short sentences but in the structure of our sentences also a train of sentences constructed in the same manner and with the same number of members whether long or short should never be allowed to succeed one another however musical each of them may be it has a better effect to introduce even a discord than to cloy the ear with the repetition of similar sounds for nothing is so tiresome as perpetual uniformity in this article of the construction and distribution of his sentences lord shaftsbury has shown great art in the last lecture i observed that he is often guilty of sacrificing precision of style to pomp of expression and that there runs through his whole manner a stiffness and affectation which render him very unfit to be considered as a general model but as his ear was fine and as he was extremely attentive to every thing that is elegant he has studied the proper intermixture of long and short sentences with variety and harmony in their structure more than any other english author and for this part of composition he deserves attention  from these general observations let us now descend to a more particular consideration of the qualities that are required to make a sentence perfect so much depends upon the proper construction of sentences that in every sort of composition we cannot be too strict in our attentions to it for be the subject what it will if the sentences be constructed in a clumsy perplexed or feeble manner it is impossible that a work composed of such sentences can be read with pleasure or even with profit whereas by giving attention to the rules which relate to this part of style we acquire the habit of expressing ourselves with perspicuity and elegance and if a disorder chance to arise in some of our sentences we immediately see where it lies and are able to rectify it on the structure of sentences the ancients appear to have bestowed a great deal of attention and care the treatise of demetrius phalereus  abounds with observations upon the choice and collocation of words carried to such a degree of nicety as would frequently seem to us minute the treatise of dionysius of halicarnassus  is more masterly but is chiefly confined to the musical structure of periods a subject for which the greek language afforded much more assistance to their writers than our tongue admits on the arrangement of words in english sentences the xviiith chapter of lord kaims elements of criticism ought to be consulted and also the  d volume of dr campbells philosophy of rhetoric   the properties most essential to a perfect sentence seem to me the four following   clearness and precision   unity   strength   harmony each of these i shall illustrate separately and at some length  the first is clearness and precision the least failure here the least degree of ambiguity which leaves the mind in any sort of suspense as to the meaning ought to be avoided with the greatest care nor is it so easy a matter to keep always clear of this as one might at first imagine ambiguity arises from two causes either from a wrong choice of words or a wrong collocation of them of the choice of words as far as regards perspicuity i treated fully in the last lecture of the collocation of them i am now to treat the first thing to be studied here is to observe exactly the rules of grammar as far as these can guide us but as the grammar of our language is not extensive there may often be an ambiguous collocation of words where there is no transgression of any grammatical rule the relations which the words or members of a period bear to one another cannot be pointed out in english as in the greek or latin by means of termination it is ascertained only by the position in which they stand hence a capital rule in the arrangement of sentences is that the words or members most nearly related should be placed in the sentence as near to each other as possible so as to make their mutual relation clearly appear this is a rule not always observed even by good writers as strictly as it ought to be it will be necessary to produce some instances which will both show the importance of this rule and make the application of it be understood  first in the position of adverbs which are used to qualify the signification of something which either precedes or follows them there is often a good deal of nicety by greatness says mr addison in the spectator no     i do not only mean the bulk of any single object but the largeness of a whole view here the place of the adverb only renders it a limitation of the following word mean i do not only mean the question may then be put what does he more than mean had he placed it after bulk still it would have been wrong i do not mean the bulk only of any single object for we might then ask what does he mean more than the bulk is it the color or any other property its proper place undoubtedly is after the word object by greatness i do not mean the bulk of any single object only for then when we put the question what more does he mean than the bulk of a single object the answer comes out exactly as the author intends and gives it the largeness of a whole view  theism says lord shaftsbury can only be opposed to polytheism or atheism does he mean that theism is capable of nothing else except being opposed to polytheism or atheism this is what his words literally import through the wrong collocation of only he should have said theism can be opposed only to polytheism or atheism  in like manner dean swift project for the advancement of religion the romans understood liberty at least as well as we these words are capable of two different senses according as the emphasis in reading them is laid upon liberty or upon at least in the first case they will signify that whatever other things we may understand better than the romans liberty at least was one thing which they understood as well as we in the second case they will import that liberty was understood at least as well by them as by us meaning that by them it was better understood if this last as i make no doubt was dean swifts own meaning the ambiguity would have been avoided and the sense rendered independent of the manner of pronouncing by arranging the words thus the romans understood liberty as well at least as we the fact is with respect to such adverbs as only wholly at least and the rest of that tribe that in common discourse the tone and emphasis we use in pronouncing them generally serves to show their reference and to make the meaning clear and hence we acquire a habit of throwing them in loosely in the course of a period but in writing where a man speaks to the eye and not to the ear he ought to be more accurate and so to connect those adverbs with the words which they qualify as to put his meaning out of doubt upon the first inspection  secondly when a circumstance is interposed in the middle of a sentence it sometimes requires attention how to place it so as to divest it of all ambiguity for instance are these designs says lord bolingbroke disser on parties dedicat are these designs which any man who is born a briton in any circumstances in any situation ought to be ashamed or afraid to avow here we are left at a loss whether these words  in any circumstance in any situation are connected with a man born in britain in any circumstances or situation or with that mans avowing his designs in any circumstances or situation into which he may be brought if the latter as seems most probable was intended to be the meaning the arrangement ought to have been conducted thus are these designs which any man who is born a briton ought to be ashamed or afraid in any circumstances in any situation to avow but  thirdly still more attention is required to the proper disposition of the relative pronouns who which what whose and of all those particles which express the connection of the parts of speech with one another as all reasoning depends upon this connection we cannot be too accurate and precise here a small error may overcloud the meaning of the whole sentence and even where the meaning is intelligible yet where these relative particles are out of their proper place we always find something awkward and disjointed in the structure of the sentence thus in the spectator no    this kind of wit says mr addison was very much in vogue among our countrymen about an age or two ago who did not practice it for any oblique reason but purely for the sake of being witty we are at no loss about the meaning here but the construction would evidently be mended by disposing of the circumstance about an age or two ago in such a manner as not to separate the relative who from its antecedent our countrymen in this way about an age or two ago this kind of wit was very much in vogue among our countrymen who did not practice it for any oblique reason but purely for the sake of being witty spectator no     we no where meet with a more glorious and pleasing show in nature than what appears in the heavens at the rising and setting of the sun which is wholly made up of these different stains of light that show themselves in clouds of a different situation which is here designed to connect with the word show as its antecedent but it stands so wide from it that without a careful attention to the sense we would be naturally led by the rules of syntax to refer it to the rising and setting of the sun or to the sun itself and hence an indistinctness is thrown over the whole sentence the following passage in bishop sherlocks sermons vol ii sermon    is still more censurable it is folly to pretend to arm ourselves against the accidents of life by heaping up treasures which nothing can protect us against but the good providence of our heavenly father which always refers grammatically to the immediately preceding substantive which here is treasures and this would make nonsense of the whole period every one feels this impropriety the sentence ought to have stood thus it is folly to pretend by heaping up treasures to arm ourselves against the accidents of life which nothing can protect us against but the good providence of our heavenly father  of the like nature is the following inaccuracy of dean swifts he is recommending to young clergymen to write their sermons fully and distinctly many says he act so directly contrary to this method that from a habit of saving time and paper which they acquired at the university they write in so diminutive a manner that they can hardly read what they have written he certainly does not mean that they had acquired time and paper at the university but that they had acquired this habit there and therefore his words ought to have run thus from a habit which they have acquired at the university of saving time and paper they write in so diminutive a manner in another passage the same author has left his meaning altogether uncertain by misplacing a relative it is in the conclusion of his letter to a member of parliament concerning the sacramental test thus i have fairly given you sir my own opinion as well as that of a great majority of both houses here relating to this weighty affair upon which i am confident you may securely reckon now i ask what it is he would have his correspondent to reckon upon securely the natural construction leads to these words this weighty affair but as it would be difficult to make any sense of this it is more probable he meant that the majority of both houses might be securely reckoned upon though certainly this meaning as the words are arranged is obscurely expressed the sentence would be amended by arranging thus thus sir i have given you my own opinion relating to this weighty affair as well as that of a great majerity of both houses here upon which i am confident you may securely reckon  several other instances might be given but i reckon those which i have produced sufficient to make the rule understood that in the construction of sentences one of the first things to be attended to is the marshalling of the words in such order as shall most clearly mark the relation of the several parts of the sentence to one another particularly that adverbs shall always be made to adhere closely to the words which they are intended to qualify that where a circumstance is thrown in it shall never hang loose in the midst of a period but be determined by its place to one or other member of it and that every relative word which is used shall instantly present its antecedent to the mind of the reader without the least obscurity i have mentioned these three cases because i think they are the most frequent occasions of ambiguity creeping into sentences  with regard to relatives i must farther observe that obscurity often arises from the too frequent repetition of them particularly of the pronouns who and they and them and theirs when we have occasion to refer to different persons as in the following sentence of archbishop tillotson vol i sermon    men look with an evil eye upon the good that is in others and think that their reputation obscures them and their commendable qualities stand in their light and therefore they do what they can to cast a cloud over them that the bright shining of their virtues may not obscure them this is altogether careless writing it renders style often obscure always embarrassed and inelegant when we find these personal pronouns crowding too fast upon us we have often no method left but to throw the whole sentence into some other form which may avoid those frequent references to persons who have before been mentioned  all languages are liable to ambiguities quinctilian gives us some instances in the latin arising from faulty arrangement a man he tells us ordered by his will to have erected for him after his death statuam auream hastam tenentem upon which arose a dispute at law whether the whole statue or the spear only was to be of gold the same author observes very properly that a sentence is always faulty when the collocation of the words is ambiguous though the sense can be gathered if any one should say chremetem audivi percussisse demeam this is ambiguous both in sense and structure whether chremes or demea gave the blow but if this expression were used se vidisse hominem librum scribentem although the meaning be clear yet quinctilian insists that the arrangement is wrong nam says he etiamsi librum ab homine scribi pateat non certe hominem a libro male tamen composuerat feceratque ambiguum quantum in ipso fuit indeed to have the relation of every word and member of a sentence marked in the most proper and distinct manner gives not clearness only but grace and beauty to a sentence making the mind pass smoothly and agreeably along all the parts of it  i proceed now to the second quality of a wellarranged sentence which i termed its unity this is a capital property in every composition of whatever kind some degree of unity is required in order to render it beautiful there must be always some connecting principle among the parts some one object must reign and be predominant this as i shall hereafter show holds in history in epic and dramatic poetry and in all orations but most of all in a single sentence is required the strictest unity for the very nature of a sentence implies one proposition to be expressed it may consist of parts indeed but these parts must be so closely bound together as to make the impression upon the mind of one object not of many now in order to preserve this unity of a sentence the following rules must be observed  in the first place during the course of the sentence the scene should be changed as little as possible we should not be hurried by sudden transitions from person to person nor from subject to subject there is commonly in every sentence some person or thing which is the governing word this should be continued so if possible from the beginning to the end of it should i express myself thus after we came to anchor they put me on shore where i was welcomed by all my friends who received me with the greatest kindness in this sentence though the objects contained in it have a sufficient connection with each other yet by this manner of representing them by shifting so often both the place and the person we and they and i and who they appear in such a disunited view that the sense of connection is almost lost the sentence is restored to its proper unity by turning it after the following manner having come to an anchor i was put on shore where i was welcomed by all my friends and received with the greatest kindness writers who transgress this rule for the most part transgress at the same time  a second rule never to crowd into one sentence things which have so little connection that they could bear to be divided into two or three sentences the violation of this rule never fails to hurt and displease a reader its effect indeed is so bad that of the two it is the safest extreme to err rather by too many short sentences than by one that is overloaded and embarrassed examples abound in authors i shall produce some to justify what i now say archbishop tillotson says an author of the history of england died in this year he was exceedingly beloved both by king william and queen mary who nominated dr tennison bishop of lincoln to succeed him who would expect the latter part of this sentence to follow in consequence of the former he was exceedingly beloved by both king and queen is the proposition of the sentence we look for some proof of this or at least something related to it to follow when we are on a sudden carried off to a new proposition who nominated dr tennison to succeed him the following is from middletons life of cicero in this uneasy state both of his public and private life cicero was oppressed by a new and cruel affliction the death of his beloved daughter tullia which happened soon after her divorce from dolabella whose manners and humors were entirely disagreeable to her the principal object in this sentence is the death of tullia which was the cause of her fathers affliction the date of it as happening soon after her divorce from dolabella may enter into the sentence with propriety but the subjunction of dolabellas character is foreign to the main object and breaks the unity and compactness of the sentence totally by setting a new picture before the reader the following sentence from a translation of plutarch is still worse their march says the author speaking of the greeks under alexander their march was through an uncultivated country whose savage inhabitants fared hardly having no other riches than a breed of lean sheep whose flesh was rank and unsavory by reason of their continual feeding upon seafish here the scene is changed upon us again and again the march of the greeks the description of the inhabitants through whose country they traveled the account of their sheep and the cause of their sheep being illtasted food form a jumble of objects slightly related to each other which the reader cannot without much difficulty comprehend under one view  these examples have been taken from sentences of no great length yet overcrowded authors who deal in long sentences are very apt to be faulty in this article one need only open lord clarendons history to find examples every where the long involved and intricate sentences of that author are the greatest blemish of his composition though in other respects as a historian he has considerable merit in later and more correct writers than lord clarendon we find a period sometimes running out so far and comprehending so many particulars as to be more properly a discourse than a sentence take for an instance the following from sir william temple in his essay upon poetry the usual acceptance takes profit and pleasure for two different things and not only calls the followers or votaries of them by the several names of busy and idle men but distinguishes the faculties of the mind that are conversant about them calling the operations of the first wisdom and of the other wit which is a saxon word used to express what the spaniards and italians call ingenio and the french esprit both from the latin though i think wit more particularly signifies that of poetry as may occur in remarks on the runic language when one arrives at the end of such a puzzled sentence he is surprised to find himself got to so great a distance from the object with which he at first set out  lord shaftsbury often betrayed into faults by his love of magnificence shall afford us the next example it is in his rhapsody where he is describing the cold regions at length says he the sun approaching melts the snow sets longing men at liberty and affords them means and time to make provision against the next return of cold this first sentence is correct enough but he goes on it breaks the icy fetters of the main where vast sea monsters pierce through floating islands with arms which can withstand the crystal rock whilst others who of themselves seem great as islands are by their bulk alone armed against all but man whose superiority over creatures of such stupendous size and force should make him mindful of his privilege of reason and force him humbly to adore the great composer of these wondrous frames and the author of his own superior wisdom nothing can be more unhappy or embarrassed than this sentence the worse too as it is intended to be descriptive where every thing should be clear it forms no distinct image whatever the it at the beginning is ambiguous whether it mean the sun or the cold the object is changed three times in the sentence beginning with the sun which breaks the icy fetters of the main then the sea monsters become the principal personages and lastly by a very unexpected transition man is brought into view and receives a long and serious admonition before the sentence closes i do not at present insist on the impropriety of such expressions as gods being the composer of frames and the sea monsters having arms that withstand rocks shaftsburys strength lay in reasoning and sentiment more than in description however much his descriptions have been sometimes admired  i shall only give one instance more on this head from dean swift in his proposal too for correcting the english language where in place of a sentence he has given a loose dissertation upon several subjects speaking of the progress of our language after the time of cromwell to this succeeded says he that licentiousness which entered with the restoration and from infecting our religion and morals fell to corrupt our language which last was not like to be much improved by those who at that time made up the court of king charles the second either such as had followed him in his banishment or who had been altogether conversant in the dialect of these fanatic times or young men who had been educated in the same country so that the court which used to be the standard of correctness and propriety of speech was then and i think has ever since continued the worst school in england for that accomplishment and so will remain till better care be taken in the education of our nobility that they may set out into the world with some foundation of literature in order to qualify them for patterns of politeness how many different facts reasonings and observations are here presented to the mind at once and yet so linked together by the author that they all make parts of a sentence which admits of no greater division in pointing than a semicolon between any of its members having mentioned pointing i shall here take notice that it is in vain to propose by arbitrary punctuation to amend the defects of a sentence to correct its ambiguity or to prevent its confusion for commas colons and points do not make the proper divisions of thought but only serve to mark those which arise from the tenor of the authors expression and therefore they are proper or not just according as they correspond to the natural divisions of the sense when they are inserted in wrong places they deserve and will meet with no regard  i proceed to a third rule for preserving the unity of sentences which is to keep clear of all parentheses in the middle of them on some occasions these may have a spirited appearance as prompted by a certain vivacity of thought which can glance happily aside as it is going along but for the most part their effect is extremely bad being a sort of wheels within wheels sentences in the midst of sentences the perplexed method of disposing of some thought which a writer wants art to introduce in its proper place it were needless to give many instances as they occur so often among incorrect writers i shall produce one from lord bolingbroke the rapidity of whose genius and manner of writing betrays him frequently into inaccuracies of this sort it is in the introduction to his idea of a patriot king where he writes thus it seems to me that in order to maintain the system of the world at a certain point far below that of ideal perfection for we are made capable of conceiving what we are incapable of attaining but however sufficient upon the whole to constitute a state easy and happy or at the worst tolerable i say it seems to me that the author of nature has thought fit to mingle from time to time among the societies of men a few and but a few of those on whom he is graciously pleased to bestow a larger portion of the ethereal spirit than is given in the ordinary course of his government to the sons of men a very bad sentence this into which by the help of a parenthesis and other interjected circumstances his lordship had contrived to thrust so many things that he is forced to begin the construction again with the phrase i say which whenever it occurs may be always assumed as a sure mark of a clumsy illconstructed sentence excusable in speaking where the greatest accuracy is not expected but in polished writing unpardonable  i shall add only one rule more for the unity of a sentence which is to bring it always to a full and perfect close every thing that is one should have a beginning a middle and an end i need not take notice that an unfinished sentence is no sentence at all according to any grammatical rule but very often we meet with sentences that are so to speak more than finished when we have arrived at what we expected was to be the conclusion when we have come to the word on which the mind is naturally led by what went before to rest unexpectedly some circumstance pops out which ought to have been omitted or to have been disposed of elsewhere but which is left lagging behind like a tail adjected to the sentence somewhat that as mr pope describes the alexandrine line like a wounded snake drags its slow length along all these adjections to the proper close disfigure a sentence extremely they give it a lame ungraceful air and in particular they break its unity dean swift for instance in his letter to a young clergyman speaking of ciceros writings expresses himself thus with these writings young divines are more conversant than with those of demosthenes who by many degrees excelled the other at least as an orator here the natural close of the sentence is at these words excelled the other these words conclude the proposition we look for no more and the circumstance added at least as an orator comes in with a very halting pace how much more compact would the sentence have been if turned thus with these writings young divines are more conversant than with those of demosthenes who by many degrees as an orator at least excelled the other in the following sentence from sir william temple the adjection to the sentence is altogether foreign to it speaking of burnets theory of the earth and fontenelles plurality of worlds the first says he could not end his learned treatise without a panegyric of modern learning in comparison of the ancient and the other falls so grossly into the censure of the old poetry and preference of the new that i could not read either of these strains without some indignation which no quality among men is so apt to raise in me as selfsufficiency the word indignation concluded the sentence the last member which no quality among men is so apt to raise in me as selfsufficiency is a proposition altogether new added after the proper close  lecture xii structure of sentences having treated of perspicuity and unity as necessary to be studied in the structure of sentences i proceed to the third quality of a correct sentence which i termed strength by this i mean such a disposition of the several words and members as shall bring out the sense to the best advantage as shall render the impression which the period is designed to make most full and complete and give every word and every member its due weight and force the two former qualities of perspicuity and unity are no doubt absolutely necessary to the production of this effect but more is still requisite for a sentence may be clear enough it may also be compact enough in all its parts or have the requisite unity and yet by some unfavourable circumstance in the structure it may fail in that strength or liveliness of impression which a more happy arrangement would have produced  the first rule which i shall give for promoting the strength of a sentence is to prune it of all redundant words these may sometimes be consistent with a considerable degree both of clearness and unity but they are always enfeebling they make the sentence move along tardy and encumbered est brevitate opus ut currat sententia neu se impediat verbis lassas onerantibus aures concise your diction let your sense be clear nor with a weight of words fatigue the ear francis  it is a general maxim that any words which do not add some importance to the meaning of a sentence always spoil it they cannot be superfluous without being hurtful obstat says quinctilian quicquid non adjuvat all that can be easily supplied in the mind is better left out in the expression thus content with deserving a triumph he refused the honor of it is better language than to say being content with deserving a triumph he refused the honor of it i consider it therefore as one of the most useful exercises of correction upon reviewing what we have written or composed to contract that roundabout method of expression and to lop off those useless excrescences which are commonly found in a first draught here a severe eye should be employed and we shall always find our sentences acquire more vigor and energy when thus retrenched provided always that we run not into the extreme of pruning so very close as to give a hardness and dryness to style for here as in all other things there is a due medium some regard though not the principal must be had to fullness and swelling of sound some leaves must be left to shelter and surround the fruit  as sentences should be cleared of redundant words so also of redundant members as every word ought to present a new idea so every member ought to contain a new thought opposed to this stands the fault we sometimes meet with of the last member of a period being no other than the echo of the former or the repetition of it in somewhat a different form for example speaking of beauty the very first discovery of it says mr addison strikes the mind with inward joy and spreads delight through all its faculties no     and elsewhere it is impossible for us to behold the divine works with coldness or indifference or to survey so many beauties without a secret satisfaction and complacency no     in both these instances little or nothing is added by the second member of the sentence to what was already expressed in the first and though the free and flowing manner of such an author as mr addison and the graceful harmony of his period may palliate such negligences yet in general it holds that style freed from this prolixity appears both more strong and more beautiful the attention becomes remiss the mind falls into inaction when words are multiplied without a corresponding multiplication of ideas  after removing superfluities the second direction i give for promoting the strength of a sentence is to attend particularly to the use of copulatives relatives and all the particles employed for transition and connection these little words but and which whose where etc are frequently the most important words of any they are the joints or hinges upon which all sentences turn and of course much both of their gracefulness and strength must depend upon such particles the varieties in using them are indeed so infinite that no particular system of rules respecting them can be given attention to the practice of the most accurate writers joined with frequent trials of the different effects produced by a different usage of those particles must here direct us on this head dr lowths short introduction to english grammar deserves to be consulted where several niceties of the language are well pointed out  some observations i shall mention which have occurred to me as useful without pretending to exhaust the subject  what is called splitting of particles or separating a preposition from the noun which it governs is always to be avoided as if i should say though virtue borrows no assistance from yet it may often be accompanied by the advantages of fortune in such instances we feel a sort of pain from the revulsion or violent separation of two things which by their nature should be closely united we are put to a stand be closely united we are put to a stand in thought being obliged to rest for a little on the preposition by itself which at the same time carries no significancy till it is joined to its proper substantive noun  some writers needlessly multiply demonstrative and relative particles by the frequent use of such phraseology as this there is nothing which disgusts us sooner than the empty pomp of language in introducing a subject or laying down a proposition to which we demand particular attention this sort of style is very proper but in the ordinary current of discourse it is better to express ourselves more simply and shortly nothing disgusts us sooner than the empty pomp of language  other writers make a practice of omitting the relative in a phrase of a different kind from the former where they think the meaning can be understood without it as the man i love  the dominions we possessed and the conquests we made but though this elliptical style be intelligible and is allowable in conversation and epistolary writing yet in all writings of a serious or dignified kind it is ungraceful there the relative should always be inserted in its proper place and the construction filled up the man whom i love  the dominions which we possessed and the conquests which we made  with regard to the copulative particle and which occurs so frequently in all kinds of composition several observations are to be made first it is evident that the unnecessary repetition of it enfeebles style it has the same sort of effect as the frequent use of the vulgar phrase and so when one is telling a story in common conversation we shall take a sentence from sir william temple for an instance he is speaking of the refinement of the french language the academy set up by cardinal richlieu to amuse the wits of that age and country and divert them from raking into his politics and ministry brought this into vogue and the french wits have for this last age been wholly turned to the refinement of their style and language and indeed with such success that it can hardly be equalled and runs equally through their verse and their prose here are no fewer than eight ands in one sentence this agreeable writer too often makes his sentences drag in this manner by a careless multiplication of copulatives it is strange how a writer so accurate as dean swift should have stumbled on so improper an application of this particle as he has made in the following sentence essay on the fates of clergymen there is no talent so useful toward rising in the world or which puts men more out of the reach of fortune than that quality generally possessed by the dullest sort of people and is in common language called discretion a species of lower prudence by the assistance of which etc by the insertion of and is in place of which is he has not only clogged the sentence but even made it ungrammatical  but in the next place it is worthy of observation that though the natural use of the conjunction and be to join objects together and thereby as one would think to make their connection more close yet in fact by dropping the conjunction we often mark a closer connection a quicker succession of objects than when it is inserted between them longinus makes this remark which from many instances appears to be just veni vidi vici i came i saw i conquered  expresses with more spirit the rapidity and quick succession of conquest than if connecting particles had been used so in the following description of a rout in caesars commentaries nostri emissis pilis gladiis rem gerunt repent post tergum equitatus cernitur cohortes aliae appropinquant hosts terga vertunt fugientibus equites occurrunt sit magna caedes bell gall l   our men after having discharged their javelins attack with sword in hand of a sudden the cavalry make their appearance behind other bodies of men are seen drawing near the enemies turn their backs the horse meet them in their flight a great slaughter ensues   hence it follows that when on the other hand we seek to prevent a quick transition from one object to another when we are making some enumeration in which we wish that the objects should appear as distinct from each other as possible and that the mind should rest for a moment on each object by itself in this case copulatives may be multiplied with peculiar advantage and grace as when lord bolingbroke says such a man might fall a victim to power but truth and reason and liberty would fall with him in the same manner caesar describes an engagement with the nervii his equitibus facile pulsis ac proturbatis incredibile celeritate ad flumen decurrerunt ut pene uno tempore et ad silvas et in flumine et jam in manibus nostris hosts viderentur bell gall l   the enemy having easily beat off and scattered this body of horse ran down with incredible celerity to the river so that almost at one moment of time they appeared to be in the woods and in the river and in the midst of our troops  here although he is describing a quick succession of events yet as it is his intention to show in how many places the enemy seemed to be at one time the copulative is very happily redoubled in order to paint more strongly the distinction of these several places  this attention to the several cases when it is proper to emit and when to redouble the copulative is of considerable importance to all who study eloquence for it is a remarkable particularity in language that the omission of a connecting particle should sometimes serve to make objects appear more closely connected and that the repetition of it should distinguish and separate them in some measure from each other hence the omission of it is used to denote rapidity and the repetition of it is designed to retard and to aggravate the reason seems to be that in the former case the mind is supposed to be hurried so fast through a quick succession of objects that it has not leisure to point out their connection it drops the copulatives in its hurry and crowds the whole series together as if it were but one object whereas when we enumerate with a view to aggravate the mind is supposed to proceed with a more slow and solemn pace it marks fully the relation of each object to that which succeeds it and by joining them together with several copulatives makes you attend that the objects though connected are yet in themselves distinct that they are many not one observe for instance in the following enumeration made by the apostle paul what additional weight and distinctness is given to each particular by the repetition of a conjunction i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god romans viii       so much with regard to the use of copulatives  i proceed to a third rule for promoting the strength of a sentence which is to dispose of the capital word or words in that place of the sentence where they will make the fullest impression that such capital words there are in every sentence on which the meaning principally rests every one must see and that these words should possess a conspicuous and distinguished place is equally plain indeed that place of the sentence where they will make the best figure whether the beginning or the end or sometimes even the middle cannot as far as i know be ascertained by any precise rule this must vary with the nature of the sentence perspicuity must ever be studied in the first place and the nature of our language allows no great liberty in the choice of collocation for the most part with us the important words are placed in the beginning of the sentence so mr addison the pleasures of the imagination taken in their full extent are not so gross as those of sense nor so refined as those of the understanding and this indeed seems the most plain and natural order to place that in the front which is the chief object of the proposition we are laying down sometimes however when we intend to give weight to a sentence it is of advantage to suspend the meaning for a little and then bring it out full at the close thus says mr pope on whatever side we contemplate homer what principally strikes us is his wonderful invention pref to homer  the greek and latin writers had a considerable advantage above us in this part of style by the great liberty of inversion which their languages permitted they could choose the most advantageous situation for every word and had it thereby in their power to give their sentences more force milton in his prose works and some other of our old english writers endeavored to imitate them in this but the forced constructions which they employed produced obscurity and the genius of our language as it is now written and spoken will not admit such liberties mr gordon who followed this inverted style in his translation of tacitus has sometimes done such violence to the language as even to appear ridiculous as in this expression into this hole thrust themselves three roman senators he has translated so simple a phrase as nullum ea tempestate bellum by war at that time there was none however within certain bounds and to a limited degree our language does admit of inversions and they are practiced with success by the best writers so mr pope speaking of homer the praise of judgment virgil has justly contested with him but his invention remains yet unrivalled it is evident that in order to give the sentence its due force by contrasting properly the two capital words judgment and invention this is a happier arrangement than if he had followed the natural order which was virgil has justly contested with him the praise of judgment but his invention remains yet unrivalled  some writers practice this degree of inversion which our language bears much more than others lord shaftsbury for instance much more than mr addison and to this sort of arrangement is owing in a great measure that appearance of strength dignity and varied harmony which lord shaftsburys style possesses this will appear from the following sentences of his enquiry into virtue where all the words are placed not strictly in the natural order but with that artificial construction which may give the period most emphasis and grace he is speaking of the misery of vice this as to the complete immoral state is what of their own accord men readily remark where there is this absolute degeneracy this total apostasy from all candor trust or equity there are few who do not see and acknowledge the misery which is consequent seldom is the case misconstrued when at worst the misfortune is that we look not on this depravity nor consider how it stands in less degrees as if to be absolutely immoral were indeed the greatest misery but to be so in a little degree should be no misery or harm at all which to allow is just as reasonable as to own that it is the greatest ill of a body to be in the utmost manner maimed or distorted but that to lose the use only of one limb or to be impaired in some single organ or member is no ill worthy the least notice vol ii p  here is no violence done to the language though there are many inversions all is stately and arranged with art which is the great characteristic of this authors style  we need only open any page of mr addison to see quite a different order in the construction of sentences our sight is the most perfect and most delightful of all our senses it fills the mind with the largest variety of ideas converses with its objects at the greatest distance and continues the longest in action without being tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments the sense of feeling can indeed give us a notion of extension shape and all other ideas that enter at the eye except colors but at the same time it is very much straitened and confined in its operations etc spectator no     in this strain he always proceeds following the most natural and obvious order of the language and if by this means he has less pomp and majesty than shaftsbury he has in return more nature more ease and simplicity which are beauties of a higher order  but whether we practice inversion or not and in whatever part of the sentence we dispose of the capital words it is always a point of great moment that these capital words shall stand clear and disentangled from any other words that would clog them thus when there are any circumstances of time place or other limitations which the principal object of our sentence requires to have connected with it we must take especial care to dispose of them so as not to cloud that principal object nor to bury it under a load of circumstances this will be made clearer by an example observe the arrangement of the following sentence in lord shaftsburys advice to an author he is speaking of modern poets as compared with the ancient if whilst they profess only to please they secretly advise and give instruction they may now perhaps as well as formerly be esteemed with justice the best and most honorable among authors this is a wellconstructed sentence it contains a great many circumstances and adverbs necessary to qualify the meaning only secretly as well perhaps now with justice formerly yet these are placed with so much art as neither to embarrass nor weaken the sentence while that which is the capital object in it viz poets being justly esteemed the best and most honorable among authors comes out in the conclusion clear and detached and possesses its proper place see now what would have been the effect of a different arrangement suppose him to have placed the members of the sentence thus if whilst they profess to please only they advise and give instruction secretly they may be esteemed the best and most honorable among authors with justice perhaps now as well as formerly here we have precisely the same words and the same sense but by means of the circumstances being so intermingled as to clog the capital words the whole becomes perplexed without grace and without strength  a fourth rule for constructing sentences with proper strength is to make the members of them go on rising and growing in their importance above one another this sort of arrangement is called a climax and is always considered as a beauty in composition from what cause it pleases is abundantly evident in all things we naturally love to ascend to what is more and more beautiful rather than to follow the retrograde order having had once some considerable object set before us it is with pain we are pulled back to attend to an inferior circumstance cavendum est says quinctilian whose authority i always willingly quote ne decrescat oration and fortiori subjungatur aliquid infirmius sicut sacrilego fur aut latroni petulans augeri enim debent sententiae and insurgere care must be taken that our composition shall not fall off and that a weaker expression shall not follow one of more strength as if after sacrilege we should bring in theft or having mentioned a robbery we should subjoin petulance sentences ought always to rise and grow  of this beauty in the construction of sentences the orations of cicero furnish many examples his pompous manner naturally led him to study it and generally in order to render the climax perfect he makes both the sense and the sound rise together with a very magnificent swell so in his oration for milo speaking of a design of clodiuss for assassinating pompey atqui si res si vir si tempus ullum dignum fuit certe haec in illa causa summa omnia fuerunt insidiator erat in foro collocatus atque in vestibulo ipso senatus ei viro autem mors parabatur cujus in vita nitebatur salus civitatis eo porro reipublicae tempore quo si unus ille occidisset non haec solum civitas sed gentes omnes concidissent the following instance from lord bolingbroke is also beautiful this decency this grace this propriety of manners to character is so essential to princes in particular that whenever it is neglected their virtues lose a great degree of luster and their defects acquire much aggravation nay more by neglecting this decency and this grace and for want of a sufficient regard to appearances even their virtues may betray them into failings their failings into vices and their vices into habits unworthy of princes and unworthy of men idea of a patriot king  i must observe however that this sort of full and oratorial climax can neither be always obtained nor ought to be always sought after only some kinds of writing admit such sentences and to study them too frequently especially if the subject require not so much pomp is affected and disagreeable but there is something approaching to a climax which it is a general rule to study ne decrescat oration as quinctilian speaks et ne fortiori subjungatur aliquid infirmius a weaker assertion or proposition should never come after a stronger one and when our sentence consists of two members the longest should generally be the concluding one there is a twofold reason for this last direction periods thus divided are pronounced more easily and the shortest member being placed first we carry it more readily in our memory as we proceed to the second and see the connection of the two more clearly thus to say when our passions have forsaken us we flatter ourselves with the belief that we have forsaken them is both more graceful and more clear than to begin with the longest part of the proposition we flatter ourselves with the belief that we have forsaken our passions when they have forsaken us in general it is always agreeable to find a sentence rising upon us and growing in its importance to the very last word when this construction can be managed without affectation or unseasonable pomp if we rise yet higher says mr addison very beautifully and consider the fixed stars as so many oceans of flame that are each of them attended with a different set of planets and still discover new firmaments and new lights that are sunk farther in those unfathomable depths of ether we are lost in such a labyrinth of suns and worlds and confounded with the magnificence and immensity of nature spect no   0 hence follows clearly  a fifth rule for the strength of sentences which is to avoid concluding them with an adverb a preposition or any inconsiderable word such conclusions are always enfeebling and degrading there are sentences indeed where the stress and significancy rest chiefly upon some words of this kind in this case they are not to be considered as circumstances but as the capital figures and ought in propriety to have the principal place allotted them no fault for instance can be found with this sentence of bolingbrokes in their prosperity my friends shall never hear of me in their adversity always where never and always being emphatical words were to be so placed as to make a strong impression but i speak now of those inferior parts of speech when introduced as circumstances or as qualifications of more important words in such case they should always be disposed of in the least conspicuous parts of the period and so classed with other words of greater dignity as to be kept in their proper secondary station  agreeably to this rule we should always avoid concluding with any of those particles which mark the cases of nouns  of to from with by for instance it is a great deal better to say avarice is a crime of which wise men are often guilty than to say avarice is a crime which wise men are often guilty of this is a phraseology which all correct writers shun and with reason for besides the want of dignity which arises from those monosyllables at the end the imagination cannot avoid resting for a little on the import of the word which closes the sentence and as those prepositions have no import of their own but only serve to point out the relations of other words it is disagreeable for the mind to be left pausing on a word which does not by itself produce any idea nor form any picture in the fancy  for the same reason verbs which are used in a compound sense with some of these prepositions are though not so bad yet still not so beautiful conclusions of a period such as bring about lay hold of come over to clear up and many other of this kind instead of which if we can employ a simple verb it always terminates the sentence with more strength even the pronoun it though it has the import of a substantive noun and indeed often forces itself upon us unavoidably yet when we want to give dignity to a sentence should if possible be avoided in the conclusion more especially when it is joined with some of the prepositions as with it in it to it in the following sentence of the spectator which otherwise is abundantly noble the bad effect of this close is sensible there is not in my opinion a more pleasing and triumphant consideration in religion than this of the perpetual progress which the soul makes toward the perfection of its nature without ever arriving at a period in it no iii how much more graceful the sentence if it had been so constructed as to close with the word period  besides particles and pronouns any phrase which expresses a circumstance only always brings up the rear of a sentence with a bad grace we may judge of this by the following sentence from lord bolingbroke letter on the state of parties at the accession of king george i let me therefore conclude by repeating that division has caused all the mischief we lament that union alone can retrieve it and that a great advance toward this union was the coalition of parties so happily begun so successfully carried on and of late so unaccountably neglected to say no worse this last phrase to say no worse occasions a sad falling off at the end so much the more unhappy as the rest of the period is conducted after the manner of a climax which we expect to find growing to the last  the proper disposition of such circumstances in a sentence is often attended with considerable trouble in order to adjust them so as shall consist equally with the perspicuity and the grace of the period though necessary parts they are however like unshapely stones in a building which try the skill of an artist where to place them with the least offense jungantur says quinctilian quo congruunt maxim sicut in structura saxorum rudium etiam ipsa enormitas invenit cui applicari et in quo possit insistere let them be inserted wherever the happiest place for them can be found as in a structure composed of rough stones there are always places where the most irregular and unshapely may find some adjacent one to which it can be joined and some basis on which it may rest   the close is always an unsuitable place for them when the sense admits it the sooner they are dispatched generally speaking the better that the more important and significant words may possess the last place quite disencumbered it is a rule too never to crowd too many circumstances together but rather to intersperse them in different parts of the sentence joined with the capital words on which they depend provided that care be taken as i before directed not to clog those capital words with them for instance when dean swift says what i had the honor of mentioning to your lordship some time ago in conversation was not a new thought letter to the earl of oxford these two circumstances sometime ago and in conversation which are here put together would have had a better effect disjoined thus what i had the honor sometime ago of mentioning to your lordship in conversation and in the following sentence of lord bolingbrokes remarks on the history of england a monarchy limited like ours may be placed for aught i know as it has been often represented just in the middle point from whence a deviation leads on the one hand to tyranny and on the other to anarchy the arrangement would have been happier thus a monarchy limited like ours may for aught i know be placed as it has often been represented just in the middle point etc  i shall give only one rule more relating to the strength of a sentence which is that in the members of a sentence where two things are compared or contrasted to one another where either a resemblance or an opposition is intended to be expressed some resemblance in the language and construction should be preserved for when the things themselves correspond to each other we naturally expect to find the words corresponding too we are disappointed when it is otherwise and the comparison or contrast appears more imperfect thus when lord bolingbroke says the laughers will be for those who have most wit the serious part of mankind for those who have most reason on their side dissert on parties pref the opposition would have been more complete if he had said the laughers will be for those who have most wit the serious for those who have most reason on their side the following passage from mr popes preface to his homer fully exemplifies the rule i am now giving homer was the greater genius virgil the better artist in the one we most admire the man in the other the work homer hurries us with a commanding impetuosity virgil leads us with an attractive majesty homer scatters with a generous profusion virgil bestows with a careful magnificence homer like the nile pours out his riches with a sudden overflow virgil like a river in its banks with a constant stream  and when we look upon their machines homer seems like his own jupiter in his terrors shaking olympus scattering the lightnings and firing the heavens virgil like the same power in his benevolence counselling with the gods laying plans for empires and ordering his whole creation  periods thus constructed when introduced with propriety and not returning too often have a sensible beauty but we must beware of carrying our attention to this beauty too far it ought only to be occasionally studied when comparison or opposition of objects naturally leads to it if such a construction as this be aimed at in all our sentences it betrays into a disagreeable uniformity produces a regularly returning clink in the period which tires the ear and plainly discovers affectation among the ancients the style of isocrates is faulty in this respect and on that account by some of their best critics particularly by dionysius of halicarnassus he is severely censured  this finishes what i had to say concerning sentences considered with respect to their meaning under the three heads of perspicuity unity and strength it is a subject on which i have insisted fully for two reasons first because it is a subject which by its nature can be rendered more didactic and subjected more to precise rule than many other subjects of criticism and next because it appears to me of considerable importance and use  for though many of those attentions which i have been recommending may appear minute yet their effect upon writing and style is much greater than might at first be imagined a sentiment which is expressed in a period clearly neatly and happily arranged makes always a stronger impression on the mind than one that is any how feeble or embarrassed every one feels this upon a comparison and if the effect be sensible in one sentence how much more in a whole discourse or composition that is made up of such sentences  the fundamental rule of the construction of sentences and into which all others might be resolved undoubtedly is to communicate in the clearest and most natural order the ideas which we mean to transfuse into the minds of others every arrangement that does most justice to the sense and expresses it to most advantage strikes us as beautiful to this point have tended all the rules i have given and indeed did men always think clearly and were they at the same time fully masters of the language in which they write there would be occasion for few rules their sentences would then of course acquire all those properties of precision unity and strength which i have recommended for we may rest assured that whenever we express ourselves ill there is besides the mismanagement of language for the most part some mistake in our manner of conceiving the subject embarrassed obscure and feeble sentences are generally if not always the result of embarrassed obscure and feeble thought thought and language act and react upon each other mutually logic and rhetoric have here as in many other cases a strict connection and he that is learning to arrange his sentences with accuracy and order is learning at the same time to think with accuracy and order an observation which alone will justify all the care and attention we have bestowed on this subject  lecture xiii structure of sentences  harmony hitherto we have considered sentences with respect to their meaning under the heads of perspicuity unity and strength we are now to consider them with respect to their sound their harmony or agreeableness to the ear which was the last quality belonging to them that i proposed to treat of  sound is a quality much inferior to sense yet such as must not be disregarded for as long as sounds are the vehicle of conveyance for our ideas there will be always a very considerable connection between the idea which is conveyed and the nature of the sound which conveys it pleasing ideas can hardly be transmitted to the mind by means of harsh and disagreeable sounds the imagination revolts as soon as it hears them uttered nihil says quinctilian potest intrare in affectum quod in aure velut quodam vestibulo statim offendit nothing can enter into the affections which stumbles at the threshold by offending the ear  music has naturally a great power over all men to prompt and facilitate certain emotions insomuch that there are hardly any dispositions which we wish to raise in others but certain sounds may be found concordant to those dispositions and tending to promote them now language can in some degree be rendered capable of this power of music a circumstance which must needs heighten our idea of language as a wonderful invention not content with simply interpreting our ideas to others it can give them those ideas enforced by corresponding sounds and to the pleasure of communicated thought can add the new and separate pleasure of melody  in the harmony of periods two things may be considered first agreeable sound or modulation in general without any particular expression next the sound so ordered as to become expressive of the sense the first is the more common the second the higher beauty  first let us consider agreeable sound in general as the property of a wellconstructed sentence and as it was of prose sentences we have hitherto treated we shall confine ourselves to them under this head this beauty of musical construction in prose it is plain will depend upon two things the choice of words and the arrangement of them  i begin with the choice of words on which head there is not much to be said unless i were to descend into a tedious and frivolous detail concerning the powers of the several letters or simple sounds of which speech is composed it is evident that words are most agreeable to the ear which are composed of smooth and liquid sounds where there is a proper intermixture of vowels and consonants without too many harsh consonants rubbing against each other or too many open vowels in succession to cause a hiatus or disagreeable aperture of the mouth it may always be assumed as a principle that whatever sounds are difficult in pronunciation are in the same proportion harsh and painful to the ear vowels give softness consonants strength to the sound of words the music of language requires a just proportion of both and will be hurt will be rendered either grating or effeminate by an excess of either long words are commonly more agreeable to the ear than monosyllables they please it by the composition or succession of sounds which they present to it and accordingly the most musical languages abound most in them among words of any length those are the most musical which do not run wholly either upon long or short syllables but are composed of an intermixture of them such as repent produce velocity celerity independent impetuosity  the next head respecting the harmony which results from a proper arrangement of the words and members of a period is more complex and of greater nicety for let the words themselves be ever so well chosen and well sounding yet if they be ill disposed the music of the sentence is utterly lost in the harmonious structure and disposition of periods no writer whatever ancient or modern equals cicero he had studied this with care and was fond perhaps to excess of what he calls the plena ac numerosa oration we need only open his writings to find instances that will render the effect of musical language sensible to every ear what for example can be more full round and swelling than the following sentence of the  th oration against catiline cogitate quantis laboribus fundatum imperium quanta virtute stabilitam libertatem quanta deorum benignitate auctas exaggeratasque fortunas una nox pene delerit in english we may take for an instance of a musical sentence the following from milton in his treatise on education we shall conduct you to a hillside laborious indeed at the first ascent but else so smooth so green so full of goodly prospects and melodious sounds on every side that the harp of orpheus was not more charming every thing in this sentence conspires to promote the harmony the words are happily chosen full of liquids and soft sounds laborious smooth green goodly melodious charming and these words so artfully arranged that were we to alter the collocation of any one of them we should presently be sensible of the melody suffering for let us observe how finely the members of the period swell one above another so smooth so green  so full of goodly prospects  and melodious sounds on every side  till the ear prepared by this gradual rise is conducted to that full close on which it rests with pleasure  that the harp of orpheus was not more charming  the structure of periods then being susceptible of a melody very sensible to the ear our next enquiry should be how this melodious structure is formed what are the principles of it and by what laws is it regulated and upon this subject were i to follow the ancient rhetoricians it would be easy to give a great variety of rules for here they have entered into a minute and particular detail more particular indeed than on any other head that regards language they hold that to prose as well as to verse there belong certain numbers less strict indeed yet such as can be ascertained by rule they go so far as to specify the feet as they are called that is the succession of long and short syllables which should enter into the different members of a sentence and to show what the effect of each of these will be wherever they treat of the structure of sentences it is always the music of them that makes the principal object cicero and quinctilian are full of this the other qualities of precision unity and strength which we consider as of chief importance they handle slightly but when they come to the  junctura et numerus the modulation and harmony there they are copious dionysius of halicarnassus one of the most judicious critics of antiquity has written a treatise on the composition of words in a sentence which is altogether confined to their musical effect he makes the excellency of a sentence to consist in four things first in the sweetness of single sounds secondly in the composition of sounds that is the numbers or feet thirdly in change or variety of sound and fourthly in sound suited to the sense on all these points he writes with great accuracy and refinement and is very worthy of being consulted though were one now to write a book on the structure of sentences we should expect to find the subject treated of in a more extensive manner  in modern times this whole subject of the musical structure of discourse it is plain has been much less studied and indeed for several reasons can be much less subjected to rule the reasons it will be necessary to give both to justify my not following the tract of the ancient rhetoricians on this subject and to show how it has come to pass that a part of composition which once made so conspicuous a figure now draws much less attention  in the first place the ancient languages i mean the greek and the roman were much more susceptible than ours of the graces and the powers of melody the quantities of their syllables were more fixed and determined their words were longer and more sonorous their method of varying the terminations of nouns and verbs both introduced a greater variety of liquid sounds and freed them from that multiplicity of little auxiliary words which we are obliged to employ and what is of the greatest consequence the inversions which their languages allowed gave them the power of placing their words in whatever order was most suited to a musical arrangement all these were great advantages which they enjoyed above us for harmony of period  in the next place the greeks and romans the former especially were in truth much more musical nations than we their genius was more turned to delight in the melody of speech music is known to have been a more extensive art among them than it is with us more universally studied and applied to a greater variety of objects several learned men particularly the abbe du bos in his reflections on poetry and painting have clearly proved that the theatrical compositions of the ancients both their tragedies and comedies were set to a kind of music whence the modos fecit and the tibiis dextris et sinistris prefixed to the editions of terences plays all sort of declamation and public speaking was carried on by them in a much more musical tone than it is among us it approached to a kind of chanting or recitative among the athenians there was what was called the nomic melody or a particular measure prescribed to the public officers in which they were to promulgate the laws to the people lest by reading them with improper tones the laws might be exposed to contempt among the romans there is a noted story of c gracchus when he was declaiming in public having a musician standing at his back in order to give him the proper tones with a pipe or flute even when pronouncing those terrible tribunitial harangues by which he inflamed the one half of the citizens of rome against the other this attention to the music of speech was in those times it seems thought necessary to success quinctilian though he condemns the excess of this sort of pronunciation yet allows a cantus obscurior to be a beauty in a public speaker hence that variety of accents acute grave and circumflex which we find marked upon the greek syllables to express not the quantity of them but the tone in which they were to be spoken the application of which is now wholly unknown to us and though the romans did not mark those accents in their writing yet it appears from quinctilian that they used them in pronunciation  quantum quale says he comparantes gravi interrogantes acuto tenore concludunt as music then was an object much more attended to in speech among the greeks and romans than it is with us as in all kinds of public speaking they employed a much greater variety of notes of tones or inflexions of voice than we use this is one clear reason of their paying a greater attention to that construction of sentences which might best suit this musical pronunciation  it is farther known that in consequence of the genius of their languages and of their manner of pronouncing them the musical arrangement of sentences did in fact produce a greater effect in public speaking among them than it could possibly do in any modern oration another reason why it deserved to be more studied cicero in his treatise entitled orator tells us conciones saepe exclamare vidi cum verba apt cecidissent id enim expectant aures i have often been witness to bursts of exclamation in the public assemblies when sentences closed musically for that is a pleasure which the ear expects  and he gives a remarkable instance of the effect of a harmonious period upon a whole assembly from a sentence of one of carbos orations spoken in his hearing the sentence was patris dictum sapiens temeritas filii comprobavit by means of the sound of which alone he tells us tantus clamor concionis excitatus est ut prorsus admirabile esset he makes us remark the feet of which these words consist to which he ascribes the power of the melody and shows how by altering the collocation the whole effect would be lost as thus patris dictum sapiens comprobravit temeritas filii now though it be true that carbos sentence is extremely musical and would be agreeable at this day to any audience yet i cannot believe that an english sentence equally harmonious would by its harmony alone produce any such effect on a british audience or excite any such wonderful applause and admiration as cicero informs us this of carbo produced our northern ears are too coarse and obtuse the melody of speech has less power over us and by our simpler and plainer method of uttering words speech is in truth accompanied with less melody than it was among the greeks and romans in versu quidem theatra tota exclamant si fuit una syllaba aut brevior aut longior nec vero multitudo pedes novit nec ullos numeros tenet nec illud quod offendit aut cur aut in quo offendat intelligit et tamen omnium longitudinum et brevitatum in sonis sicut acutarum graviumque vocum judicium ipsa natura in auribus nostris collocavit cicero orator c      for these reasons i am of opinion that it is in vain to think of bestowing the same attention upon the harmonious structure of our sentences that was bestowed by these ancient nations the doctrine of the greek and roman critics on this head has misled some to imagine that it might be equally applied to our tongue and that our prose writing might be regulated by spondees and trochees and iambuss and poeons and other metrical feet but first our words cannot be measured or at least can be measured very imperfectly by any feet of this kind for the quantity the length and shortness of our syllables is not by any means so fixed and subjected to rule as in the greek and roman tongues but very often left arbitrary and determined by the emphasis and the sense next though our prose could admit of such metrical regulation yet from our plainer method of pronouncing all sort of discourse the effect would not be at all so sensible to the ear nor be relished with so much pleasure as among the greeks and romans and lastly this whole doctrine about the measures and numbers of prose even as it is delivered by the ancient rhetoricians themselves is in truth in a great measure loose and uncertain it appears indeed that the melody of discourse was a matter of infinitely more attention to them than ever it has been to the moderns but though they write a great deal about it they have never been able to reduce it to any rules which could be of real use in practice if we consult ciceros orator where this point is discussed with the most minuteness we will see how much these ancient critics differed from one another about the feet proper for the conclusion and other parts of a sentence and how much after all was left to the judgment of the ear nor indeed is it possible to give precise rules concerning this matter in any language as all prose composition must be allowed to run loose in its numbers and according as the tenor of a discourse varies the modulation of sentences must vary infinitely  but although i apprehend that this musical arrangement cannot be reduced into a system i am far from thinking that it is a quality to be neglected in composition on the contrary i hold its effect to be very considerable and that every one who studies to write with grace much more who seeks to pronounce in public with success will be obliged to attend to it not a little but it is his ear cultivated by attention and practice that must chiefly direct him for any rules that can be given on this subject are very general some rules however there are which may be of use to form the ear to the proper harmony of discourse i proceed to mention such as appear to me most material  there are two things on which the music of a sentence chiefly depends these are the proper distribution of the several members of it and the close or cadence of the whole  first i say the distribution of the several members is to be carefully attended to it is of importance to observe that whatever is easy and agreeable to the organs of speech always sounds grateful to the ear while a period is going on the termination of each of its members forms a pause or rest in pronouncing and these rests should be so distributed as to make the course of the breathing easy and at the same time should fall at such distances as to bear a certain musical proportion to each other this will be best illustrated by examples the following sentence is from archbishop tillotson this discourse concerning the easiness of gods commands does all along suppose and acknowledge the difficulties of the first entrance upon a religious course except only in those persons who have had the happiness to be trained up to religion by the easy and insensible degrees of a pious and virtuous education here there is no harmony nay there is some degree of harshness and unpleasantness owing principally to this that there is properly no more than one pause or rest in the sentence falling betwixt the two members into which it is divided each of which is so long as to occasion a considerable stretch of the breath in pronouncing it  observe now on the other hand the ease with which the following sentence from sir william temple glides along and the graceful intervals at which the pauses are placed he is speaking sarcastically of man but god be thanked his pride is greater than his ignorance and what he wants in knowledge he supplies by sufficiency when he has looked about him as far as he can he concludes there is no more to be seen when he is at the end of his line he is at the bottom of the ocean when he has shot his best he is sure none ever did or ever can shoot better or beyond it his own reason he holds to be the certain measure of truth and his own knowledge of what is possible in nature or this instance  he is addressing himself to lady essex upon the death of her child i was once in hope that what was so violent could not be long but when i observed your grief to grow stronger with age and to increase like a stream the farther it ran when i saw it draw out to such unhappy consequences and to threaten no less than your child your health and your life i could no longer forbear this endeavor nor end it without begging of you for gods sake and for your own for your children and your friends your country and your family that you would no longer abandon yourself to a disconsolate passion but that you would at length awaken your piety give way to your prudence or at least rouse the invincible spirit of the percys that never yet shrunk at any disaster  here every thing is at once easy to the breath and grateful to the ear and it is this sort of flowing measure this regular and proportional division of the members of his sentences which renders sir william temples style always agreeable i must observe at the same time that a sentence with too many rests and these placed at intervals too apparently measured and regular is apt to savor of affectation  the next thing to be attended to is the close or cadence of the whole sentence which as it is always the part most sensible to the ear demands the greatest care so quinctilian non igitur durum sit neque abruptum quo animi velut respirant ac reficiuntur haec est seeds orationis hoc auditor expectat his laus omnis declamat let there be nothing rash or abrupt in the conclusion of the sentence on which the mind pauses and rests this is the most material part in the structure of discourse here every hearer expects to be gratified here his applause breaks forth  the only important rule that can be given here is that when we aim at dignity or elevation the sound should be made to grow to the last the longest members of the period and the fullest and most sonorous words should be reserved to the conclusion as an example of this the following sentence of mr addisons may be given it fills the mind speaking of sight with the largest variety of ideas converses with its objects at the greatest distance and continues the longest in action without being tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments every reader must be sensible of a beauty here both in the proper division of the members and pauses and the manner in which the sentence is rounded and conducted to a full and harmonious close  the same holds in melody that i observed to take place with respect to significancy that a falling off at the end always hurts greatly for this reason particles pronouns and little words are as ungracious to the ear at the conclusion as i formerly showed they were inconsistent with strength of expression it is more than probable that the sense and the sound have here a mutual influence on each other that which hurts the ear seems to mar the strength of the meaning and that which really degrades the sense in consequence of this primary effect appears also to have a bad sound how disagreeable is the following sentence of an author speaking of the trinity it is a mystery which we firmly believe the truth of and humbly adore the depth of and how easily could it have been mended by this transposition it is a mystery the truth of which we firmly believe and the depth of which we humbly adore in general it seems to hold that a musical close in our language requires either the last syllable or the penult that is the last but one to be a long syllable words which consist mostly of short syllables as contrary particular retrospect seldom conclude a sentence harmoniously unless a run of long syllables before has rendered them agreeable to the ear  it is necessary however to observe that sentences so constructed as to make the sound always swell and grow toward the end and to rest either on a long or a penult long syllable give a discourse the tone of declamation the ear soon becomes acquainted with the melody and is apt to be cloyed with it if we would keep up the attention of the reader or hearer if we would preserve vivacity and strength in our composition we must be very attentive to vary our measures this regards the distribution of the members as well as the cadence of the period sentences constructed in a similar manner with the pauses falling at equal intervals should never follow one another short sentences should be intermixed with long and swelling ones to render discourse sprightly as well as magnificent even discords properly introduced abrupt sounds departures from regular cadence have sometimes a good effect monotony is the great fault into which writers are apt to fall who are fond of harmonious arrangement and to have only one tune or measure is not much better than having none at all a very vulgar ear will enable a writer to catch some one melody and to form the run of his sentences according to it which soon proves disgusting but a just and correct ear is requisite for varying and diversifying the melody and hence we so seldom meet with authors who are remarkably happy in this respect  though attention to the music of sentences must not be neglected yet it must also be kept within proper bounds for all appearances of an authors affecting harmony are disagreeable especially when the love of it betrays him so far as to sacrifice in any instance perspicuity precision or strength of sentiment to sound all unmeaning words introduced merely to round the period or fill up the melody complementa numerorum as cicero calls them are great blemishes in writing they are childish and puerile ornaments by which a sentence always loses more in point of weight than it can gain by such additions to the beauty of its sound sense has its own harmony as well as sound and where the sense of a period is expressed with clearness force and dignity it will seldom happen but the words will strike the ear agreeably at least a very moderate attention is all that is requisite for making the cadence of such a period pleasing and the effect of greater attention is often no other than to render composition languid and enervated after all the labor which quinctilian bestows on regulating the measures of prose he comes at last with his usual good sense to this conclusion in universum si sit necesse duram potius atque asperam compositionem malim esse quam effeminatam ac enervem qualis apud multos ideoque vincta quaedam de industria sunt solvenda ne laborata videantur neque ullum idoneum aut aptum verbum praetermittamus gratia lenitatis upon the whole i would rather choose that composition should appear rough and harsh if that be necessary than that it should be enervated and effeminate such as we find the style of too many some sentences therefore which we have studiously formed into melody should be thrown loose that they may not seem too much labored nor ought we ever to omit any proper or expressive word for the sake of smoothing a period  lib ix c    cicero as i before observed is one of the most remarkable patterns of a harmonious style his love of it however is too visible and the pomp of his numbers sometimes detracts from his strength that noted close of his esse videatur which in the oration pro lege manilia occurs eleven times exposed him to censure among his cotemporaries we must observe hewever in defense of this great orator that there is a remarkable union in his style of harmony with ease which is always a great beauty and if his harmony be sometimes thought studied that study appears to have cost him little trouble  among our english classics not many are distinguished for musical arrangement milton in some of his prose works has very finely turned periods but the writers of his age indulged a liberty of inversion which now would be reckoned contrary to purity of style and though this allowed their sentences to be more stately and sonorous yet it gave them too much of a latinized construction and order of later writers shaftsbury is upon the whole the most correct in his numbers as his ear was delicate he has attended to music in all his sentences and he is peculiarly happy in this respect that he has avoided the monotony into which writers who study the grace of sound are very apt to fall having diversified his periods with great variety mr addison has also much harmony in his style more easy and smooth but less varied than lord shaftsbury sir william temple is in general very flowing and agreeable archbishop tillotson is too often careless and languid and is much outdone by bishop atterbury in the music of his periods dean swift despised musical arrangement altogether  hither to i have discoursed of agreeable sound or modulation in general it yet remains to treat of a higher beauty of this kind the sound adapted to the sense the former was no more than a simple accompaniment to please the ear the latter supposes a peculiar expression given to the music we may remark two degrees of it first the current of sound adapted to the tenor of a discourse next a particular resemblance effected between some object and the sounds that are employed in describing it  first i say the current of sound may be adapted to the tenor of a discourse sounds have in many respects a correspondence with our ideas partly natural partly the effect of artificial associations hence it happens that any one modulation of sound continued imprints on our style a certain character and expression sentences constructed with the ciceronian fullness and swell produce the impression of what is important magnificent sedate for this is the natural tone which such a course of sentiment assumes but they suit no violent passion no eager reasoning no familiar address these always require measures brisker easier and often more abrupt and therefore to swell or to let down the periods as the subject demands is a very important rule in oratory no one tenor whatever supposing it to produce no bad effect from satiety will answer to all different compositions nor even to all the parts of the same composition it were as absurd to write a panegyric and an invective in a style of the same cadence as to set the words of a tender lovesong to the air of a warlike march  observe how finely the following sentence of cicero is adapted to represent the tranquillity and ease of a satisfied state etsi homini nihil est magis optandum quam prospera aequabilis perpetuaque fortuna secundo vitae sine ulla offensione cursu tamen si mihi tranquilla et placata omnia fuissent incredibili quadam et pene divina qua nunc vestro beneficio fruor laetitiae voluptate caruissem orat ad quirites post reditum  nothing was ever more perfect in its kind it paints if we may so speak to the ear but who would not have laughed if cicero had employed such periods or such a cadence as this in inveighing against mark antony or catiline what is requisite therefore is that we previously fix in our mind a just idea of the general tone of sound which suits our subject that is which the sentiments we are to express most naturally assume and in which they most commonly vent themselves whether round and smooth or stately and solemn or brisk and quick or interrupted and abrupt this general idea must direct the run of our composition to speak in the style of music must give us the key note must form the ground of the melody varied and diversified in parts according as either our sentiments are diversified or as is requisite for producing a suitable variety to gratify the car  it may be proper to remark that our translators of the bible have often been happy in suiting their numbers to the subject grave solemn and majestic subjects undoubtedly require such an arrangement of words as runs much on long syllables and particularly they require the close to rest upon such the very first verses of the bible are remarkable for this melody in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved on the face of the waters several other passages particularly some of the psalms afford striking examples of this sort of grave melodious construction any composition that rises considerably above the ordinary tone of prose such as monumental inscriptions and panegyrical characters naturally runs into numbers of this kind  but in the next place besides the general correspondence of the current of sound with the current of thought there may be a more particular expression attempted of certain objects by means of resembling sounds this can be sometimes accomplished in prose composition but there only in a more faint degree nor is it so much expected there in poetry chiefly it is looked for where attention to sound is more demanded and where the inversions and liberties of poetical style give us a greater command of sound assisted too by the versification and that cantus obscurior to which we are naturally led in reading poetry this requires a little more illustration  the sounds of words may be employed for representing chiefly three classes of objects first other sounds secondly motion and thirdly the emotions and passions of the mind  first i say by a proper choice of words we may produce a resemblance of other sounds which we mean to describe such as the noise of waters the roaring of winds or the murmuring of streams this is the simplest instance of this sort of beauty for the medium through which we imitate here is a natural one sounds represented by other sounds and between ideas of the same sense it is easy to form a connection no very great art is required in a poet when he is describing sweet and soft sounds to make use of such words as have most liquids and vowels and glide the softest or when he is describing harsh sounds to throw together a number of harsh syllables which are of difficult pronunciation here the common structure of language assists him for it will be found that in most languages the names of many particular sounds are so formed as to carry some affinity to the sound which they signify as with us the whistling of winds the buz and hum of insects the hiss of serpents the crash of falling timber and many other instances where the word has been plainly framed upon the sound it represents i shall produce a remarkable example of this beauty from milton taken from two passages in paradise lost describing the sound made in the one by the opening of the gates of hell in the other by the opening of those of heaven the contrast between the two displays to great advantage the poets art the first is the opening of hells gates  on a sudden open fly with impetuous recoil and jarring sound the infernal doors and on their hinges grate harsh thunder  b i observe now the smoothness of the other  heaven opened wide her everduring gates harmonious ound on golden hinges turning  b ii the following beautiful passage from tassos gierusalemme has been often admired on account of the imitation effected by sound of the thing represented chiama gli habitator de lombre eterne il rauco suon de la tartarea tromba treman le spaciose atre caverne et laer cieco a quel rumor rimbomba ni stridendo cosi de la superne regioni dele cielo il folgor piomba ne si scossa giammai la terra quand i vapori in sen gravida serra cant iv stanz    the second class of objects which the sound of words is often employed to imitate is motion as it is swift or slow violent or gentle equable or interrupted easy or accompanied with effort though there be no natural affinity between sound of any kind and motion yet in the imagination there is a strong one as appears from the connection between music and dancing and therefore here it is in the poets power to give us a lively idea of the kind of motion he would describe by means of sounds which correspond in our imagination with that motion long syllables naturally give the impression of slow motion as in this line of virgil olli inter sese magna vi brachia tollunt a succession of short syllables presents quick motion to the mind as quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum   both homer and virgil are great masters of this beauty and their works abound with instances of it most of them indeed so often quoted and so well known that it is needless to produce them i shall give one instance in english which seems happy it is the description of a sudden calm on the seas in a poem entitled the fleece  with easy course the vessels glide unless their speed be stopped by dead calms that often lie on these smooth seas when every zephyr sleeps then the shrouds drop the downy feather on the cordage hung moves not the flat sea shines like yellow gold fusd in the fire or like the marble floor of some old temple wide    the third set of objects which i mentioned the sound of words as capable of representing consists of the passions and emotions of the mind sound may at first view appear foreign to these but that here also there is some sort of connection is sufficiently proved by the power which music has to awaken or to assist certain passions and according as its strain is varied to introduce one train of ideas rather than another this indeed logically speaking cannot be called a resemblance between the sense and the sound seeing long or short syllables have no natural resemblance to any thought or passion but if the arrangement of syllables by their sound alone recall one set of ideas more readily than another and dispose the mind for entering into that affection which the poet means to raise such arrangement may justly enough be said to resemble the sense or be similar and correspondent to it i admit that in many instances which are supposed to display this beauty of accommodation of sound to the sense there is much room for imagination to work and according as a reader is struck by a passage he will often fancy a resemblance between the sound and the sense which others cannot discover he modulates the numbers to his own disposition of mind and in effect makes the music which he imagines himself to hear however that there are real instances of this kind and that poetry is capable of some such expression cannot be doubted drydens ode on st cecilias day affords a very beautiful exemplification of it in the english language without much study or reflection a poet describing pleasure joy and agreeable objects from the feeling of his subject naturally runs into smooth liquid and flowing numbers  namque ipsa decoram caesariem nato genetrix lumenque juventae purpureum et laetos oculis afflarat honores aen i or devenere locos laetos and amaena vireta fortunatorum nemorum sedesque beatas largior hic campos ether and lumine vestit purpureo solemque suum sua sidera norant aen vi brisk and lively sensations exact quicker and more animated numbers  juvenum manus emicat ardens littus in hesperium aen vii melancholy and gloomy subjects naturally express themselves in slow measures and long words in those deep solitudes and awful cells where heavenly pensive contemplation dwells et caligantem nigra formidine lucum   i have now given sufficient openings into this subject a moderate acquaintance with the good poets either ancient or modern will suggest many instances of the same kind and with this i finish the discussion of the structure of sentences having fully considered them under all the heads i mentioned of perspicuity unity strength and musical arrangement  lecture xiv origin and nature of figurative language having now finished what related to the construction of sentences i proceed to other rules concerning style my general division of the qualities of style was into perspicuity and ornament perspicuity both in single words and in sentences i have considered ornament as far as it arises from a graceful strong or melodious construction of words has also been treated of another and a great branch of the ornament of style is figurative language which is now to be the subject of our consideration and will require a full discussion  our first enquiry must be what is meant by figures of speech on the subject of figures of speech all the writers who treat of rhetoric or composition have insisted largely to make references therefore on this subject were endless on the foundations of figurative language in general one of the most sensible and instructive writers appears to me to be m marsais in his traite des tropes pour servir d introduction a la rhetorique and a la logique for observations on particular figures the elements of criticism may be consulted where the subject is fully handled and illustrated by a great variety of examples   in general they always imply some departure from simplicity of expression the idea which we intend to convey not only enunciated to others but enunciated in a particular manner and with some circumstance added which is designed to render the impression more strong and vivid when i say for instance that a good man enjoys comfort in the midst of adversity i just express my thought in the simplest manner possible but when i say to the upright there arises light in darkness the same sentiment is expressed in a figurative style a new circumstance is introduced light is put in the place of comfort and darkness is used to suggest the idea of adversity in the same manner to say it is impossible by any search we can make to explore the divine nature fully is to make a simple proposition but when we say can thou by searching find out god can thou find out the almighty to perfection it is high as heaven what can thou do deeper than hell what can thou know this introduces a figure into style the proposition being not only expressed but admiration and astonishment being expressed together with it  but though figures imply a deviation from what may be reckoned the most simple form of speech we are not thence to conclude that they imply any thing uncommon or unnatural this is so far from being the case that on very many occasions they are both the most natural and the most common method of uttering our sentiments it is impossible to compose any discourse without using them often nay there are few sentences of any length in which some expression or other that may be termed a figure does not occur from what causes this happens shall be afterward explained the fact in the mean time shows that they are to be accounted part of that language which nature dictates to men they are not the invention of the schools nor the mere product of study on the contrary the most illiterate speak in figures as often as the most learned whenever the imaginations of the vulgar are much awakened or their passions inflamed against one another they will pour forth a torrent of figurative language as forcible as could be employed by the most artifical declaimer  what then is it which has drawn the attention of critics and rhetoricians so much to these forms of speech it is this they remarked that in them consists much of the beauty and the force of language and found them always to bear some characters or distinguishing marks by the help of which they could reduce them under separate classes and heads to this perhaps they owe their name of figures as the figure or shape of one body distinguishes it from another so these forms of speech have each of them a cast or turn peculiar to itself which both distinguishes it from the rest and distinguishes it from simple expression simple expression just makes our idea known to others but figurative language over and above bestows a particular dress upon that idea a dress which both makes it be remarked and adorns it hence this sort of language became early a capital object of attention to those who studied the powers of speech  figures in general may be described to be that language which is prompted either by the imagination or by the passions the justness of this description will appear from the more particular account i am afterward to give of them rhetoricians commonly divide them into two great classes figures of words and figures of thought the former figures of words are commonly called tropes and consist in a words being employed to signify something that is different from its original and primitive meaning so that if you alter the word you destroy the figure thus in the instance i gave before light arises to the upright in darkness the trope consists in light and darkness being not meant literally but substituted for comfort and adversity on account of some resemblance or analogy which they are supposed to bear to these conditions of life the other class termed figures of thought supposes the words to be used in their proper and literal meaning and the figure to consist in the turn of the thought as is the case in exclamations interrogations apostrophes and comparisons where though you vary the words that are used or translate them from one language into another you may nevertheless still preserve the same figure in the thought this distinction however is of no great use as nothing can be built upon it in practice neither is it always very clear it is of little importance whether we give to some particular mode of expression the name of a trope or of a figure provided we remember that figurative language always imports some coloring of the imagination or some emotion of passion expressed in our style and perhaps figures of imagination and figures of passion might be a more useful distribution of the subject but without insisting on any artificial divisions it will be more useful that i enquire into the origin and the nature of figures only before proceeding to this there are two general observations which it may be proper to premise  the first is concerning the use of rules with respect to figurative language i admit that persons may both speak and write with propriety who know not the names of any of the figures of speech nor ever studied any rules relating to them nature as was before observed dictates the use of figures and like mons jourdain in moliere who had spoken for forty years in prose without ever knowing it many a one uses metaphorical expressions to good purpose without any idea of what a metaphor is it will not however follow thence that rules are of no service all science arises from observations on practice practice has always gone before method and rule but method and rule have afterward improved and perfected practice in every art we every day meet with persons who sing agreeably without knowing one note of the gamut yet it has been found of importance to reduce these notes to a scale and to form an art of music and it would be ridiculous to pretend that the art is of no advantage because the practice is founded in nature propriety and beauty of speech are certainly as improveable as the ear or the voice and to know the principles of this beauty or the reasons which render one figure or one manner of speech preferable to another cannot fail to assist and direct a proper choice  but i must observe in the next place that although this part of style merit attention and be a very proper object of science and rule although much of the beauty of composition depends on figurative language yet we must beware of imagining that it depends solely or even chiefly upon such language it is not so the great place which the doctrine of tropes and figures has occupied in systems of rhetoric the overanxious care which has been shown in giving names to a vast variety of them and in ranging them under different classes has often led persons to imagine that if their composition was well bespangled with a number of these ornaments of speech it wanted no other beauty whence has arisen much stiffness and affectation for it is in truth the sentiment or passion which lies under the figured expression that gives it any merit the figure is only the dress the sentiment is the body and the substance no figures will render a cold or an empty composition interesting whereas if a sentiment be sublime or pathetic it can support itself perfectly well without any borrowed assistance hence several of the most affecting and admired passages of the best authors are expressed in the simplest language the following sentiment from virgil for instance makes its way at once to the heart without the help of any figure whatever he is describing an argive who falls in battle in italy at a great distance from his native country sternitur infelix alieno vulnere coelumque aspicit et dulces moriens reminiscitur argos anthares had from argos traveled far alcides friend and brother of the war now falling by anothers wound his eyes he casts to heaven on argos thinks and dies in this translation much of the beauty of the original is lost on argos thinks and dies is by no means equal to dulces moriens reminiscitur argos as he dies he remembers his beloved argos  it is indeed observable that in most of those tender and pathetic passages which do so much honor to virgil that great poet expresses himself with the utmost simplicity as te dulcis conjux te solo in littore secum te veniente die te decedente canebat georg iv and so in that moving prayer of evander upon his parting with his son pallas at vos o superi et divum tu maxim rector jupiter arcadii quaeso miserescite regis et patrias audite preces si numina vestra incolumem pallanta mihi si fata reservant si visurus eum vivo et venturus in unum vitam oro patiar quemvis durare laborem sin aliquem insandum casum fortuna minaris nunc o nunc liceat crudelem abrumpere vitam dum curae ambiguae dum spes incerta futuri dum te chare puer mea sera et sola voluptas amplexu teneo gravior ne nuncius aures vulneret  aen viii      aen x     a single stroke of this kind drawn as by the very pencil of nature is worth a thousand figures in the same manner the simple style of scripture he spoke and it was done he commanded and it stood fast  god said let there be light and there was light imports a lofty conception to much greater advantage than if it had been decorated by the most pompous metaphors the fact is that the strong pathetic and the pure sublime not only have little dependence on figures of speech but generally reject them the proper region of these ornaments is where a moderate degree of elevation and passion is predominant and there they contribute to the embellishment of discourse only when there is a basis of solid thought and natural sentiment when they are inserted in their proper place and when they rise of themselves from the subject without being sought after  having premised these observations i proceed to give an account of the origin and nature of figures principally of such as have their dependence on language including that numerous tribe which the rhetoricians call tropes  at the first rise of language men would begin with giving names to the different objects which they discerned or thought of this nomenclature would at the beginning be very narrow according as mens ideas multiplied and their acquaintance with objects increased their stock of names and words would increase also but to the infinite variety of objects and ideas no language is adequate no language is so copious as to have a separate word for every separate idea men naturally sought to abridge this labor of multiplying words in infinitum and in order to lay less burden on their memories made one word which they had already appropriated to a certain idea or object stand also for some other idea or object between which and the primary one they found or fancied some relation thus the preposition in was originally invented to express the circumstance of place the man was killed in the wood in progress of time words were wanted to express mens being connected with certain conditions of fortune or certain situations of mind and some resemblance or analogy being fancied between these and the place of bodies the word in was employed to express mens being so circumstanced as ones being in health or in sickness in prosperity or in adversity in joy or in grief in doubt or in danger or in safety here we see this preposition in plainly assuming a tropical signification or carried off from its original meaning to signify something else which relates to or resembles it  tropes of this kind abound in all languages and are plainly owing to the want of proper words the operations of the mind and affections in particular are in most languages described by words taken from sensible objects the reason is plain the names of sensible objects were in all languages the words most early introduced and were by degrees extended to those mental objects of which men had more obscure conceptions and to which they found it more difficult to assign distinct names they borrowed therefore the name of some sensible idea where their imagination found some affinity thus we speak of a piercing judgment and a clear head a soft or a hard heart a rough or a smooth behavior we say inflamed by anger warmed by love swelled with pride melted into grief and these are almost the only significant words which we have for such ideas  but although the barrenness of language and the want of words be doubtless one cause of the invention of tropes yet it is not the only nor perhaps even the principal source of this form of speech tropes have arisen more frequently and spread themselves wider from the influence which imagination possesses over all language the train on which this has proceeded among all nations i shall endeavor to explain  every object which makes any impression on the human mind is constantly accompanied with certain circumstances and relations that strike us at the same time it never presents itself to our view isole as the french express it that is independent on and separated from every other thing but always occurs as somehow related to other objects going before them or following after them their effect or their cause resembling them or opposed to them distinguished by certain qualities or surrounded with certain circumstances by this means every idea or object carries in its train some other ideas which may be considered as its accessories these accessories often strike the imagination more than the principal idea itself they are perhaps more agreeable ideas or they are more familiar to our conceptions or they recall to our memory a greater variety of important circumstances the imagination is more disposed to rest upon some of them and therefore instead of using the proper name of the principal idea which it means to express it employs in its place the name of the accessory or correspondent idea although the principal have a proper and wellknown name of its own hence a vast variety of tropical or figurative words obtain currency in all languages through choice not necessity and men of lively imaginations are every day adding to their number  thus when we design to intimate the period at which a state enjoyed most reputation o glory it were easy to employ the proper words for expressing this but as this readily connects in our imagination with the flourishing period of a plant or a tree we lay hold of this correspondent idea and say the roman empire flourished most under augustus the leader of a faction is plain language but because the head is the principal part of the human body and is supposed to direct all the animal operations resting upon this resemblance we say catiline was the head of the party the word voice was originally invented to signify the articulate sound formed by the organs of the mouth but as by means of it men signify their ideas and their intentions to each other voice soon assumed a great many other meanings all derived from this primary effect to give our voice for any thing signified to give our sentiment in favor of it not only so but voice was transferred to signify any intimation of will or judgment though given without the least interposition of voice in its literal sense or any sound uttered at all thus we speak of listening to the voice of conscience the voice of nature the voice of god this usage takes place not so much from barrenness of language or want of a proper word as from an allusion which we choose to make to voice in its primary sense in order to convey our idea connected with a circumstance which appears to the fancy to give it more sprightliness and force  the account which i have now given and which seems to be a full and fair one of the introduction of tropes into all languages coincides with what cicero shortly hints in his third book de oratore modus transferendi verba late patet quam necessitas primum genuit coacta inopia et angustias post autem delectatio jucunditasque celebravit nam ut vestis frigoris depellendi causa reperta primo post adhiberi caepta est ad ornatum etiam corporis et dignitatem sic verbi translatio instituta est inopiae causa frequentata delectationis the figurative usage of words is very extensive an usage to which necessity first gave rise on account of the paucity of words and barrenness of language but which the pleasure that was found in it afterward rendered frequent for as garments were first contrived to defend our bodies from the cold and afterward were employed for the purpose of ornament and dignity so figures of speech introduced by want were cultivated for the sake of entertainment   from what has been said it clearly appears how that must come to pass which i had occasion to mention in a former lecture that all languages are most figurative in their early state both the causes to which i ascribed the origin of figures concur in producing this effect at the beginnings of society language is then most barren the stock of proper names which have been invented for things is small and at the same time imagination exerts great influence over the conceptions of men and their method of uttering them so that both from necessity and from choice their speech will at that period abound in tropes for the savage tribes of men are always much given to wonder and astonishment every new object surprises terrifies and makes a strong impression on their mind they are governed by imagination and passion more than by reason and of course their speech must be deeply tinctured by their genius in fact we find that this is the character of the american and indian languages bold picturesque and metaphorical full of strong allusions to sensible qualities and to such objects as struck them most in their wild and solitary life an indian chief makes a harangue to his tribe in a style full of stronger metaphors than a european would use in an epic poem  as language makes gradual progress toward refinement almost every object comes to have a proper name given to it and perspicuity and precision are more studied but still for the reasons before given borrowed words or as rhetoricians call them tropes must continue to occupy a considerable place in every language too there are a multitude of words which though they were figurative in their first application to certain objects yet by long use lose that figurative power wholly and come to be considered as simple and literal expressions in this case are the terms which i remarked before as transferred from sensible qualities to the operations or qualities of the mind a piercing judgment a clear head a hard heart and the like there are other words which remain in a sort of middle state which have neither lost wholly their figurative application nor yet retain so much of it as to imprint any remarkable character of figured lauguage on our style such as these phrases apprehend ones meaning enter on a subject follow out an argument stir up strife and a great many more of which our language is full in the use of such phrases correct writers will always preserve a regard to the figure or allusion on which they are founded and will be careful not to apply them in any way that is inconsistent with it one may be sheltered under the patronage of a great man but it were wrong to say sheltered under the masque of dissimulation as a masque conceals but does not shelter an object in description may be clothed if you will with epithets but it is not so proper to speak of its being clothed with circumstances as the word circumstances alludes to standing round not to clothing such attentions as these are requisite in the common run of style  what has been said on this subject tends to throw light on the nature of language in general and will lead to the reasons why tropes or figures contribute to the beauty and grace of style  first they enrich language and render it more copious by their means words and phrases are multiplied for expressing all sorts of ideas for describing even the minutest differences the nicest shades and colors of thought which no language could possibly do by proper words alone without assistance from tropes  secondly they bestow dignity upon style the familiarity of common words to which our ears are much accustomed tends to degrade style when we want to adapt our language to the tone of an elevated subject we would be greatly at a loss if we could not borrow assistance from figures which properly employed have a similar effect on language with what is produced by the rich and splendid dress of a person of rank to create respect and to give an air of magnificence to him who wears it assistance of this kind is often needed in prose compositions but poetry could not subsist without it hence figures form the constant language of poetry to say that the sun rises is trite and common but it becomes a magnificent image when expressed as mr thomson has done but yonder comes the powerful king of day rejoicing in the east  to say that all men are subject alike to death presents only a vulgar idea but it rises and fills the imagination when painted thus by horace pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas regumque turres or omnes eodem cogimur omnium versatur urna serius ocyus sors exitura and nos in eternum exilium impositura cymbae with equal pace impartial fate knocks at the palace as the cottage gate or we all must tread the paths of fate and ever shakes the mortal urn whose lot embarks us soon or late on charons boat ah never to return francis    in the third place figures give us the pleasure of enjoying two objects presented together to our view without confusion the principal idea which is the subject of the discourse along with its accessory which gives it the figurative dress we see one thing in another as aristotle expresses it which is always agreeable to the mind for there is nothing with which the fancy is more delighted than with comparisons and resemblances of objects and all tropes are founded upon some relation or analogy between one thing and another when for instance in place of youth i say the morning of life the fancy is immediately entertained with all the resembling circumstances which presently occur between these two objects at one moment i have in my eye a certain period of human life and a certain time of the day so related to each other that the imagination plays between them with pleasure and contemplates two similar objects in one view without embarrassment or confusion not only so but  in the fourth place figures are attended with this farther advantage of giving us frequently a much clearer and more striking view of the principal object than we could have if it were expressed in simple terms and divested of its accessory idea this is indeed their principal advantage in virtue of which they are very properly said to illustrate a subject or to throw light upon it for they exhibit the object on which they are employed in a picturesque form they can render an abstract conception in some degree an object of sense they surround it with such circumstances as enable the mind to lay hold of it steadily and to contemplate it fully those persons says one who gain the hearts of most people who are chosen as the companions of their softer hours and their reliefs from anxiety and care are seldom persons of shining qualities or strong virtues it is rather the soft green of the soul on which we rest our eyes that are fatigued with beholding more glaring objects here by a happy allusion to a color the whole conception is conveyed clear and strong to the mind in one word by a well chosen figure even conviction is assisted and the impression of a truth upon the mind made more lively and forcible than it would otherwise be as in the following illustration of dr youngs when we dip too deep in pleasure we always stir a sediment that renders it impure and noxious or in this a heart boiling with violent passions will always send up infatuating fumes to the head an image that presents so much congruity between a moral and a sensible idea serves like an argument from analogy to enforce what the author asserts and to induce belief  besides whether we are endeavoring to raise sentiments of pleasure or aversion we can always heighten the emotion by the figures which we introduce leading the imagination to a train either of agreeable or disagreeable of exalting or debasing ideas correspondent to the impression which we seek to make when we want to render an object beautiful or magnificent we borrow images from all the most beautiful or splendid scenes of nature we thereby naturally throw a luster over our object we enliven the readers mind and dispose him to go along with us in the gay and pleasing impressions which we give him of the subject this effect of figures is happily touched in the following lines of dr akenside and illustrated by a very sublime figure  then the inexpressive strain diffuses its enchantment fancy dreams of sacred fountains and elysian groves and vales of bliss the intellectual power bends from his awful throne a wondering ear and smiles  pleas of imaginat i      what i have now explained concerning the use and effects of figures naturally leads us to reflect on the wonderful power of language and indeed we cannot reflect on it without the highest admiration what a fine vehicle is it now become for all the conceptions of the human mind even for the most subtle and delicate workings of the imagination what a pliant and flexible instrument in the hand of one who can employ it skilfully prepared to take every form which he chooses to give it not content with a simple communication of ideas and thoughts it paints those ideas to the eye it gives coloring and relievo even to the most abstract conceptions in the figures which it uses it sets mirrors before us where we may behold objects a second time in their likeness it entertains us as with a succession of the most splendid pictures disposes in the most artificial manner of the light and shade for viewing every thing to the best advantage in fine from being a rude and imperfect interpreter of mens wants and necessities it has now passed into an instrument of the most delicate and refined luxury  to make these effects of figurative language sensible there are few authors in the english language whom i can refer to with more advantage than mr addison whose imagination is at once remarkably rich and remarkably correct and chaste when he is treating for instance of the effect which light and colors have to entertain the fancy considered in mr lockes view of them as secondary qualities which have no real existence in matter but are only ideas in the mind with what beautiful painting has he adorned this philosophic speculation things says he would make but a poor appearance to the eye if we saw them only in their proper figures and motions now we are every where entertained with pleasing shows and apparitions we discover imaginary glories in the heavens and in the earth and see some of this visionary beauty poured out upon the whole creation but what a rough unsightly sketch of nature should we be entertained with did all her coloring disappear and the several distinctions of light and shade vanish in short our souls are at present delightfully lost and bewildered in a pleasing delusion and we walk about like the enchanted hero of a romance who sees beautiful castles woods and meadows and at the same time hears the warbling of birds and the purling of streams but upon the finishing of some secret spell the fantastic scene breaks up and the disconsolate knight finds himself on a barren heath or in a solitary desert it is not improbable that something like this may be the state of the soul after its first separation in respect of the images it will receive from matter no     spec  having thus explained at sufficient length the origin the nature and the effects of tropes i should proceed next to the several kinds and divisions of them but in treating of these were i to follow the common tract of the scholastic writers on rhetoric i should soon become tedious and i apprehend useless at the same time their great business has been with a most patient and frivolous industry to branch them out under a vast number of divisions according to all the several modes in which a word may be carried from its literal meaning into one that is figurative without doing any more as if the mere knowledge of the names and classes of all the tropes that can be formed could be of any advantage toward the proper or graceful use of language all that i purpose is to give in a few words before finishing this lecture a general view of the several sources whence the tropical meaning of words is derived after which i shall in subsequent lectures descend to a more particular consideration of some of the most considerable figures of speech and such as are in most frequent use by treating of which i shall give all the instruction i can concerning the proper employment of figurative language and point out the errors and abuses which are apt to be committed in this part of style  all tropes as i before observed are founded on the relation which one object bears to another in virtue of which the name of the one can be substituted instead of the name of the other and by such a substitution the vivacity of the idea is commonly meant to be increased these relations some more some less intimate may all give rise to tropes one of the first and most obvious relations is that between a cause and its effect hence in figurative language the cause is sometimes put for the effect thus mr addison writing of italy blossoms and fruits and flowers together rise and the whole year in gay confusion lies where the whole year is plainly intended to signify the effects or productions of all the seasons of the year at other times again the effect is put for the cause as gray hairs frequently for old age which causes gray hairs and shade for trees that produce the shade the relation between the container and the thing contained is also so intimate and obvious as naturally to give rise to tropes  ille impiger hausit spumantem pateram and pleno se proluit auro where every one sees that the cup and the gold are put for the liquor that was contained in the golden cup in the same manner the name of any country is often used to denote the inhabitants of that country and heaven very commonly employed to signify god because he is conceived as dwelling in heaven to implore the assistance of heaven is the same as to implore the assistance of god the relation betwixt any established sign and the thing signified is a further source of tropes hence cedant arma togae concedat laurea linguae the toga being the badge of the civil professions and the laurel of military honors the badge of each is put for the civil and military characters themselves to assume the scepter is a common phrase for entering on royal authority to tropes founded on these several relations of cause and effect container and contained sign and thing signified is given the name of metonymy  when the trope is founded on the relation between an antecedent and a consequent or what goes before and immediately follows after it is then called a metalepsis as in the roman phrase of fuit or vixit to express that one was dead fuit ilium et ingens gloria dardanidum signifies that the glory of troy is now no more  when the whole is put for a part or a part for the whole a genus for a species or a species for a genus the singular for the plural or the plural for the singular number in general when any thing less or any thing more is put for the precise object meant the figure is then called a synecdoche it is very common for instance to describe a whole object by some remarkable part of it as when we say a fleet of so many sail in the place of ships when we use the head for the person the pole for the earth the waves for the sea in like manner an attribute may be put for a subject as youth and beauty for the young and beautiful and sometimes a subject for the attribute but it is needless to insist longer on this enumeration which serves little purpose i have said enough to give an opening into that great variety of relations between objects by means of which the mind is assisted to pass easily from one to another and by the name of the one understands the other to be meant it is always some accessory idea which recals the principal to the imagination and commonly recals it with more force than if the principal idea had been expressed  the relation which of all others is by far the most fruitful of tropes i have not yet mentioned that is the relation of similitude and resemblance on this is founded what is called the metaphor when in place of using the proper name of any object we employ in its place the name of some other which is like it which is a sort of picture of it and which thereby awakens the conception of it with more force or grace this figure is more frequent than all the rest put together and the language both of prose and verse owes to it much of its elegance and grace this therefore deserves very full and particular consideration and shall be the subject of the next lecture  lecture xv metaphor after the preliminary observations i have made relating to figurative language in general i come now to treat separately of such figures of speech as occur most frequently and require particular attention and i begin with metaphor this is a figure founded entirely on the resemblance which one object bears to another hence it is much allied to simile or comparison and is indeed no other than a comparison expressed in an abridged form when i say of some great minister that he upholds the state like a pillar which supports the weight of a whole edifice i fairly make a comparison but when i say of such a minister that he is the pillar of the state it is now beeome a metaphor the comparison betwixt the minister and a pillar is made in the mind but is expressed without any of the words that denote comparison the comparison is only insinuated not expressed the one object is supposed to be so like the other that without formally drawing the comparison the name of the one may be put in the place of the name of the other the minister is the pillar of the state this therefore is a more lively and animated manner of expressing the resemblances which imagination traces among objects there is nothing which delights the fancy more than this act of comparing things together discovering resemblances between them and describing them by their likeness the mind thus employed is exercised without being fatigued and is gratified with the consciousness of its own ingenuity we need not be surprised therefore at finding all language tinctured strongly with metaphor it insinuates itself even into familiar conversation and unsought rises up of its own accord in the mind the very words which i have casually employed in describing this are a proof of what i say tinctured insinuates rises up are all of them metaphorical expressions borrowed from some resemblance which fancy forms between sensible objects and the internal operations of the mind and yet the terms are no less clear and perhaps more expressive than if words had been used which were to be taken in the strict and literal sense  though all metaphor imports comparison and therefore is in that respect a figure of thought yet as the words in a metaphor are not taken literally but changed from their proper to a figurative sense the metaphor is commonly ranked among tropes or figures of words but provided the nature of it be well understood it signifies very little whether we call it a figure or a trope i have confined it to the expression of resemblance between two objects i must remark however that the word metaphor is sometimes used in a looser and more extended sense for the application of a term in any figurative signification whether the figure be founded on resemblance or on some other relation which two objects bear to one another for instance when gray hairs are put for old age as to bring ones gray hairs with sorrow to the grave some writers would call this a metaphor though it is not properly one but what rhetoricians call a metonymy that is the effect put for the cause gray hairs being the effect of old age but not bearing any sort of resemblance to it aristotle in his poetics uses metaphor in this extended sense for any figurative meaning imposed upon a word as a whole put for the part or a part for the whole a species for the genus or a genus for the species but it would be unjust to tax this most acute writer with any inaccuracy on this account the minute subdivisions and various names of tropes being unknown in his days and the invention of later rhetoricians now however when these divisions are established it is inaccurate to call every figurative use of terms promiscuously a metaphor  of all the figures of speech none comes so near to painting as metaphor its peculiar effect is to give light and strength to description to make intellectual ideas in some sort visible to the eye by giving them color and substance and sensible qualities in order to produce this effect however a delicate hand is required for by a very little inaccuracy we are in hazard of introducing confusion in place of promoting perspicuity several rules therefore are necessary to be given for the proper management of metaphors but before entering on these i shall give one instance of a very beautiful metaphor that i may show the figure to full advantage i shall take my instance from lord bolingbrokes remarks on the history of england just at the conclusion of his work he is speaking of the behavior of charles i to his last parliament in a word says he about a month after their meeting he dissolved them he repented but he repented too late of his rashness well might he repent for the vessel was now full and this last drop made the waters of bitterness overflow here he adds we draw the curtain and put an end to our remarks nothing could be more happily thrown off the metaphor we see is continued through several expressions the vessel is put for the state or temper of the nation already full that is provoked to the highest by former oppressions and wrongs this last drop stands for the provocation recently received by the abrupt dissolution of the parliament and the overflowing of the waters of bitterness beautifully expresses all the effects of resentment let loose by an exasperated people  on this passage we may make two remarks in passing the one that nothing forms a more spirited and dignified conclusion of a subject than a figure of this kind happily placed at the close we see the effect of it in this instance the author goes off with a good grace and leaves a strong and full impression of his subject on the readers mind my other remark is the advantage which a metaphor frequently has above a formal comparison how much would the sentiment here have been enfeebled if it had been expressed in the style of a regular simile thus well might he repent for the state of the nation loaded with grievances and provocations resembled a vessel that was now full and this superadded provocation like the last drop infused made their rage and resentment as waters of bitterness overflow it has infinitely more spirit and force as it now stands in the form of a metaphor well might he repent for the vessel was now full and this last drop made the waters of bitterness overflow  having mentioned with applause this instance from lord bolingbroke i think it incumbent on me here to take notice that though i may have recourse to this author sometimes for examples of style it is his style only and not his sentiments that deserve praise it is indeed my opinion that there are few writings in the english language which for the matter contained in them can be read with less profit or fruit than lord bolingbrokes works his political writings have the merit of a very lively and eloquent style but they have no other being as to the substance the mere temporary productions of faction and party no better indeed than pamphlets written for the day his posthumous or as they are called his philosophical works wherein he attacks religion have still less merit for they are as loose in the style as they are flimsy in the reasoning an unhappy instance this author is of parts and genius so miserably perverted by faction and passion that as his memory will descend to posterity with little honor so his productions will soon pass and are indeed already passing into neglect and oblivion  returning from this digression to the subject before us i proceed to lay down the rules to be observed in the conduct of metaphors and which are much the same for tropes of every kind  the first which i shall mention is that they be suited to the nature of the subject of which we treat neither too many nor too gay nor too elevated for it that we neither attempt to force the subject by means of them into a degree of elevation which is not congruous to it nor on the other hand allow it to sink below its proper dignity this is a direction which belongs to all figurative language and should be ever kept in view some metaphors are allowable nay beautiful in poetry which it would be absurd and unnatural to employ in prose some may be graceful in orations which would be very improper in historical or philosophical composition we must remember that figures are the dress of our sentiments as there is a natural congruity between dress and the character or rank of the person who wears it a violation of which congruity never fails to hurt the same holds precisely as to the application of figures to sentiment the excessive or unseasonable employment of them is mere foppery in writing it gives a boyish air to composition and instead of raising a subject in fact diminishes its dignity for as in life true dignity must be founded on character not on dress and appearance so the dignity of composition must arise from sentiment and thought not from ornament the affectation and parade of ornament detract as much from an author as they do from a man figures and metaphors therefore should on no occasion be stuck on too profusely and never should be such as refuse to accord with the strain of our sentiment nothing can be more unnatural than for a writer to carry on a train of reasoning in the same sort of figurative language which he would use in description when he reasons we look only for perspicuity when he describes we expect embellishment when he divides or relates we desire plainness and simplicity one of the greatest secrets in composition is to know when to be simple this always gives a heightening to ornament in its proper place the right disposition of the shade makes the light and coloring strike the more is enim est eloquens says cicero qui et humilia subtiliter et magna graviter et mediocria temperate potest dicere  nam qui nihil potest tranquille nihil leniter nihil definite distinct potest dicere is cum non praeparatis auribus inflammare rem caepit furere apud sanos et quasi inter sobrios bacchari temulentus videtur he is truly eloquent who can discourse of humble subjects in a plain style who can treat important ones with dignity and speak of things which are of a middle nature in a temperate strain for one who upon no occasion can express himself in a calm orderly distinct manner when he begins to be on fire before his readers are prepared to kindle along with him has the appearance of raving like a madman among persons who are in their senses or of reeling like a drunkard in the midst of sober company  this admonition should be particularly attended to by young practitioners in the art of writing who are apt to be carried away by an undistinguishing admiration of what is showy and florid whether in its place or not what person of the least taste can bear the following passage in a late historian he is giving an account of the famous act of parliament against irregular marriages in england the bill says he underwent a great number of alterations and amendments which were not effected without violent contest this is plain language suited to the subject and we naturally expect that he should go on in the same strain to tell us that after these contests it was carried by a great majority of voices and obtained the royal assent but how does he express himself in finishing the period at length however it was floated through both houses on the tide of a great majority and steered into the safe harbor of royal approbation nothing can be more puerile than such language smollets history of england as quoted in critical review for oct      p       the second rule which i give respects the choice of objects from whence metaphors and other figures are to be drawn the field for figurative language is very wide all nature to speak in the style of figures opens its stores to us and admits us to gather from all sensible objects whatever can illustrate intellectual or moral ideas not only the gay and splendid objects of sense but the grave the terrifying and even the gloomy and dismal can on different occasions be introduced into figures with propriety but we must beware of ever using such allusions as raise in the mind disagreeable mean vulgar or dirty ideas even when metaphors are chosen in order to vilify and degrade any object an author should study never to be nauseous in his allusions cicero blames an orator of his time for terming his enemy stercus curiae quamvis sit simile says he tamen est deformis cogitatio similitudinis but in subjects of dignity it is an unpardonable fault to introduce mean and vulgar metaphors in the treatise on the art of sinking in dean swifts works there is a full and humourous collection of instances of this kind wherein authors instead of exalting have contrived to degrade their subjects by the figures they employed authors of greater note than those which are there quoted have at times fallen into this error archbishop tillotson for instance is sometimes negligent in his choice of metaphors as when speaking of the day of judgment he describes the world as cracking about the sinners ears shakespeare whose imagination was rich and bold in a much greater degree than it was delicate often fails here the following for example is a gross transgression in his henry v having mentioned a dunghill he presently raises a metaphor from the steam of it and on a subject too that naturally led to much nobler ideas and those that leave their valiant bones in france dying like men though buried in your dunghills they shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them and draw their honors reeking up to heaven act iv sc    in the third place as metaphors should be drawn from objects of some dignity so particular care should be taken that the resemblance which is the foundation of the metaphor be clear and perspicuous not farfetched nor difficult to discover the transgression of this rule makes what are called harsh or forced metaphors which are always displeasing because they puzzle the reader and instead of illustrating the thought render it perplexed and intricate with metaphors of this kind cowley abounds he and some of the writers of his age seem to have considered it as the perfection of wit to hit upon likenesses between objects which no other person could have discovered and at the same time to pursue those metaphors so far that it requires some ingenuity to follow them out and comprehend them this makes a metaphor resemble an aenigma and is the very reverse of ciceros rule on this head verecunda debet esse translatio ut deducta esse in alienum locum non irruisse atque ut voluntario non vi venisse videatur every metaphor should be modest so that it may carry the appearance of having been led not of having forced itself into the place of that word whose room it occupies that it may seem to have come thither of its own accord and not by constraint de oratore l iii c     how forced and obscure for instance are the following verses of cowley speaking of his mistress woe to her stubborn heart if once mine come into the selfsame room twill tear and blow up all within like a granada shot into a magazine then shall love keep the ashes and torn parts of both our broken hearts shall out of both one new one make from here is the alloy from mine the metal take for of her heart he from the flames will find but little left behind mine only will remain entire no dross was there to perish in the fire in this manner he addresses sleep in vain thou drowsy god i thee invoke for thou who do from fumes arise thou who mans soul do overshade with a thick cloud by vapors made can have no power to shut his eyes whose flames so pure that it sends up no smoke yet how do tears but from some vapors rise tears that bewinter all my year the fate of egypt i sustain and never feel the dew of rain from clouds which in the head appear but all my too much moisture owe to overflowings of the heart below see an excellent criticism on this sort of metaphysical poetry in dr johnsons life of cowley  trite and common resemblances should indeed be avoided in our metaphors to be new and not vulgar is a beauty but when they are fetched from some likeness too remote and lying too far out of the road of ordinary thought then besides their obscurity they have also the disadvantage of appearing labored and as the french call it recherche whereas metaphor like every other ornament loses its whole grace when it does not seem natural and easy  it is but a bad and ungraceful softening which writers sometimes use for a harsh metaphor when they palliate it with the expression as it were this is but an awkward parenthesis and metaphors which need this apology of an as it were had generally be better omitted metaphors too borrowed from any of the sciences especially such of them as belong to particular professions are almost always faulty by their obscurity  in the fourth place it must be carefully attended to in the conduct of metaphors never to jumble metaphorical and plain language together never to construct a period so that part of it must be understood metaphorically part literally which always produces a most disagreeable confusion instances which are but too frequent even in good authors will make this rule and the reason of it be clearly understood in mr popes translation of the odyssey penelope bewailing the abrupt departure of her son telemachus is made to speak thus long to my joys my dearest lord is lost his countrys buckler and the grecian boast now from my fond embrace by tempests torn our other column of the state is borne nor took a kind adieu nor sought consent in the original there is no allusion to a column and the metaphor is rightly supported      d      iv     here in one line her son is figured as a column and in the next he returns to be a person to whom it belongs to take adieu and to ask consent this is inconsistent the poet should either have kept himself to to the idea of a man in the literal sense or if he figured him by a column he should have ascribed nothing to him but what belonged to it he was not at liberty to ascribe to that column the actions and properties of a man such unnatural mixtures render the image indistinct leaving it to waver in our conception between the figurative and the literal sense horaces rule which he applies to characters should be observed by all writers who deal in figures  servetur ad imum qualis ab incepto processerit et sibi constet mr pope elsewhere addressing himself to the king says to thee the world its present homage pays the harvest early but mature the praise this though not so gross is a fault however of the same kind it is plain that had not the rhyme misled him to the choice of an improper phrase he would have said the harvest early but mature the crop and so would have continued the figure which he had begun whereas by dropping it unfinished and by employing the literal word praise when we were expecting something that related to the harvest the figure is broken and the two members of the sentence have no proper correspondent with each other the harvest early but mature the praise   the works of ossian abound with beautiful and correct metaphors such as that on a hero in peace thou art the gate of spring in war the mountain storm or this on a woman she was covered with the light of beauty but her heart was the house of pride they afford however one instance of the fault we are now censuring trothal went forth with the stream of his people but they met a rock for fingal stood unmoved broken they rolled back from his side nor did they roll in safety the spear of the king pursued their flight at the beginning the metaphor is very beautiful the stream the unmoved rock the waves rolling back broken are expressions employed in the proper and consistent language of figure but in the end when we are told they did not roll in safety because the spear of the king pursued their flight the literal meaning is improperly mixed with the metaphor they are at one and the same time presented to us as waves that roll and men that may be pursued and wounded with a spear if it be faulty to jumble together in this manner metaphorical and plain language it is still more so  in the fifth place to make two different metaphors meet on one object this is what is called mixed metaphor and is indeed one of the grossest abuses of this figure such as shakespeares expression to take arms against a sea of troubles this makes a most unnatural medley and confounds the imagination entirely quinctilian has sufficiently guarded us against it id imprimis est custodiendum ut quo genere coeperis translationis hoc finias multi autem cum initium a tempestate sumserunt incendio aut ruina finiunt quae est inconsequentia rerum foedissima we must be particularly attentive to end with the same kind of metaphor with which we have begun some when they begin the figure with a tempest conclude it with a conflagration which forms a shameful inconsistency  observe for instance what an inconsistent groupe of objects is brought together by shakespeare in the following passage of the tempest speaking of persons recovering their judgment after the enchantment which held them was dissolved  the charm dissolves apace and as the morning steals upon the night melting the darkness so their rising senses begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle their clearer reason  so many illsorted things are here joined that the mind can see nothing clearly the morning stealing upon the darkness and at the same time melting it the senses of men chasing fumes ignorant fumes and fumes that mantle so again in romeo and juliet  as glorious as is a winged messenger from heaven unto the white upturned wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazy pacing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air here the angel is represented as at one moment bestriding the clouds and sailing upon the air and upon the bosom of the air too which forms such a confused picture that it is impossible for any imagination to comprehend it  more correct writers than shakespeare sometimes fall into this error of mixing metaphors it is surprising how the following inaccuracy should have escaped mr addison in his letter from italy i bridle in my struggling muse with pain that longs to launch into a bolder strain in my observation on this passage i find that i had coincided with dr johnson who passes a similar censure upon it in his life of addison  the muse figured as a horse may be bridled but when we speak of launching we make it a ship and by no force of imagination can it be supposed both a horse and a ship at one moment bridled to hinder it from launching the same author in one of his numbers in the spectator says there is not a single view of human nature which is not sufficient to extinguish the seeds of pride observe the incoherence of the things here joined together making a view extinguish and extinguish seeds  horace also is incorrect in the following passage urit enim fulgore suo qui pregravat arts infra se positas    urit qui pregravat  he dazzles who bears down with his weight makes plainly an inconsistent mixture of metaphorical ideas neither can this other passage be altogether vindicated ah quanta laboras in charybdi digne puer meliore flamma where a whirlpool of water charybdis is said to be a flame not good enough for this young man meaning that he was unfortunate in the object of his passion flame is indeed become almost a literal word for the passion of love but as it still retains in some degree its figurative power it should never have been used as synonymous with water and mixed with it in the same metaphor when mr pope eloisa to abelard says all then is full possessing and possessed no craving void left aching in the breast a void may metaphorically be said to crave but can a void be said to ache  a good rule has been given for examining the propriety of metaphors when we doubt whether or not they be of the mixed kind namely that we should try to form a picture upon them and consider how the parts would agree and what sort of figure the whole would present when delineated with a pencil by this means we should become sensible whether inconsistent circumstances were mixed and a monstrous image thereby produced as in all those faulty instances i have now been giving or whether the object was all along presented in one natural and consistent point of view  as metaphors ought never to be mixed so in the sixth place we should avoid crowding them together on the same object supposing each of the metaphors to be preserved distinct yet if they be heaped on one another they produce a confusion somewhat of the same kind with the mixed metaphor we may judge of this by the following passage from horace motum ex metello consule civicum bellique causas et vitia et modos ludumque fortunae gravesque principum amicitias and arma nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus periculosae plenum opus aleae tractas et incedis per ignes suppositos cineri doloso of warm commotions wrathful jars the growing seeds of civil wars of double fortunes cruel games the specious means the private aims and fatal friendships of the guilty great alas how fatal to the roman state of mighty legions late subdued and arms with latian blood embrud yet unatoned a labor vast doubtful the die and dire the cast you treat adventurous and incautious tread on fires with faithless embers overspread francis  lib   i this passage though very poetical is however harsh and obscure owing to no other cause but this that three distinct metaphors are crowded together to describe the difficulty of pollios writing a history of the civil wars first tractas arma uncta cruoribus nondum expiatis next opus plenum periculosae aleae and then incedis per ignes suppositos doloso cineri the mind has difficulty in passing readily through so many different views given it in quick succession of the same object  the only other rule concerning metaphors which i shall add in the seventh place is that they be not too far pursued if the resemblance on which the figure is founded be long dwelt upon and carried into all its minute circumstances we make an allegory instead of a metaphor we tire the reader who soon wearies of this play of fancy and we render our discourse obscure this is called straining a metaphor cowley deals in this to excess and to this error is owing in a great measure that intricacy and harshness in his figurative language which i before remarked lord shaftsbury is sometimes guilty of pursuing his metaphors too far fond to a high degree of every decoration of style when once he had hit upon a figure that pleased him he was extremely loath to part with it thus in his advice to an author having taken up soliloquy or meditation under the metaphor of a proper method of evacuation for an author he pursues this metaphor through several pages under all the forms of discharging crudities throwing off froth and scum bodily operation taking physic curing indigestion giving vent to choler bile flatulencies and tumors till at last the idea becomes nauseous dr young also often trespasses in the same way the merit however of this writer in figurative language is great and deserves to be remarked no writer ancient or modern had a stronger imagination than dr young or one more fertile in figures of every kind his metaphors are often new and often natural and beautiful but as his imagination was strong and rich rather than delicate and correct he sometimes gives it too loose reins hence in his night thoughts there prevails an obscurity and a hardness in his style the metaphors are frequently too bold and frequently too far pursued the reader is dazzled rather than enlightened and kept constantly on the stretch to comprehend and keep pace with the author we may observe for instance how the following metaphor is spun out thy thoughts are vagabonds all outward bound midst sands and rocks and storms to cruise for pleasure if gained dear bought and better missed than gained fancy and sense from an infected shore thy cargo brings and pestilence the prize then such the thirst insatiable thirst by fond indulgence but inflamed the more fancy still cruizes when poor sense is tired   speaking of old age he says it should walk thoughtful on the silent solemn shore of that vast ocean it must sail so soon and put good works on board and wait the wind that shortly blows us into worlds unknown   the two first lines are uncommonly beautiful walk thoughtful on the silent etc but when he continues the metaphor to putting good works on board and waiting the wind it plainly becomes strained and sinks in dignity of all the english authors i know none so happy in his metaphors as mr addison his imagination was neither so rich nor so strong as dr youngs but far more chaste and delicate perspicuity natural grace and ease always distinguish his figures they are neither harsh nor strained they never appear to have been studied or sought after but seem to rise of their own accord from the subject and constantly embellish it  i have now treated fully of the metaphor and the rules that should govern it a part of the doctrine of style so important that it required particular illustration i have only to add a few words concerning allegory  an allegory may be regarded as a continued metaphor as it is the representation of some one thing by another that resembles it and that is made to stand for it thus in priors henry and emma emma in the following allegorical manner describes her constancy to henry did i but purpose to embark with thee on the smooth surface of a summers sea while gentle zephyrs play with prosperous gales and fortunes favor fills the swelling sails but would forsake the ship and make the shore when the winds whistle and the tempests roar   we may take also from the scriptures a very fine example of an allegory in the  0th psalm where the people of israel are represented under the image of a vine and the figure is supported throughout with great correctness and beauty thou have brought a vine out of egypt thou have cast out the heathen and planted it thou preparedst room before it and did cause it to take deep root and it filled the land the hills were covered with the shadow of it and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars she sent out her boughs into the sea and her branches into the river why have thou broken down her hedges so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her the boar out of the wood does waste it and the wild beast of the field does devour it return we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine here there is no circumstance except perhaps one phrase at the beginning thou have cast out the heathen that does not strictly agree to a vine whilst at the same time the whole quadrates happily with the jewish state represented by this figure this is the first and principal requisite in the conduct of an allegory that the figurative and the literal meaning be not mixed inconsistently together for instance instead of describing the vine as wasted by the boar from the wood and devoured by the wild beast of the field had the psalmist said it was afflicted by heathens or overcome by enemies which is the real meaning this would have ruined the allegory and produced the same confusion of which i gave examples in metaphors when the figurative and literal sense are mixed and jumbled together indeed the same rules that were given for metaphors may also be applied to allegories on account of the affinity they bear to each other the only material difference between them besides the one being short and the other being prolonged is that a metaphor always explains itself by the words that are connected with it in their proper and natural meaning as when i say achilles was a lion an able minister is the pillar of the state my lion and my pillar are sufficiently interpreted by the mention of achilles and the minister which i join to them but an allegory is or may be allowed to stand more disconnected with the literal meaning the interpretation not so directly pointed out but left to our own reflection  allegories were a favorite method of delivering instructions in ancient times for what we call fables or parables are no other than allegories where by words and actions attributed to beasts or inanimate objects the dispositions of men are figured and what we call the moral is the unfigured sense or meaning of the allegory an aenigma or riddle is also a species of allegory one thing represented or imaged by another but purposely wrapped up under so many circumstances as to be rendered obscure where a riddle is not intended it is always a fault in allegory to be too dark the meaning should be easily seen through the figure employed to shadow it however the proper mixture of light and shade in such compositions the exact adjustment of all the figurative circumstances with the literal sense so as neither to lay the meaning too bare and open nor to cover and wrap it up too much has ever been found an affair of great nicety and there are few species of composition in which it is more difficult to write so as to please and command attention than in allegories in some of the visions of the spectator we have examples of allegories very happily executed  lecture xvi hyperbole  personification  apostrophe the next figure concerning which i am to treat is called hyperbole or exaggeration it consists in magnifying an object beyond its natural bounds it may be considered sometimes as a trope and sometimes as a figure of thought and here indeed the distinction between these two classes begins not to be clear nor is it of any importance that we should have recourse to metaphysical subtilties in order to keep them distinct whether we call it trope or figure it is plain that it is a mode of speech which has some foundation in nature for in all languages even in common conversation hyperbolical expressions very frequently occur as swift as the wind as white as the snow and the like and our common forms of compliment are almost all of them extravagant hyperboles if any thing be remarkably good or great in its kind we are instantly ready to add to it some exaggerating epithet and to make it the greatest or best we ever saw the imagination has always a tendency to gratify itself by magnifying its present object and carrying it to excess more or less of this hyperbolical turn will prevail in language according to the liveliness of imagination among the people who speak it hence young people deal always much in hyperboles hence the language of the orientals was far more hyperbolical than that of the europeans who are of more phlegmatic or if you please of more correct imagination hence among all writers in early times and in the rude periods of society we may expect this figure to abound greater experience and more cultivated society abate the warmth of imagination and chasten the manner of expression  the exaggerated expressions to which our ears are accustomed in conversation scarcely strike us as hyperboles in an instant we make the proper abatement and understand them according to their just value but when there is something striking and unusual in the form of a hyperbolical expression it then rises into a figure of speech which draws our attention and here it is necessary to observe that unless the readers imagination be in such a state as disposes it to rise and swell along with the hyperbolical expression he is always hurt and offended by it for a sort of disagreeable force is put upon him he is required to strain and exert his fancy when he feels no inclination to make any such effort hence the hyperbole is a figure of difficult management and ought neither to be frequently used nor long dwelt upon on some occasions it is undoubtedly proper being as was before observed the natural style of a sprightly and heated imagination but when hyperboles are unseasonable or too frequent they render a composition frigid and unaffecting they are the resource of an author of feeble imagination of one describing objects which either want native dignity in themselves or whose dignity he cannot show by describing them simply and in their just proportions and is therefore obliged to rest upon tumid and exaggerated expressions  hyperboles are of two kinds either such as are employed in description or such as are suggested by the warmth of passion the best by far are those which are the effect of passion for if the imagination has a tendency to magnify its objects beyond their natural proportion passion possesses this tendency in a vastly stronger degree and therefore not only excuses the most daring figures but very often renders them natural and just all passions without exception love terror amazement indignation anger and even grief throw the mind into confusion aggravate their objects and of course prompt a hyperbolical style hence the following sentiments of satan in milton as strongly as they are described contain nothing but what is natural and proper exhibiting the picture of a mind agitated with rage and despair me miserable which way shall i fly infinite wrath and infinite despair which way i fly is hell myself am hell and in the lowest depth a lower deep still threatening to devour me opens wide to which the hell i suffer seems a heaven b iv l     in simple description though hyperboles are not excluded yet they must be used with more caution and require more preparation in order to make the mind relish them either the object described must be of that kind which of itself seizes the fancy strongly and disposes it to run beyond bounds something vast surprising and new or the writers art must be exerted in heating the fancy gradually and preparing it to think highly of the object which he intends to exaggerate when a poet is describing an earthquake or a storm or when he has brought us into the midst of a battle we can bear strong hyperboles without displeasure but when he is describing only a woman in grief it is impossible not to be disgusted with such wild exaggeration as the following in one of our dramatic poets  i found her on the floor in all the storm of grief yet beautiful pouring forth tears at such a lavish rate that were the world on fire they might have drowned the wrath of heaven and quenched the mighty ruin lee  this is mere bombast the person herself who was under the distracting agitations of grief might be permitted to hyperbolize strongly but the spectator describing her cannot be allowed an equal liberty for this plain reason that the one is supposed to utter the sentiments of passion the other speaks only the language of description which is always according to the dictates of nature on a lower tone a distinction which however obvious has not been attended to by many writers  how far a hyperbole supposing it properly introduced may be safely carried without overstretching it what is the proper measure and boundary of this figure cannot as far as i know be ascertained by any precise rule good sense and just taste must determine the point beyond which if we pass we become extravagant lucan may be pointed out as an author apt to be excessive in his hyperboles among the compliments paid by the roman poets to their emperors it had become fashionable to ask them what part of the heavens they would choose for their habitation after they should have become gods virgil had already carried this sufficiently far in his address to augustus  tibi brachia contrahit ingens scorpius and coeli justa plus part relinquit the scorpion ready to receive thy laws yields half his region and contracts his paws dryden  georg i but this did not suffice lucan resolved to outdo all his predecessors in a like address to nero he very gravely beseeches him not to choose his place near either of the poles but to be sure to occupy just the middle of the heavens lest by going either to one side or other his weight should overset the universe sed neque in arctoo sedem tibi legeris orb nec polus adversi calidus qua mergitur austri aetheris immensi partem si presseris unam sentiet axis onus librati pondera coeli orb tene medio but oh whatever be thy godhead great fix not in regions too remote thy seat nor deign thou near the frozen bear to shine nor where the sultry southern stars decline press not too much on any part the sphere hard were the task thy weight divine to bear soon would the axis feel the unusual load and groaning bend beneath the incumbent god over the mid orb more equal shall thou rise and with a juster balance fix the skies row   phars i    such thoughts as these are what the french call outres and always proceed from a false fire of genius the spanish and african writers as tertullian cyprian augustine are remarked for being fond of them as in that epitaph on charles v by a spanish writer pro tumulo ponas orbem pro tegmine coelum sidera pro facibus pro lacrymis maria sometimes they dazzle and impose by their boldness but wherever reason and good sense are so much violated there can be no true beauty epigrammatic writers are frequently guilty in this respect resting the whole merit of their epigrams on some extravagant hyperbolical turn such as the following of dr pitcairns upon hollands being gained from the ocean tellurem fecere dii sua littora belgae immensaeque molis opus utrumque fuit dii vacuo sparsas glomerarunt aethere terras nil ibi quod operi possit obesse fuit at belgis maria and coeli naturaque rerum obstitit obstantes hi domuere deos so much for the hyperbole we proceed now to those figures which lie altogether in the thought where the words are taken in their common and literal sense  among these the first place is unquestionably due to personification or that figure by which we attribute life and action to inanimate objects the technical term for this is prosopopoia but as personification is of the same import and more allied to our own language it will be better to use this word  it is a figure the use of which is very extensive and its foundation laid deep in human nature at first view and when considered abstractly it would appear to be a figure of the utmost boldness and to border on the extravagant and ridiculous for what can seem more remote from the tract of reasonable thought than to speak of stones and trees and fields and rivers as if they were living creatures and to attribute to them thought and sensation affections and actions one might imagine this to be no more than childish conceit which no person of taste could relish in fact however the case is very different no such ridiculous effect is produced by personification when properly employed on the contrary it is found to be natural and agreeable nor is any very uncommon degree of passion required in order to make us relish it all poetry even in its most gentle and humble forms abounds with it from prose it is far from being excluded nay in common conversation very frequent approaches are made to it when we say the ground thirsts for rain or the earth smiles with plenty when we speak of ambitions being restless or a disease being deceitful such expressions show the facility with which the mind can accommodate the properties of living creatures to things that are inanimate or to abstract conceptions of its own forming  indeed it is very remarkable that there is a wonderful proneness in human nature to animate all objects whether this arises from a sort of assimilating principle from a propension to spread a resemblance of ourselves over all other things or from whatever other cause it arises so it is that almost every emotion which in the least agitates the mind bestows upon its object a momentary idea of life let a man by an unwary step sprain his ankle or hurt his foot upon a stone and in the ruffled discomposed moment he will sometimes feel himself disposed to break the stone in pieces or to utter passionate expressions against it as if it had done him an injury if one has been long accustomed to a certain set of objects which have made a strong impression on his imagination as to a house where he has passed many agreeable years or to fields and trees and mountains among which he has often walked with the greatest delight when he is obliged to part with them especially if he has no prospect of ever seeing them again he can scarce avoid having somewhat of the same feeling as when he is leaving old friends they seem endowed with life they become objects of his affection and in the moment of his parting it scarce seems absurd to him to give vent to his feeling in words and to take a formal adieu  so strong is that impression of life which is made upon us by the more magnificent and striking objects of nature especially that i doubt not in the least of this having been one cause of the multiplication of divinities in the heathen world dryads and naiads the genius of the wood and the god of the river were in men of lively imaginations in the early ages of the world easily grafted upon this turn of mind when their favorite rural objects had often been animated in their fancy it was an easy transition to attribute to them some real divinity some unseen power or genius which inhabited them or in some peculiar manner belonged to them imagination was highly gratified by thus gaining somewhat to rest upon with more stability and when belief coincided so much with imagination very slight causes would be sufficient to establish it  from this deduction may be easily seen how it comes to pass that personification makes so great a figure in all compositions where imagination or passion have any concern on innumerable occasions it is the very language of imagination and passion and therefore deserves to be attended to and examined with peculiar care there are three different degrees of this figure which it is necessary to remark and distinguish in order to determine the propriety of its use the first is when some of the properties or qualities of living creatures are ascribed to inanimate objects the second when those inanimate objects are introduced as acting like such as have life and the third when they are represented either as speaking to us or as listening to what we say to them  the first and lowest degree of this figure consists in ascribing to inanimate objects some of the qualities of living creatures where this is done as is most commonly the case in a word or two and by way of an epithet added to the object as a raging storm a deceitful disease a cruel disaster etc it raises the style so little that the humblest discourse will admit it without any force this indeed is such an obscure degree of personification that one may doubt whether it deserves the name and might not be classed with simple metaphors which escape in a manner unnoticed happily employed however it sometimes adds beauty and sprightliness to an expression as in this line of virgil aut conjurato descendens dacus ab istro geor ii     where the personal epithet conjurato applied to the river istro is infinitely more poetical than if it had been applied to the person thus aut conjuratus descendens dacus ab istro a very little taste will make any one feel the difference between these two lines  the next degree of this figure is when we introduce inanimate objects acting like those that have life here we rise a step higher and the personification becomes sensible according to the nature of the action which we attribute to those inanimate objects and the particularity with which we describe it such is the strength of the figure when pursued to any length it belongs only to studied harangues to highly figured and eloquent discourse when slightly touched it may be admitted into subjects of less elevation cicero for instance speaking of the cases where killing another is lawful in selfdefence uses the following words aliquando nobis gladius ad occidendum hominem ab ipsis porrigitur legibus orat pro milone the expression is happy the laws are personified as reaching forth their hand to give us a sword for putting one to death such short personifications as these may be admitted even into moral treatises or works of cool reasoning and provided they be easy and not strained and that we be not cloyed with too frequent returns of them they have a good effect on style and render it both strong and lively  the genius of our language gives us an advantage in the use of this figure as with us no substantive nouns have gender or are masculine and feminine except the proper names of male and female creatures by giving a gender to any inanimate object or abstract idea that is in place of the pronoun it using the personal pronouns he or she we presently raise the style and begin personification in solemn discourse this can often be done to good purpose when speaking of religion or virtue or our country or any such object of dignity i shall give a remarkably fine example from a sermon of bishop sherlocks where we shall see natural religion beautifully personified and be able to judge from it of the spirit and grace which this figure when well conducted bestows on a discourse i must take notice at the same time that it is an instance of this figure carried as far as prose even in its highest elevation will admit and therefore suited only to compositions where the great efforts of eloquence are allowed the author is comparing together our savior and mahomet go says he to your natural religion lay before her mahomet and his disciples arrayed in armor and blood riding in triumph over the spoils of thousands who fell by his victorious sword show her the cities which he set in flames the countries which he ravaged and destroyed and the miserable distress of all the inhabitants of the earth when she has viewed him in this scene carry her into his retirement show her the prophets chamber his concubines and his wives and let her hear him allege revelation and a divine commission to justify his adultery and lust when she is tired with this prospect then show her the blessed jesus humble and meek doing good to all the sons of men let her see him in his most retired privacies let her follow him to the mount and hear his devotions and supplications to god carry her to his table to view his poor fare and hear his heavenly discourse let her attend him to the tribunal and consider the patience with which he endured the scoffs and reproaches of his enemies lead her to his cross let her view him in the agony of death and hear his last prayer for his persecutors father forgive them for they know not what they do  when natural religion has thus viewed both ask her which is the prophet of god but her answer we have already had when she saw part of this scene through the eyes of the centurion who attended at the cross by him she spoke and said truly this man was the son of god bishop sherlocks sermons vol i disc ix  this is more than elegant it is truly sublime the whole passage is animated and the figure rises at the conclusion when natural religion who before was only a spectator is introduced as speaking by the centurions voice it has the better effect too that it occurs at the conclusion of a discourse where we naturally look for most warmth and dignity did bishop sherlocks sermons or indeed any english sermons whatever afford us many passages equal to this we should oftener have recourse to them for instances of the beauty of composition  hither to we have spoken of prose in poetry personifications of this kind are extremely frequent and are indeed the life and soul of it we expect to find every thing animated in the descriptions of a poet who has a lively fancy accordingly homer the father and prince of poets is remarkable for the use of this figure war peace darts spears towns rivers every thing in short is alive in his writings the same is the case with milton and shakespeare no personification in any author is more striking or introduced on a more proper occasion than the following of miltons on occasion of eves eating the forbidden fruit so saying her rash hand in evil hour forth reaching to the fruit she plucked she eat earth felt the wound and nature from her seat sighing through all her works gave signs of woe that all was lost  ix   0 all the circumstances and ages of men poverty riches youth old age all the dispositions and passions melancholy love grief contentment are capable of being personified in poetry with great propriety of this we meet with frequent examples in miltons allegro and penseroso parnells hymn to contentment thomsons seasons and all the good poets nor indeed is it easy to set any bounds to personifications of this kind in poetry  one of the greatest pleasures we receive from poetry is to find ourselves always in the midst of our fellows and to see every thing thinking feeling and acting as we ourselves do this is perhaps the principal charm of this sort of figured style that it introduces us into society with all nature and interests us even in inanimate objects by forming a connection between them and us through that sensibility which it ascribes to them this is exemplified in the following beautiful passage of thomsons summer wherein the life which he bestows upon all nature when describing the effects of the rising sun renders the scenery uncommonly gay and interesting but yonder comes the powerful king of day rejoicing in the east the lessening cloud the kindling azure and the mountains brim tipped with ethereal gold his near approach betoken glad   by thee refined in brisker measures the relucent stream frisks over the mead the precipice abrupt projecting horror on the blackened flood softens at thy return the desert joys wildly through all his melancholy bounds rude ruins glitter and the briny deep seen from some pointed promontorys top reflects from every fluctuating wave a glance extensive as the day  the same effect is remarkable in that fine passage of milton  to the nuptial bower i led her blushing like the morn all heaven and happy constellations on that hour shed their selectest influence the earth gave signs of gratulation and each hill joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs whispered it to the woods and from their wings flung rose flung odor from the spicy shrub disporting    the third and highest degree of this figure remains to be mentioned when inanimate objects are introduced not only as feeling and acting but as speaking to us or hearing and listening when we address ourselves to them this though on several occasions far from being unnatural is however more difficult in the execution than the other kinds of personification for this is plainly the boldest of all rhetorical figures it is the style of a strong passion only and therefore never to be attempted unless when the mind is considerably heated and agitated a slight personification of some inanimate thing acting as if it had life can be relished by the mind in the midst of cool description and when its ideas are going on in the ordinary train but it must be in a state of violent emotion and have departed considerably from its common tract of thought before it can so far realise the personification of an insensible object as to conceive it listening to what we say or making any return to us all strong passions however have a tendency to use this figure not only love anger and indignation but even those which are seemingly more dispiriting such as grief remorse and melancholy for all passions struggle for vent and if they can find no other object will rather than be silent pour themselves forth to woods and rocks and the most insensible things especially if these be any how connected with the causes and objects that have thrown the mind into this agitation hence in poetry where the greatest liberty is allowed to the language of passion it is easy to produce many beautiful examples of this figure milton affords us an extremely fine one in that moving and tender address which eve makes to paradise just before she is compelled to leave it oh unexpected stroke worse than of death must i thus leave thee paradise thus leave thee native soil these happy walks and shades fit haunt of gods where i had hope to spend quiet though sad the respite of that day which must be mortal to us both o flowers that never will in other climate grow my early visitation and my last at even which i bred up with tender hand from your first opening buds and gave you names who now shall rear you to the sun or rank your tribes and water from the ambrosial fount book ii l     this is altogether the language of nature and of female passion it is observable that all plaintive passions are peculiarly prone to the use of this figure the complaints which philoctetes in sophocles pours out to the rocks and caves of lemnos amidst the excess of his grief and despair are remarkably fine examples of it     etc o mountains rivers rocks and savage herds to you i speak to you alone i now must breathe my sorrows you are wont to hear my sad complaints and i will tell you all that i have suffered from achilles son franklin  and there are frequent examples not in poetry only but in real life of persons when just about to suffer death taking a passionate farewell of the sun moon and stars or other sensible objects around them  there are two great rules for the management of this sort of personification the first rule is never to attempt it unless when prompted by strong passion and never to continue it when the passion begins to flag it is one of those high ornaments which can only find place in the most warm and spirited parts of composition and there too must be employed with moderation  the second rule is never to personify any object in this way but such as has some dignity in itself and can make a proper figure in this elevation to which we raise it the observance of this rule is required even in the lower degrees of personification but still more when an address is made to the personified object to address the corpse of a deceased friend is natural but to address the clothes which he wore introduces mean and degrading ideas so also addressing the several parts of ones body as if they were animated is not congruous to the dignity of passion for this reason i must condemn the following passage in a very beautiful poem of mr popes eloisa to abelard dear fatal name rest ever unreveald nor pass these lips in holy silence sealed hide it my heart within that close disguise where mixed with gods his loved idea lies oh write it not my hand  his name appears already written  blot it out my tears here are several different objects and parts of the body personified and each of them are addressed or spoken to let us consider with what propriety the first is the name of abelard dear fatal name rest ever etc to this no reasonable objection can be made for as the name of a person often stands for the person himself and suggests the same ideas it can bear this personification with sufficient dignity next eloisa speaks to herself and personifies her heart for this purpose hide it my heart within that close etc as the heart is a dignified part of the human frame and is often put for the mind or affections this also may pass without blame but when from her heart she passes to her hand and tells her hand not to write his name this is forced and unnatural a personified hand is low and not in the style of true passion and the figure becomes still worse when in the last place she exhorts her tears to blot out what her hand had written oh write it not etc there is in these two lines an air of epigrammatic conceit which native passion never suggests and which is altogether unsuitable to the tenderness which breathes through the rest of that exellent poem  in prose compositions this figure requires to be used with still greater moderation and delicacy the same liberty is not allowed to the imagination there as in poetry the same assistances cannot be obtained for raising passion to its proper height by the force of numbers and the glow of style however addresses to inanimate objects are not excluded from prose but have their place only in the higher species of oratory a public speaker may on some occasions very properly address religion or virtue or his native country or some city or province which has suffered perhaps great calamities or been the scene of some memorable action but we must remember that as such addresses are among the highest efforts of eloquence they should never be attempted unless by persons of more than ordinary genius for if the orator fails in his design of moving our passions by them he is sure of being laughed at of all frigid things the most frigid are the awkward and unseasonable attempts sometimes made toward such kinds of personification especially if they be long continued we see the writer or speaker toiling and laboring to express the language of some passion which he neither feels himself nor can make us feel we remain not only cold but frozen and are at full leisure to criticize on the ridiculous figure which the personified object makes when we ought to have been transported with a glow of enthusiasm some of the french writers particularly bossuet and flechier in their sermons and funeral orations have attempted and executed this figure not without warmth and dignity their works are exceedingly worthy of being consulted for instances of this and of several other ornaments of style indeed the vivacity and ardour of the french genius is more suited to this animated kind of oratory than the more correct but more phlegmatic genius of the british who in their prose works very rarely attempt any of the high figures of eloquence in the oraisons funebres de m bossuet which i consider as one of the masterpieces of modern eloquence apostrophes and addresses to personified objects frequently occur and are supported with much spirit thus for instance in the funeral oration of mary of austria queen of france the author addresses algiers in the prospect of the advantage which the arms of louis xiv were to gain over it avaunt lui la france presque sans vaisseaux tenoit en vain aux deux mers maintenant on les voit convertes depuis le levant jusquau couchant de nos flottes victorieuses and la hardiesse francoise port par tout la terreur avec le nom de louis tu cederas tu tomberas sous ce vainqueur alger rich des depouilles de la chretiente tu disois en ton coeur avare je tiens le mer sous ma loix and les nations sont ma proie la legerete de tes vaisseaux te donnoit de la confiance mais tu te verras attaque dans tes murailles comme un oisseau ravissant quon iroit chercher parmi ses rochers and dans son nid ou il partage son butin a ses petits tu rends deja tes esclaves louis a brise les fers dont tu acablois ses sujets etc in another passage of the same oration he thus apostrophizes the isle of pheasants which had been rendered famous by being the scene of those conferences in which the treaty of the pyrenees between france and spain and the marriage of this princess with the king of france were concluded isle pacifique ou se doivent terminer les differends de deux grands empires a qui tu sers de limits isle eternellement memorable par les conferences de deux grands ministres  auguste journee ou deux fieres nations long tems ennemis et alors reconciliees par marie therese savancent sur leur confins leur rois a leur tete non plus pour se combattre mais pour sembrasser  fetes sacrees marriage fortune voile nuptial benediction sacrifice puisje meler aujourdhui vos ceremonies et vos pompes avec ces pompes funebres and le comble des grandeurs avec leur ruins in the funeral oration of henrietta queen of england which is perhaps the noblest of all his compositions after recounting all she had done to support her unfortunate husband he concludes with this beautiful apostrophe o mere o femme o reine admirable and digne dune meilleure fortune si les fortunes de la terre etoient quelque chose enfin il faut ceder a votre sort vous avez assez soutenu letat qui est attaque par une force invincible et divine il ne rest plus desormais si non que vous teniez ferme parmi ses ruins  so much for personifications or prosopopoeia in all its different forms  apostrophe is a figure so much of the same kind that it will not require many words it is an address to a real person but one who is either absent or dead as if he were present and listening to us it is so much allied to an address to inanimate objects personified that both these figures are sometimes called apostrophes however the proper apostrophe is in boldness one degree lower than the address to personified objects for it certainly requires a less effort of imagination to suppose persons present who are dead or absent than to animate insensible beings and direct our discourse to them both figures are subject to the same rule of being prompted by passion in order to render them natural for both are the language of passion or strong emotions only among the poets apostrophe is frequent as in virgil  pereunt hypanisque dymasque confixi a sociis nec te tua plurima pantheu labentem pietas nec apollinis infula texit nor pantheus thee thy mitre nor the bands of awful phoebus saved from impious hands dryden    the poems of ossian are full of the most beautiful instances of this figure weep on the rocks of roaring winds o maid of inistore bend thy fair head over the waves thou fairer than the ghost of the hills when it moves in a sunbeam at noon over the silence of morven he is fallen thy youth is low pale beneath the sword of cuchullin fingal b i  quinctilian affords us a very fine example in prose when in the beginning of his sixth book deploring the untimely death of his son which had happened during the course of the work he makes a very moving and tender apostrophe to him nam quo ille animo qua medicorum admiratione mensium octo valetudinem tulit ut me in supremis consolatus est quam etiam jam deficiens jamque non noster ipsum illum alienatae mentis errorem circa solas literas habuit tuosne ergo o meae spes inanes labentes oculos tuum fugientem spiritum vidi tuum corpus frigidum exangue complexus animam recipere auramque communem haurire amplius potui tene consulari nuper adoptione ad omnium spes honorum patris admotum te avunculo praetori

months his lingering distress with what tender attention did he study even in the last extremity to comfort me and when no longer himself how affecting was it to behold the disordered efforts of his wandering mind wholly employed on subjects of literature ah my frustrated and fallen hopes have i then beheld your closing eyes and heard the last groan issue from your lips after having embraced your cold and breathless body how was it in my power to draw the vital air or continue to drag a miserable life when i had just beheld you raised by consular adoption to the prospect of all your fathers honors destined to be soninlaw to your uncle the praetor pointed out by general expectation as the successful candidate for the prize of atttic eloquence in this moment of your opening honors must i lose you for ever and remain an unhappy parent surviving only to suffer woe  in this passage quinctilian shows the true genius of an orator as much as he does elsewhere that of the critic  for such bold figures of discourse as strong personifications addresses to personified objects and apostrophes the glowing imagination of the ancient oriental nations was particularly fitted hence in the sacred scriptures we find some very remarkable instances o thou sword of the lord how long will it be ere thou be quiet put thyself up into thy scabbard rest and be still how can it be quiet seeing the lord has given it a charge against ashkelon and against the seashore there has he appointed it jer xlvii      there is one passage in particular which i must not omit to mention because it contains a greater assemblage of sublime ideas of bold and daring figures than is perhaps any where to be met with it is in the fourteenth chapter of isaiah where the prophet thus describes the fall of the assyrian empire thou shall take up this proverb against the king of babylon and say how has the oppressor ceased the golden city ceased the lord has broken the staff of the wicked and the scepter of the rulers he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke he that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hinders the whole earth is at rest and is quiet they break forth into singing yea the firtrees rejoice at thee and the cedars of lebanon saying since thou art laid down no feller is come up against us hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stirs up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations all they shall speak and say unto thee art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto us thy pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy viols the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover thee how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations for thou have said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners all the kings of the nations even all of them lie in glory every one in his own house but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as the raiment of those that are slain thrust through with a sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a carcass trodden under feet this whole passage is full of sublimity every object is animated a variety of personages are introduced we hear the jews the firtrees and cedars of lebanon the ghosts of departed kings the king of babylon himself and those who look upon his body all speaking in their order and acting their different parts without confusion  lecture xvii comparison antithesis interrogation exclamation and other figures of speech we are still engaged in the consideration of figures of speech which as they add much to the beauty of style when properly employed and are at the same time liable to be greatly abused require a careful discussion as it would be tedious to dwell on all the variety of figurative expressions which rhetoricians have enumerated i chose to select the capital figures such as occur most frequently and to make my remarks on these the principles and rules laid down concerning them will sufficiently direct as to the use of the rest either in prose or poetry of metaphor which is the most common of them all i treated fully and in the last lecture i discoursed of hyperbole personification and apostrophe this lecture will nearly finish what remains on the head of figures  comparison or simile is what i am to treat of first a figure frequently employed both by poets and prose writers for the ornament of composition in a former lecture i explained fully the difference betwixt this and metaphor a metaphor is a comparised implied but not expressed as such as when i say achilles is a lion meaning that he resembles one in courage or strength a comparison is when the resemblance between two objects is expressed in form and generally pursued more fully than the nature of a metaphor admits as when i say the actions of princes are like those great rivers the course of which every one beholds but their springs have been seen by few this slight instance will show that a happy comparison is a kind of sparkling ornament which adds not a little luster and beauty to discourse and hence such figures are termed by cicero orationis lumina  the pleasure we take in comparisons is just and natural we may remark three different sources whence it arises first from the pleasure which nature has annexed to that act of the mind by which we compare any two objects together trace resemblances among those that are different and differences among those that resemble each other a pleasure the final cause of which is to prompt us to remark and observe and thereby to make us advance in useful knowledge this operation of the mind is naturally and universally agreeable as appears from the delight which even children have in comparing things together as soon as they are capable of attending to the objects that surround them secondly the pleasure of comparison arises from the illustration which the simile employed gives to the principal object from the clearer view of it which it presents or the more strong impression of it which it stamps upon the mind and thirdly it arises from the introduction of a new and commonly a splendid object associated to the principal one of which we treat and from the agreeable picture which that object presents to the fancy new scenes being thereby brought into view which without the assistance of this figure we could not have enjoyed  all comparisons whatever may be reduced under two heads explaining and embellishing comparisons for when a writer likens the object of which he treats to any other thing it always is or at least always should be with a view either to make us understand that object more distinctly or to dress it up and adorn it all manner of subjects admit of explaining comparisons let an author be reasoning ever so strictly or treating the most abstruse point in philosophy he may very properly introduce a comparison merely with a view to make his subject be better understood of this nature is the following in mr harriss hermes employed to explain a very abstract point the distinction between the powers of sense and imagination in the human mind as wax says he would not be adequate to the purpose of signatures if it had not the power to retain as well as to receive the impression the same holds of the soul with respect to sense and imagination sense is its receptive power imagination its retentive had it sense without imagination it would not be as wax but as water where though all impressions be instantly made yet as soon as they are made they are instantly lost in comparisons of this nature the understanding is concerned much more than the fancy and therefore the only rules to be observed with respect to them are that they be clear and that they be useful that they tend to render our conception of the principal object more distinct and that they do not lead our view aside and bewilder it with any false light  but embellishing comparisons introduced not so much with a view to inform and instruct as to adorn the subject of which we treat are those with which we are chiefly concerned at present as figures of speech and those indeed which most frequently occur resemblance as i before mentioned is the foundation of this figure we must not however take resemblance in too strict a sense for actual similitude or likeness of appearance two objects may sometimes be very happily compared to one another though they resemble each other strictly speaking in nothing only because they agree in the effects which they produce upon the mind because they raise a train of similar or what may be called concordant ideas so that the remembrance of the one when recalled serves to strengthen the impression made by the other for example to describe the nature of soft and melancholy music ossian says the music of carryl was like the memory of joys that are past pleasant and mournful to the soul this is happy and delicate yet surely no kind of music has any resemblance to a feeling of the mind such as the memory of past joys had it been compared to the voice of the nightingale or the murmur of the stream as it would have been by some ordinary poet the likeness would have been more strict but by founding his simile upon the effect which carryls music produced the poet while he conveys a very tender image gives us at the same time a much stronger impression of the nature and strain of that music like the memory of joys that are past pleasant and mournful to the soul  in general whether comparisons be founded on the similitude of the two objects compared or on some analogy and agreement in their effects the fundamental requisite of a comparison is that it shall serve to illustrate the object for the sake of which it is introduced and to give us a stronger conception of it some little excursions of fancy may be permitted in pursuing the simile but they must never deviate far from the principal object if it be a great and noble one every circumstance in the comparison must tend to aggrandise it if it be a beautiful one to render it more amiable if terrible to fill us with more awe but to be a little more particular the rules to be given concerning comparisons respect chiefly two articles the propriety of their introduction and the nature of the objects whence they are taken  first the propriety of their introduction from what has been already said of comparisons it appears that they are not like the figures of which i treated in the last lecture the language of strong passion no they are the language of imagination rather than of passion of an imagination sprightly indeed and warmed but undisturbed by any violent or agitating emotion strong passion is too severe to admit this play of fancy it has no leisure to cast about for resembling objects it dwells on that object which has seized and taken possession of the soul it is too much occupied and filled by it to turn its view aside or to fix its attention on any other thing an author therefore can scarcely commit a greater fault than in the midst of passion to introduce a simile metaphorical expression may be allowable in such a situation though even this may be carried too far but the pomp and solemnity of a formal comparison is altogether a stranger to passion it changes the key in a moment relaxes and brings down the mind and shows us a writer perfectly at his ease while he is personating some other who is supposed to be under the torment of agitation our writers of tragedies are very apt to err here in some of mr rowes plays these flowers of similes have been strewed unseasonably mr addisons cato too is justly censurable in this respect as when portius just after lucia had bid him farewell for ever and when he should naturally have been represented as in the most violent anguish makes his reply in a studied and affected comparison thus over the dying lamp the unsteady flame hangs quivering on a point leaps off by fits and falls again as loath to quit its hold thou must not go my soul still hovers over thee and cannot get loose every one must be sensible that this is quite remote from the language of nature on such occasions  however as comparison is not the style of strong passion so neither when employed for embellishment is it the language of a mind wholly unmoved it is a figure of dignity and always requires some elevation in the subject in order to make it proper for it supposes the imagination to be uncommonly enlivened though the heart be not agitated by passion in a word the proper place of comparisons lies in the middle region between the highly pathetic and the very humble style this is a wide field and gives ample range to the figure but even this field we must take care not to overstock with it for as was before said it is a sparkling ornament and all things that sparkle dazzle and fatigue if they recur too often similies should even in poetry be used with moderation but in prose writings much more otherwise the style will become disgustingly luscious and the ornament lose its virtue and effect  i proceed next to the rules that relate to objects whence comparisons should be drawn supposing them introduced in their proper place  in the first place they must not be drawn from things which have too near and obvious a resemblance to the object with which we compare them the great pleasure of the act of comparing lies in discovering likenesses among things of different species where we would not at the first glance expect a resemblance there is little art or ingenuity in pointing out the resemblance of two objects that are so much akin or lie so near to one another in nature that every one sees they must be like when milton compares satans appearance after his fall to that of the sun suffering an eclipse and affrighting the nations with portentous darkness we are struck with the happiness and the dignity of the similitude but when he compares eves bower in paradise to the arbor of pomona or eve herself to a dryad or woodnymph we receive little entertainment as every one sees that one arbor must of course in several respects resemble another arbor and one beautiful woman another beautiful woman  among similies faulty through too great obviousness of the likeness we must likewise rank those which are taken from objects become trite and familiar in poetical language such are the similies of a hero to a lion of a person in sorrow to a flower drooping its head of violent passion to a tempest of chastity to snow of virtue to the sun or the stars and many more of this kind with which we are sure to find modern writers of second rate genius abounding plentifully handed down from every writer of verses to another as by hereditary right these comparisons were at first perhaps very proper for the purposes to which they are applied in the ancient original poets who took them directly from nature not from their predecessors they had beauty but they are now beaten our ears are so accustomed to them that they give no amusement to the fancy there is indeed no mark by which we can more readily distinguish a poet of true genius from one of a barren imagination than by the strain of their comparisons all who call themselves poets affect them but whereas a mere versifier copies no new image from nature which appears to his uninventive genius exhausted by those who have gone before him and therefore contents himself with humbly following their tract to an author of real fancy nature seems to unlock spontaneously her hidden stores and the eye quick glancing from earth to heaven discovers new shapes and forms new likenesses between objects unobserved before which render his similies original expressive and lively  but in the second place as comparisons ought not to be founded on likenesses too obvious still less ought they to be founded on those which are too faint and remote for these in place of assisting strain the fancy to comprehend them and throw no light upon the subject it is also to be observed that a comparison which in the principal circumstances carries a sufficiently near resemblance may become unnatural and obscure if pushed too far nothing is more opposite to the design of this figure than to hunt after a great number of coincidences in minute points merely to show how far the poets wit can stretch the resemblance this is mr cowleys common fault whose comparisons generally run out so far as to become rather a studied exercise of wit than an illustration of the principal object we need only open his works his odes especially to find instances every where  in the third place the object from which a comparison is drawn should never be an unknown object or one of which few people can form clear ideas ad inferendam rebus lucem says quinctilian repertae sunt similitudines praecipue igitur est custodiendum ne id quod similitudinis gratia ascivimus aut obscurum sit aut ignotum debet enim id quod illustrandae alterius rei gratia assumitur ipsum esse clarius eo quod illuminatur comparisons have been introduced into discourse for the sake of throwing light on the subject we must therefore be much on our guard not to employ as the ground of our simile any object which is either obscure or unknown that surely which is used for the purpose of illustrating some other thing ought to be more obvious and plain than the thing intended to be illustrated  comparisons therefore founded on philosophical discoveries or on any thing which persons of a certain trade only or a certain profession are conversant attain not their proper effect they should be taken from those illustrious noted objects which most of the readers either have seen or can strongly conceive this leads me to remark a fault of which modern poets are very apt to be guilty the ancients took their similies from that face of nature and that class of objects with which they and their readers were acquainted hence lions and wolves and serpents were fruitful and very proper sources of similies amongst them and these having become a sort of consecrated classical images are very commonly adopted by the moderns injudiciously however for the propriety of them is now in a great measure lost it is only at second hand and by description that we are acquainted with many of those objects and to most readers of poetry it were more to the purpose to describe lions or serpents by similies taken from men than to describe men by lions nowadays we can much easier form the conception of a fierce combat between two men than between a bull and a tiger every country has a scenery peculiar to itself and the imagery of every good poet will exhibit it the introduction of unknown objects or of a foreign scenery betrays a poet copying not after nature but from other writers i have only to observe further  in the fourth place that in compositions of a serious or elevated kind similies should never be taken from low or mean objects these are degrading whereas similies are commonly intended to embellish and to dignify and therefore unless in burlesque writings or where similies are introduced purposely to vilify and diminish an object mean ideas should never be presented to us some of homers comparisons have been taxed without reason on this account for it is to be remembered that the meanness or dignity of objects depends in a great degree on the ideas and manners of the age wherein we live many similies therefore drawn from the incidents of rural life which appear low to us had abundance of dignity in those simpler ages of antiquity  i have now considered such of the figures of speech as seemed most to merit a full and particular discussion metaphor hyperbole personification apostrophe and comparison a few more yet remain to be mentioned the proper use and conduct of which will be easily understood from the principles already laid down  as comparison is founded on the resemblance so antithesis on the contrast or opposition of two objects contrast has always this effect to make each of the contrasted objects appear in the stronger light white for instance never appears so bright as when it is opposed to black and when both are viewed together antithesis therefore may on many occasions be employed to advantage in order to strengthen the impression which we intend that any object should make thus cicero in his oration for milo representing the improbability of milos forming a design to take away the life of clodius at a time when all circumstances were unfavourable to such a design and after he had let other oppunities slip when he could have executed the same design if he had formed it with much more ease and safety heightens our conviction of this improbability by a skilful use of this figure quem igitur cum omnium gratia interficere noluit hunc voluit cum aliquorum querela quem jure quem loco quem tempore quem impune non est ausus hunc injuria iniquo loco alieno tempore periculo capitis non dubitavit occidere is it credible that when he declined putting clodius to death with the consent of all he would choose to do it with the disapprobation of many can you believe that the person whom he scrupled to slay when he might have done so with full justice in a convenient place at a proper time with secure impunity he made no scruple to murder against justice in an unfavourable place at an unseasonable time and at the risque of capital condemnation  in order to render an antithesis more complete it is always of advantage that the words and members of the sentence expressing the contrasted objects be as in this instance of ciceros similarly constructed and made to correspond to each other this leads us to remark the contrast more by setting the things which we oppose more clearly over against each other in the same manner as when we contrast a black and a white object in order to perceive the full difference of their color we would choose to have both objects of the same bulk and placed in the same light their resemblance to each other in certain circumstances makes their disagreement in others more palpable  at the same time i must observe that the frequent use of antithesis pecially where the opposition in the words is nice and quaint is apt to render style disagreeable such a sentence as the following from seneca does very well where it stands alone si quem volueris esse divitem non est quod augeas divitias sed minuas cupiditates if you seek to make one rich study not to increase his stores but to diminish his desires  or this si ad naturam vives nunquam eris pauper si ad opinionem nunquam dives if you regulate your desires according to the standard of nature you will never be poor if according to the standard of opinion you will never be rich  a maxim or moral saying properly enough receives this form both because it is supposed to be the fruit of meditation and because it is designed to be engraven on the memory which recalls it more easily by the help of such contrasted expressions but where a string of such sentences succeed each other where this becomes an authors favorite and prevailing manner of expressing himself his style is faulty and it is upon this account seneca has been often and justly censured such a style appears too studied and labored it gives us the impression of an author attending more to his manner of saying things than to the things themselves which he says dr young though a writer of real genius was too fond of antitheses in his estimate of human life we find whole pages that run in such a strain as this the peasant complains aloud the courtier in secret repines in want what distress in affluence what satiety the great are under as much difficulty to expend with pleasure as the mean to labor with success the ignorant through illgrounded hope are disappointed the knowing through knowledge despond ignorance occasions mistake mistake disappointment and disappointment is misery knowledge on the other hand gives true judgment and true judgment of human things gives a demonstration of their insufficiency to our peace there is too much glitter in such a style as this to please long we are fatigued by attending to such quaint and artificial sentences often repeated  there is another sort of antithesis the beauty of which consists in surprising us by the unexpected contrasts of things which it brings together much wit may be shown in this but it belongs wholly to pieces of professed wit and humor and can find no place in grave compositions mr pope who is remarkably fond of antithesis is often happy in this use of the figure so in his rape of the lock whether the nymph shall break dianas law or some frail china jar receive a flaw or stain her honor or her new brocade forget her prayers or miss a masquerade or lose her heart or necklace at a ball or whether heaven has doomed that shock must fall what is called the point of an epigram consists for most part in some antithesis of this kind surprising us with the smart and unexpected turn which it gives to the thought and in the fewer words it is brought out it is always the happier  comparisons and antitheses are figures of a cool nature the productions of imagination not of passion interrogations and exclamations of which i am next to speak are passionate figures they are indeed on so many occasions the native language of passion that their use is extremely frequent and in ordinary conversation when men are heated they prevail as much as in the most sublime oratory the unfigured literal use of interrogation is to ask a question but when men are prompted by passion whatever they would affirm or deny with great vehemence they naturally put in the form of a question expressing thereby the strongest confidence of the truth of their own sentiment and appealing to their hearers for the impossibility of the contrary thus in scripture god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent has he said it and shall he not do it has he spoken it and shall he not make it good numbers chap xxiii ver     so demosthenes addressing himself to the athenians tell me will you still go about and ask one another what news what can be more astonishing news than this that the man of macedon makes war upon the athenians and disposes of the affairs of greece  is philip dead no but he is sick what signifies it to you whether he be dead or alive for if any thing happens to this philip you will immediately raise up another all this delivered without interrogation had been faint and ineffectual but the warmth and eagerness which this questioning method expresses awakens the hearers and strikes them with much greater force  interrogations may often be employed with propriety in the course of no higher emotions than naturally arise in pursuing some close and earnest reasoning but exclamations belong only to stronger emotions of the mind to surprise admiration anger joy grief and the like heu pietas heu prisca fides invictaque bello dextera both interrogation and exclamation and indeed all passionate figures of speech operate upon us by means of sympathy sympathy is a very powerful and extensive principle in our nature disposing us to enter into every feeling and passion which we behold expressed by others hence a single person coming into company with strong marks either of melancholy or joy upon his countenance will diffuse that passion in a moment through the whole circle hence in a great crowd passions are so easily caught and so fast spread by that powerful contagion which the animated looks cries and gestures of a multitude never fail to carry now interrogations and exclamations being natural signs of a moved and agitated mind always when they are properly used dispose us to sympathise with the dispositions of those who use them and to feel as they feel  from this it follows that the great rule with regard to the conduct of such figures is that the writer attend to the manner in which nature dictates to us to express any emotion or passion and that he give his language that turn and no other above all that he never affect the style of a passion which he does not feel with interrogations he may use a good deal of freedom these as above observed falling in so much with the ordinary course of language and reasoning even when no great vehemence is supposed to have place in the mind but with respect to exclamations he must be more reserved nothing has a worse effect than the frequent and unseasonable use of them raw juvenile writers imagine that by pouring them forth often they render their compositions warm and animated whereas quite the contrary follows they render it frigid to excess when an author is always calling upon us to enter into transports which he has said nothing to inspire we are both disgusted and enraged at him he raises no sympathy for he gives us no passion of his own in which we can take part he gives us words and not passion and of course can raise no passion unless that of indignation hence i incline to think he was not much mistaken who said that when on looking into a book he found the pages thick bespangled with the point which is called punctum admirationis he judged this to be a sufficient reason for his laying it aside and indeed were it not for the help of this punctum admirationis with which many writers of the rapturous kind so much abound one would be often at a loss to discover whether or not it was exclamation which they aimed at for it has now become a fashion among these writers to subjoin points of admiration to sentences which contain nothing but simple affirmations or propositions as if by an affected method of pointing they could transform them in the readers mind into high figures of eloquence much akin to this is another contrivance practiced by some writers of separating almost all the members of their sentences from each other by blank lines as if by setting them thus asunder they bestowed some special importance upon them and required us in going along to make a pause at every other word and weigh it well this i think may be called a typographical figure of speech neither indeed since we have been led to mention the arts of writers for increasing the importance of their words does another custom which prevailed very much some time ago seem worthy of imitation i mean that of distinguishing the significant words in every sentence by italick characters on some occasions it is very proper to use such distinctions but when we carry them so far as to mark with them every supposed emphatical word these words are apt to multiply so fast in the authors imagination that every page is crowded with italicks which can produce no effect whatever but to hurt the eye and create confusion indeed if the sense point out the most emphatical expressions a variation in the type especially when occurring so frequently will give small aid and accordingly the most masterly writers of late have with good reason laid aside all those feeble props of significancy and trusted wholly to the weight of their sentiments for commanding attention but to return from this digression  another figure of speech proper only to animated and warm composition is what some critical writers call vision when in place of relating something that is past we use the present tense and describe it as actually passing before our eyes thus cicero in his fourth oration against catiline videor enim mihi hanc urbem videre lucem orbis terrarum atque arcem omnium gentium subito uno incendio concidentem cerno animo sepulta in patria miseros atque insepultos acervos civium versatur mihi ante oculos aspectus cethegi et furor in vestra caede bacchantis i seem to myself to behold this city the ornament of the earth and the capital of all nations suddenly involved on one conflagration i see before me the slaughtered heaps of citizens lying unburied in the midst of their ruined country the furious countenance of cethegus rises to my view while with a savage joy he is triumphing in your miseries  this manner of description supposes a sort of enthusiasm which carries the person who describes in some measure out of himself and when well executed must needs impress the reader or hearer strongly by the force of that sympathy which i have before explained but in order to a successful execution it requires an uncommonly warm imagination and such a happy selection of circumstances as shall make us think we see before our eyes the scene that is described otherwise it shares the same fate with all feeble attempts toward passionate figures that of throwing ridicule upon the author and leaving the reader more cool and uninterested than he was before the same observations are to be applied to repetition suspension correction and many more of those figurative forms of speech which rhetoricians have enumerated among the beauties of eloquence they are beautiful or not exactly in proportion as they are native expressions of the sentiment or passion intended to be heightened by them let nature and passion always speak their own language and they will suggest figures in abundance but when we seek to counterfeit a warmth which we do not feel no figures will either supply the defect or conceal the imposture  there is one figure and i shall mention no more of frequent use among all public speakers particularly at the bar which quinctilian insists upon considerably and calls amplification it consists in an artful exaggeration of all the circumstances of some object or action which we want to place in a strong light either a good or a bad one it is not so properly one figure as the skilful management of several which we make to tend to one point it may be carried on by a proper use of magnifying or extenuating terms by a regular enumeration of particulars or by throwing together as into one mass a crowd of circumstances by suggesting comparisons also with things of a like nature but the principal instrument by which it works is by a climax or a gradual rise of one circumstance above another till our idea be raised to the utmost i spoke formerly of a climax in sound a climax in sense when well carried on is a figure which never fails to amplify strongly the common example of this is that noted passage in cicero which every schoolboy knows facinus est vincire civem romanum scelus verberare prope parricidium necare quid dicam in crucem tollere it is a crime to put a roman citizen in bonds it is the height of guilt to scourge him little less than parricide to put him to death what name then shall i give to crucifying him  i shall give an instance from a printed pleading of a famous scotch lawyer sir george mkenzie it is in a charge to the jury in the case of a woman accused of murdering her own child gentlemen if one man had any how slain another if an adversary had killed his opposer or a woman occasioned the death of her enemy even these criminals would have been capitally punished by the cornelian law but if this guiltless infant who could make no enemy had been murdered by its own nurse what punishments would not then the mother have demanded with what cries and exclamations would she have stunned your ears what shall we say then when a woman guilty of homicide a mother of the murder of her innocent child has comprised all those misdeeds in one single crime a crime in its own nature detestable in a woman prodigious in a mother incredible and perpetrated against one whose age called for compassion whose near relation claimed affection and whose innocence deserved the highest favor i must take notice however that such regular climaxes as these though they have considerable beauty have at the same time no small appearance of art and study and therefore though they may be admitted into formal harangues yet they speak not the language of great earnestness and passion which seldom proceed by steps so regular nor indeed for the purposes of effectual persuasion are they likely to be so successful as an arrangement of circumstances in a less artificial order for when much art appears we are always put on our guard against the deceits of eloquence but when a speaker has reasoned strongly and by force of argument has made good his main point he may then taking advantage of the favorable bent of our minds make use of such artificial figures to confirm our belief and to warm our minds  end of vol i
