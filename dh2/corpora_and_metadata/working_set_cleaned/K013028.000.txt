remarks on medical jurisprudence intended for the general information of juries and young surgeons  dublin printed by james reilly no   astonsquay  mdccxciii  to the right honorable john lord viscount clonmel chief justice of ireland my lord the propriety of addressing the subsequent remarks on medical jurisprudence to you appeared obvious  and i am convinced if they are deemed important by your lordship will not be considered as intrusive  to point out how far in cases of supposed murder anatomical inspection can ascertain the cause of death  to direct young surgeons in the more material processes of such enquiry and to enable them to distinguish the effects of injuries from those spontaneous changes dead bodies necessarily undergo  and to excite some attention to the present state of medical jurisprudence in this country are the principal objects of this publication  if to be arraigned for murder strikes the most hardened villain with horror what must the innocent culprit suffer  who prosecuted perhaps through malignity and impeached through ignorance finds his conviction from mistaken prejudice become a public wish  how often in those cases do we find a slight hint clear up a doubt that might otherwise have the most fatal tendency  and it is in those moments of terror and suspense that a discriminating and humane judge may by presenting the case in a proper point of view to the jury rescue the unfortunate accused from an impending ignominious death  where the loss of life may be considered as the lesser forfeit  it has been frequently regretted that in the exertion of great professional talents the milder virtues seem suspended in your lordships official capacity this never can happen for while you decide as a lawyer you always feel as a man  i am my lord with great respect your humble servant the author  remarks on medical jurisprudence there are three important cases in which surgeons are particularly called upon to ascertain by dissection the cause of death first where external injury has been suffered secondly where it is suspected poison has been administered thirdly where a woman is accused of having murdered her child these are occasions which require in the surgeon a practical knowledge of anatomy without which he can never accurately distinguish appearances that may arise from injury or disease from those spontaneous changes all dead bodies necessarily undergo a good practical anatomist is rare among surgeons even in a great city and seldom or never to be met with in the country from this defect many dreadful mistakes have been committed to the scandal of the profession and irretrievable injury of the person accused  there are no fituations in which the general malignity of popular clamor is more conspicuous than in those of supposed murder no sooner is a person suspected than the rumor of it rapidly spreads and as it flies exaggerates every circumstance that may tend to criminate the unhappy culprit to young practitioners those are esteemed favorable occasions for displaying their medical discrimination and attracting public attention opinions are hastily promulgated generally contradictory often absurd and frequently grounded on suppositious facts the consequence is that the accused is publicly condemned before he is juridically tried and falls at last perhaps an innocent victim to popular prejudice i have on many occasions been present at inquests where the attending surgeon unused to dissection did not even know the method of exposing to view the different cavities of the body and it may readily be conceived how little capable he must have been to decide on so important a point yet in those cases the surgeon when called on has no alternative he must either avow his ignorance or deliver his opinion and in the struggle between conscience and pride i very much fear the former is often sacrificed to the latter  there is not i will affirm on record a more melancholy and striking instance of the unhappy effects of popular prejudice and the fatal consequences of medical ignorance than the case of captain donnellan who was executed in england about ten years ago for the murder of sir theodosius boughton it appears that eight or nine days after sir theodosius was buried a surgeon had the body raised although it was in the month of june and proceeded to the dissection notwithstanding a physician and another surgeon present declared that from the putrid state of the body no information could be obtained on which any opinion could be grounded respecting the cause of death and that such an investigation was even attended with much personal danger yet regardless of this joint opinion and advice the first surgeon proceeded in the dissection saying that to him such a subject was rather a posy and decidedly gave his opinion that sir theodosius died of poison nor could the testimony of the celebrated john hunter who swore that it was impossible to investigate the cause of death in such a state of general putrefaction do away the impression of the first evidence on either the mind of the judge the judge is always considered as the advocate of the prisoner  in capt donnellans case he seems to have acted as lawyer for the crown or jury for the first in his charge opposes to the opinion of hunter which he says he can call but a doubt the positive declaration of the first surgeon who opened the body and of some physicians that the deceased died of poison now hunters opinion was positive as to the physical impossibility of deciding on the cause of death and only doubtful when interrogated as to the administration of poison in this country a case not long since happened where the medical men concerned decided that a man died of poison and i have very good reason to believe his death happened in consequence of a rupture  the unfortunate accused in both cases were convicted and suffered an ignominious death for crimes they both at their dying moments in the most solemn manner denied  no stronger instances can be adduced of the fatal and melancholy effects of popular prejudice when joined with medical ignorance from this it appears how necessary it is for surgeons to avail themselves of every opportunity that may tend to improve them in practical anatomy by which they will acquire a knowledge of the natural appearance of the contents of the different cavities and when called on be able to discriminate with accuracy between a sound and diseased state of the parts and not mistake those changes which take place after death for morbid appearances a circumstance that i have known sometimes to have happened to experienced surgeons not used to dissection  when it is necessary to inspect a body in order to ascertain the cause of death the sooner afterdeath the inspection takes place the more accurate the investigation will prove as those remarks are particularly addressed to the younger part of the profession it is necessary to point out the most material circumstances that should be attended to in the general order of the dissection  the first object of enquiry should be into the principal circumstances that attended and have been deemed to have occasioned the persons death for those when known will direct the surgeons attention in opening the body to many important points that otherwise might possibly in the hurry of dissection escape him fully informed as to all those circumstances the body should be cleaned and placed on a table in clear daylight candlelight for obvious reasons is extremely improper on such occasions the external appearances should be first carefully examined and we should distinguish between those bloody suffusions and putrid distensions which always rapidly take place after sudden death in full habits from those that may arise from contusion or disease those are circumstances that require the utmost caution in the surgeon for people not used to inspect dead bodies are very apt to be struck by such appearances and instantly decide that the persons death was caused by some injury after a careful examination of the external surface of the body we begin to open the different cavities but first the one in which we may expect to find the cause of death if it proceeded from external injury we cannot be at a loss where to begin but if from poison the state of the alimentary canal should be our principal object  and here i must request the young practitioner studiously to avoid all unseasonable levity or making any remarks on the case as he proceeds in the dissection for the attendants are attentive and will recollect and i have known some instances where the occasional remarks of the surgeon and his ultimate decision did not correspond  the three great cavities are those we generally expose i will begin with the head  i need not remind the young surgeon that before he proceeds to open the head he should have it clean shaved in short i cannot too strongly recommend in dissection the utmost attention to cleanliness and a decorum that should prohibit the exposing unnecessarily any parts that may hurt the feelings of the lookers on or cast an injurious reflection on those of the profession  the scalp ought to be first carefully examined if there appears any contusion wound or spontaneous separation of the pericranium from the skull the extent of those different injuries should attentively be traced we should next proceed to examine the cranium and let the young operator be careful not to fall into the error of hippocrates who mistook a suture or natural sulcus for a fracture all injuries of the bone should be traced and carefully attended to the upper part of the cranium being removed the dura matter becomes exposed this membrane in its natural state has a firm vascular and filamentous connection to the whole inside of the skull its detachment therefore in any part must be the effect of violence or consequence of disease in large extensive fractures and depressions where death has suddenly followed we frequently find a considerable detachment of the dura matter under the part injured and more or less extravasated blood on its surface in other injuries of the cranium it becomes subsequently detached by inflaming and suppurating but let me caution the surgeon to proceed farther in his dissection before he pronounces on the cause of death before we have done with the dura matter the state of the sinuses should be remarked as they are frequently found in many injuries of the brain unnaturally distended with blood we should then expose the pia matter to view it is a vascular web and the connecting medium between the various vessels that pervade the brain when death is the consequence of concussions of the brain or injuries of the cranium we will find the cause of death either in extravasation suppuration or a general collapsion of the brain so that it does not fill the cavity of the cranium if death immediately succeeds the injury we must look for extravasation either on the surfaces of the pia matter corpus callosum in the ventricles or about the basis of the brain for all shocks which the head receives are readily communicated to the pia matter and either produce a temporary suspension of the circulation through it as happens when a man is knocked down or stunned or else some of the fine vessels are ruptured and a fatal extravasation of blood ensues in the various injuries of the cranium which after some time cause death we always find the suppuration formed in the pia matter for the effect of all concussions are instantaneously propagated throughout this vascular membrane and although a rupture of some of the finer vessels may not be produced still the temporary derangement in the general circulation through the brain particularly when combined with local injury must ever be looked on as a strong exciting cause to future inflammation and suppuration and this is every day confirmed by experience for in more than fiveandtwenty years extensive practice in which time i have opened more heads than i believe most other practitioners i never in a single instance found the contrary  should our inspection have for its object the ascertaining the cause of disease our enquiry must be directed by the leading symptoms that attended it apoplexy or hydrocephalus are the two most frequent occasions for such examination in the first extravasations of blood are frequently found in the ventricles from a rupture of some of the vessels in the plexus choroides or in the folds of the pia matter in the second we should take care not to mistake the water that is generally found in the ventricles for a morbid accumulation  as to other diseased appearances that may occur in dissections of the brain such as steatoma and fungous tumors of the dura matter those enquiries do not admit of any particular direction  we now proceed to the examination of the thorax and first we should carefully examine any wound that may externally appear and trace its traject observe whether the ribs sternum or dorsal vertebrae be fractured after this is done the cavity of the thorax should be exposed we should examine the different cavities right and left the duplicature of the pleura or mediastinum the pericardium and see whether there be extravasation of blood water or matter in any of those different cavities we should observe whether the lungs fill the cavity of the thorax or are in a collapsed state and perhaps wounded it is often difficult to trace a wound through the lungs i have more than once been embarrassed on such occasions and but for the extravasation in the cavities would have found it difficult to determine whether the sword passed through the lungs or heart for by the collapsion of the parts the traject of the wound became effaced our next object should be to examine whether the lungs are inflamed gangrened tubercular or any part of them in a state of suppuration on those points we may decide from their appearance weight and density or by cutting into them the large blood vessels and the thoracic duct should next be inspected and we should carefully look whether aneurism polypi or wound has taken place in them having satisfied ourselves as to those different points we proceed to open the abdomen  the external appearances as to wounds contusions and fractures of the vertebrae should be first enquired after then the different parts of the abdomen where ruptures usually appear should be carefully examined in cases of suspected poison great attention should be paid to this enquiry for the symptoms of a rupture under the circumstances of stricture may by the ignorant be imputed to the administration of poison as in both cases the patients are harrassed with incessant vomitings etc satisfied as to all those points we proceed to expose the cavity of the abdomen and examine if it contains extravasations of water matter or blood the first will be at once obvious the second may be in the cellular membrane that envelopes the psoas muscles or lines the pelvis blood will generally descend and be found about pouparts ligament the different viscera next should be accurately inspected lest any of them should be wounded or in a diseased state i need not surely remark that the urinary passages and organs of generation lie outside the abdomen and if there appears any necessity for it they may be separately examined  we next proceed to open the alimentary canal and abstracted from wounds our enquiry will be directed in general to ascertain whether poison had been administered this we do by an accurate examination of the stomach and intestinal canal and a chemical analysis of their contents but it will be first necessary minutely to enquire into the leading circumstances and symptoms that preceded the persons death poison is a very relative term it is an old adage that what is one mans meat is another mans poison it depends not only on the quality but the quantity of the substance given and its activity on the vehicle in which it is mixed or suspended there are but few poisons that have not been medicinally administered from time to time without producing any dangerous complaints nay morgagni affirms that mountebanks have been known to swallow arsenic rolled up in suet or lard and retain it for some time in their stomachs then vomit it up without substaining the least injury  although it is difficult to define poison medically yet mankind judge rationally and consider that as poison which given in a certain quantity induces sudden death and which is administered in such quantity for such purpose  poison may be drawn from the mineral vegetable and animal kingdoms the two first will form the only objects of our present enquiry being the substances usually given for the purpose of poisoning of the mineral poisons arsenic is most frequently administered the action of all mineral poisons is immediately on the stomach which it throws into violent spasms induces incessant vomiting pain hiccough distention of the abdomen and in some cases which i have seen it appeared as if drawn in toward the back frequent deliquium cold sweats convulsions and death the body turns suddenly putrid becomes horridly inflated the head tongue fauces monstrously swelled and black the whole carcass emits the most putrid stench and the scarfskin peels off on touching it on viewing the stomach it appears inflated often inflamed with gangrenous spots or rather suffusions here and there spread over its surface and the blood vessels distended when opened the villous coat has all the appearance of having suffered great inflammation often an eschar is observed encircled by an inflammatory ring this has been deemed characteristic of the action of arsenic but i know to a certainty that it is not an inversion of the intestinal canal is also frequently seen having finished the anatomical inspection of those parts we next proceed chemically to examine the contents of the stomach i am convinced that many erroneous and fatal opinions have been drawn in those cases from the most bungling and inaccurate processes the most decisive methods of ascertaining the existence of arsenic in the contents is by exposing the detached substance we deem to be arsenic to the effects of fire when an aliaceous smell will be emitted to make the experiment usually tried on copper which it turns white or to precipitate it by a preparation of sulphur if we but for a moment consider the circumstances that happen previous to death the incessant vomitings constant dilution and often small quantity of the poison taken in it will not be surprising that it should elude all chemical investigation and that the whole of the poison may be frequently ejected soon after it has been received although its deleterious effects continue besides few bodies are opened until twelve or twentyfour hours after death and at those periods very important changes rapidly take place so that to detach arsenic from all adventitious substances under those circumstances is more to be wished for than expected and all mineral poisons as to their immediate action if given in such quantity as to produce sudden death are similar in their effects and local appearances  i attended two healthy men that were poisoned by drinking claret made up with sugar of lead  a frequent practice in correcting sour wine they both died in the course of forty eight hours after and it was impossible either from the symptoms that preceded death or the appearances found on dissection to determine what kind of mineral poison had been administered  vegetable poisons particularly the laurel may be ranked among the most powerful their action seems more immediately to engage the nervous system than locally to affect the stomach therefore convulsions epilepsy apoplexy and death soon succeed nor can the effects particularly of the laurel be observed on inspecting the stomach and alimentary canal  any opinion founded on the smell of the contents or giving them to a dog disguised in food i consider of no weight in deciding on so important a question i will just remark that where death has in a few hours followed the administration of poison if mineral the excitement is first local soon after the nervous system becomes affected if vegetable the nervous system becomes at once engaged and no characteristic local effect can be perceived on dissection in either case death seems to me to be more immediately produced by pain the fatigue of vomiting convulsions and in short general sympathy than from any organic injury  i have been frequently called on in cases of death where poison was supposed to have been given and after the most accurate anatomical investigation i never could decide the appearances were so ambiguous should this appear extraordinary it ought to be remembered that in all cases of sudden death particularly if the deceased was of a full habit the body swells and suddenly turns putrid although this event may in a shorter time take place and in a more extensive way where poison has been administered yet this is a matter involved in so much doubt and depends so much on contingency arising from season situation and various other circumstances as to render it of little weight in deciding on so important a point  poisons of all kinds induce sudden putrefaction and so do spirits when drank to such excess as to cause death  i remember the case of a woman accustomed to drink spirits in such quantities as to be almost continually drunk this woman was found dead in her room i was called a few hours after she was then so putrid that i smelt her from below stairs on examining the body it was horridly inflated bursting with putrefaction the scarf skin peeled off with the slightest touch on opening the stomach an aliaceous smell or that of garlic was extremely perceptible this convinced a gentleman present that arsenic had been administered it was in vain i informed him that arsenic unless exposed to the action of fire was inodorous the family became alarmed doubt and terror seized them providence directed me to a closer examination and i found a box of asafoetida pills which she usually took from time to time in the window this immediately so struck me that i turned out the contents of the stomach into a basin and found a pill undissolved i need not mention from what impending misery a husband who was the person suspected of having poisoned her was saved  as to the appearances of inflammation and gangrene all who are conversant in dissections know that they indicate the commencement of putrefaction as frequently as the effects of disease  there is hardly a stomach of those who die of short illness that does not present suffused spots the gastric juice often acts on the stomach as a solvent after death and from this cause the stomach has been found eroded in different parts as if acted on by some of the mineral poisons which by the ignorant may be taken for morbid appearances i therefore am decidedly of opinion that unless arsenic is found actually in the stomach all the other marks of its having been administered are extremely equivocal and should be of no weight in determining on a point of so much consequence and where should any mistake arise the accused person may suffer an ignominious death  juries therefore in all cases of suspected poison in forming their opinion should attend more to the other circumstances that may occur in the course of the trial than to the report of the surgeon all medical opinions in those cases being more frequently founded on mere conjectures than real facts are little to be relied on  the next circumstance in which the opinion of a surgeon is usually demanded is the case of supposed infanticide  i honor the memory of the late doctor hunter for a paper which he published in the sixth volume of the london medical observations on this subject it is replete with anatomical discrimination directed to the most humane purposes he is of opinion and that founded on long experience and an intimate knowledge of the feelings of the sex in the most critical and trying moments that infanticide is rarely a premeditated act  in fact women who are pregnant without daring to avow their situation are generally poor deluded credulous creatures abandoned by the objects of their affection and cause of their misfortune often left to struggle with neglect poverty and disease under the pressure of those circumstances they retire to some solitary place when in labor and abandon themselves in despair to the event without seeking any assistance delivery in those circumstances is frequently attended with haemorrhage either during the time or immediately after the placenta is detached it frequently lies half in the vagina and os uteri for want of assistance a deliquium is frequently induced from terror and loss of blood and when the unfortunate woman recovers perhaps she finds the child dead and in this situation surely her concealing the cause of her shame is an impulse of nature and should not be adduced as a proof of guilt yet this very circumstance without making any allowance for the state of mind in those moments of terror and shame gives rise to suspicion and often leads to an enquiry that in the event has consigned many an innocent woman to an ignominious death if the appearances of poison are found extremely equivocal on dissection those of infanticide are still more so no judgment abstracted from evident external injury ought to have the least weight the suffused and bloated look of a child in those cases is rather characteristic of its being stillborn particularly if occurring after a tedious or difficult labor  the experiments generally tried on those occasions in order to ascertain whether the child was born alive or not are all made on the lungs it is concluded if they float on being thrown into water that the child came into the world alive if they sink that it was born dead no appearances are less to be relied on putrefaction will occasion the lungs to be specifically lighter than water and cause them to swim on the surface although they never had been inflated and by inflammation they may become dense and sink to the bottom although the child had breathed besides the child may have partially or just breathed and expired on being born  in short all such appearances so much depend on a variety of contingent circumstances as render them of little importance in determining in cases of suspected infanticide  having anatomically inspected the body the young surgeon should retire and reconsider the case before he makes his report his character is at stake as well as the accused persons life both by imprudence may be irretrievably lost in delivering his opinion or explaining the cause of death the surgeons narrative should be simple and candid let him use as few technical terms as possible both for the better information of the jury and to avoid giving a lawyer an opportunity of embarrassing him  as abstracted from wounds fractures and other external injuries the causes of death are generally equivocal wherever the surgeon cannot ascertain them beyond the possibility of a doubt he should decide in favor of the accused better ninety and nine guilty should escape punishment than one innocent person suffer  the remaining points to be considered are the manner of making reports and the attendance on inquests  no people suffer more from malicious prosecutions than those of the lower order in ireland every dispute is with them generally terminated fustibus et gladiis and he who has got the worst of the battle swears against the victorious party two motives seem principally to induce them so uniformly to have recourse to law for redress the first is resentment the next money and in the pursuit of both it is impossible to describe the flagrant instances of perjury every day exhibited in our crown offices  i never attended a trial of this kind that i was not shocked at the contradictory assertions of both parties many of which i knew at the instant to have no foundation in truth the witnesses are generally tutored for the evident purpose of perjury previous to the trial and in the common language are ready to swear any thing that may be deemed conducive to gaining their suit the mode of prosecution is simply as follows  when a man has received a wound or any other injury he immediately goes to a magistrate and lodges examinations against the person from whom he received it and swears he is under the care of a surgeon and his life is in danger the magistrate grants a warrant for apprehending the offending party and if taken he is immediately committed to goal  now all this is generally done without much enquiry whether the allegations are wellfounded or not  to be committed to goal is in itself i conceive a very great punishment and i am convinced has been the means of corrupting many an innocent man for shame and character those barriers against vice are at once lost the accused must lie in prison until bailed out on the surgeons report of the person injured being out of danger how many honest innocent men have i known ruined before this report was obtained their families in supporting them in prison reduced to beggary and themselves by wicked association the effects of despair the loss of character become drunken idle and profligate during the remainder of their lives  there is hardly a man in society that may not innocently become the unfortunate victim of a malicious prosecution to convince the most incredulous and to show to what extent such things are sometimes carried i will out of many instances produce one  a clergyman of the established church hearing his wife and servantmaid disputing in the kitchen about some trivial matter went down and only interfered so far as to repel some rudeness offered by the girl to her mistress by pushing the servant one side she either accidentally or on purpose fell against the dresser and received a slight contusion over the eye of no sort of consequence she immediately went up stairs stood at the street door told the people passing by she had been almost murdered by her master and to confirm this assertion she immediately dropped into an apparently strong epileptic fit she was then carried as one expiring to an hospital and without farther inquiry the unfortunate clergyman and his wife were both dragged to newgate the indignation of the populace was at such an height that the windows of his house were broken and the furniture thrown out into the street in the evening the account of this dreadful murder was cried about the streets by the newshawkers the next day this woman was removed out of the hospital to private lodgings where she continued to be attended by some of the faculty for ten or twelve days during which time she never could be got to show the least signs of sense or recollection but seemed to be particularly when examined violently agitated and convulsed i was at this time called into consultation and on examining her rather unexpectedly i was at once convinced she labored under no real complaint and that she was a vile impostor there are two objects a medical man should have in view in those inquiries  to alarm the party by fear of operation or to rouse them into sudden passion by abuse i took the latter method and with some harsh expressions told her i would instantly send her to channelrow she as one electrified bounced up and swore i dare not my business was now effected i immediately went to the late sir samuel bradstreet related the whole transaction and had the clergyman and his wife liberated on coming back i called to see in what situation my patient was but she as soon as i had left the house put on her clothes and decamped without leave  it is needless to comment on this case i will only add that the terror and shame of being so publicly exposed made such impression on this poor mans mind as brought his life into the most imminent danger and the expenses attending his confinement etc surrounded as he was with a large family considerably injured his circumstances  in order to obviate those abuses in our medical jurisprudence magistrates should not grant a warrant for committing a man to goal on the mere oath of the injured person and unless the attending surgeon certifies his life to be in danger when a person is once committed to goal for an offense of this nature without a surgeons report that the injured party is not in danger of his life he cannot be admitted to bail formerly giving certificates of this kind formed a very lucrative part of the practice of surgeons for they often in those cases withheld making any report until paid their demand for their whole attendance i have known thirty forty nay eighty guineas given before a report could be obtained in short if the accused was rich or if they thought they could get much money all parties must be satisfied before a report would be thought of  it is impossible to conceive the distress that this iniquitous practice has reduced whole families to i have known the poorer people in such circumstances sell or pawn every necessary they possessed in order to get as much money as would satisfy the surgeon who was generally the principal object and release perhaps a husband or brother from prison during this negotiation it was always thought necessary that the injured persons should keep in bed and appear extremely ill and they were generally so well instructed and such good actors that it required no small share of discrimination to detect them for they would suffer even severe operations or any thing that was thought necessary to the carrying on the deception i have in many of those cases unexpectedly visited a fellow and found him eating heartily of beefsteaks who perhaps two hours before appeared with all the symptoms of a fractured skull out of many instances i will produce one  a man deemed to be rich gave another a blow with a stick on the head and cut him he was the next day sworn against and lodged in goal the man was attended by a surgeon long since dead another was called no report could be made as no terms were offered by the man in goal that would be accepted days and weeks passed in this kind of negotiation for although the man was wealthy he was tenacious at length a third surgeon was called he found that the man had originally but a slight cut but that it had been thought necessary on account of irregular shiverings which the man said he had to scalp him an operation as then performed attended with the most exquisite pain and by which the skull was laid bare to near the breadth of half a crown no other dangerous circumstance appearing the consulted surgeon fully convinced of the imposition in order to terrify the man proposed that he should be immediately trepaned the patient enquired the nature of that operation the other coolly replied it was only to bore a hole through his skull with an instrument much like a large augre this was going too far  terms were immediately proposed and accepted the shiverings ceased and the man in goal after a confinement of six weeks was released at the expense of near five hundred pounds  the royal college of surgeons early saw those flagrant abuses and have done every thing in their power to counteract them for by one of their bylaws no member of the college can demand more than two guineas for a report to a magistrate and should he be convicted of making a false and corrupt one he is publicly expelled the college  the only point that remains for consideration is the attendance on inquests this has always been deemed a professional duty which surgeons owe to public justice and undoubtedly in most cases it really is so however public motives alone will seldom induce men to act contrary to their private interests  to attend an inquest is to the surgeon unprofitable the loss of time highly inconvenient and in the event may be productive of very disagreeable consequences for he is bound to appear at the trial whence should he be absent even on the most pressing professional occasion he may be heavily fined  those are very strong motives for surgeons to endeavor as much as possible to avoid being engaged on such occasions i was myself fined fifty pounds by the late judge robinson although he had been previously informed that i had only just quitted the court on being sent for to a man whose thigh i had amputated in the morning and who was said to have had a bleeding from the stump to this excuse the judge paid not the least attention as i believe he supposed it to be illfounded so imposed the fine it is true i got it taken off next day but there is something extremely humiliating and vexatious in the various applications necessary to be made on those occasions  a surgeon not long since had a keeper put on his house in consequence of a greenwax process for nonattendance although he had not been half an hour absent from court but unfortunately the trial commenced in the interim this case was extremely distressing for he was a man surrounded with a small family and could not possibly command half the sum the consequence was the keeper remained on his house for eight weeks as the judge who imposed the fine was absent on circuit and nothing could be done in the affair until he came back so after suffering this disgrace and being at more than ten pounds expense at length the fine was remitted  when those different circumstances are duly considered no reflection can justly fall on gentlemen of the profession for endeavoring to avoid an attendance that must so materially interfere with their other duties however there can be no doubt that it is extremely necessary that inquests should be properly attended and that the worst consequences may arise and frequently do from the want of a good anatomist and experienced surgeon to assist on those occasions it is absolutely shameful that in cases where life and death are at issue the jury in the more important point of the trial should have no better direction to form their opinion by than perhaps the evidence of an apprentice so that justice may be evaded or innocence condemned  the business of attending inquests should be therefore made a distinct appointment or annexed to some of the present professional establishments so that in all cases of supposed murder the inspection of a good anatomist and experienced surgeon may no longer be a matter of mere contingency  before i conclude those general remarks i request the reader will consider that it never was my intention to go much into detail the subject undoubtedly is important and required more time and attention than i was able to give it but if what i have advanced will lead to any useful enquiry or be the means of detecting ignorance or defeating malice my views are fully completed  finis
