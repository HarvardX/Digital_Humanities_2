page     chap xi the drama closes and the curtain falls page     henry book the tenth chapter i in which the author confutes himself having been so long employed in finding words according to rule and method for others i begin to think i have a right to bestow some according to my own fancy and that just now prompts me to write without any rule or method whatsoever  in the first place then permit me to say that i do not allow any man can have a fair excuse for not reading these volumes once at least in his life provided he can read at all for what is the plea i would fain know that he can set up for refusing them a perusal is he too wise to be taught any thing new  they do not pretend to have any new thing in them or about them they boast themselves to be as old as nature and as for instruction if he is too wise to want it they are not so foolish as to force it upon him against his wishes  is he too lazy to be amused by any reading then let him employ a toadeater to recite them in his ears till he falls asleep he cannot purchase a cheaper or more harmless narcotic in his apothecarys shop  is he too proud to stoop his genius to the perusal of a trivial novel my life upon it his genius is oftentimes more trivially employed is truth his constant study and pursuit and has he not yet found out that there is truth in fiction that by the device of fable as the philosopher saint pierre well observes the soul gradually opens itself to truth i am vain enough to think there may be many more truths in this poor fable than he will discover or comprehend in all his metaphysics  but some may plead business and business must be followed  true and so must hounds but the man who follows either be it ever so closely will still find that he has gone many miles out of his way let the man of business recollect how much of his life is spent in being busy about nothing and he cannot but acknowledge he has had time to bestow upon the reading of these little books and a hundred others but all this while he has been accumulating money if he dies tomorrow he will die worth one hundred thousand pounds and if he does is he any whit wiser i put the question in the words of the inimitable author of the serious call is he any whit wiser i demand than he who has taken the same pains to have a hundred thousand pair of boots and spurs when he leaves the world  but harkye mr novelist the fastidious philosopher will say my studies do not lie your way to him i could answer  then are my studies learned sir more complaisant than yours for as far as you yourself participate of human nature so far you come within the scope of my researches why then may not you deign to read me though i do not aspire to copy you though your proud castle is barred against my approach my humble cottage is the seat of general hospitality and open to you in common with the rest of my fellow creatures the simple goosequill that can fan one spark of pure benevolence into activity by the playfulness of its motion has done more for mankind than the fullplumed philosopher who with the strut of the goose itself cackles out his despicable spleen and hisses at each passenger as he goes regardless by him  if but one of all my readers has felt the sympathy of a generous sentiment if another has experienced the conscious sense of selfreproaching turpitude and blushed at the discovery i think i have thrown more light into the world than the philosopher can dig out of the bowels of the earth though he may thereby affect to decide upon the worlds age as jockies do upon horses by looking in their mouths what if philosophers have now found out that water is no element they have neither added to its uses nor taken any away and as for me though for peace sake i will forbear to say it is an element i will not promise them to rest my faith so far upon their dogma as to say that it is not the author of nature seems graciously to have ordained that in searching after things without use our enquiries should be pursued without success so that no labor might be wasted upon things that cannot profit us but it is only after these curious nothings that our philosopher is ever on the quest and yet he pretends to say that he has no leisure to bestow upon my men and women why will he not rather study to be informed of what would profit him to know and submit to be ignorant of what the great disposer of the universe has in tender consideration of his shortlived creatures buried out of sight as much truth as mans intellects can admit is accessible to mans enquiries but ignorance is given to the soul as the lid is bestowed upon the eye it lets in all the light it can usefully dispense with and shuts out what it cannot bear and now no more of the philosopher whilst i am contemplating the statue let him hunt after the beetle that crawls at the base of it  there is notwithstanding more for me to do and as these volumes are my clients so am i their advocate and must be prepared for all that may oppose me the next however is a gentle caviller and approaches in a form that challenges my respect it is a reader i would not offend and shock for all that fame could give me she comes with modest blushes on her cheeks and points to certain pages doubled down in my offending work too highly colored for her chaste revolting eye to rest upon what shall i reply to this appellant how defend myself from one who comes into the lists with all the virtues armed in her support where now is my impure jemima where is fanny claypole where even my benevolent susan may  fled out of sight abashed and self condemned what avails it me to say that they are natures children my reproving critic does not wish to make acquaintance with the profligates of her family in vain i urge that contrast is the soul of composition that joy and sorrow health and sickness good and evil chequer life itself through every stage that even virtue wants an opposite to give its luster full display she does not think that scenes which address themselves to the passions can be defended by arguments that apply to the judgment i may be justified by the rules of composition she is trying me by those of decorum if i shelter myself in the plea that temptations are the test of an heroic spirit that i cannot make bricks without straw and that although the said straw be of an inflammable quality yet i must work with such materials as i have she will not hesitate to admit the necessity of temptations but she will resolutely condemn the too profuse and prominent display of them she would work her shades more tender mine are too bold if i say wait for the moral she replies that it is the nature of susceptibility not to wait the mischief is in the front the moral is in the rear the remedy cannot always overtake the disease and she asks where is the wit in voluntarily provoking the fang of the viper because forsooth we have a medicine in our closet that will staunch the poison if we do not slip the time of applying it  mark now candid reader if i have not wove a hedge about myself which i have neither cunning to creep through nor agility to climb but it is ever thus when i argue with the ladies if their modesty is of so touchy a temper as to accuse me of impudence i know no better way to convince them of their mistake than by copying that modesty and making no defense and sure i am that such would be their conduct in the case of real attack when the relation of it only stirs them into such tremors and palpitations i fear therefore that their extreme susceptibility proves too much those must ride their palfreys with a very loose rein who are so soon thrown out of their seat upon every little start or stumble that they make  what i have written i have written in the hope of recommending virtue by the fiction of a virtuous character which to render amiable i made natural and to render natural i made subject to temptations though resolute in withstanding them in one instance only my hero owes his victory to chance and not to his own fortitude if virtue therefore cannot read her own encomium without catching fire at the allurements of her antagonist she is not that pure and perfect virtue i was studious to pay court to but some hypocrite who has basely tricked herself out in the uniform of the corpse for the opportunity of deserting over to the enemy with her arms and accoutrements  chapter ii a peep behind the curtain at crowbery castle whilst the gentle bosom of isabella was rent with a thousand perplexing inquietudes the proud exulting heart of fanny claypole was anticipating the fancied joys of rank and splendor and already practicing the stately airs of a viscountess elect her uncle now began to pass his time not quite so much to his satisfaction as he had done though his niece still continued to treat him with external civility yet there was a gracious manner in it that conveyed the idea of condescension and protection rather than of cordiality or respect the restraint which she and her noble paramour submitted to in his company though as little as decency could dispense with was still something more than they could willingly spare on certain occasions and he then began to discover that all his accommodating complacency did not quite answer their purposes and that his absence began to be wished for by both parties this indeed was more than insinuated to him by dumb show for my lord took frequent occasions of enquiring whether sir roger manstock would not be uneasy at his parish being left without a resident minister and once or twice asked him in a natural manner if he was doing any thing at the parsonage and whether it would require any repairs before it was made fit for his reception intimating with much seeming kindness that if there was any thing wanting for his comfort he would send his own workmen over and fit it to his wishes adding that it would ever give him the most supreme delight to show any mark of his respect to the uncle of his amiable friend miss claypole these hints that sagacious gentleman was not slow to comprehend but it did not just now suit him to put them into practice  when lawyer ferret returned from manstock and the copy of lady crowberys will which he had there taken had been perused by his lordship that noble personage in a manner suitable to his high dignity expressed a most sovereign contempt for the good things of this world which it had conveyed in such ample proportion to the fair isabella and so sparingly to himself in fact it is reasonable to suppose that as his lordships expectations were extremely moderate his disappointment could not be very great so that he bore the event without any great exercise of his virtues one thing however he remarked with a considerable degree of satisfaction and this was the unexpected omission of any legacy to our hero henry this circumstance he communicated without loss of time to mr claypole and miss fanny commenting upon it in a style that sufficiently disclosed to them the gratification he secretly derived to himself in talking of it  you see cried his lordship in his usual style of pleasantry what sort of stuff her ladyships liking to that young fellow was made of no longer pipe no longer pay was her maxim he must now sink into his primitive obscurity all his golden hopes are blasted and i dare engage he is at this moment venting execrations against her deceit and his own credulity but he is rightly served may such ever be the fate of all upstart favorites of married ladies  here claypole chimed in with an inference or two in the way of retort upon henry for his refusal of blachfords bequest observing that the man who from an affectation of disinterestedness withstood the favors of fortune when they were tendered to him generally lived long enough to find himself the dupe of his own vanity and to bewail his folly in the bitterness of selfreproach and vexation i see but one chance that remains for this silly fellow added he which is to betake himself with all humility to blachfords leavings and pay his court without loss of time to mrs susan may of meretricious memory by whose favor he may still subsist upon the bread of infamy and sing psalms with ezekiel daw to some godly tune whilst the old dame scums the pot so ends the history of henry the foundling whose adventures with the help of a little modern garnish may furnish matter to some paltry novelist for a scurvy tale to fill a gap in the shelves of a circulating library and if the writer has the wit to make the most of it he may find out a moral in the catastrophe of his hero and entitle it the rise and fall of vanity for such in fact it is  miss fanny threw a different light upon the subject she confessed he well deserved the disappointment he had met with but she did not think that was excuse sufficient for the person who disappointed him i own said that candid young lady i have always accustomed myself to consider a promise as a sacred thing where i give hopes i think myself in conscience bound to make them good and on the other hand where they are given to me i should hold the person base in the extreme abandoned to all sense of honor and a wretch whom without a crime we might treat as an outlaw and assassin who violated the faith he had pledged and the word of promise he had given now i do not mean to impute this baseness to any person in particular much less to the respectable object of our present conversation i only beg leave to observe that in all connections between man and woman where favors have been interchangd and promises grafted upon those pledges of affection they are binding in the most sacred sense and he or she who breaks from them abandoned in the extremest degree  certainly interposed my lord without all doubt you speak what every person of honor must admit to be true and what i permit me to say feel and i hope practice in its strictest sense put the case by way of elucidation only that i profess myself the admirer of a lady of reputation i am smitten with her charms in short i am in love with her very well believing me to be a man of honor she allows me to make suit to her i gain her confidence well suppose and she begins to favor my suit she smiles on my humble addresses  here a soft glance from the bright eyes of miss fanny brought his lordships eloquence to a pause he gently took her hand and in a whisper tenderly murmured  lovely creature if you look upon me with those eyes i shall forget every word i was saying every sense will be lost in ecstacy and rapture  go on go on said fanny smiling i am much interested in what you are saying and should be sorry to interrupt you in the most important part of it  put me in then said the peer for i protest to you i am lost  why you had just gained the ladys affections replied fanny nay i believe of my conscience you was going on too prosperously for her repose unless you was upon the strictest honor  there you are rather beforehand with me resumed my lord though i confess i was coming to the point be it so then let us for a moment suppose that this lady in pity to my sufferings or if you will in kind compliance with my importunate and empassiond solicitations generously concedes those favors which are the greatest woman can bestow or man receive can it for a moment be doubted that i am bound by all the ties of honor gratitude and justice to indemnify the reputation of my benefactress heavens i were the vilest wretch that ever breathed could i do less than tender her my heart my hand my name rank fortune every thing that i possess on earth as soon as ever opportunity and circumstances would permit these are my principles my dear miss claypole and they are such as i trust your worthy uncle if he has listened to our discourse will give me credit for and approve  certainly my lord replied that reverend personage there cannot be two opinions on the subject were the case to happen as you put it every man of honors conduct must be such as you state it but i must take the liberty to observe that no woman of honor who was wise would put him to the trial  ah my good sir said my lord you speak exactly within the line of your profession and so far you speak right it is as natural for you who are a parson to preach up self denial as it is for an apothecary to recommend physic though nature in both cases nauseates the dose and the finest gratification of the senses is sacrificed by the prescription that rigid morality that would strip life of all its best enjoyments would also divest our hearts of all their most exalted sensations what would become of those glowing effusions of love and gratitude if there was no trust no confidence no mutual interchange of honor and good faith the lawyer who furnishes my occasions with a loan and binds me down by the fetters of a mortgage is a trader in money who confers no favor on me by the accommodation i derive from it whereas the friend who confidentially supplies my wants and rests upon my promise for indemnification leaves me under an obligation that convinces me i was in his esteem and fixes him in mine favors in love are like favors in friendship the same rule applies to both to trust is the test of friendship to be trusted is the triumph of love  i believe my lord said miss claypole we are talking upon a subject that my uncle has not made his study therefore we may as well drop it for the present  this being said a sullen silence ensued the advocates for the tender passion no longer deigned to maintain an argument with so unequal an opponent but contented themselves with giving him to understand by certain plainspeaking looks that if he had any private studies to pursue which might occupy an hour or two of his time they had resources within themselves for filling up the interval the intelligent observer read their meaning in their looks and placidly withdrew  doubtful as i am whether some of my readers might not think that there was one dialogue too many in my history were i to record what now ensued between miss fanny and the viscount i shall omit the recital and conclude this chapter  chapter iii an excursion from crowbery castle the next morning both phoebus and sir roger manstock had harnessed their steeds and advanced upon their journey before the beauteous miss fanny broke the soft bands of sleep asunder and arose to renew her charms at the toilette her protracted slumbers had so far exceeded the accustomed hour of breakfast that she gave orders to her attendant to serve her in her own apartment polite enquiries were sent up more than once by his lordship to which excuses were returned of a slight indisposition in the mean time the following reflections arose in that gentle fair ones mind upon a review of past occurrences  well to be sure there is something very captivating in a title else this same lord crowbery would be insupportable i perceive i shall be most heartily sick of him before the honeymoon is half out i shall never have the patience of his former lady let him beware how he treats me in the manner he behaved to her i will soon show him that my spirit is at least as good as his own he shall not shut me up in this dismal castle and nauseate me with his surfeiting fondness sure of all visitations under heaven that of a stale doting husband would be the most intolerable oh henry henry why would you reject me still still your image haunts me my fond heart still doats upon you and would spurn this odious creature and his titles with disdain could i but gain your love but hold perhaps your disappointment may have humbled you all hopes now blasted and isabella thrown by fortune beyond the reach even of your meditations who can tell but you are now regretting your own obstinacy and wishing to recall that fatal hour when mad with love and fired with resentment  oh horrible i cannot name the rest  here she threw herself back in her chair and bursting into tears fortunately found vent for a gust of passion that would else have thrown her into violent hysterics again she resumed her soliloquy  what did my provoking uncle mean by saying you must marry susan may no that my henry will never do his spirit never will stoop to that it never shall if i have influence to prevent it i will sacrifice ambition fortune every thing to love i have befooled myself enough too much with this detested lord i sicken at his name i will cast him off for ever  stop where is my fancy carrying me there are some charms in title rank and splendor they gratify ambition and do not exclude love i have gone much too far now to recede i were a fool indeed to pay the purchase and not reap the profit i have him sure and i will not let him loose viscountess crowbery will pique the pride of plain miss manstock oh twill be bitterness and gall to that old baronet to see his nieces coronet upon my head delicious triumph glorious revenge  thus whilst her mind was fluctuating betwixt contending passions my lord announced himself with a gentle tap at the door and humbly asked admittance it was granted and as he approached her he said  i venture to assume the privileges of a husband and come to ask if you have any orders for the carriages or servants this morning as i think the day is fine and promises you a pleasant airing henceforward madam you command in this house and the humblest of your servants is now in your presence this was an address that merited what it received a gracious smile and threw a turning weight into the scale of the addresser and his peerage that made poverty and henry kick the beam this fair beginning was still further advanced by a very seasonable auxiliary in the shape of a handsome brilliant set in a ring which his lordship with great gallantry put upon her wedding finger the heart of fanny claypole was amenable to so many passions besides that of love in its common acceptance that the donor of the ring could not fail to be delighted with the impression it had made and as that young lady was a better actress than lord crowbery was a critic it is not much to be wondered at if upon this occasion he mistook artifice for sincerity  after a few indispensible arrangements at the toilette which my lord was graciously permitted to be a spectator of and which were not ill calculated to display her charms in the most alluring attitudes fanny signified her intention of taking the air in a little cabriole drawn by one horse of gentle condition having been long in the habit of obeying the hand of a less daring driver and order was given accordingly fanny had a scheme in meditation of paying a visit to susan may in the course of her circuit and for that reason chose it should be solitary she therefore set out followed by a servant leaving my lord at home to meditate on his felicity or discuss new topics of edification with his reverend guest as they strolled through the plantations and gardens  miss claypole after a tour about the park came upon the village green and stopped at the gate of susans mansion who soon presented herself and very respectfully invited her into the house this was graciously accepted by the viscountess elect and after a few common questions had passed and repassed they fell upon the subject of lady crowberys death and then miss fanny demanded of susan if she had been informed of the circumstances of her will upon her answering in the negative she related to her the leading particulars and observed with much assumed concern that it was a matter most surprising to her how it came to pass henry should be so totally forgotten that even his name was not once mentioned nor any thing that could allude to a provision for him recommended to the heiress even by the most distant hint  susan gazed with astonishment upon her as if in doubt whether she was to yield credit to the account she was giving of an event so unexpected if it is so she said and if my young lady is in possession of the estate and has it at her own disposal i can only presume to say she has a noble opportunity of being generous to the most deserving man upon earth and i cannot doubt but she will avail herself of it  i think of him as you do replied miss fanny but our sentiments my good friend may not be every bodys sentiments they may not be miss manstocks and they certainly are not likely to be sir rogers refunding is a pitch of generous selfdenial that is hardly to be found in any other breast than one of such superior magnanimity as your liberal friends if you had such a fortune dropped into your lap i can readily believe that you would be generous enough to invite henry to a share of it nay i can tell you mrs susan there are some friends of yours not far from hence who credit you for that generosity even upon your present establishment  they may safely credit me replied susan so far as to suppose i never can forget to whom i am indebted for every thing i possess i hope therefore i am capable of the gratitude they ascribe to me though not so presumptuous as to annex to it the conditions which they seem to allude to no madam be assured i know him and myself too well not to know that poverty can never so depress him as to level him with me the woman mr henry marries must not only be pure from guilt of her own contracting but even from involuntary stains which you well know i am not i believe madam even levity of behavior and a forward carriage in the person he might else have admired would change his liking into disgust though she had every other charm that could attract him  here it is supposed that miss fanny would have blushed if art had not been beforehand with nature and dipped her pencil in the counterfeited tint of modesty and shame but though nature was barred from one avenue she found vent at another and whilst conscious recollection smote her heart her tongue betrayed how justly she applied the observation to herself i can readily understand she said where your remark points and what person i am to thank as the founder of it for servants are very apt to retail the scandal that their mistresses propagate i know there have been very impertinent stories circulated about me but i would have you and every one else concerned with you to be assured that my reputation is not to be slandered with impunity i have friends mrs susan that will make those tremble who attempt it and i believe you will soon be convinced that if it is your wish to live here and enjoy your newly acquired fortune in peace and quiet you will be extremely cautious how you suffer any expressions to escape you that can be construed to impute the smallest indiscretion to my conduct  with these words the lady elect made her exit with all due dignity and without vouchsafing a word more or even a look to susan who attended her to the step of her cabriole where she replaced herself in her seat and pursued her way toward the castle  at that instant ezekiel daw came forth from his cottage and turning into the house with susan began a conversation which we shall reserve for the ensuing chapter  chapter iv there are more ways than one of interpreting a doubtful text so daughter susan i perceive you have had a visit from that young madam of the castle you did right to receive her with respect for that is due to our superiors in condition but if she came with the purpose of enticing you into conversation about our absent friend henry it is to be hoped you had discretion to keep a watch upon the door of your lips and not to satisfy an importunate curiosity i have here a letter from our friend henry which announces the death of our respected lady crowbery it is dated from falmouth which i understand to be the port from whence she was to have embarked for lisbon it pleased the supreme disposer of all events to call her to himself from this world of sorrow by a swift messenger be it so we must all obey the summons some sooner some later it is in vain to lament she was a pious and a charitable lady and the poor have lost a friend which i fear will not be replaced to them by that young madam at least who as common fame reports is destined to be her successor at the castle as the lady crowbery died in possession of a very ample patrimony in her own right we may now expect to hear that our beloved henry is rewarded for his disinterestedness and made independent for his life of this i am sure that the deceased lady was much too just to disappoint the hopes she had inspired him with and far too discerning to overlook his merits and therefore child take notice i predict a very ample provision for our absent friend  that is a very natural prediction for you to make cried susan i wish i could say it was a true one but alas alas my good mr daw our poor friend has got nothing miss claypole just now informs me that he is not so much as named in lady crowberys will  it is a lie cried ezekiel starting from his seat it is a false aspersion miss claypole is a slut and a hussy for her pains a defamer of the dead and that is a foul and heinous misdemeanor i pronounce it impossible for the lady crowbery to be a deceiver a dealer in false promises and a hypocrite at the hour of death and therefore i reject your information and abide by my prediction what child will you tell me that i dont know what is in human nature that i should be made the bubble and the dupe of such a prating minx as that miss claypole who never yet uttered one truth of henry since she knew him dont we know enough of her dark dealings not to take her word in any case where he is concerned did not i tell you that she came for no good purpose and now you see i did not speak lightly and without good reason learn from this child i exhort you not to trust too confidently to your own rash opinions but listen to those who have more knowledge and experience than yourself  whilst ezekiel was uttering these words in an elevated voice and upright attitude a letter was delivered to susan which one of sir rogers servants had brought over from manstock it was from the fair hand of isabella and written on that very morning early before she set out upon her journey susan cast her eye over it and then read aloud to ezekiel as follows   dear susan i cannot leave the country without giving you a few lines on the subject of a melancholy event of which as far as your friend and benefactor is interested i am persuaded you will be anxious to be informed    right cried ezekiel now you will find my prediction verified  the sad news of my poor cousins death will probably have reached you before this comes to hand and if so you will be told at the same time that he is in no respect benefited by lady crowbery in her will  there there repeated the exulting prophet you perceive the falsehood had got wind susan made no answer but resumed her reading  it is true  it is false cried ezekiel i will not believe it susan repeated  it is true that his name is not to be found in the will but lest you should be tempted in your zeal for his interest to make false conclusions that would be injurious to the memory of the excellent lady i recommend to you to wait the event in the full persuasion that neither she will be found regardless of her promises nor your most amiable friend unworthy of her affection  no sooner had susan read these concluding words than ezekiel in an ecstacy of joy struck the staff in his hand with vehemence on the floor crying out  i told thee so i told thee so now will thou believe me silly child that art drawn away with every breath and vapor of false doctrine dostnt hear dostnt understand that all is well and as we wish it and that your prattling companion and her politic uncle will be confuted in their false sayings did not i truly pronounce of the lady crowbery that she would not be found regardless of her promises and do not thou mark those very words repeated as it were from my prophetic lips in the young ladys letter and now child why am i right in my judgment and these wrong in theirs i will tell thee why it is because i draw my inferences from a clear and perfect insight into human nature whilst they form theirs upon crude conjecture upon vain imaginations with which they deceive themselves and now i will read thee henrys own letter listen  death has deprived the world of a most excellent being and me of a friend whose loss i must ever deplore lady crowbery is dead wherever it shall please lord crowbery to deposit her remains i shall take measures so as to be present at her interment though it may be prudent to disguise my person when that last duty is performed i propose making you a visit at the cottage i have much to say to you and something for the private ear of your fair neighbor my valued friend susan   what were the precise sensations that these last words stirred in the gentle bosom of the attentive hearer we do not pretend to divine but something there was either in the found or in the sense of them that suffused her face with blushes which doctor daw notwithstanding his prodigious skill and penetration just then happened to overlook so that there was time for them to fade away into a deadly pale which succeeded without attracting the notice of the aforesaid sagacious critic in the human character how he was employed whilst these changes were in transition we are not minutely informed but surely not in the contemplation of one of the most expressive countenances in nature else the scenery there displayed could hardly have escaped him though the secret spring that gave movement to it might have puzzled him to find out  now it had so happened in the reading of miss manstocks letter as it has happened in the cases of many other readings that her two commentators ezekiel daw and susan may had two different methods of interpreting the same text the preacher making it conform to his own prediction and susan construing it according to her own first impression of the fact whilst the one therefore believed henry very richly provided for the other persuaded herself he was not worth a doit now the reader perhaps may recollect that miss fanny who communicated the intelligence of his being left out of lady crowberys will threw out a hint at a report which saddled him upon susan for a moiety of her means and though susan instantly returned an answer which we hope was proper for the occasion and well becoming her to make yet it is not unnatural to suppose that it might raise some ideas in her mind which she did not hold herself bound to communicate either to miss fanny or even to doctor daw himself combining therefore these ideas with the concluding paragraph in henrys letter that he had something for her private ear we may find a clue to the sensations that occasioned susans change of countenance at the hearing of that paragraph as to the consequences which this abstraction of thought on her part had with respect to ezekiel they were only those of affording him free scope for talking upon any subject he thought fit whilst she meditated upon another a privilege he frequently enjoyed in the company of his friends without finding it out  chapter v our history shifts the scene we now turn our attention to the lovely isabella who on the second day from her leaving manstock arrived with her father at the ancient seat of the adamants called hagley hall it was a stately though irregular pile of building in the gothic style but in perfect repair with a handsome park about it and a fine command of water lady crowbery had always kept up a sufficient establishment of servants by whose care every thing was in good order to receive their expected visitants though the melancholy occasion that brought them there kept the neighbors and tenants whom curiosity or respect would else have assembled from intruding on their privacy one old gentleman the rector of the parish and well known to sir roger presented himself on their arrival of which he had been apprised by letter from the baronet he had been long the administrator of all affairs at hagley hall and the appearance of the place bore testimony to his care this worthy person by name and title doctor sandford was greatly affected at the meeting with sir roger and the heiress whose tears kept pace with his on the occasion he informed them that a messenger had arrived to apprise him that the body might be expected the next day whereupon the day following was settled between him and sir roger for the ceremony of interment  it was about the hour of dinner when sir roger arrived at hagley hall and doctor sandford had provided for their entertainment his company was a seasonable relief to the worthy baronet who to his great concern saw his beloved isabella much depressed in spirits and though he did his best to comfort her yet whilst the painful secret of her lovers birth hung on her mind it cannot be wondered at if all his kind endeavors failed of their effect  after dinner however she kept her seat at the table with her father and doctor sandford with whose company she was greatly pleased and in truth he was an amiable and excellent man in the course of their conversation they fell upon the subject of mr ratcliffes death whose parish adjoined to hagley and whose preferment was yet undisposed of his parsonage house was still unoccupied bur the duty of the church was executed for the time by doctor sandfords son a young man educated at the university of cambridge and lately admitted into priests orders in speaking of the melancholy event of poor ratcliffes sudden death the good doctor expatiated on the virtuous and amiable qualities of his late neighbor and friend with great sensibility bewailing the irreparable loss which his parishioners had suffered but avoiding with great delicacy the most distant hint of any expectation for his son the strongest solicitation would probably have been less efficacious than this very delicacy which did by no means escape the observation of his hearers isabella expressed a desire f visiting the deserted mansion of mr ratcliffe before she left the country the contemplation of it as the residence of so good a man would impress her mind with melancholy awe and veneration sir roger combined other impressions in his interpretation of this desire but doctor sandford who did not dive quite so deep into her motives proceeded to say that much as he lamented the loss of his friend ratcliffe there was yet another reason with him that made it a most gloomy spectacle in his sight i allude said he to the sudden and unaccountable disappearance of a youth called henry who under very mysterious circumstances was reared and educated from infancy to manhood by that excellent man a look of marked attention from isabella caused him to apply his discourse more immediately to her and he proceeded to say  ah madam to me who knew this young man and regarded him as a creature little short of perfection in mind person and manners the loss of him without any tidings of his fate is one of the heaviest reflections which my heart can muse upon he was devoted to his patron and preceptor and at his death seemed to have vanished like a ghost whither he went and what may have befallen him heaven only knows but if human virtue merits a peculiar providence surely that youth so lost to us will be the object of heavens care  your prediction is verified cried sir roger and immediately turning to isabella who was pale as ashes tendered a glass of water which perhaps was seldom if ever more critically applied  dr sandford surprised at this alarm gazed upon isabella and her father like a man who perceives he has done mischief and neither knows what nor how  i hope he said i have given no offense it is purely unintentional if i have  not the least cried sir roger not the least offense good sir but quite the contrary we think of this young man as highly as you do we know him well and we love him much  i rejoice to hear it cried sandford from my heart i rejoice to hear that the young man is under your protection heaven has indeed been bountiful in granting him so good a friend  it was at this very moment that isabella though agitated by a variety of thoughts conceived the resolution of suggesting to her father the nomination of young sandford to mr ratcliffes vacancy and to back it with all her influence no sooner had she rallied her spirits than her eyes directed such a glowing beam of gratitude and benevolence toward those of the good old doctor that he must have been blind indeed if he had not seen and dull as death if he had not understood the language of that look he was neither void of sight or sense but sufficiently quick in both to perceive that he had given pleasure by his praise of henry to one of the most beautiful and not the least sensitive objects in creation and he was not slow to conclude that where so much joy was caused some affection must exist he therefore ventured to enquire where his favorite was to be found to this isabella replied by giving a short narrative of his story which left him at falmouth beyond which her information did not enable her to proceed  then i will engage we shall see him here said the doctor and i hope if he comes he will gratify me so far as to make my house his home which will be matter of peculiar joy to my poor son who has beat the whole country round in search of him till despair has driven him from the attempt  i hope then cried isabella you will lose no time in giving mr sandford the information so agreeable to him  here she was joined by sir roger who so cordially desied a servant might be instantly sent off to invite him that the old man who confessed he was hard by at the parsonage consented with no small pleasure to the summons and if that fatherly pleasure needed a justification the appearance of young sandford which a few minutes produced very effectually afforded it for he was in person manners and address a son to be proud of  isabellas warm heart immediately accorded to him he was the friend of henry that was enough the blaze of beauty that good humor threw upon her enchanting countenance as she welcomed him with smiles so dazzled him upon his first introduction to her that his admiration resembled awkwardness and he scarce knew how to address himself to her the charms of her voice and the encouraging sweetness of her manner soon put him at his ease without diminishing his respect the company now naturally classed themselves according to their ages and whilst the fathers fell into discourse upon matters of business the young people entertained each other upon topics more suitable to their taste  friendship for henry on one part and love on the other were not long in agreeing upon what that topic should be and it soon became manifest that the history of our heros adventures was reciprocally the most interesting subject they could talk upon isabella again went over the account enlarging upon it with many more particulars than she had thought necessary to recite in her first narration but there was now only one hearer and to him every circumstance was new to say that he heard her with delight is to do justice to but one of his senses when there was another at least in full occupation which filled his heart with rapture and would have made the dullest tale of sorrow pleasing  what voice do i hear said he within himself what vision do i behold she breathes through rows of pearls over beds of roses it is an enchantment she will vanish presently and i shall start out of my trance  when isabella had brought her history to a close young sandford remained silent for some time as if unwilling to take the discourse from one whom he had listened to with such delight at last perceiving that she expected a reply he thanked her for the entertainment she had vouchsafed him every circumstance of which had been very highly interesting to him whose mind had been so long kept in anxious suspense about the fate of a friend who was deservedly so dear to him i always loved henry said he from a boy and though there were some years between us yet his manly character his command of temper and excellent understanding gave him advantages which my greater maturity of age and experience could not compensate for on many occasions i have profited by his better judgment not unfrequently by his friendly reproof and more than once have been very seriously indebted to his zealous spirit and undaunted gallantry i hear therefore of his behavior in the fight at sea with much more pleasure than surprise for i believe nothing braver lives on earth but there is withal a tenderness and candor in his nature that endear him to our hearts as much as his more brilliant qualities entitle him to our admiration if ever that day shall come to pass when the clouds that obscure his birth shall disperse i am persuaded it will be found that he is of noble descent and should the same good fortune raise him to affluence and an elevated situation i am certain there is no sphere in life so extended which his virtues will not adorn and fill  chapter vi a short excursion leads to an important interview at the expected time arrived the body of the deceased lady crowbery properly attended and followed by a numerous company of the tenants and peasants appertaining to the estate there is no need for us to describe the solemn pageantry of a funeral it will suffice to say that the mortal remains of one of the meekest and most benevolent of gods creatures were committed to the vault of her ancestors with every ceremonious rite that could mark the respect of her surviving friends and every tribute of unfeigned sorrow that could testify their affection the service was performed by the reverend dr sandford assisted by his son and the body was followed by sir roger manstock and isabella chief mourners a great concourse of spectators were assembled amongst whom two strangers in horsemens loose coats were conspicuous for the eagerness with which they pressed forwards at the interment of the body as well as for the interest they appeared to take in that affecting ceremony deep affliction seemed to possess them wholly and as they held their handkerchiefs to their faces all the while the service was performing none of those whose attention was drawn toward them and they were not a few could get a sight of their faces or learn by any enquiry who they were after the service was over they separated themselves from the crowd mounted their horses and rode off with speed  there was one however in that mournful assembly whose attention had not been so totally engrossed by his share in it as not to catch a sudden glimpse of these strangers which led him to a pretty confident conjecture as to the person of one of them it was young sandford who had made this observation and upon the first opportunity which offered of his speaking to isabella apart he communicated to her his persuasion that he had discovered his friend henry amongst the crowd disguised in a clownish dress and accompanied by another person in the like habit the probability immediately struck her though she herself had not made any observation upon the spectators general or particular  we forgot to mention in its proper place that we had a friend amongst the mourners zachary cawdle by name who had accompanied the hearse all the way from falmouth in an attendant coach he was now lodged in hagley hall and it is hardly to be supposed that our fair heroine had failed to make certain enquiries of him which might now have made any further questions about henrys appearance at the funeral unnecessary but the fact was that these enquiries had not produced any other information from honest zachary except that henry accompanied by a gentleman who called himself smith had parted from him at falmouth disclosing nothing more of his future plan than that he would be at crowbery within such a time and hoped to meet him there upon a certain business to this zachary added under the seal of secrecy that the seamed mr smith was veritably that identical mr delapoer from whom lady crowbery was rescued by her father within a stage of gretna green and who had been ever since in the east indies from whence he was lately returned with an affluent fortune here zachary stopped and with a sagacious look eyed the young lady whose knowledge of the secret in his keeping supplied all the rest which he in justice to his trust suppressed  all this isabella had gained from zachary within a few hours after his arrival so that when mr sandford imparted to her his supposed discovery of henry in company with a person unknown her own suggestions readily found a name for that person without resorting to zachary for any further intelligence there was one reflection isabella drew from this account that was consolatory to her mind in its present state of anxious suspense  henry had found a father and under all events was probably secured against any future danger of experiencing distress of circumstances this consideration also helped her to account in some degree for her cousins silence in her will an omission otherwise both inexplicable and in her sense of it inexcuseable  it had occurred to sandford and he suggested it to isabella that it was likely henry would be found somewhere in or about the house of his deceased benefactor ratcliffe and the probability of this so struck that young lady as to determine her upon putting her projected visit to that mansion into immediate execution she accordingly with her fathers consent obtained his chaise for an airing and immediately directed it to the point she had in view fortunately for her purpose she was alone and whilst her heart throbbed with the hopes of meeting the dearest object of its thoughts reflecting upon the difficulties that darkened all her views of happiness she trembled as she approached the spot and dreaded what she most desired an interview with henry at the bottom of a little hanging garden in front of a neat but humble mansion her carriage stopped and she got out a little wicket in a low shorn hedgerow of hornbeam was open and admitted her into the garden the slope was rather steep and she slowly sauntered up it gazing about her on each side and surveying the small but interesting scene with a pensive sensibility she was noticed by an old woman who presented herself at the house door and asked her commands isabella said she wished to see the rooms and that it was not idle curiosity but respect for the memory of the late inhabitant had brought her thither  then pray madam walk in and welcome perhaps you belong to the dear young gentleman who is now in the house and sure enough i am the happiest creature living to see him safe and once more amongst us after being lost so long he is in the little back parlour which was my late masters study all alone and there he has been these two long hours forbidding me to interrupt him though i would fain have come in and kept him company in hopes to have cheered him a bit for i know he must be melancholy to think of the days he passed in that room with my dear good dead master who loved him as if he had been the father of him  this intelligence so agitated the tender spirits of isabella that she paused in suspense and for a while stood musing what to do at length having resolved to proceed she desired to be shown the room where the gentleman was the old woman conducted her through a little vestibule into a plain neat parlour and there pointing to a door that was opposite to the windows she said that is my late masters study there mr henry is  isabella desired to be left and when the dame had disappeared she approached the door and with a trembling hand turned the lock and presented to the sight of henry an object so welcome and so unexpected that starting with ecstasy from his seat he exclaimed good heavens do i behold miss manstock may i believe my eyes are you alone  i am here alone she replied whilst blushes overspread her face and i confess my purpose was to find you out i heard you was present at a mournful meeting you was discovered henry but not by me  he approached her respectfully took her hand and tenderly pressed his lips upon it it was visible that he had been in tears his eyes were red with weeping he fixed them on her with a look so full of love and transport as caused the timid sensibility of isabella to shrink back and retire a few steps which instantly observing he recollected himself and in the mildest accent beseeched her to believe he knew the distance he should keep in presence of such purity but if i had the power said he by words to paint to you how beautiful you are how exquisitely charming you appear thus breaking forth upon me by surprise and overpowering all my faculties with unexpected joy you would in candor own i had some struggles to subdue yet fear me not if it were possible to lose myself through an excess of love it is not here within the mansion of virtue you could be a witness to my disorder  i have no fears she replied i commit myself to you with perfect confidence and gladly seize the opportunity of conversing with you in private anxious to assure you that my heart remains unaltered that it sympathizes with you in your sorrows in your joys for if you have lost a mother henry i am told you have found a father and that i hope in some degree will balance your affliction as to this estate which i consider myself as holding in trust for your use i have only conjecture to assist me in my interpretation of my cousins will having received no private instructions from her before her death therefore i conjure you henry if you know her wishes impart them to me fully and without reserve i am confident it could not be her purpose to pass you over and heap an useless fortune in your wrong on me  ah loveliest of women cried henry of what use is all this world can give to me without the hope on which alone i live if i am bereft of that i have more than misery can want already what matters it how a solitary being languishes out an irksome life let me sink into obscurity without a name which only can disgrace the memory of my unhappy mother and give cause of triumph to her cruel pesecutor who survives her perhaps my isabellas father would be wounded in his pride of family if i were published to the world the heir of lady crowbery and the son of delapoer  henry cried isabella eagerly interrupting him you strike upon the very circumstance that causes all my terror and distress my fathers feelings are exactly what you suppose them to be and all the opposition he ever gave to your pretensions arose from the suspicion he entertained of your being the son of his niece he now from the nature of my cousins will is persuaded to the contrary of that suspicion and is become your cordial friend knowing therefore that he is now acting toward you under the impression of a mistaken conclusion what a situation am i in to avail myself of his delusion and carry on a deceit against him is what my nature revolts from to undeceive him and reveal a secret i have pledged myself to keep is what i cannot do hard indeed is that dilemma which puts me under equal difficulties whether i resort to silence or confession nothing can extricate me from it unless you are so fully possessed of lady crowberys mind or have such written instructions in charge as may either direct me how to act toward my father or leave me to make use of my own discretion by releasing me from my engagement if you have any such therefore to report or to produce impart them to me i beseech you for both our sakes  chapter vii the interview is brought to a conclusion when our hero heard himself thus earnestly called upon to produce the letter he was encharged with though his delicacy would have been better gratified could he have been absent whilst isabella read it yet he no longer hesitated to deliver it to her telling her at the same time that it was written by his mother three days only before her death and that the contents had never been imparted to him nor in any respect suggested by him to this she made answer by assuring him she gave perfect credit to his delicacy in the business and that her only apology for reading it in his presence was her wish to be instructed in her cousins pleasure touching an affair on which their mutual happiness depended i am fettered added she till this letter sets me free if indeed it shall do that without some clue to guide me how shall i ever extricate myself from this labyrinth of difficulties in which i am lost oh henry before i open this important paper let me confess to you that i perceive all which is dear to me in life may be decided by it and i feel a thousand anxious fears lest fidelity to a fatal promise and duty to a respected father should seal me down to silence and separate us perhaps for ever  and would that sad necessity he demanded so terrible to me cause a regret in you does my beloved my adored isabella wish to reward her henrys faithful love have i an interest in her heart  you should know that she tenderly replied for you possess it wholly that fond heart is yours  language is nothing words can give no picture of those soft emotions which a sincere and virtuous passion when alarmed by dangers can in the crisis of its sat excite within a feeling bosom it is then the soul looks through the eyes and by its own intelligible emanation intimates to the beloved object thoughts and sensations which no eloquence can so describe such was the look that in this interesting moment glanced from isabellas eyes to henrys he had been more or less than man had he remained unmoved and master of himself our hero was a man one of the bravest and the best of natures family but still he was her son and by inheritance made subject to those sallies and alarms of passion which mere mortality cannot at all times conquer and repress temperance he had we have given it upon proof recorded in his history respect he never wanted in the presence of virtue and virtue was present in the person of isabella yet impetuous love hurried him on and as her fond eyes glanced upon him he threw his arms in rapture round her beauteous waist and pressed her ardently in his presumptuous embrace  i am but natures copyist her scribe and dare not add or take away without her leave it is nature therefore and not i that must explain why isabella pure as the untouched lily did not shrink away and sever her sweet form from henrys arms yet so it was and so i write it down as my responsible directress dictates the letter was yet unopened and now the blushing isabella having mildly reproved her too ardent lover and taken her seat at some little distance from him read as follows  fully sensible that my last hour of life is close at hand i write to you my beloved isabella whilst it is yet in my power a few lines to be delivered into your hands by my son when i shall be no more an unexpected meeting with his father under most peculiar circumstances having providentially taken place i have at their joint instance been prevailed upon to bequeath my whole fortune to you making no mention whatever of my henry in my will their motive for this generous sacrifice has been extreme delicacy toward my memory and mine for complying with it has been confidence in your justice and a perfect conviction that my henry lives but in the hope of sharing life and all its interests with you if this happy union takes place all will be well and my spirit shall rest in peace if not alas no wealth can profit him nothing that i can give will save him from despair duplicity never was my isabellas character i therefore die in the persuasion that you love my son that love will inspire you with the means of reconciling your connection with him to the feelings of your father be they of what sort they may i leave this to your conduct and discretion and for that purpose totally release you from all past promises respecting what in secresy i have imparted to you i only think lord crowbery should not know it as his insulting temper may in that case provoke events that might disturb your future peace and plunge you into serious distress may providence direct you in it is wisdom and preserve you in it is mercy think of me with the candor that belongs to you pardon my errors protect my memory remember my last wishes you and my henry will have my dying prayers farewell for ever  cecilia   isabella having perused this letter with silent attention delivered it to henry for his reading which when he had done he said as he returned it to her  my fate is in your hands whether i am or am not avowed to sir roger manstock depends on your pleasure and so entirely am i resigned to it that if your commands shall be for my immediate departure painful as obedience in that case will be yet i will obey provided i am not banished without hope but may be permitted to believe that there is one conclusion in that letter on which all my happiness depends not falsely drawn and that the fond persuasion in which my lamented mother died has some foundation in your heart there whilst i hold a place life must be dear to me and my ambition to deserve at distance some remembrance in your thoughts will animate me to such efforts as may happily in time to come obtain your fathers favor behold me then loveliest of women your devoted creature and pronounce my doom  here isabella raised her eyes and turning them upon him with a look that smiled through tears replied  if twas with me to pronounce upon your fate your happiness would be complete for why should i affect to disguise what your own observation must have discovered that you have all the interest in my heart which this letter gives you well might the dear lamented writer be persuaded of a truth too obvious to escape her nor doubt of an attachment which i so far from striving to conceal hold it my point of honor to avow hypocrisy has ever been my scorn i trust that modesty does not need it and i am certain that your character will ever grace the woman that admires it  then i am blessed indeed exclaimed the enraptured lover thus honored by your approbation i am fortified against all difficulties direct me what to do for i am ready  there i am still to seek said isabella and time does not allow for our debating this important point with the deliberation it requires one thing is certain whilst you are undiscovered you will be sure to find a welcome from my father come to us then with all your former mystery about you make your own observations on the spot we shall have opportunities of further conversation on the subject and those opportunities perhaps will not be totally unpleasant though they may not produce all the effects that our uncertainty might wish for we may renew our walks at least and you may amuse your fancy with projecting future alterations and embellishments in a place that must at all events become your property we shall remain a few days in this spot and though we cannot cheer your spirits with amusing scenes or lively company my best endeavors shall not be wanting to dispel the gloom of sadness or to share it with you in bewailing our lost friend and soothing you with all the tender sympathy that a fond faithful heart can feel  saying this she leant her hand on his and gently pressed it the sweet manner of it was so modest and withal so captivating that all his senses were absorbed in love  now we must part she said my time is out and these are moments henry that will never stay but come to us i charge you come i shall prepare my father to expect you and let it be this evening this said the lovers separated isabella returned to hagley hall and henry to his father  chapter viii the discovery of a posthumous paper causes great sensations the death of lady crowbery had so deeply affected delapoer that henry saw with concern a very visible alteration in his state of health and a fixed melancholy that seemed to take possession of him wholly balancing between duty and inclination he scarce knew how to decide with respect to isabellas tempting invitation upon discoursing with his father however he found him so resolved to take up his abode in the neighborhood of hagley that he immediately began to cast about in his thoughts for some fit place for him to reside in and it soon occurred to him that the very house where his late happy interview with isabella had taken place would be of all situations most desirable if that preferment should devolve upon any person unencumbered with a family this idea by a very natural transition suggested to him the probability of his friend young sandfords being thought of for that succession and as he entertained a very high opinion of his merit he determined to employ his interest with isabella in his behalf  this idea henry communicated to his father and found him so eager to embrace it and so pressing for him to lose no time in visiting sir roger manstock that he set out for hagley hall without delay here he received a very cordial welcome from the worthy baronet whom he found alone and already apprised of his coming by isabella speaking of his nieces death sir roger took notice to henry of his being overlooked in her will as a matter that caused some surprise and which he could not well account for having heard the deceased more than once declare her intentions of providing for him at her death adding that he considered himself as heir to those intentions and telling him not to be cast down for in his friendship he should find a resource against all disappointments  to this henry made answer that the excellent lady alluded to who always acted from the best and purest motives had faithfully fulfilled all promises she had ever made him and that his grateful respect for her memory would never cease but with life itself he thanked sir roger for the offer of his friendship which he accepted as the highest honor he could aspire to and which he would study to merit and preserve by every effort in his power favors of any other sort he flattered himself he should not stand in need of  here their conversation was cut short by the arrival of doctor sandford who had not been many minutes in the room before henry had the satisfaction to hear sir roger manstock acquaint him that with his daughters concurrence he had determined to nominate his son to the living late enjoyed by the reverend mr ratcliffe the good man expressed a lively sense of gratitude on this occasion and his happiness seemed complete  henry in a private conversation with his friend zachary cawdle revived the subject of billy williams and as zachary was now determined upon retiring from business on his annuity bequeathed to him by lady crowbery he very readily engaged to make over his shop and effects to williams upon fair and equitable terms which should be adjusted when that gentleman should obtain a discharge from his ship and make his appearance at crowbery for which place zachary intended to set out the next morning this matter being settled to henrys entire content for he was much attached to williams zachary began to speak of matters more immediately interesting and turning to our hero he said  in this very room where we are now sitting i brought you into the world and surely it is now full time you should assume some proper name and station in society life is uncertain and though thank god i feel myself stout and hearty at this present moment yet we are all liable to casualties and nobody can say how long it may be before i follow your good mother in which case you would lose a witness to your birth whose testimony is most material you have a father it is true whose fortune can in some respect indemnify you for the disinterested and give me leave to call it the wanton sacrifice you have made of this noble property which had else been yours but that father a if i have any skill in my professsion is in a very precarious state of health his spirits sink and his constitution threatens swift decay it behooves you therefore my dear henry to look about you if you have put aside your inheritance in the hope of sharing it with the amiable young lady who now possesses it methinks you would do well to lose no time in bringing that expectancy to bear and why you should persist in concealing yourself from sir roger manstock who seems to be so favorably disposed and entertains you with such kindness and regard is what i cannot understand you will pardon me for the freedom i take in talking to you on a subject in which i am no otherwise concerned but as my friendship and good wishes interest me in every thing that relates to you for in truth dear henry i have a very warm and tender heart toward you and ever had from the first moment fortune threw you in my way  your zeal said henry can stand in need of no apology and i am free to confess to you that my situation with respect to sir roger manstock becmes every hour more and more irksome to me as every species of disguise must be when i know that i am indebted to a misconception for the kindness he shows me i cannot enjoy the fruits of it with content it blights the happiness i should else receive in the society of the loveliest of women and though i have every reason to fear that the discovery of my birth would be instantly followed by my dismission from every hope that points toward an alliance with his amiable daughter yet my conscience so revolts against deceit that i will sooner meet the worst of misfortunes and embrace despair than persist to act the counterfeit as i have hitherto been compelled to do you therefore see my worthy friend how entirely my feelings coincide with your counsel and i am resolved with isabellas leave tomorrow shall not pass without an explanation on my part let me then request that you will not set out upon your journey till that event is over as it cannot fail to happen that we shall appeal to you  zachary signified his perfect compliance with this request and henry declared his resolution accordingly an occurrence in the mean time had come to pass which anticipated all the consequences incidental to that resolution sir roger manstock whilst discoursing with doctor sandford upon some particulars relative to the living intended for his son had occasion to refer to some papers of the late mr ratcliffe which the doctor told him were to be found in a certain oldfashioned cabinet where he himself had deposited them upon the death of that gentleman and of which he kept the key the papers were easily found but in taking them out it appeared to sir roger that there was some secret machinery at the bottom of the cell in which they laid for hiding money or valuables in a small compass and upon a closer scrutiny a joint was discovered which upon the insertion of a penknife was made to slide back and in it was found a small packet folded in the form of a letter unsealed upon opening this packet sir roger immediately recognized the handwriting of his brotherinlaw sir stephen adamant and read as follows  particulars relative to my daughter cecilia to be communicated to her uncle sir roger manstock after my decease this title he read aloud and here he paused closing the paper and observing to his companion that it was a very extraordinary and to him a very interesting discovery i confess to you added he my curiosity is highly agitated nay so much am i affected by the suddenness of the surprise that i can scarce command myself enough to proceed with the perusal of it it seems to have been my brothers purpose that i should be made acquainted with the contents yet no such communication was ever made to me so that in honor i am hardly satisfied that i ought to read any further have you doctor sandford any knowledge of this paper you was most in the confidence of sir stephen if you have any information on the subject give it me if not advise me what to do  i have nothing to guide me but conjecture replied the doctor but i should presume there need be no hesitation on your part to read what professes to have been written for your information the early attachment of our dear lamented lady is well known to every friend of the family and i should guess the paper may refer to that there has ever been a mystery consequential of that transaction and as it is probably developd in that posthumous packet i will with your permission retire whilst you examine it in private so saying he left the room and sir roger read as follows   particulars relative to my daughter cecilia to be communicated to her uncle sir roger manstock after my decease upon the   th day of august      my daughter then of the age of sixteen and upwards secretly escaped from hagleyhouse in company with a young cornet the honorable henry delapoer purposing to effect a stolen marriage at gretna green  the young man i confess had made fair and open proposals for my daughter but i had other views and positively prohibited the connection he was formed to engage a heart like cecilias his person was fine his manners and address were captivating in the extreme alas mistaken man that i am i knew not to what extremes her passion was capable of hurrying her and foolishly expected that my authority could extinguish it love and nature set my power at naught and my child in every other instance of her life the most dutiful creature breathing broke those from every filial tie and elopd with her admirer furious in my wrath and equally exasperated against both parties i pursued them along the road with such unremitted exertion that upon their very last post i overtook and surpised them in a public inn where they were changing horses  here i forced them oh fatal violence from each others arms in spite of prayers entreaties and even confession on cecilias part of an anticipated consummation that took from innocence its virgin gloss and in the course of time to the dishonor of my house and the ruin of my minds future peace occasioned my poor child to be an unmarried mother whilst her disconsolate lover had left his native country and embarked for the east indies  early in the month of may ensuing cecilia was secretly delivered in my own house of a male infant zachary cawdle a faithful man and skilful in his profession assisted her in that painful extremity  heaven and earth can i describe my anguish my remorse my terrors in those moments what would i then have given could i have recalled the banished father of my wretched grandson how did my conscience rack me with remorse for having torn two hearts asunder pledged to each other by every sacred vow and virtually though not legally married oh had i then had mercy in my wrath had i allowed for nature for affection for the weakness of a fond doting girl at sixteen years of age what misery had i prevented what shame had i avoided let no father henceforth tread in my unwary steps  they will but lead him to remorse and agony  and now ten years are past whilst i have seen my daughter married to a despicable lord who is her tyrant rather than her husband in her my generation legitimately stops no fruit can spring from such a stock her bed is barren and her heart is broken thank heaven my grandson henry still survives protected reared and educated by the best of men and of friends the most faithful i see him fostered into early virtues by the forming hand of ratcliffe god of all mercies bless and prosper the mysterious issue of my hapless child whilst my sad daughter lives and is lord crowberys wife i dare not venture to avow the son of indiscretion hard fate for him poor innocent for my cecilia for myself  is there a friend now left to me on earth in whose humane and honest heart i can repose my sorrows and my secret let me still hope there is surely sir roger manstock is that candid that trustworthy friend  to sir roger manstock to the uncle of my child in confidence i bequeath this mournful narrative of my errors and misfortunes imploring him by all that he holds sacred to protect and father the last relict of my house my nameless unacknowledged child to whom i trust a mothers love and justice will bequeath that property which in this firm persuasion i have devised to her and put into her free and absolute disposal without limitation or restraint let henry then take his fathers name i would not leave a stigma on my daughters memory may crowbery never have to say he took the refuse of a favored lover  sensible that i am hastening to the close of life i would fain dedicate my short abiding time to atonement and repentance to you therefore sir my brother and my friend i address this paper avowing a full sense of my past errors and a deep contrition for that haughty spirit of revenge which prompted me to blast the happiness of two persons formed for each other wedded in spirit and in heart and who but for my fatal interference would have blessed the remnant of my days to you sir my brother and my friend i once more solemnly bequeath my grandson henry you are yourself a father you have a lovely daughter two years younger than my boy nature has taught you how to judge of my sensations by your own to your family my fortune would have devolved had not this son of my cecilia stood between us may i not form a distant hope that time and education may hereafter so adorn and grace the work of nature as to make him worthy your regard and love the outset is auspicious the promise of his infant years is flattering in the extreme should this fair blossom ripen into that perfection which its early bloom gives hope of and should your sweet child my pretty goddaughter when time with lenient hand has molded her soft beauties into womanhood be touched with tender pity and esteem for my adopted henry need i despair of your candor or must the want of that last form that my precipitancy interrupted haunt him through life and cast him off from happiness without his fault may heaven inspire your heart with sentiments more generous and may he who mixes blood from no ignoble source with that which he derives from me merit a blessing great as my fond fancy has devised farewell  chapter ix the counsel of a friend in a dilemma more secrets are brought to light the perusal of this paper which pointed out to sir roger manstock the son of his niece in the person of henry the admirer of his daughter threw him into deep meditation and exceedingly perplexed him how to act in a case where decision on either side militated against his feelings the appeal was solemn that pleaded in favor of the youth the objection to his illegitimacy and even to his proximity of blood was no slight one and sir rogers mind was long time balanced between difficulties one point his conscience saw in the clearest light  the equity of henrys claim to the property of his grandfather and according to the high sense of honor natural to him he interpreted the paper he had just been reading but how to act with respect to his daughter whether to oppose or to countenance her attachment was the question that embarrassed him on the opposing side there was a strong repugnance arising from his habits of thinking and from a certain pride of family which revolted from the stain of illegitimacy on the favorable side there was much occurred to mitigate the rigor of these thoughts the character of henry preeminently pleaded in his behalf the fatal consequences of paternal obduracy so forcibly set forth in the recital of sir stephen was a striking example before his eyes and the pathetic adjuration at the close of that recital was an affecting appeal to his heart which was sensibly felt  it is in a crisis like this when the mind is fluctuating between doubt and decision that the voice of a friend is most welcome and then it is that new reasons or reasons differently expressed and dilated seldom fail to cut the knot that puzzles us to unravel sir roger rung his bell and requested the company of doctor sandford  a better arbitrator could not be chosen he read the paper attentively and when called upon for his sentiments upon it deliberately replied as follows i am not surprised at the discovery which this paper gives for though i was not a party to the secret of this young mans birth i was ever in my private opinion persuaded of his being the son of those very parents now disclosed to us well may the unhappy writer bewail his own obduracy i knew the party rejected and thought him every way deserving of the alliance he courted sir stephen knew my sentiments for he drew them from me and i honestly committed my opinion to his consideration it did not tally with his own and i lost his confidence by the sincerity with which i gave it mr ratcliffe in consequence of this had charge of the infant  a better choice could not be made a worthier wiser more enlightened mind no man possessed  to an education so excellent the son of your niece did ample justice nature never formed a more engaging person instruction never cultivated a more accomplished mind  here sir roger interposed declaring his entire concurrence in this testimony to his merits  but with what face he demanded can i hold up to the world the spurious issue of my deluded niece what will lord crowbery say what will the world at large say to an adoption like this i should be glad to hear your sentiments on this point of difficulty  with this paper in my hand replied the doctor i cannot resist the appeal it contains nor refuse being advocate for the feelings of the writer of it when i see a father taking on himself the reproach of being sole author of his daughters errors and misfortunes and weigh the circumstances that attended their elopement and arrest upon the way i can hardly be induced to call their issue illegitimate i should go too far if i was to deny the right of a parent to restrain or to direct the passions of his child but sir stephen went farther and exerted more authority than belonged to him when he compelled a marriage with the lord viscount crowbery that is an act of tyranny over the human heart which i hold in abhorrence what vows were interchangd between your niece and her first lover we cannot know but we can well conjecture they were solemn and sincere on both sides their hearts were married though the blacksmith was not found that would have clinchd the chain shall then the son of love and promise be disclaimed because a few hours intervened and force was employed to tear their hands asunder and compel them to a separation mark how the parent suffers in his conscience for this act of cruelty so would not i for all this world can give me henry is a virtuous youth affix what criminality you please to the authors of his birth we cannot so pervert all sense of justice as to attach their stain to his character however much we may wish to cover the memory of his mother from the malevolent attacks of lord crowbery and others who may be basely disposed to blast it this i confess should be avoided as much as possible and surely it will be no impossible thing to do that by proper precautions with respect to lord crowbery at least so long as he survives which seems to have been the clear intention of the deceased lady when she forebore to name her son in her will and as you have told me henry himself was the chief promoter of this omission i cannot doubt but he was fully acknowledged by his mother before she died  i dont doubt that resumed sir roger and i hold my daughter bound to restore him to his inheritance upon every principle of honor and justice but i am not bound to give him my daughter also  far be it from me replied the doctor to say that your daughters inclination must precede a step so essential to her own happiness as that  but am i bound to follow with my consent her inclinations if they should point to him  i must decline an answer to that question being so partial as i am to henry  why that is answering it replied sir roger to the fullest extent here their conference was interrupted by a servant who announced a gentleman of the name of smith that requested a few minutes conversation in private with sir roger manstock order being given for the gentlemans admittance and doctor sandford having withdrawn the father of our hero presented himself to the worthy baronet and addressed him to the following effect   i am personally unknown to you sir roger manstock but am no stranger to your character and hold it in the most perfect respect i have therefore solicited a few minutes of your leisure and you have politely granted it for which i thank you and will study not to abuse your patience i have sent in a name by your servant which in your presence i should be ashamed to wear being only an assumed one for reasons that i trust you will think not unworthy of a gentleman my real name is henry delapoer which in times past you may have heard attached to that of the loveliest and by me the most lamented of her sex pardon me if for the present i can proceed no further  sir roger started with amaze he smote his hands together with more than usual energy and gazed upon the stranger with intense curiosity  may i believe what i hear he cried are you really mr delapoer the honorable henry delapoer father   there he stopped short and checked the words that were upon his lips  sir interjected the visitor you was proceeding with your speech may i request you to fill up the sentence  you may replied sir roger after a short pause the words i was about to add were the father of my nieces son  my conscience then is clear said delapoer you are possessed of the secret and i have broke no trust yes sir i am that very person miserable in the recollection of the bitterest disappointment that ever blasted human happiness but honored in the virtues of that son who is at once the memorial of our misfortune and the relict of our love i may now say to sir roger manstock all that a wounded heart suggests i may speak of my sorrows of my affection of my despair which is now hurrying me to the grave where my betrothed my everlovd cecilia sleeps here a gust of tears interrupted his speech for a few instants he wiped them away and proceeded  it is now my request and i hope your charity will grant it that my remains may be allowed to rest in the vault beside those of that sainted being who was by every obligation sacred in the eye of heaven my true and all but legal wife sir we were bound together by the holiest ties accursed be the breath that dares to contaminate the purity of my cecilias fame if there was crime in our precipitancy that crime be on my head i will embrace the whole of the offense let her unfeeling father take on himself the responsibility of our separation sir i have held it matter of the strictest conscience ever since that fatal moment to keep unviolated the marriage bed and i have religiously fulfilled that sacred duty one melancholy consolation heaven vouchsafed providence employed the arm of my son to rescue me from death when i was a prisoner on board a ship of the enemy and at the last stage of existence he brought me to the port of falmouth his piety and care preserved my life fortune directed cecilia to the same spot i passed some days by the couch of that dying martyr and she expired in the arms of me and of my son grant me then i beseech you my last earnest prayer and let my corpse repose by here is  the baronet whose long silence had been the effect of his sympathy in the feelings of the speaker now found himself called upon for a reply at a time when he was much more inclined to give a loose to tears than to words he commanded himself notwithstanding so far as to assure his visitor that his suit was granted and to add withal that he hoped it would be many years before that promise could be claimed to this delapoer replied with many acknowledgments that nothing but his conviction that no time was to be lost could have excused to himself the rude intrusion of so unseasonable a visit  here he paused and seemed preparing to take his leave when it occurred to sir roger as proper to apprise him that he had possessed himself by chance of a posthumous paper written by his nieces father which had thrown great light on his state of mind and which at the same time devolved a duty upon him on the part of his daughter of reinstating henry in the whole of his grandfathers estate this added he is an act of justice which i think i can take upon myself to say will be infallibly performed on our part and i shall now put the paper into your hands for your perusal and very highly interesting it is to you mr delapoer and your representative  chapter x our history records a dreadful incident delapoer having read the paper returned it to sir roger observing that although the writers change of sentiments came too late for redress it was to be hoped they were in time for the full purposes of repentance he then proceeded to disclose to sir roger the state of his own circumstances in point of fortune which being settled upon henry would at all events make him an affluent man there is but one object in life added he can make him a happy one if i know his thoughts rightly it is the person not the property of the present heiress of this estate which he would receive as the greatest bounty she could bestow upon him  to this sir roger simply replied that henry was certainly a very amiable young man and delapoer too delicate to press his wishes any further politely took his leave and departed in fact the mind of the worthy baronet was by no means made up to any determined measure and as the recent death of lady crowbery secured him from any present call from either of the parties he very gladly availed himself of the excuse for holding back his opinion till it was more matured by experience and reflection  henry now wished to throw aside a mask he was no longer compelled to wear and to declare himself to sir roger manstock but as it was necessary in the first place to consult isabellas opinion in the case he followed her into the park where he understood she was gone to take her evening walk when he had mounted the hill that rose from the house he caught a distant glimpse of her as she was entering a grove of oaks and immediately set out toward the spot with all the speed he could he was yet at some distance when a female shriek was heard as coming from some one in the grove which struck him to the heart with the apprehension that his lovely isabella was in danger or alarm already nearly breathless with his exertions terror gave him all but wings upon a call so pressing and he sprung forwards toward the voice with an impetuosity undescribable  swift as his motion was our history demands a pause before we bring him to the rescue of the affrighted isabella whilst we account for the cause of that shriek so terrible to the ears of love  in the near neighborhood of hagley house without the enclosure of the park there was a lonely mansion tenanted by a person whose melancholy profession it was to take charge of those unhappy beings who are deprived of reason one of these distracted objects and probably the most pitiable in the whole wretched fraternity was a young man of the name of saunders only son of a respectable clergyman who had bred him in the line of his own profession and given him an excellent education with that view both at school and university the youth whom nature had endowed with uncommon talents had more than equalled all the warmest expectations of a fond exulting father every honor that moral conduct could merit every prize that successful genius could contend for had been fairly gained and worthily possessed by this young student but strong imagination and a feeling heart the natural concomitants of superior genius had conspired against the peace of poor saunders and by a disappointment in love had made wreck of a mind full freighted with science and richly endowed with every noble quality the object of his passion was unfortunately one to whom in point of rank and circumstances he could not aspire and though she felt his merits and was flattered by his attentions yet his suit was peremptorily and proudly rejected by her father who had higher views and overruled the affections of his child with absolute authority the same fine taste that taught him to select and admire the purest models of classical composition inspired him with a passion for the elegant and beautiful louisa beaufort his opportunities of conversing with her were not frequent for sir ferdinand her father was not easy of access from one so much his inferior and saunders was reduced to a variety of humble shifts to make known to louisa the flame that was consuming him and gradually undermining the foundations of a solid understanding the smile which at some stolen moment she could bestow upon him was his only hope on these reflections he fed and by the help of a vivid fancy sketched out dreams and visions of happiness which in one fatal moment were for ever blasted by the intelligence of her being married to a titled lover from this instant his deportment became irregular and capricious at first he was loud and vehement in his complaints he talked of the affair to all his friends professed to treat it with contempt and railed against the sex in general venting upon them all the invectives which his memory or imagination could suggest he ransacked the poets ancient and modern for epigrams and lampoons and had by heart every tag and fragment of satire which made for his purpose and which greek latin or english could supply if any one of his acquaintance spoke in praise of a woman or even toasted the health of his mistress he was ready with a dash at his folly which oftentimes would have brought on serious discussions had he not been very generally considered as a licensed railer or had his companions been as prompt for quarrel as himself  this humor being spent his mind took a sudden turn to the contrary extreme and poor saunders was no more to be found in society sullen and inaccessible he shut himself into his college room and centering all his ideas heretofore so wild and excursive in one single point and dwelling invariably upon that with pertinacious melancholy the vigor of his intellect began to melt away whilst his constitution partaking of the same debility and attenuated by long fasting was hastening to decay by actual inanition a student late so regular in his duties could not absent himself from college hours without drawing the attention of his tutor and other members of the society upon him the former of these one day took means of surprising him in his room where he discovered him on his knees employed in loud and fervent prayer to which his presence gave not the smallest interruption whilst the poor supplicant continued to deplore his wretched state of mind in terms truly piteous and disconsolate intermixed with petitions most earnest and devout for the preservation of his reason his pitying visitor was melted at the scene of such distress and having waited for a proper interval applied such consolation as his charity could suggest upon the emergency and instantly dispatched a letter to the father apprising him of the dangerous condition to which his pupil was reduced this sad intelligence soon brought the afflicted parent to be a witness of the total ruin of his hopes he took the poor distracted creature with him to his own house where finding no relief to his disorder but on the contrary an increase of every symptom to an extravagance that kept him under hourly alarm he at last resolved to resign him wholly into the hands of a keeper and in this house before described he placed him where for some months he had been confined under proper regimen though without any progress toward cure of which his wretched parent now began to lose all hope  it had so chanced this very evening that with a cunning peculiar to his distemper he had contrived to elope from his keeper and running out of the house at random had made his way into hagley park escaping the sight of his pursuers by hiding himself in the grove where he was lying buried under the thickest of the underwood when chance brought the beauteous isabella in her solitary ramble to the very spot where he was concealed a glimpse of her fair form which his quick eye caught through the bushes roused him instantly from his lair and springing on her like a couchant tiger on the unwary passenger he seized the trembling victim in his arms roaring out in a yell of transport  have i caught you then at last vile perjured woman traitress to my love murderer of my peace false faithless louisa you have driven me to desperation you have made me what i am mad as the fires of hecla wild as the waves that swallow navigation up and now siren i will be revenged upon you for my transformation a beast of your own creation shall devour you i will pluck asunder those fine limbs and scatter them to all the points of heaven come come no struggling hence with all this frippery away with it you are but natures counterfeit well have her full in sight and then   upon the instant in that saving momentary crisis on which humanity will not admit of speculations pause our hero henry breathless aghast led thither by that unseen clue which providence had graciously bestowed for virtues timely rescue sprung upon the lunatic and with a phrensy equal to his own grasping him in his arms hurled him violently to the ground never quitting his hold but accompanying him in his fall in the same moment the dishevelled isabella her cloak handkerchief and clothes torn from her dropped inanimate at his side without uttering even a sigh that showed signs of life distracted with the sight still he did not venture to let loose his desperate antagonist who raved and foamed in all the furious excess of phrensy yelling and gnashing with his teeth a spectacle too horrible for contemplation emaciated as he was the very spectre of famine still his madness gave him nerves almost supernatural and in their grappling all the vigor henrys active limbs could furnish sometimes scarce sufficed to keep him under and hold him down extended on his back at length the wretched creature gave one desperate struggle then uttered a direful groan and swooned upon the spot stretching his limbs as if in the last pang of life  happily at this moment the keeper and his follower guided to the spot by the yells and howlings of their patient made their appearance to the unspeakable relief of our exhausted hero whose terrors for the beloved object lying breathless by his side were now become too agonizing to endure instantly he raised her in his arms replaced the scattered fragments of her dress with tenderest attention arranging it in a manner as decorous as her situation and his own distraction would admit and calling out to the keeper for assistance in recovering her from her swoon the man had skill and was not wanting in humanity he knew withal the quality of the lady who stood in need of his assistance and was terrified not less on his own account than on here is for the consequences of what had happened bidding his servant take charge of the lunatic by tying up his hands he applied himself directly to the recovery of the lady and drawing out a case of lancets recommended the immediate opening of a vein this was eagerly acceded to by henry and in a few seconds the pure blood that fed the veins of the fairest form in nature sprung forth from the lancet and at the same time the brightest eyes that ever lover looked upon unveiled their lids and fixed their sight on henry who whilst assisting the operation just performed had received upon his person the full gushing tribute of that sanguine stream so much dearer to him than what fed his own fond heart the sight of this to which in his confusion he had not adverted so terrified the reviving isabella that the first sign she gave of recollection was a scream of terror on the discovery crying out to the operator  leave leave me and staunch his wounds he is bleeding to death and do not think i will survive him  joy seized the heart of henry to hear the voice of his beloved isabella and to hear it first employed in anxious concern for him he eagerly assured her he was not wounded that the blood which alarmed her was her own and upon these assurances the stream that had stopped began to flow again and her senses grew clear by the revulsion when her arm was bound up and her mind became composed her attention was attracted by the disorder of her dress surveying the confusion and derangement which her person had undergone she perceived that certain articles had been replaced by hands not practiced in those offices and the sensation covered her with blushes the emotion was not lost upon henry he could interpret what was passing in her thoughts and took occasion with a delicacy peculiar to himself to allay and soothe her inquietude she turned a look upon him that beggars all description love beamed in her eyes gratitude filled them with tears then having caught a glimpse of saunders as he was under custody of his keeper turned away with shuddering from the sight and fell upon henrys neck crying out  oh my henry my preserver from what horrors have you rescued me  let those that have the powers of description paint his transports if they can i sink beneath the task and recommend it to the readers fancy if ever he experienced joy like this if not i wish he may deserve it and obtain it  the wretched object that had occasioned all this terror now engaged their attention he had recovered from his swoon but so wan and woebegone as would have extracted pity from a heart of a stone he was sitting on the ground his hands confined with a bandage swathed round his wrists he rolled his eyes about in wild disorder and at last fixing them on his keeper drooped his head gave a deep sigh and burst into tears he was now at once become as meek and humble as he had been outrageous and reason seemed to have revisited his mind with the return of temperance  i am a very wretched creature he cried and sensible of my misfortunes that sometimes drive me into extravagancies i never fail to repent of i know it is for my good that this worthy gentleman ties up my hands but if he would have the charity to set me at liberty i would convince him that i am not unfit to be trusted with the use of them if he will not grant me this favor i should be much beholden to him would he have the kindness to remove a few paces out of sight whilst i speak a word in the way of atonement to the gentleman i have offended i have a secret on my mind which i am desirous of imparting to him and i can assure him on my honor i am this moment as perfectly in my senses as any man in england  here the keeper turned a look upon him which he quickly understood as a sign for silence and obeyed a look no less intelligent was passing at the same moment in another quarter for henry fixing his eyes upon the keepers follower recognized the person of the assassin orourke and perceiving certain indications in the fellows countenance which convinced him he was right he said to him in a whisper  dont be alarmed orourke for i shall not betray you if you execute this melancholy office faithfully and humanely you are in a way to atone to society for the crime you have committed  chapter xi which describes the effects of that incident and concludes the tenth book of our history poor saunders being now removed and the operation of the bleeding having succeeded in restoring isabella to the full possession of her senses and in some degree of her strength she declared herself able to walk to the house and forbade the proposal of sending for a carriage as it would create an alarm which could hardly fail of finding its way to her father with her natural grace and good humor she accepted the apologies of the keeper of the lunatics gordon by name who was very anxious to exculpate himself to the heiress of hagley and to tender his further services if occasion required in accounting for the escape of his patient through the negligence of his servant he took occasion to observe by the way that a derangement of the reason proceeding from disappointed love was universally experienced to be the very worst species of madness that human nature was subject to this he said was unhappily the case of mr saunders whom he despaired of as perfectly incurable  alas cried henry i pity him from my soul i dare say his story is a melancholy one but we will not trouble you to relate it  this he said as a hint to gordon that any farther discourse on the subject in isabellas hearing should be avoided and it might be in part from the same motive that she declined his offer to attend upon her home relying solely on the arm of her protector for her support by the way and leaving gordon to resume his melancholy vocation in the mansion of misery on the skirts of the common adjoining to the park  henry now for the first time in his life regretted the length of way he had to measure with his lovely but languid charge and proceeded slowly and cautiously regardful of every motion that might disturb her and directing every step for her security and ease with hearts full of gratitude to providence and glowing with the tenderest affection for each other they walked silently on till they reached the boundary of the grove where they came in view of the house upon an open lawn that sloped with a gradual descent for the rest of their way here they were descried by sir roger and doctor sandford as they were walking and conversing together within a few paces of the house the baronet observing that isabella walked slowly and seemed supported by henry on whose arm she was leaning instantly took alarm and calling out to the servants who happened then to be out of the way was heard by young sandford who bolting out of the halldoor flew to the call  run i beseech you said sir roger pointing to the spot run to isabella yonder and tell me what has happened for i greatly fear some accident has befallen or some illness seized her  whilst these words were on his lips the eager messenger caught sight of the object they referred to and seized with the like terror sprung forwards with his utmost speed whilst sir roger trembling with apprehension caught hold of his friend hy the arm and stood motionless on the spot in dreadful expectation of the event in the same moment whilst sandford was straining every nerve against the hill isabella taken suddenly with a giddiness and loss of sight had come to a stop and unable to keep her feet had fallen into henrys arms who with one knee upon the ground was supporting her whole weight on his breast and shoulder himself pale as ashes and oppressed with such agony of soul as to be almost in the very act of fainting when sandford came most critically to his assistance the houseservants mean time had seen what was going on and taken the alarm a pair of horses had fortunately been put to the chaise and were ready in the stableyard one of the servants had presence of mind to order them to the spot immediately which was as instantly obeyed during this operation sir roger remained immovable a spectacle of pity sandford saw his distress and as soon as ever the chaise and servants came to the assistance of isabella ran back with all haste to sir roger making signs and calling out by the way that he had good news all was well and no danger two servants had very considerately mounted behind the carriage and by their help the faint and languid isabella was lifted to the seat and placed upon it as much at her length as it admitted of she now opened her eyes and cast them round in search for her preserver he was sitting on the ground totally exhausted and in a situation as it seemed more piteably helpless than her own she would not move without him and he could not stir without help toward her  lay me on the floor of the chaise he cried and let me expire at her feet  she heard his voice but luckily the words did not reach her ear at that instant she started into life and recovered as one out of a trance the mist vanished from before her eyes and seeing henry on the ground she conjured him to arise and come to her in the chaise her father and doctor sandford now approached sir rogers agitation though much assuaged by what had been told him was still very great and as he came up to the chaise the door of which was held open she cried out  oh my beloved father be in no alarm on my account dismiss your fears for me and exert all your care for the recovery of my heroic preserver to whose courage under providence i am indebted for my life  henry was now on his legs and reanimated with the sound of her voice seemed to have lost his debility with the terror that had created it as he presented himself to her sight isabella exclaimed  oh blessed be heaven my protector lives  upon these words sir roger turned a look upon him in which that excess of gratitude which will not admit of language was so strikingly depicted that as he threw his arms about our heros neck he seemed to give him his whole heart with the embrace his cheeks were wet with tears he trembled and was faint but nothing could persuade him to avail himself of the chaise he peremptorily insisted upon henrys taking his seat by isabella  go go he cried i will not rob you of the honor you have earned with you the darling of my soul is safe take the place you so well merit and let the same arm that saved my child support her  end of book the tenth book the eleventh chapter i describes what our heroine is and what we wish our virgin readers to be the time is so nearly approaching when i must close this history that i am now in the situation of a man who being on the point of parting from friends in whose company he has taken a long and pleasant tour is anxious to call to mind any faults or omissions he may have fallen into that he may explain such as will bear a justification and ask pardon for what demands an apology  to enter on a review of all my errors is a task above my hands but there is one i apprehend apparently too gross to be overlooked by any of my readers i mean that of neglecting to describe the person of my heroine if this is a crime it is the more unpardonable forasmuch as i cannot plead oversight and inadvertency in excuse of it i have kept her portrait wilfully in its case and not disclosed even the color of her eyes or set to view a single locket of her hair fieldings sophia had locks of glossy black more modern novels give their heroines flaxen tresses and azure eyes there is a fashion in beauty perhaps my isabella had neither the jet of the raven nor the ivory of the swan i would prefix to these volumes an engraving from her portrait but henry would not let it out of his hands and our great artists are so fully employed that not one was at leisure to go down to manstockhouse to take the copy  now as i have not the vanity to attempt an undertaking which i believe no author has yet succeeded in i will not aim to describe what will not bear a description singularity or deformity may be delineated by the vehicle of words perfect beauty eludes the power of language let it suffice for me to say upon the faith of an historian that my heroine was all the most doting lover when dreaming of his mistress fancies her to be and something more than the selfadmiring beauty beholds when she examines herself in the glass yet in many things she fell short of some whom i have heard extolled above the modesty of praise her eyes could not express what theirs excel in when they sparkled it was with benevolence when they languished it was with pity they were not repulsive enough to look a modest man out of countenance nor attractive enough to inspire an impudent man with hope good nature dimpled round her lips that encased two rows of purest pearls but scorn never pouted in the one and the grin of folly never was put on to disclose the other her voice was melody that kept the middle tones for it could neither sound the pitch of an affected scream nor grumble in the base note of a sullen murmur her motions were the expressive marks that charactered her mind composed and temperate rage never agitated them pride never distorted them light and elastic when she hastened to the succor of the wretched she neither aped the languor of sickliness nor the mincing step of affectation she danced gracefully but not like a professor loved music but was no performer had an eye for nature but never libelled a single feature of it by pen or pencil she had read sufficiently for her years and profitably for her instruction she could express her thoughts in speaking or in writing elegantly and without embarrassment but she possessed in its perfection the still happier gift of a patient ear whilst others were speaking and of a polite attention to what they spoke being the only child of her parents the little bickerings of brothers and sisters never irritated her temper nor did the triumphs of a rival ever fan one spark of envy in her breast educated entirely by an excellent mother she had no communication with governesses and servants nor any friendships with caballing misses that she was deceived in supposing her heart so preoccupied by filial affection as to be unassailable by love these sheets have sufficiently evinced but when she found herself surprised into a tender attachment and fully understood the merits of the person who inspired it she scorned to masque herself in false appearances played off no vain coquetries to teaze and tantalize her lover by affected scruples and counterfeited fears but with a candor that resulted from her purity of thought gave him to know the interest he had gained justly conceiving artifice need not be used to smother a confession which honor dictated and delicacy might avow  if i offend against refinement by describing an ingenuous nature i make no other answer but by an appeal to the hearts of my readers as in like cases i have done to those of my spectators let them decree when men of doubtful characters for doubtful purposes approach the fair let the fair resort to their defenses i am no casuist in a case of cunning nor am i fond of working to my point by crooked paths or describing the base properties of degenerated nature if any of my female readers has been taught to think hypocrisy a virtue by the necessity she has been under of resorting to it i will not argue against her prejudices for a friend that has been so useful to her i can only say it is not a virtue i am studious to bestow upon the character of isabella  chapter ii a modest suitor does not hurt his cause we left our heroine in distress we therefore seize the first instant that our history admits of to resort to her again and now we find her with henry at her side under escort to hagley house where we commit her to the care of her assembled friends with every anxious wish for her speedy and entire recovery  as soon as the superintendant of the insane patients had seen poor saunders securely cased in a straight waistcoat and lodged in proper hands he hastened to make his enquiries after the lady who had suffered so severely by the negligence of his people who had let a creature so wild as saunders escape out of their charge interest and humanity conjointly prompted him to pay this mark of respect and atonement to a person who was now become proprietor of the house and land he lived in sir roger manstock was accessible to every body and of course gordon was admitted from him he received the whole melancholy detail of saunderss case and the providential rescue of his beloved isabella from the clutches of a raving maniac inflamed with revenge against the sex and probably bent both upon violation and murder what were his obligations then to the courage and vigor of her defender when he heard with horror thrilling through his veins this awful narrative of the danger she had been snatched from his heart ran over with gratitude to heaven and acknowledgments to henry  no sooner was gordon departed than sir roger sent a summons to our hero determined to discharge himself in some degree of the weight of obligations which pressed upon his mind by an instant acknowledgment of him as the son of his niece and every offer of an unreserved friendship in future  if then he demands my daughter he said within himself can i refuse him the possession of what he has preserved could i hold out against a claim so just and drive him who has given her life a second time into the like condition with that wretched maniac  whilst these reflections occupied his mind the servant he had sent for henry made report that he was not to be found and indeed as he had not ventured upon an intrusion into isabellas apartment it is not to be wondered at that his search was fruitless here his presence was still indispensible for nothing but the chearing sight of her defender and his persuasive voice could yet allay the tumult of her mind constitutions less strong than isabellas might have sunk entirely under such a shock the ravage it made in her nerves was not inconsiderable and great attention was necessary to prevent further derangement zachary whose services were now in demand of course postponed his journey and paid close attendance upon his lovely patient silence and repose were the great and only restoratives in request with this view a couch was provided in her dressing room and on this was displayed the fairest form in creation whilst at her side in pensive mute attention to each breath she drew fate henry whilst a servant posted without the chamber door kept watch against disturbers of her slumbers and now the gentle power of sleep had visited her senses descending like the dove of peace with downy pinions on her troubled spirit one glimmering ray of evening light scarcely sufficed to shadow out her form and on this the eyes of henry invariably were fixed whilst he held her hand fast locked in his careful to prevent the slightest movement if it were possible even of a fiber to awaken her  in the mean time the news had reached doctor sandford who in company with his son instantly resorted to hagley house even delapoer himself in the adjoining village had received the alarming intelligence magnified as usual in its passage and he had also joined the anxious groupe of visitors to sir roger whilst strict order of silence was observed through all that region of the house which was dedicated to isabella this groupe of friends waited the issue of her present repose with anxious hope and henrys praises were in the mean time the general topic of their discourse even the modest diffidence of young saunders was overcome by the warmth of their applauses and he gave his voice to the chorus with peculiar glee for he loved our young hero and was beloved by him he also at humble distance adored his lovely patroness whose grace of giving had the power of doubling every bounty she bestowed and sandfords was the very heart to feel that grace in its full compass and extent  honest zachary also joined the company he communicated to them with cordial delight the favorable situation of his patient above stairs wrapped in soft repose and guarded by the preserver of her life he then expatiated very learnedly upon the dismal effects of sudden frights and perturbations with the different modes of treating them arguing with great display of reason that no one process was so efficacious as the sooting attention of some affectionate person best beloved by the suffering object in the course of this discussion the learned lecturer got himself so completely entangled amongst the fibrous ramifications of the nervous system that after many fruitless struggles and as many plunges into deeper difficulties zachary left nothing clear to the edification of his hearers except that love was one of the strongest of the human passions that the person best beloved was decidedly the most welcome to the person loving that sleep was a grand restorer of exhausted nature and finally that it was his opinion the young lady up stairs would sleep the better for henrys sitting by her and of course that his society would forward her recovery to all these conclusions there was not amongst the company present one single opponent though sir roger whilst he acquiesced in these general deductions chose to make use of the word gratitude on the part of his daughter in place of the broader and perhaps more apposite term which zachary had employed on the same subject  there was indeed one person in company whom long experience of the fatal power of love deep sensibility of its effects and sufficient eloquence to have descanted on that topic qualified to speak what would have been worth the attention of the hearers had he been so disposed but silence and sorrow seemed to have entire possession of poor delapoer still one ray of hope cheared the gloom of his ideas and that was derived from the prospect now given him by the declared attachment of isabella to his son  doctor sandford observed to zachary with a smile that he did not wonder if he had found some difficulty in treating upon love to preserve a due distinction of ideas since it was an affection that showed itself under so many symptoms and descriptions being in some cases an actual disease in others an effectual remedy the medicines commonly applied for the cure of it were too often ignorantly administered and few fathers he believed were good physicians in their own families very true cried zachary they deal too much in strong repellants a deep sigh which escaped from delapoer not unperceived by the company reminded them they were touching upon too tender a subject and at this moment to their general joy henry entered with a cheerful air announcing the good news of isabellas amendment she had waked from sleep so recovered and composed that he hoped all effects from her fright would now be done away  hold hold cried zachary interrupting him young physicians are apt to be too sanguine old ones proceed with caution we must not pronounce upon the cure as perfect because the symptoms intermit  sir roger submitted to this doctrine and though impatient to see his daughter suffered zachary to visit her without him  delapoer now saw a fair opportunity of sounding the parties present with regard to his wish of inhabiting the parsonage devolved upon young sandford he expressed his intention with leave of the incumbent to purchase the furniture and effects of the late mr ratcliffe reserving an apartment to the use of the said mr sandford assuring him that whatever he laid out either in that or any other way upon the premises should remain to his use and benefit and as his life would be retired and single for the rest of his ays there would not fail to be house enough for them both whilst circumstances remained as they were at present  my motives said he for wishing to end my days in this spot of earth which covers all that was dear and valuable to me in life are known to sir roger manstock and i believe i may add that any promises i engage for with mr sandford will be guaranteed by this young gentleman now sitting beside me who by deed of gift is heir irrevocable of all that i am worth to the head of my house who with the title inherits every thing that appertains to it i shall bequeath to the full amount of what i have received my sword and my honor both untainted and no worse for the wear of my great and early disappointment in life i will not speak for the author of it is gone to his account and the object of it alas is now no more one wish remains at my heart which if i am indulged in i shall pray for so much life as may suffice for the completion of it if it is refused to me death cannot come too suddenly this i will now explain before the present company hoping they will second my most earnest suit to sir roger manstock it is that i may be permitted to raise some monument of affection and respect to the memory of that beloved person whom we have lately followed to the grave i would have it a mausoleum separate and select and in some degree resembling certain edifices of that description which i have contemplated with awful veneration in the east i have marked in my walks about this place a location as i think peculiarly apposite and i have worked upon a plan for architecture has been my favorite study which i shall be prepared to exhibit to sir roger manstock when i have his permission for so doing the workmen and materials are within my reach the superintendance of the work will be my task the last melancholy gratification that my sorrows will admit of  a request so new and unexpected coming upon the worthy baronet in this manner embarrassed him not a little he was at no time very quick at a reply but now was more than ordinarily deliberate in arranging his thoughts indeed a suspicion had haunted him ever since his last conversation with delapoer that grief and disappointment had in some degree deranged his intellects and this proposal of the mausoleum very much confirmed him in that notion he therefore sought rather to evade the suit than to satisfy it observing to him that the manners of the east were different from those of europe that in some few instances edifices of the sort he described had been erected in certain parts of england but with an effect that did not much recommend them to his taste a monument attached to a church he had no objection to it had a local solemnity and was seldom visited by the observer but at religious seasons whereas a mausoleum built upon unconsecrated ground became like other ornamental buildings in parks and gardens a mere spectacle to the curious and was rarely found to impress the visitor with any portion of that mournful respect with which the founder of it might be supposed to have been inspired besides this it was to be considered that lord crowbery was still living and though his insensibility toward the deceased had been such as to devolve upon her kindred those duties and decent attentions toward her remains which properly belonged to himself yet this would be an affront that could not fail to provoke his utmost rancour and expose her memory to the worst insinuations upon the whole he thought it a matter of no small moment and therefore should not wish to decide upon it hastily as for mr sandfords parsonage house it was a question entirely for the parties concerned to settle between themselves he could have no objection to oppose to a tender of so generous a sort  the project of the mausoleum being thus adjourned delapoer retired with dr sandford and his son to negociate the treaty for the parsonage when sir roger finding himself left with henry addressed him as follows   the service you have this day rendered me is of such magnitude as no return of thanks on my part can sufficiently express since there is no object in this world so precious to me as the life which under providence you have been the means of saving you cannot therefore tax my gratitude above the value which i put upon your merits and of course i must refer it to your own choice and arbitration to name that favor within my power to grant which will make you happy to obtain if any such there is consult your wishes henry and let me know what it is i can do to recompense the preserver of my daughter  the first and greatest favor you can bestow upon me replied henry is the assurance of your pardon for the seeming duplicity of my conduct in keeping secret the affinity i have the honor to bear to you and the presumptuous love that i have harbored in my heart for your adorable daughter obedience to the injunctions of a tender parent compelled me to silence in the first case and nature overruled the consciousness of my own unworthiness in the latter for how could i approach miss manstock and be insensible to her perfections how could i see her and converse with her without surrendering myself up to love and admiration  if my pardon said sir roger be all you have to ask you would indeed name a very slight return for a very weighty obligation but let us talk in plainer terms by pardon i presume you mean consent and approbation when you desire me to pardon you for loving my daughter i suppose i am to understand it as a modest way of asking me to give you my daughter  henry blushed and was silent  why truly resumed the baronet your diffidence makes a stop without discovering an excuse for it for whilst you scruple to demand my daughter you do not hesitate to secure her affections  if such is my happy fortune replied henry the interest i may have with her is all the merit i can claim with you to her then i refer my cause in her is all my hope  here a message from isabella to her father called him suddenly away and cut short a conference that was becoming very critically interesting to our agitated hero  chapter iii love is the grand specific whilst sir roger manstock attended the summons of his beloved daughter delapoer had brought his business to a conclusion with the sandfords and had set out on his return to the parsonage damped and deprest in spirit by the chilling reception he had met with from sir roger in the matter of his projected mausoleum he turned in his thoughts every mode his imagination could suggest for combating the objections he had heard and as appearances toward the noble but unworthy widower seemed the strongest and best founded bars to his proposal he brought himself after long debate and meditation to the romantic resolution of setting out forthwith upon a secret expedition to crowbery castle there to demand an interview with the viscount and either by reasoning or other means if reasoning would not serve to return with such authority for commencing his operations as should satisfy the delicacy of sir roger manstock with respect to opposition from that quarter thus determined he put himself in order of march with all possible dispatch and taking with him a faithful servant in his postchaise left a note for henry simply informing him that he should he absent for a few days upon particular business which he would explain to him at his return  in the mean time sir roger visited his lovely daughter and had the happiness to find her in a state of such convalescence as promised him a speedy and complete recovery his conversation with her was tender and gratifying in the extreme for he talked of henry in terms of the highest approbation acknowledging his obligations to him with a warmth of gratitude and affection that encouraged her to throw off all reserve in speaking of her attachment to this in the same strain of candor he replied that he had seen enough to certify the fact which she confessed to and therefore any attempt to vary from it would be highly disingenuous it was natural he owned that she should be thus partial to a man so amiable in mind and person and what must that heart be he said which was not sensible of obligations so important as those she owed to henry far be it then from him to oppose her inclinations with two such melancholy instances freshly impressed upon his mind he should not risk the fatal consequences of exerting his parental authority to prevent her union with the man of her heart so long as nothing could be urged to the impeachment of his character but as time which was both the friend of prudence and the test of truth must now of necessity intervene before their connection could take place he flattered himself that in decency to the deceased neither henry nor herself would take means to shorten it by any abrupt determination let the season of mourning run out its full date during which he should impose no illiberal restraint upon either of them no less confiding in henrys honor than in her discretion  my doors he added will never be shut against the preserver of my isabella till i see what i hope and trust will never occur sufficient reasons for so harsh a measure  to this isabella made answer that her recollection did not serve as to all that had passed but she well remembered in the midst of her terrors clinging to the breast of her defender in his arms i sought for safety and i found it in that terrible moment the impression of whose horrors will never be effaced from my memory he opposed himself to the raging phrensy of my assailant and snatched me from a fate too terrible to think of even now my imagination is haunted by visions which nothing but his presence can dispel when he is absent darkness falls upon my senses with his appearance light returns and should he leave us i shall never know happiness or health again  the agitation which accompanied these words so alarmed her father that he beseeched her to entertain no such desponding thoughts but assure herself that henry would continue where he was till she was in a state to travel and should attend her even to manstock house if she wished it with these assurances she seemed pacified and sir roger willing to prevent any further irritation took the opportunity of zacharys coming into the room quietly to slip out of it and retire in good time zachary soon perceived that her spirits had been disturbed and wished to prescribe something in his own way to allay them advising her at the same time to solicit sleep and exclude all company from her chamber  ah my good sir she cried how widely you mistake my case solitude is my terror i know not when i shall be able to encounter it i have a horrid image continually before my eyes and no one but he who rescued me from the reality can fortify me against the shadow till i am satisfied that henry is in the house and that he will not leave it i can never rest  zachary assured her that he was in the house and would have been ere now at the side of her couch if he had not in the most peremptory manner protested against it  it is not to be told he added what difficulty i had to persuade him to stay away from you  i hope then she replied you will for my sake as well as your own never attempt that difficulty any more why should i resort to art when nature tenders me a ready cure what i may be brought to in time i know not but i have not yet lost my senses and therefore dark rooms and soporific doses do not apply to my case  whilst she was yet speaking the room door was gently opened and a ray of light from one glimmering taper striking on the person of henry presented an object to her sight worth all the recipes on zacharys file the doctor saw the change that instantly took place in the countenance of his patient joy now illuminated her lovely features the blood once more glowed in her cheeks and zachary exclaimed  well my fair lady if such cures can be performed without the doctors help it is time for me to leave off the profession i shall begin to think that physic is mere quackery and a dose of what the heart loves best worth all the compounds in the chymists shop  this said he retired whilst henry approached with cautious steps to the lovely convalescent gently taking her hand which was held out to him whilst she said  dont be any longer alarmed about me i shall soon recover all the unpleasant effects of this days misadventure and remember none but such as gratitude to my preserver have implanted in my heart for ever oh henry sure it was my guardian angel brought you to my rescue at that dreadful moment and endowed you with nerves to combat a creature whose phrensy seemed to furnish him with supernatural strength how lost beyond redemption i had been but for you surely you will not leave me in this dismal place where i can look on nothing but what revives the scene of my terrors surely you will return with us to manstock it is my fathers wish it is my request what says my henry  to this tender petition henry replied with equal tenderness that he was here is his whole heart was devoted to her and that he was prepared to obey every wish of here is though it should impose upon him the severest trial and not like the present one flatter him with a prospect of the highest happiness he could receive that of being allowed to attend upon her in whose presence only he could be said to live whilst he repeated this he gently pressed her hand which he still held to his breast fondly regarding her with a look of softest pity and affection a sympathetic glow of chaste delight beamed on her blushing face her eyes witnessed the animating pleasure which these endearments gave her and when she saw him watchful of her emotions and preparing as she thought to withdraw himself through fear of discomposing her tranquillity she smiled and said  i perceive you have been tutored by our doctor zachary has persuaded you that you ought not to be here but he is no physician for the mind and you oh henry why should i blush to own it you are the master of those springs which feed my heart with life and health at your touch they move in your presence i revive when you absent yourself they stop and relapse into despair  whilst she was uttering this henry was struggling to repress his transports with difficulty he refrained from throwing himself at her feet but recollecting in the instant all the danger of her situation he checked the ardour of his passion and with as much composure as he could summon on the sudden reassured her of his inviolable attachment promising to be ever ready at her call attentive to all her wishes and resolute to devote his whole life to her service  only be composed he cried let me but see this gentle bosom reassume its peace and all these tremors vanish who then will be so blessed as i  i perceive she replied that you regard me with pity as a being deprived of reason and one who according to zacharys regimen should be kept in solitude and silence it may be so i am sensible i wander in my thoughts beyond the bounds of reason or discretion for gratitude perhaps betrays me into too much warmth of language and sensibility in the excess resembles madness if so i must submit and you must treat me as my malady requires still i will hope that your compassion sometimes will prevail with you to visit me in my affliction and if you find that by your process my disorder is aggravated not relieved perhaps you then will think it time to try what contraries may do and favor me with more indulgencies  a deep drawn sigh accompanied by tears succeeded to this speech her head sunk upon her breast and she seemed surrendering herself up to an agony of grief when henry no longer master of himself and cut to the heart with her construction of his reserve cast himself on his knees and enfolding her in his arms gave vent to all those fond and ardent protestations which with difficulty he had hitherto suppressed the act and the effect like those of electricity were instantaneous so quick she caught the sympathy of his transports it seemed as if one soul had animated both the gloom that hung upon her spirits vanished in a moment her mind became collected and joy diffused smiles over her beauteous countenance such was the magical transmutation love wrought in the mind and person of our fair heroine to follow them in their conversation any further is a task we shall not undertake the language of lovers is apt to be too broken and desultory for regular detail and their imaginations a little too volatile for sober history there is also more of action in these scenes than can well be brought into description and if attempted to be described are they not open to misconstruction which might wound the purity so characteristic of those persons for whose honor we are truly zealous let it suffice to say that though love reigned in both their hearts honor kept guard over one and innocence was inherent in the other respect tempered the passion of henry virtue herself might have acknowledged the sensations of isabella  chapter iv rash enterprises are apt to miscarry whilst henry and isabella were thus enjoying the blessings of a virtuous mutual passion delapoer the melancholy martyr of an unfortunate attachment like a wounded veteran worn out in the service of an ungrateful master was pursuing his pensive progress toward the habitation of the viscount deep and dreary were his meditations by the way and not one word escaped him to the humble companion of his journey his mind continually pondered upon the object of his expedition and various were the speeches he compounded and decompounded for the event of their meeting in all these resentment was a prevalent ingredient and the bitter drug of an inveterate aversion to the worthless possessor of his lost and lamented treasure tainted every composition he devised nature had given him together with a fair and comely person a most kind and courteous disposition but the cruel stings of disappointed love had festered in his bosom whilst his travels and campaigns in an unhealthy climate had hastened on a premature old age and rendered him feeble and decrepid at a time of life when many others enjoy themselves in full health and vigor of constitution we have already stated the condition he was found in on board the prize by henry and his rescue from that dangerous crisis grief for the loss of lady crowbery had since preyed upon him in such a manner as not only to reduce his feeble constitution in an alarming degree but in some measure to impair his mental faculties of which this chimera of the mausoleum and the journey he was taking in consequence of it were no slight symptoms his thoughts by dwelling perpetually upon one single object rendered him strange and insensible to all other matters and withal so vehement and pertinacious in the pursuit of his favorite meditation that neither rest nor food nor the calls of health could awaken his attention and in spite of all the remonstrances of his faithful servant he pressed forward on his journey though he was evidently sinking under fatigue and at the same time exhibited strong symptoms of a fever hastily coming on  these indications were no longer dubious at the conclusion of his journey and as his chaise entered the village of crowbery the delirium had gained upon him to such a degree that he was no longer capable of giving orders to the drivers where to go much less of executing the purposes of his expedition the reader may recollect a certain public house on the village green under the sign of the george and dragon this being the only house of entertainment in the place thither the drivers conducted our travelers and there they stopped it so chanced that ezekiel daw was at this instant perambulating the aforesaid green enjoying the fresh breeze of the evening and his customary pipe when curiosity led him to the alehouse door to enquire who the strangers might be and probably the idea that his friend henry would be found in the chaise had a share in that curiosity for sure enough the thoughts of that good creature were at that very time employed in meditating upon our hero whose absence his kind heart very seriously regretted  delapoer was still in the chaise and martin his servant in great distress how to dispose of him when ezekiel coming up to the door discovered the person of the reputed mr smith and no sooner heard and indeed saw the sad state he was in than with the compassion natural to him he claimed acquaintance with the wretched invalid and immediately directed the drivers to conduct him to the house of susan may where he promised him a kind reception and all possible care and attention proper for his situation this was gladly accepted by martin on the part of his master and executed without delay ezekiel strode across the green with such speed that he was at susans door and had warned her of what was coming before the carriage got round and drove up to the gate benevolence that glowed in ezekiels bosom was no less warm in those of susan and her mother at the call of pity both parties turned out upon the instant and as the chaise stopped both with the same hospitable voice welcomed the arrival of their distressed and sickly guest whilst the women prepared a bed for him martin and ezekiel lifted him out of the chaise and with the aid of a proper cordial from the storecloset of dame may saved him from a fainting fit  as soon as they had got him into bed and provided all things necessary for his comfort and accommodation ezekiel advanced to the bed side and having felt his pulse with due solemnity and deliberation drew martin aside and in a low voice said  of a truth friend i discover very ugly tokens of a febrile quality in the pulse of this poor gentleman to whom i presume you stand in near degree of friendship or affinity seeing you have exhibited proofs of so much care and solicitude about his person  martin replied that he was the gentlemans servant but no less attached to him than if he had the honor of being his relation  be it so be it so quoth ezekiel there is honor due unto all men who fulfill the duties of the station they are in however humble it may be and i perceive thou art not one that contenteth himself with eyeservice only as some are too apt to render let that pass therefore and to the point which being no less important than that of the life or death of a fellow creature demands brevity and quick dispatch i have myself a smattering in the medical art i speak humbly as becomes me having been early trained to wield the pestle and compound the drugs of a country practitioner of no mean note but i presume not to undertake a case of such danger and difficulty as i much fear this will be attended with at the same time i know not whither to resort for better advice in this pressing emergency for the aesculapius of our parish is absent at this present and the substitute who officiates in his stead alexander kinloch by name warrants not any great eulogium from me seeing i cannot witness to the success of his practice in general in candor i would say more if in conscience i was not checked from uttering an untruth had alexander kinloch been a cobbler or a butcher i would perhaps strain a point to recommend a neighbor but in the skill of the physician depends the safety of the patient and therefore it is that i speak not in his praise to be short he is a very selfconceited shallow fellow wilful as a mule and ignorant as an ass and woe betide the sick that comes under his care where he enters death is at the door  what then is to become of my poor master replied martin if this is all he is to look to have you no physician within reach  we have had doctors in the neighborhood said ezekiel but our country is so healthful that it has starved them all out in fact there is little or no employ for any but bonesetters and manmidwives therefore if i may advise we will let nature have her course for this night which with good nursing and the attention of these kind women we may hope will pass well with our patient and to morrow we will consult what more may be done for mr smiths relief and accommodation  smith did you say demanded martin my masters name is delapoer the honorable henry delapoer son of the late lord pendennis and brother to the present a gentleman of noble family and great fortune acquired with high reputation and long services in the east indies  say you so say you so interposed ezekiel  and be assured added martin he is not a man to let these your kind offices go unrewarded if he lives to come to a sense of them my master heaven preserve him is of a noble spirit and lets nobody serve him for nothing  what tell you me of his spirit cried the preacher drawing himself up into the stiffest of all human attitudes there be others who have as much spirit as your master and who will not allow of any recompense to be made for the common offices of hospitality and humanity which they have both the mind and the means to deal to those who stand in need of their assistance but i excuse these sentiments in you which had they been sooner made known to me i should not have mistaken your condition as i did  here martin finding he had roused the pride of his host began to make apologies which he had no sooner done than the spirit of the good creature was instantly allayed and with many friendly expressions and a hearty shake by the hand he assured him every idea of offense was totally done away and as he felt perhaps that more resentment had been shown than the occasion warranted he set about to qualify appearances by telling martin that there was not a man in the kingdom less irritable or captious than himself every body that knew him could witness that his patience and forbearance were notorious to a proverb so long as his motives were rightly understood but as to them he presumed every wellmeaning man was naturally and laudably sensitive for to do eyeservice to god and take wages of mammon was to make a stalkinghorse of religion and in his opinion a a most heinous and despicable piece of hypocrisy  ezekiel daw had now sufficiently developed his own character for martin no longer to mistake it so that having heard this harangue without returning any answer peace was effectually reestablished and the features of the apostle relaxed from their rigidity he then proceeded to enquire what friends or relations mr delapoer might have in those parts whom it might be proper to apprise of his situation or if none such were at hand what particular call he might have to the village of crowbery which caused him to travel with such speed and perseverance to the sensible neglect of his health to this martin replied that he concluded it was business of no small importance which brought his master to that place but the particular nature of it he was not informed of however he understood so much from what had escaped him by the way as to believe it had reference to the lord crowbery in person with whom his master seemed very eager to have an interview  enough said quoth ezekiel his business lies with the lord viscount at the castle and his speed betokens the momentous nature of that business i do recognize his person heretofore in these parts when he passed himself upon me under the name of smith there is a mystery at the bottom that i am not curious to pry into nevertheless friend it seems right unto me that the lord viscount should be apprisd of his arrival and also of the malady with which it has pleased god to visit him that so the aforesaid lord viscount may aid and assist us in this extremity with his counsel and thereby lighten our responsibility in case your master should die which truly i do greatly fear will be the case  having so said and no opposition being made on the part of martin ezekiel stalked away and with hasty strides bent his course toward the castle  chapter v bellum pax rursum the party we left at the castle consisting of claypole and his niece with the lord of the mansion had passed their time in their accustomed retirement and received no addition to their number from the curiosity or civility of their neighbors for the unsocial qualities of the viscount were well known to all the gentry round about him and none of them loved or respected him sufficiently to pay him an uninvited visit amongst the various causes in nature which tend to corroborate or impair an attachment we are not curious to search for that particular motive which had operated to the evident abatement of his lordships passion for miss fanny but so it was that his ardour had considerably cooled of late so as to excite some uneasy sensations in the mind of the sagacious uncle and at certain times emotions of indignation and resentment in the tender bosom even of the lady herself perhaps it would have been prudent in this fair creature whose personal charms were her chief if not her only recommendation to have husbanded that resource with a little more economy but as her uncle had on his part been as prodigal of advice as she had been of favors it may be presumed he overacted his part so as to force her into measures directly contrary to what he recommended certain it is that she did not love the lord crowbery and therefore we may conclude some passion stood proxy for inclination in her connection with that personage whatever this was she followed it as a guide to matrimony though by so doing she very much dissented from her uncles policy who frequently objected to her in the vulgar phrase of the common saying that she had put the cart before the horse  it so happened that whilst ezekiel was on his way to the castle meditating as he walked on the address with which he purposed to introduce himself and his business to the noble viscount a teteatete between his lordship and miss fanny had taken place in which some little asperity had mixed with matters of a sweeter quality that young lady having taken occasion to inquire of his lordship what precise time he had fixed for making good his promises by presenting her with a coronet hinting in modest terms that this was reasonably to be looked for before she returned the favor by presenting him with an heir amongst various excuses which the peer had ready at hand to palliate his delay the recent death of his lady was insisted on in a manner that provoked miss fanny to advance a few truths upon the meanness of hypocrisy after so public a breach she observed between him and lady crowbery the world could not expect even the semblance of sorrow on his part that if he had meant to treat her memory with respect how came it to pass that he failed to show it to her remains but consigned them to her uncle for burial she could not therefore regard his plea of her recent death in any other light than as a palpable pretense to evade an act of honor and justice which it would be more manly in him to disavow at once and boldly face the consequences of his breach of faith than meanly fritter away both her time and patience with apologies and excuses that were as frivolous as they were false and what was this lady crowbery for whom he held himself thus bound to sacrifice to appearances upon what terms did they live in what temper did they part did he stir one foot from his door to accompany her on her way when she departed from his house a dying woman had he any love or respect or even pity in his heart toward her then was the time to show it but it was notorious he had not and it was also as well known who had it was no secret to her at least that henry the adventurer was the object of her fondest affection that he embarked on board captain carys ship for no other purpose but to give her the meeting at lisbon that when that undertaking failed and illness stopped her short at falmouth there he joined her there he renewed those uninterrupted attentions which cheered her dying moments and in his arms she fondly breathed out her last expiring sigh  damnation madam he exclaimed do you think i have no feelings that you sport with them so unmercifully do you think i have no sense of honor of revenge can you suppose that villain shall escape my vengeance and is this a time to talk of marriage  say rather she replied is this a wife to mourn for as for revenging yourself upon her favorite if that be your serious pursuit no fear but you will find it henry is not a man to avoid an open enemy if your lordship has the spirit he will give you the opportunity  sblood madam do you doubt my spirit  till i have better proof of your honor i do doubt your spirit but as i am persuaded henry will soon return to these parts your lordship may soon put that matter out of question though i should rather think your first discussion ought to be with your ladys first love mr delapoer who i understand to be returned to england fraught with the treasures of the east and loud in his invectives against you  against me cried the peer sensibly alarmed what has mr delapoer to do with me because he thought fit to run away with her before marriage am i to be called to account by him after her death if i am to fight my way through all her lovers i had need have more lives than one for the undertaking by the alacrity you express in numbering up my opponents i should almost suspect you took pleasure in my danger  to this she calmly replied i only warn you of your danger my lord which is the office of a friend and trusting to your courage take an early opportunity of putting you upon your guard i have a correspondent who has informed me of some particulars that perhaps you are unapprisd of i am told that mr delapoer had a meeting with your lady at falmouth and that he paid the closest and fondest attendance upon her in her last illness i hear also that he was present at her funeral and remains inconsolable for her death i further understand that he speaks of you with less respect than any man of spirit will permit his character to be spoken of in short my lord i should not wonder if a man whose blood is fired with the heats of india and who avowedly imputes to you the death of the object so dearly loved and so deeply lamented shall be sound capable of any measures how violent soever or how rash nay truly it would not much surprise me to hear his name announcd to you this very evening as my servant tells me there has been a chaise and four posthorses arrived in the village not an hour ago and that the travelers were received into the house of susan may which in your late friend blachfords time would hardly have been opened to visitors at that hour and of that description  whilst miss fanny was thus speaking the visage of lord crowbery became ruefully aghast he struggled for words but passion and pride stopped what fear and cowardice would have dictated at last after many efforts and much ridiculous gesticulation he made shift to mutter out a few broken sentences by which nothing was to be understood but that he believed she was in a league with these assassins to attempt his life with a smile of ineffable contempt she replied i am not in any league against your life for if i am injured i know how to redress myself against the villain who betrays my confidence and violates those promises he has employed to seduce my virtue let such a faithless wretch tremble at my vengeance defenseless as i may seem to be i have a spirit that will not stoop to infamy and a hand that can execute the merited punishment on the defiler of my virgin honor  this ranting menace uttered with all the emphasis of a tragedyheroine might have lost its effect at any other time than the present when his lordships nerves were very much deranged from various causes but now it was heard with terror and when she rose from her seat with becoming dignity to make her exit the spiritless and quivering lover earnestly requested her not to leave him in anger for that he was ready to obey her wishes and give her every possible proof of his love honor and good faith this atonement made her features soften into kindness and whilst she tendered him her hand in token of forgiveness she declared herself ready to stand by him in all difficulties and dangers and make common cause against every impertinent that should offer to annoy him  chapter vi an humble visitor meets a haughty reception the terms that fear extorts cunning commonly finds means to evade lord crowbery had all the disposition in life to extricate himself from his embarrassments with miss fanny and all the regret that heart could feel for having rashly involved himself in them the peace he had patched up was of course a dubious one but at the present moment it was convenient  a servant how entered the room and reported to his lord that ezekiel daw was in waiting and requested to be admitted upon business of importance it was one of those illtimed strokes that take a man in the moment of his weakness my lord might certainly have refused admission to a poor neighbor of daws condition but miss fanny had instantly given her voice in the affirmative and for him to revoke it was to subject himself to greater inconveniences than his confirming it might lead to it is probable that the idea of delapoer rushed upon his mind when he heard the name of ezekiel daw but a thousand other trifling matters might occur to bring that good apostle to his door who was ever busy in the interests of his poor neighbors and forward to stand forth as their advocate with the rich and mighty having therefore put the previous question of what does the fellow want with me and received for answer from the servant that daw would not communicate his business the cautious peer directed his message first to mr claypole desiring the favor of his attendance and then permitted him to tell ezekiel that he would see him for a few moments in consequence of these orders the reverend mr claypole and the untitled fieldpreacher entered the audiencechamber where sat the lord of the castle and his lady elect nearly at the same moment  ezekiel made his reverence and was told to deliver himself of his business in as few words as possible i doubt not replied the preacher that time is precious to your lordship who so well knows the uses of it and i shall therefore intrude no further on your patience than a brief recital of my motives for soliciting the honor of this audience will of necessity involve benevolence my lord as this reverend divine can testify is a virtue which    we do not wish to hear you expatiate upon said claypole interrupting him let brevity for once be your virtue ezekiel daw or patience will not be ours and you will be dismissed without a hearing  reverend sir replied ezekiel i will be brief and not put any virtue of yours to a trial that might perchance be too hard for it this is my business  a traveller has this evening arrived in our village who now sojourneth at the house of susannah may of whose coming i held it as my duty to advertise the lord viscount crowbery  and what is that to me cried the peer sensibly alarmed  my lord replied daw i humbly conceive it is so far forth appertaining to you forasmuch as the gentleman whose name is delapoer a person as it seems of high birth and noble family incontinently seeks your lordship upon business peradventure of no slight importance seeing he has traveled with unremitting speed to the great detriment of his health and at the imminent peril of his life which if i have any skill in prognostics now draws fast to a conclusion  at the name of delapoer my lord turned pale and was visibly in great perturbation the information with which ezekiel concluded his speech was of a more welcome sort rallying his spirits he assumed a haughty tone and demanded of the preacher if he knew the nature of the business that delapoer pretended to have with him to this it was replied that he knew it not nor was the poor gentleman himself in a condition to make it known having arrived in a high state of fever which had seized his brain and deprived him of his senses  and where are your senses said claypole who knew enough of delapoers story to unravel the whole mystery to come on such an errand what has my lord crowbery to do with mr delapoer and his delirium let kinloch or dame may or any other old woman of the place yourself for instance put a blister on his head or nurse your patient after any other fashion you think fit we have neither doctors surgeons nor apothecaries in this family i am astonished you have the assurance to intrude yourself upon his lordship and the company present with such a tale  if i am guilty of an indecorum in coming hither said ezekiel i should expect your reverence would be the first to find pardon for my error seeing it can spring from none but christian motives of benevolence and charity the stranger who now languishes on the bed of sickness might draw comfort from the presence of a noble person whom he has sought with such avidity and that noble person pardon the presumption with which i speak it in his hearing might seize the joyful opportunity of succouring a fellow creature in the hour of distress  this said and no answer given ezekiel made his humble obedience and retired claypole who bore him an ancient grudge did not spare him on the occasion calling him an officious canting methodistical rascal miss fanny who saw her prediction verified so unexpectedly kept her eyes upon the peer secretly enjoying his confusion whilst he maintained a sullen silence persuaded that the whole had been a plot of her devising and more than ever determined to escape out of her hands for this purpose he soon retired to his library for meditation where it occurred to him to write to his cousin captain crowbery whose assistance he foresaw would be necessary to him on many accounts and on whose courage and counsel he could firmly rely a short letter requiring his instant presence being written and dispatched he found his mind considerably more at ease and to cover his designs carried himself toward miss fanny and her uncle with more than ordinary cordiality and good humor claypole though a cunning man in the general was so effectually blinded by this finesse and by the report his niece made of the result of her last altercation with his lordship that he considered her as viscountess elect and his labors crowned with success he commended her very highly for her spirit and observed that fear operated on her lovers nature as the more powerful passion of the two but no matter for that so long as the object was attained he would not quarrel with the means he hoped delapoer was not absolutely in a dying state but of that he was determined to satisfy himself very speedily for he regarded him under the present circumstances as a very lucky instrument for quickening his lordships measures which he should take the first fair opportunity of promoting by suggesting a temporary secession from crowbery during which the knot might be secretly tied and not only the appearances of precipitation avoided but also the interview with delapoer that he seemed so much to dread to these ideas miss fanny on her part very cordially assented  when ezekiel arrived at susan mays he had the satisfaction to hear that mr williams the surgeon had surprised them with a visit and was then in attendance upon the sick person he had obtained his discharge from his ship and was now come upon zacharys invitation to give him the meeting upon the spot and adjust the preliminaries of their treaty for the shop and trade nothing could be more critically fortunate for poor delapoer than the arrival of this intelligent young man who had already rendered him such services and made himself so acceptable to his patient as for daw who esteemed williams and despised kinloch his joy was excessive and it was with some difficulty susan may prevented him from rushing into the sick mans room to tell him so in the mean time a bed was appropriated to williams in her house that he might be near at hand and within call at all hours for he had already pronounced upon the case of his patient as extremely dangerous his applications however had such effect that before the night was past williams had the satisfaction to see a change of symptoms that augured favorably and was recognized by delapoer with marks of joyful surprise and satisfaction the meeting between williams and ezekiel was very affectionate nor did his friend susan fail to give him a reception perfectly kind and cordial when he stated to them the object of his coming they were rejoiced to hear there was so fair a chance of his settling amongst them to the exclusion of kinloch and in truth williams was deservedly beloved by all that knew him being a young man of most gentle and engaging manners in person very agreeable and of a wellinformed understanding with every thing that could recommend him in the line of his profession at such times and seasons as his patient did not need his attendance he gave the whole detail of his adventures by land and sea since he had quitted crowbery but in a more particular manner he recited every thing that had passed from the time that henry had joined the frigate this was the most interesting part of his story to ezekiel and susan who listened with admiration and delight to the animated picture williams drew of their heroic friend and which he colored to the height with every warm tint that truth could give or valor and humanity deserve whilst this was in relation ezekiels glowing spirit would break forth into rapture and exultation ever and anon he would spring from his seat erect himself into a martial attitude and thunder forth his applauses forgetting sometimes his accustomed sobriety of speech and launching forth into apostrophes of triumph which if they did not absolutely amount to a breach of the statute against swearing were yet but hairbreadth escapes from the penal letter of the law susans fine eyes meanwhile expressed the tenderest sensibility of soul now dropping tears of sympathy now glistening bright with transport emotions that cannot be thought to have escaped the penetrating observation of the narrator  i knew exclaimed ezekiel in one of his rhapsodies that my boy was brave it was i and i alone who first discovered the innate integrity of his heart albeit he was then oppressed under a cloud of accusations and appearances of guilt it was i and i alone who stepped forth in the defense of innocence and opposed my single voice in arrest of condemnation against a torrent of overbearing witnesses this good dame i confess took pity on his corporal sufferings and like the charitable samaritan poured oil and wine into his wounds i do not aver take notice that it was identically oil and wine which she administered but it was something as good and served the purpose she intended by it the allusion is not less apposite because it is not literal heaven will consider the mind and not scrutinize the medicine he was guiltless and we rescued him friendless and we protected him hungry and we fed him had he been in prison i would have come unto him even there for my bowels yearned toward him in christian charity and compassion and now behold he is brave he wieldeth the sword against the enemies and blasphemers of his faith he fights valiantly in the righteous cause of his king his country and his god who would not do the same who would not die in such a glorious contest i would for one  but out upon it whither does my passion hurry me do i not forget myself have i not a calling that warns me from deeds like these am i not a preacher of peace  here ezekiel sunk down in his chair confounded and abashed whilst his lips moved and his eyes were turned upwards in secret ejaculation which williams observing kept silence for some few minutes and then watching his opportunity threw in a few consolatory remarks by way of qualifying his selfreproach which will be found by those who think it worth their while to search for them in the succeeding chapter  chapter vii first love sinks deep into the human heart i am sorry friend daw that you should seem for a moment to retract the sentiments and expressions which my recital drew from you what is so natural as to exult in the heroism of a friend i protest to you though my profession has no more to do with the actual operations of the battle than yours has yet my heart glows for my countrymen when i hear them applauded for their valor and as to this action which i have been relating to you though our victory was not great in its consequences to the nation at large yet none could be more glorious to the brave hearts who obtained it in which let me tell you our gallant young friend distinguished himself in a most conspicuous manner had you but seen him as i did when he brought tom weevil to the cockpit to be dressed you would have owned you had beheld the perfect model of a real hero such a countenance here he turned to susan never in my life did i look upon the like why twas what we may form to our fancies for the picture of achilles such fire in his eyes but then it was tempered with so much pity and consideration for the wounded object who had indeed a most desperate cut across the cheek that he had got in the boarding   at these words susan shrunk back in her chair and put her hand before her eyes whilst dame may eagerly demanded if poor tom weevil was killed to which williams answered that it was a mere flesh wound in no degree dangerous and which was just sufficient to leave an honorable scar upon his skin he then addressing himself to ezekiel proceeded to say  you mr daw and the good dame here present have some experience of these matters but you can have little if any conception of the horrid cases we have to deal with during the carnage of an action of this however we will not speak in the presence of mrs susan whose tender heart is ill suited to such descriptions the virtues of mr henry will be a more pleasing subject to her ears and of these the catalogue would be in a manner inexhaustible whilst he proceeded to recount a variety of anecdotes to the credit of henry particularly his humane exertions for mr delapoer who was found a prisoner on board the enemys ship and also his kindnesses to himself in the negotiation with doctor cawdle he read the heart of susan in her countenance and perceived that whilst he was praising henry he was recommending himself for this her eyes declared with a sensibility that could not be mistaken first impressions are not easily obliterated williamss soft heart had felt those impressions early in life for susan then in the first bud of beauty time that had matured her form had improved her charms and though there was something for delicacy to stumble at in the history of her adventures with blachford yet there were such mitigating circumstances to set against it that he began to feel in himself a strong propensity to wave all refinements and revert with ardour to his first passion we have already said that a more alluring person than susans was hardly to be met with we may now add that a more susceptible heart than williamss must have been a rare discovery in nature if therefore he was not easily revolted by small dangers it was a consequence of his being operated upon by strong attractions when they were boy and girl under the same roof every minute they could rescue from the duties of their service they devoted to each other at a playful age their love was merely sport and playfulness as time advanced opportunities were more greedily sought and more ingeniously improved inexperienced youth is prone to curiosity and the dalliance of the sexes is sure to be progressive in the path of pleasure there is no pausingplace upon which the foot of the novice can rest even for a moments recollection so was it with this fond pair they had no mentor at hand to break the spell jemima was herself no edifying example to susan zachary was no rigid moral master to williams prudence was not the reigning virtue in susans character selfdenial was not the best attribute that williams had to boast of as their meetings became more delicious so they contrived to make them more secret still they were subjected to repeated interruptions and the innocence of susan was frequently indebted to the petulance of her mistress for its timely rescue but fortune is not such a friend to virtue as to work miracles for its sake and if there is nothing but chance to save a poor damsel from a false step i am afraid there is but little chance of her being saved at all in a soft and yielding moment susans protecting genius being asleep on his post and love alert and wakeful williams stole unheeded to her chamber and without the churchs sanction was admitted to all the privileges of a husband  furtive enjoyments are seldom less fleeting than they ought to be our lovers were soon discovered in their meetings and the consequence was their instant separation williams went to seek his fortune at sea and susan staid on shore to bewail his absence not that he left her like a man who runs away from the mischief he has committed on the contrary he tendered to her every recompense in his power but nothing cannot be divided and the proferred indemnification was of course postponed till better days should enable him to invite her to a better situation during the whole of his peregrinations no rival ever detached his heart from its first love he kept in faithful remembrance all his own promises and susans favors anxious to seize the first moment his good fortune might present to him for fulfilling his engagements three years had now passed away whilst he had been beating the round of service with little other gain than of experience in his profession he was now at the age of twentythree and susan had scarce completed her nineteenth year and within that period events had occurred which stand recorded in this history that in one sense favored their union and in another discouraged it but the explanation henry had given him of blachfords treachery in the case of usans seduction had qualified his repugnance and converted into pity what would else have been aversion and contempt in the mean time her personal attractions were improved by years and his sensibility not abated by absence the only struggle he had now to suffer was his dread of being thought a mercenary suitor for the balance of worldly wealth was strongly on the side of susan and his discovery of an impression in henrys favor which seemed to him to be paramount to all things else in her remembrance of this however time and future observation could alone give him the necessary assurance and in the mean while his attendance upon mr delapoer would in a manner occupy his whole time and be a sufficient excuse for his delay in entering into any conversation with her that might draw him into a premature discussion of what was passing in his thoughts  whilst matters hung in this suspense the reverend mr claypole impatient to be informed of delapoers real situation and if possible to gain some light into his business called at susan mays and meeting with williams was not sorry to hear that his patient was no longer in so desperate a state as was at first apprehended as to the derangement of his senses concerning which he was particularly inquisitive williams naturally told him that there was no mental debility in mr delapoer except what was incidental to his fever and even that was considerably abated did he know claypole asked what particular concern he had with the lord crowbery that had brought him in such haste into those parts  to this williams replied properly enough that it was out of his line to pry into those matters but heartily confessed that he could collect enough from the rambling discourse that his patient would at times start into that there was something on his mind of a very irritative as well as interesting nature and it was much to be wished that some common friend of the parties could seasonably interpose for the prevention of extremities claypole rightly conceiving this to be pointed at himself said that for his own part he had no commission to enter upon the business and being a perfect stranger to the gentleman above stairs as well as to the motives of his discontent he should by no means choose to thrust himself officiously into an unwelcome office but wait till he should be called upon when his best endeavors as a friend of peace would not fail to be forthcoming with this profession he broke up the conference and returned to the castle  chapter viii when parties understand each other rightly business advances rapidly it was in the evening of this day whilst ezekiel was engaged with his pipe and dame may employed in affairs of the family that chance threw williams and his friend susan together in a moment and after a manner so pointedly commodious for a teteatete that they must have been ingenious indeed to have found means of avoiding it without betraying more disinclination toward each others company than either of them in reality possessed the sick man was asleep susan had taken up her work williams was seated beside her the parlourdoor was shut and the hour was sacred from interruption  susan kept her eyes upon her work williams directed his upon her both parties were embarrassed and neither could at once find courage to break silence a kind of preparatory hum like the tuning of an instrument bespoke an effort on the part of williams this produced a responsive note in unison from susan who at the same time raised her eyes from the object they had been fixed upon and guided them in that direction as to clash with his by the way a soft and almost imperceptible relaxation of the muscles which none but a lovers sensibility of perception could have construed into a smile struck courage into his heart as an invitation to hope and the words found way  it is along age in my account of time since we parted said williams  and i doubt you have suffered a great many hardships in that period replied susan  many people would have thought them such he rejoined but where the whole soul is engrossed by one overruling affliction lesser evils are scarcely felt  that is true indeed she replied if such was the state of your mind mr williams you might well be indifferent to small inconveniences when so great a sorrow possessed you altogether  what could be more afflicting he said than the cruel necessity i was under of flying from one i so dearly loved trust me my dear susan it was a heartbreaking separation and that nothing but the hopes of establishing myself in some such way of business as might enable me to fulfill those engagements toward you which i ever held as sacred could have supported my spirits through such a length of time and suffer me to assure you my sweet girl that my heart has been steady to its first love through all changes and chances it has been ever yours and if i hesitate at this moment to convince you of its sincerity it is because fortune has made your scale so much heavier than mine that i might perhaps be thought to act from mercenary motives an imputation which i disdain and disavow from my very soul  that is an imputation said susan i shall never make against you but alas those very advantages i have gained in point of fortune must be regarded by you who know my history as insuperable objections to any views you might otherwise have had an unmarried mother will never be your object in an honorable light and neither you nor i have any longer the plea of inexperiencd youth to excuse our frailties as once we had  here she cast down her eyes and yielded to a suffusion of blushes that so captivated the enamoured heart of williams that by an irresistible impulse he caught her in his arms and in a transport of love smothered her with caresses a negotiation conducted upon these terms was not likely to be very tedious between parties so tempered as williams and susan may  i protest to truth he cried that the wrongs you have suffered from that villainous seducer only render you more dear to my heart and more lovely in my eyes inasmuch as they add pity to affection and inspire me with the most ardent desire to stand forth as your defender against all the world who shall dare to breathe a word against your reputation by my soul susan if i could flatter myself that your heart was untoucht by any other passion than that which i first planted in it if i could believe that no happier lover superior to me in every point had effaced the impression i once made on that dear bosom it is not all the injuries that blachford or a hundred such as blachford could accumulate upon you would hold me back one moment from your arms no no i have no such principles by nature nor have i learnt any such amongst my countrys brave defenders on the sea as should induce me to desert the girl that has favored me with her confidence because i found her either plunged in the extremest poverty or suffering under undeserved disgrace  one of the kindest glances which susans fascinating eyes could bestow witnessed the effect which this gallant declaration had upon her heart it was a signal of something more than hope to her happy lover and produced no common returns of gratitude from him  but it has been more than once made known to the readers of this history that we are no dealers in description to recite what is said so far at least as it refers to the elucidation of events is all that we undertake for it must be left to imagination to fill up the scenes with action and dumbshew after an interval in which though the parties were silent the business did not sleep susan heartily explained to williams the nature of her attachment to henry giving him a brief but fair account how it arose to what length it reached and where it stopped and this account had a farther claim to his entire belief inasmuch as it perfectly accorded in all points with what our hero himself had told him in their conversation on the subject it was natural that such a person as henrys should attract attention it was impossible that a nature so animated as susans should overlook it but as honor forbade her to accept his hand when the humility of his fortune might have tempted him to offer it so the change in his circumstances and the attachment he had formed were now become such insuperable bars to hope of any sort that all danger and delusion were totally at an end it was clear that nothing had occurred which susan had cause to regret and that nothing could occur which williams had any reason to fear doubt and mistrust being thus removed and a mutual good understanding established with absolute confidence in each others honor williams renewed his former vows and susan scrupled not to confess her former liking if we had the privilege of the comic poet who makes marriages a momentary business we would couple these lovers in those holy bands without loss of time and the rather because we are not perfectly sure but that they ought to have been married or acted as if they had been married but alas we historians are tied down to forms and dare not do them violence though they might not be so scupulously regarded by those whom we have at this moment found occasion to bring together on the scene let it be remembered however in the way of palliation that there is no moment so dangerous to female discretion none so favorable to an ardent suitor as that in which first love is renewed  o nature whom alone it is my destiny to follow when i attempt to paint the characters of my fellow creatures why will thou not always lead me through pure and unsoiled paths in the way that i most wish to go setting up a mark at every resting place for morality to steer by and presenting no one object to my view but what throws a luster on the history of man and reflects a bright example to that portion of posterity that shall chance to read it why will thou compel me to record the frailties of thy fairest works thou mother of all nations how often have i combated thy obstinate authority to the length almost of rebellion itself whilst i have been persuading thee to acknowledge some unfriended outcasts from society as children of thine own what is it i have not attempted in my zeal to reconcile thee to the sufferers by prejudice but thou art capriciously ingenious in devising models for thy academy which are dashed with blemishes so cunningly interwoven into the very essence of the work that he who aims to mend a part mars the whole in copying thy productions so faithful must be the hand of the imitator that every blot in the original must be reflected in the transcript  chapter ix some people preach over their liquor whilst sleep was refreshing the exhausted faculties of delapoer and love in possession of the whole soul of williams ezekiels pipe was out and his meditations at an end the fire he had kept up in both quarters was burnt down to the embers and as he was coming from the next door susan who kept a good lookout against a surprise adjusted her apartment and put herself in proper trim to receive him  o woman woman thou art a curious compound of sincerity and finesse of candor and cunning alert in thy resources when discovery threatens feeble in thy defenses when temptation assails thee love thou art a traitor an incendiary a thief on whom the hardest name i could bestow would be a term too gentle for thy unutterable wickedness all the world knows thee yet more than half of it trusts thee to their cost though they call thee a god it would disgrace the very devil himself to claim kindred with thee there is susan for instance to whose virtues i would else have consecrated the fairest page in this immortal history would have been a mirror of all human excellence but for thee thou insinuating imp  heyday exclaimed the preacher looking her in the face as she met him at the parlour door what a change is here in thy countenance daughter of mine i should guess thou have some extraordinary good news to tell me by the liveliness of thine eye and the luster of thy complexion is thy sick guest on the recovery has our friend williams cheered thee with the glad tidings of his convalescence and truly he also does appear very sensibly exhilerated why this is well my children this is as it should be this is the feast of the soul which conscience serves up to us when it brings into review the good deeds we have been doing this is the fruit of love my girl of that love i have often recommended to thee as yielding the most rapturous gratification to the senses joys in which thou may indulge without stint or remorse no fear my good child that thou should be satiated with these enjoyments for they are congenial to thy nature they flow from thy benevolence and in sharing them with thy fellow creatures thou fulfillest the great purpose of thy creation and thou friend williams art a young man of goodly parts and endowments thou have done well in thy vocation working the good work of love in conjunction with this hospitable damsel and comforting her kind heart with the timely efforts of thy successful skill and experience in the secret powers and energies of nature with which gift i do pronounce thee to be in no ordinary degree furnished and endowed and happy is it not only for the stranger above stairs but for all our neighbors that thou art come to reside and practice in these parts now then we will sit down and rejoice over the reflection of a wellspent day whilst the good dame our willing caterer shall provide us a temperate refreshment with a can of that mild wholesome beverage which our own fields afford i envy not the vineyards of france portugal or spain i covet not their intoxicating their adulterated draughts a tankard of my own native ale fresh smiling in my face and mantling to my lips whilst both the senses of taste and smell sympathize in the joint delight is to me a treat which all the vats of the wine press cannot compare with come my child let thy good mother replenish the pitcher and we will pledge each other to the health of the poor stranger above stairs and to the many and happy repetitions of this gladsome moment  thus having predicated ezekiel deposited his hat and staff in a corner of the room whilst susan glanced a smile at williams so expressive and withal so sweet that the muse of comedy or thou her second self inimitable eliza might have deigned to acknowledge it then springing nimbly from her seat she hastened to obey the social proposal  reader to thy heart i dedicate this humble scene let thy fancy fill it up with all those pleasing images that creative genius can supply call forth thy benevolence let every joyous particle that warms thy veins and sets thy heart in motion toward mankind animate the composition and then thou shall paint the dame with glowing philanthropy in her countenance and the foaming goblet in her hand entering the room followed by the jocund miller father of the brave tom weevil and welcomed by all voices with the glorious allhail of neighbourly love and cordiality see them assembled round the board hand clasped by hand lip succeeding lip in their salutations to the spiritstirring tankard whilst the triumphs of old england and libations to the health of her brave defenders circulated round the table and whilst williams recounted to the exulting father the gallant actions of his boy not omitting to relate the circumstance of his wound and the honorable scar he would bring home as a trophy of his victory and fame  a flood of thanks to williams poured from the hopper of old weevils lips backed with hearty invitations to the mill and congratulations upon his settling amongst them garnished with many oaths and protestations of good will and zeal for his success  sblood my dear billy he vociferated in his loudest key i would not only be contented to fall sick to bring you custom but damn me if i would not even die to do you credit  hold hold cried ezekiel interposing swear not at all friend thomas neither believe that the death of the patient can bring credit to his doctor die if it be required of thee for thy countrys sake die for thy religion for thy faith for the defense of thy family but in the mean time live for thyself and thy friends here present and drink about for good fellowship  aye by my soul quoth old tom i shall be glad to stop a bit longer amongst you for i have a heart for my friends and thou art a true one zekiel i will say for thee and so is my dear billy and the good dame and my pretty pretty mrs susan damn it    hush cried ezekiel i would fain see the scoundrel that dares wag his tongue to her disparagement in my hearing zooks i would soon clap a stopper upon his clack and i hope i shall live to see the day very shortly when she shall be married to her deserts a fair creature friend williams and a dainty one though i say it to her face as ever the blessed sun shone light upon is she not here williams nodded assent and shook him by the hand whilst susan tittered and looked archly under her eyelids  what continued the miller she must not live in this lone house like a mope when some good fellow may be blessed in her arms and have corn wine and oil in abundance why it is against nature and so the good mother will say and so says friend zekiel for all he looks so grave upon it come doctor i will give you a text and you shall give us a preachment upon it increase and multiply  though levity of conversation seldom passed unreproved by ezekiel especially when it glanced upon sacred topics yet it so happened that just then ezekiel was in no disposition for reproof the exhilerating tankard had given him a flow of soul that would not suffer him to chill the gaiety of his companions yet as far as weevils challenge went for a preachment as he termed it the good apostle was no flincher and perhaps never found himself in a much better cue to take up the gauntlet  planting himself therefore in his oratorical attitude with his thumbs tucked into his waistcoat pockets and his fingers expanded like the claws of a bird he gave two or three folemn hums to bespeak attention and began as follows  when i revolve in my thoughts the widewasting ravages of death i cannot but regard with gratitude and respect those prolific matrons by whose labor of love the gaps and chasms in creation are filled up and replenished which sword pestilence and famine are hourly making praise be to their patriotic endeavors in an honest way and much are they to be preferred to those solitary and sequestered damsels who shutting themselves up in nunneries and convents keep their natural faculties inert and lifeless leaving to others of their sex to struggle under heavy burdens whilst they go free and partake not of the toil if all women were of their persuasion the world must wear out like an annuity and cease with the present generation for i believe i may boldly assert that no way has yet been discovered by the curious in all ages how such a consequence could be prevented if the fair sex were one and all to stand out and no longer lend a helping hand to the work again when i call to recollection that before a single babe can be produced in the world two rational free agents must be in the same mind to give it life i am astonished there can have been through so many ages such a coincidence of sentiment and good will between the sexes as to keep the work going and more praise of course must be due to that party on whom the weight bears hardest which if i rightly guess is the woman i speak under correction my worthy neighbors for having no positive experience to guide me in either case i will not take upon myself to pronounce from my own knowledge on the point in question tell me who can for i profess it is past my finding out to what secret cause it is owing that the population of this globe of earth is upheld how comes it to pass that there is no drawing back no renegation in that quarter where the whole pain and peril of the task falls with such partial preponderance when i reflect on this i own to you i have sometimes trembled for the fate of posterity fearing it should be cut off at once and the world dockd of it is entail at a stroke but when i look round me and perceive how vain these apprehensions are and that my fair countrywomen for whom i have such fears fear nothing for themselves but carry the world merrily on and indeed in many instances with more haste than good speed as the saying is i take heart and believe that as the hand of heaven set it a going nothing but the same hand will stop it concluding within myself that when the commandment was given to increase and multiply there was something given with it that makes up to those who are at the pains to obey it  you need not doubt it said old weevil and immediately williams who pretty well guessed how susan thought upon the subject started some other topic and changed the discourse  chapter x four parties fairly matched at a round game of hypocrisy at the castle in the mean time all parties were busily employed in plots upon each other the reverend mr claypole made his best use of the intelligence he had picked up from williams for alarming the lord crowbery and grounding upon his fears his favorite proposal of a temporary retirement and a speedy marriage his lordship gave him the hearing with all due courtesy and good breeding but with no inclination to follow it in any other point but what suited his own purpose as to quitting crowbery they were both of a mind but so far from turning it to claypoles views of hastening the marriage his intention was to employ it as the means of totally avoiding it miss fanny entertained her fancy in devising projects for postmatrimonial amusements and in these it may well be doubted if his lordships honor and repose were the ruling objects of her meditation privileges of rank extension of authority and indulgence of propensities attached to her constitution had certainly some share of her attention and had her system taken place the wrongs her predecessor suffered might have been amply avenged  captain crowbery whom my lord had summoned to his assistance obeyed the call and having heard the case acted as gentlemen in his predicament mostly act and recommended those very measures which he found his principal predisposed to pursue it was therefore resolved upon with joint consent that it would be advisable for his lordship to take a tour upon the continent whilst the captain kept guard upon the castle with full powers at discretion to get rid of miss fanny and her uncle upon the best terms he could make and here let it be remarked for the edification of my female readers that those very steps which miss fanny took to secure her conquest were urged against her as the first and strongest impediments to the completion of it  this commission it may well be supposed was not in all respects the most pleasant to the undertaker of it but it was attended with no small bribe to his diligence inasmuch as in the event of his lordships death without heirs the captain was next in succession to his title and estate and it was something more than probable on the supposition of miss fannys marriage taking place that my lord would not long be childless the captain was a man of spirit and address not naturally disposed to put his hand to every mean unworthy job but too good a politician to oppose his cousins will and not so much his own enemy as to have an unconquerable repugnance against serving him in a case like the present  it is not to be expected that his coming at this crisis was the most welcome of all events to the uncle and niece and it certainly required some management to mask the plot he had concerted against them to mr claypole he talked freely on the reasons of his invitation ascribing them to the alarm that delapoers arrival had given to his noble cousin hinting in no very distant terms at his want of spirit and acknowledging in conformity to his ideas that the best thing his lordship could do would be to step aside for a time and leave the matter whatever it might be to be made up in his absence by deputation which he observed was indeed an unpleasant office though he was ready to undertake it for the good of all parties and the rescue of his kinsmans reputation  this passed tolerably well upon claypole who knew enough of lord crowberys want of spirit to think it perfectly natural that he should wish to have the captain about him and as this gentleman agreed with his wishes in advising the same measures for a change of place he saw no immediate danger of his schemes being traversed and therefore continued to flatter himself that the promised marriage was in a fair train to take place  captain crowbery had a part also to act with miss fanny and upon this he entered with considerable advantages for besides that her character was too open to be mistaken and her foibles well known to him he had the requisites of an agreeable manner a good person great powers of flattery and a facility of assuming any species of disguise that might suit his purposes with her he put on a gay and careless air of a mere soldier of fortune who considered her as the lady elect of the head of his house and paid court to her accordingly this so effectually flattered her vanity that she seemed never weary of encouraging his humility with the smile of protection nor was he deficient in humouring her with opportunities for the display of those graces so condescendingly bestowed he had enough of that faculty of small talk to be sufficiently eloquent upon insignificant topics he could point a compliment or envelope a double meaning with all the readiness of a practitioner in that commodious art and indeed he was not behindhand with any man of modern honor in the true principles of the sect for he had courage to justify seduction and gallantry to despise friendship whenever the charms of a wife of a daughter or which is more than either of a mistress came in contact with his passions and with opportunity to profit by with these accomplishments we need not wonder that he succeeded in his efforts to lull the suspicion of a lady not over incredulous and had his ambition prompted him to higher objects than a little inglorious deceit we may presume he would have been no less fortunate for miss fanny seemed in a very likely train to overlook both his situation and her own  his lordships preparations in the mean time were put forward with unremitted diligence as it was necessary for him to provide himself for his tour and settle his remittances with his banker before he set forward a journey to town became indispensible and for this he had only to pretend the customary occasions of consulting his conveyancer upon the marriage settlement and providing a license together with all other necessary appendages to a noble bride these were pleasant tidings to the parties interested and his lordships preparations were cordially seconded by the reverend uncle of the young lady whose interest was so much concerned in quickening his departure that she seemed to have forgot the obvious compliment of lamenting it there was a concurrence of circumstances that made it in a manner unavoidable for his lordship to invite mr claypole to bear him company on this jaunt it had its pro and con in point of convenience but as it was no difficult matter for him to give that reverend gentleman the slip in such a town as london the offer was made of a place in the chaise with all seeming sincerity and accepted with no other hesitation but as to the point of decorum toward his niece who in that case would be left to keep house with captain crowbery alone but as this scruple was with himself singly and not admitted by my lord himself or the lady elect who indeed treated all such outofdate ideas with the contempt they merited it was withdrawn almost as soon as it was advanced and the engagement was made  i think said my lord to the captain on the eve before his departure this business will be better managed between you and my madam in the absence of the parson than if he was to stay where he is and make thirdfellow in the fray two to one is odds in argument and claypole is a plaguey proser as i shall find to my cost but i will keep the wheels going till i have him safe in london and then i will soon bequeath him to his meditations a fellow that has treated his own patron with such ingratitude deserves no mercy as to miss fanny i dont expect you will find much difficulty in qualifying her anger for as love is out of the question which of all passions is the most turbulent you will have only to contend with a little dogged disappointment and when she has spent her fire in abusing me in which i give you free leave to join her i predict that you will find her as reasonable and as flexible as you can wish only let me escape from her talons and i have little care what becomes of her afterward  that is a happy indifference cried the captain smiling and i can only promise you i will do my best to pacify her by every means but marrying her in your stead which i suspect would not altogether suit her purpose and mine not at all  ladies of her sort resumed the peer are not entitled to much delicacy and in my opinion merit little pity so that you have full powers from me to use your own discretion which if it deserves the name will never suffer you to fall into that snare she had spread for me she has ten thousand charms as a mistress but not one recommendation as a wife the devil of a temper and an unbounded propensity to play the devil with it for whatever she may say to the contrary i am in my own mind perfectly persuaded that she dealt a foul blow to your antagonist henry in the vengeance of her disappointment and then pretended he had hurt himself with a knife by accident therefore have a care of your ribs george for if you should fall into the same fault as he did it is a chance but you meet the fame fate  it is not just the death i should choose said the captain nor am i the man in the world to stand out like that young joseph against ladies who make love with weapons in their hands i would rather of the two meet the favor than the punishment  be prepared then replied the peer for if i have any guess you are not unlikely to encounter the alternative for my own part i am clear in conscience and shall die in the persuasion that i am neither the first nor shall be the last in her good graces  here a gentle tap at the door announced the fair subject of their discourse in person his lordship in a moment dressed his face in its best trim to welcome her with looks of love and with all due regard to truth declared that it was of her and her alone they were conversing and that he flattered himself the tender instructions he had been giving to his cousin would be punctually observed  he will tell you fairest of creatures said he fondly taking her hand in his for he knows what place you hold in my affections it is on your account only i submit to be a stranger to my own home for a time but they will be heavy hours of absence from my charmer and oh when we meet again   here his lordship thought proper to be much affected and his voice faultered whilst the gentle fanny acted all the ceremonials of a tender blush which wanted nothing but change of color to make it real and artifice was thus repaid with artifice meanwhile a wandering glance stole its way by a sideway passage toward the captain who with infinite gravity of countenance respectfully liberated her hand that was then held captive by my lords murmuring in soft accents whilst he secretly pressed it in his own  come come my lovely cousin you must let me part these hands so soon to be united for ever scenes like this will only agonize you both  chapter xi breakfast table talk the next morning our travelers started with the sun whilst sleep held the bright eyes of fanny claypole in his downy fetters and spared her the painful task of squeezing out a parting tear at the hour of breakfast she issued forth from her chamber armed for conquest we have already observed that this young votary of the graces was in the art of undress eminently successful on this occasion she had by no means forgot to employ that art in such a style of studied negligence as contrived to display her person in its most attractive points by a seeming carelessness in those articles on which most care was in fact bestowed and this we take to be the very first excellence the grand desideratum of the modern toilet  a pensive look that had an air of sorrow for the absence of her lord was necessarily assumed and the captain could do no less than counterfeit a sympathising face of pity on the meeting now we have the experience of human nature to inform us that when an agreeable young gentleman takes upon him to play the comforter to a tempting young woman in affliction it is so much like making love to her that he seldom fails to run one office into the other the observation was not discredited by the case in point for whilst miss fanny acted her part to admiration the captain sustained his share in the farce of hypocrisy with no less spirit and address her sorrow was just enough to find occupation for his attentions and not so much as to discourage him from persisting in them from a despair of their effects in short she was cheared and he was flattered by the discovery that his consolation was not lost in their conversation which he took care to regulate according to the point he had in view he did not scruple to glance at the character of his noble relation in such particulars as might serve to pave the way for his purpose he stood in admiration at his good fortune in gaining the affections of a lady so beautiful so young and so worthy of a more accomplished lover he was sorry to confess but truth could not be disguised that his cousin did not make the best husband in the world to his former lady in fact his temper was not so good as he could wish his heart was narrow and his disposition unsocial and morose a soul like here is he said would find itself curbed and confined by rules so rigid as he laid down what were rank and title if they did not bring happiness with them and who was there in the kingdom she might not aspire to in short if this was a matter of choice he begged pardon for what he had been saying if it was a match of prudence he wished it might not deceive her expectations in the issue of it  these insinuations well timed and artfully introduced had their desired effect they saved miss fanny all the pains which hypocrisy would have cost her inasmuch as they threw captain crowbery entirely on her mercy and put his fate in her hands had he been guarded in his discourse she would certainly have been inexcusably imprudent to have trusted him with her real sentiments but when he had so far committed himself on the subject she saw no danger in meeting him with the like candor and vindicating her taste at the expense of her sincerity for she was ashamed to be supposed guilty of a real liking for so contemptible a person as lord crowbery not discerning what motive he could have for reposing so much confidence in her but that of good opinion and zeal for her happiness she felt greatly flattered by the turn of his discourse and knowing how absolutely dependant he was upon his cousin and that he had been uttering words which if repeated against him would never be forgiven she said in a style of mock reproof  what a giddy thoughtless soul you are to talk this language to me and put it in my power to ruin you with my lord  if ever i deserve to be so punished by you he replied i should have no right to complain of being betrayed but if without my deserving you should think fit to do it the necessity i should be under of ceasing to esteem you would be the greatest misfortune i could suffer by the event  that is very gallant on my word but why do you suppose i am the one woman in the world that can keep a secret and what do you think you discover in me to trust me with your whole fortune  shall i answer that question fully and sincerely  no she replied for that perhaps would not be to answer it favorably and women you know are naturally fond of flattery dont you see what mischief i could make if i was wickedly inclined to it  whatever your inclinations are said the captain looking tenderly upon her i would have you gratify them though my insignificant self was made the sacrifice for after all what am i but a soldier of fortune and what is my fortune but the sword by my side there is my subsistence and that my lord cannot take from me or if he could he dare not use it  fie upon you smiling she replied you cannot suppose but he would use his sword in a good cause  he would hardly be persuaded rejoined the captain to think any cause was good enough for that i believe he will never let it see the light in anger with his good will else that young henry would have brought it out of its hiding place for he spelt hard to get a sight of it  that is a brave lad after all said fanny i have a right to say so quoth the man of war and now this delapoer this man of mystery hangs over us like a cloud what you may think of this journey to town my sweet lady i will not pretend to say but for my part i must think if all his lordships fears were out of the question there would not be much left for his love to boast of  oh you mortifying creature she exclaimed if i could believe this he deserves   what demanded the captain interposing what does he deserve not the handsomest woman in the creation i will boldly say not the transport of being wrapped in those arms which were never meant by nature to embrace a coward  well well she rejoined perhaps it is not the best use i could put them to  what a pity then he observed it should be the only one  the only one she repeated breaking into a loud laugh surely you draw your inferences very nimbly my good friend but am i bound to make them good do you think that every marriage presupposes liking can you find no other motives for a connection between a simple miss like me and a titled personage like your cousin but a preference that would disgrace my judgment and a passion that has no interest in my heart  none so heaven help me cried the captain in your case i can find no plea for the sacrifice and i should think myself bound to congratulate you on your escape if you was never more to see his face  oh you cruel monster she exclaimed rallying him would you break my heart with the very mention of it do you suppose a married lady is without resources is she therefore lost to all the world or all the world to her are there no happy wives but what are in love with their husbands nay let me put the question closer are there no wives in love with any but their husbands come come i will talk with you no longer  so saying she rolled up a pellet of the bread on the breakfasttable and threw it at him in that pretty playful manner as we have often seen it done by many a fair hand with exquisite address and good aim  if a man knows any thing of modern breeding he knows how to answer all attacks like this the captain made too much of it for he swore it had wounded him to the heart there was a little too much of knighterrantry in this and he did better when he drew a rose from his buttonhole and gallantly tossed it into her lap declaring that no soldier ought to take a blow without returning it he had done better still if he had said nothing for at best this is but the trick and pantomime of coquetry and wantonness this is the time when wit is not wanted and action takes the whole scene upon itself  miss fanny with the sweetest grace in nature took the rose and placed it in her bosom adjusting it with all that pretty difficulty of choice that rivetted the beholders eyes upon the charming operation  blessed flower the captain cried to what a paradise have i promoted thee  then smiting his hands together sprung from his chair and turned to the window as if to divert some emotion too violent for his control  come cried the lady rising also from her seat we have talked nonsense long enough let us take a grave walk in the garden and drive nonsense out of our brains  her cloak was in the room the captain flew to reach it to her and in assisting to put it on made so many awkward blunders and was treated with so many pretty reprimands that few cloaks perhaps have given room to more raillery or been less applied to the purposes which cloaks in general are understood to be made for  to the garden they went and here we will leave them to ramble amidst shady bowers and loveinspiring grots not the most innocent pair that ever took their solitary walk in garden or in grove yet fairly matched in nature as in art and fitted for each other whither they went and what they did we are not careful to recount for though the justice of the historian should be equal toward all characters he is concerned with yet he must be allowed to dwell with more delight and expatiate with greater felicity upon the amiable than upon the unamiable as far as these prejudices may be deemed excusable so far i hope i may be indulged in them and therefore i shall now drop the curtain upon this scene as i have upon others of the like description and close the eleventh book of this important history now hastening to its conclusion  end of book the eleventh book the twelfth chapter i the authors last address to his readers we are now drawing nigh to the conclusion of our history and if my kind reader has found amusement in his task i shall not regret the toil and labor of mine great must be that authors mortification who miscarries in a trivial undertaking and certain it is that small matters should never be attempted without strong presumption of success something there must be in every mans view who commits himself to the press and as all speculations upon profit are now becoming more and more precarious there seems little left to animate the adventurer but a disinterested passion for fame i think it is therefore to the credit of the corpse that we still continue to volunteer it with such spirit that no abatement is yet discernible either in our numbers or exertions when i search my own heart for the motives that have operated with such activity upon me for resorting to my pen i find myself impelled by a principle i am not ashamed of since it has been uniformly that of doing every thing in my power for keeping alive a general spirit of good humor and endearing man to man by bringing characters under review which prejudice has kept at distance from the mass of society i have never failed to lend my feeble hand to theirs who are benevolently employed in recommending love and harmony to mankind i love my contemporaries and detest that language so much in use which tends to sink the present age on a comparison with ages past and as i hold this to be an illiberal and ungenerous propensity i thank god i have reached that time of life when it is chiefly prevalent and yet perceive myself more than ever abhorrent from the practice of it  i must now send my hero into the world to shift for himself i have done what i could for him whilst he was under my care and have bequeathed him nature for his guide at parting the trials and temptations i have exposed him to are such as might befall any person in his situation and not greater than every man of steady principles without any romantic strain of virtue or courage may resolutely meet i have not set his character upon stilts for sentimental enthusiasts to gaze at but kept him on the plain ground with natures common stock studying to endow him with the patient virtues rather than the proud  to my heroine i have given as many charms as the readers imagination shall be disposed to afford her without being indebted to descriptions which i reject upon conscience having so often read them in other novelists with satiety and disgust and i flatter myself my isabella will appear not the less attractive for the very few and slight demands i have made upon her health and constitution not having been able to discover amongst all the numerous examples of sickly and tormented heroines any peculiar delicacy in their diseases or much amusement in their casualties in one instance only i have fallen in with the fashion  i have kept my narrative free from the perplexities of episode and digression and given the scene to my characters without any intrusion of my own person which i hold to be an unpardonable impertinence of poetry i have made no use and of quotation so very sparingly as scarce to be perceptible the incidents i trust are in no case improbable and as to that combination of circumstances which appears to criminate my hero in the second book i have since the writing of it been told of a case upon record which so nearly resembles it as to give my narrative the air of being founded upon fact in that particular which in reality it was not in point of style i flatter myself the critic will not find much to reprehend but in that and every other particular i am fairly before him let him strike with justice and i will not murmur at the stroke  and now if this page shall meet the eyes of a certain lady not less distinguished for her many amiable qualities than for her exalted rank she will perceive that i have fulfilled her instructions and composed a novel to the best of my ability in the form she recommended and prescribed uncertain of its fate i forbear to make known whose commands i have been honored with content if she alone is satisfied with my obedience and not entirely disappointed with the execution of a work which but for her i never should have undertaken  chapter ii the history goes back to the hero the sudden disappearance of delapoer and the state of mind in which he had departed caused great uneasiness to henry and damped those joys he would else have reaped in the unrestrained society of his beloved isabella to whom every hour of his time was devoted her health was now so nearly reestablished that sir roger had named a day for his return to manstock and that was now so near at hand that henry was alarmed lest the time should not allow for his fathers coming back and till that event took place or some intelligence was obtained duty fixed him to the spot he was in he knew too well the resentful feelings of his father and the strong expressions he had repeatedly thrown out against lord crowbery to be at any loss to find a motive for the suddenness and secrecy of his departure and those conjectures were as painful as they were plausible not that he apprehended any danger to his fathers person from a supposed discussion with that unworthy lord for he had all possible contempt for his want of spirit but it was the impropriety of the thing itself and the unfitness of the undertaker which struck him so forcibly and presented so many unpleasant thoughts upon reflection that he debated very seriously within himself whether he should not set out upon a venture in the hopes of overtaking his father and dissuading him from the interview the practicability of this however was made more than doubtful by the time that had elapsed before he had intelligence of mr delapoers departure so that when he came to confer with sir roger upon the idea which had started in his mind that worthy gentleman had so many good reasons to oppose against it and his own maturer thoughts prompted withal by an unseen advocate suggested so many more that he resolved upon waiting the issue of his fathers promised return till after some days anxious expectation a letter from williams to zachary written after delapoers arrival at crowbery put an end to all suspense as to the destination of the absentee but gave at the same time so alarming an account of the illness he had been seized with that henry apprehending him to be in the utmost degree of danger no longer hesitated what to do  he had provided himself with two excellent riding horses and tom weevil received orders for making ready without delay the distance was little more than sixty miles and it was his purpose for expedition sake to ride part of the way but there still remained the painful task of reconciling isabella to the necessity of an unexpected parting this was a distressful moment for though a heart like here is could not scruple to admit the urgency of the call yet love and tender apprehension could not be made to accord without anguish to the disappointment neither was sir roger himself a disinterested party in the discussion of this unwelcome business for when he saw the struggle it occasioned to the fond yet candid heart of isabella he offered to set out the next morning with his whole family if henry would bear them company but as sir rogers equipage was in the style of ancient times and bore not the least similitude to a mailcoach a distance of sixty miles was to him a journey of two days whilst our heros impatience did not mean to appropriate more than six hours to the road a compromise was therefore struck upon by henry who engaged to come back and give them the meeting at the inn where they rested for the night unless he found his fathers situation such as to prevent it this was eagerly embraced by isabella who at parting from him with eyes full of tears and a look of the tenderest affection said to him go then and may success attend you remember only you have that in charge which is infinitely dearer to me than the life you have preserved  his horses were at the door duty pressed time was on the wing he snatched a hasty adieu and light as perseus or the equestrian son of leda sprung into the saddle and was out of sight in an instant  he is gone cried zachary who with sir roger and isabella had attended him to the door he is off like a shot it is a rare thing to be young and nimble but after all i am afraid his labor will be lost and he will come too late for i augur ill from williamss account of mr delapoers case  heaven forbid cried isabella that any such unhappiness as you predict should befall him  come come said sir roger we will not anticipate misfortunes  then taking isabellas arm under his walked forth to give his orders to the servants without doors for the next days journey  i perceive my dear child said he as they passed along though your life has been saved by your friend who has just left us your heart is irrecoverably lost it behooves us therefore to consider what you have substituted in its place that so we may compute and strike the balance between profit and loss if i did not think as highly of henrys virtues and predict as favorably of his temper as an old man like me ought in reason to do of a young one like him i should contemplate my lovely isabellas situation with alarm and terror for though i should not despair but my authority might prevent imprudence i fear it would not serve to extinguish love it demands therefore all the prepossession that i entertain for henrys character to bring me to acquiesce as you may now perceive i do in your decided attachment to him i own to you my isabella i once thought no circumstances could have induced me to favor a connection with him or any person under his predicament but it seems as if providence had decreed that in spite of all my prejudices i should be compelled by the force of facts to be the convert of his virtues and renounce my opposition to him how strongly have events conspired to mark this out since fortune first made him known to us by throwing him in the last extremity of distress upon the unexpected protection of a mysterious mother what an escape had he from the murderous designs af blachford and the desperate rage of that infuriated wanton what perils did he incur in the boarding of the frenchman and what but the hand of heaven itself could so critically conduct him to your rescue in the last awful instant that stood betwixt you and a disaster too terrible to think upon how singular was the chance by which i discovered that posthumous and important writing of sir andrew adamant addressed to me in his behalf and which seemed to have lain concealed for the sole purpose of bringing it to light in the happiest moment for his interest and advantage the very case of that wretched maniac from whose hands he snatched you had a moral in the history of his madness that applied itself to my conviction but when to these i add the very striking circumstances that attended his meeting with his father and reflect upon his uncommon generosity in the case of blachfords will and again in that of lady crowbery how can i say he is not deserving of your affection or any longer interpose between him and the happiness he seems destined to enjoy  here sir roger concluded whilst his attentive hearer still waited in respectful silence but perceiving after a pause that he now expected her reply she turned upon him the most lovely countenance in nature and  oh my dear father she said think not that i have been silent because i wanted gratitude for your goodness but because i feel it to an excess that stifles my expressions i trust i never could act in opposition to your will but i would fain not entertain even a wish in contradiction to your judgment had you therefore interdicted my attachment to henry i must and i would have strove to have torn him from my heart terrible although the struggle would have been but when i hear his praises from your lips and receive your sanction to confirm me in my choice words cannot speak the happiness you bestow upon me and if i did not sooner make reply it was because i was loath to interrupt you on a subject i could listen to for ever  in the mean time henry thus ever present to the thoughts of his isabella proceeded briskly toward the destination where his duty called him new affections had been stirred within his bosom by the discovery of his parents but hard fortune which had already bereft him of a mother lost as soon as known and beloved only to be bewailed seemed now in the cruel disposition to deprive him of his father also this and his meditations on the dear object he had newly parted from were his companions by the way and honest weevil who followed him had full scope to indulge his own imagination without let or hindrance till our hero having measured more than half the way found himself at the inn where sir roger proposed to take up his rest here he left tom and his horses and having delivered to the master of the house the necessary instructions for the reception of his guests next day he took post and proceeded with all possible expedition toward crowbery  the day had closed when henry arrived at susans hospitable door and was received by williams with a cheerful countenance that bespoke the happy report he had to make of his patients amendment delapoer had quitted his sick chamber and was sitting in the parlour great was his joy at the sight of henry clasping him in his arms and blessing his good providence that he had survived to see him once again of his obligations to williams who had now for the second time rescued him from death he spoke in the warmest terms and not less gratefully of honest ezekiel and the kind women whose tender care and solicitude had contributed to restore him he confessed the object of his journey had been a sudden resolution of seeking lord crowbery in consequence of the objection started by sir roger manstock with respect to his projected mausoleum and what added he might have been the consequence of our meeting had it taken place i will not presume to say certain it is that second thoughts and a calmer state of mind have placed that project in another light from what it first appeared in to me when under the impression of a recent disappointment i have now renounced it and think it a lucky circumstance that the wretch i came in search of is out of my reach and gone from home to prepare as it is said for a second marriage with the niece of mr claypole now residing at the castle  unfeeling shameless profligate exclaimed henry with indignation and astonishment will he so grossly insult the virtuous memory of his injured wife as to plot a second marriage before she is scarce cold in her coffin and with the niece of claypole would he marry is fanny claypole of all women breathing to be the lady crowbery that so hastily succeeds to my unhappy mother be it so if he is so rank of soul as to set decency at defiance let him couple with a fury and may his passion be his plague i know her well and if providence for his sins shall surrender him into her hands you and i my good sir may let our vengeance sleep his punishment is provided for the task is taken out of our hands and the tyrant over others is his own executioner  the evening was now in advance and though delapoers spirits were greatly exhilerated by the arrival of his son yet in consideration of his strength the conversation was not protracted beyond the time that williams thought fit to indulge him with and nothing more occurred between them worth recording in this history  chapter iii a singular instance of a journey performed by our hero and heroine without one casualty by the way as soon as delapoer had retired to his chamber susan may and her mother presented themselves to henry and were met by him with all the warmth of former affection the good dame as usual was loquacious in her joy and had many questions and enquiries to be resolved susans sensibility was of a more silent sort and whilst she greeted him with smiles of gratitude and love the tear glistened in her eye and the blush glowed upon her cheek  henry saw her emotion and perfectly understood the cause of it making a plea therefore of his impatience to see ezekiel he cut short the interview observing that the evening just served him to snatch a sight of his friend over his concluding pipe before he turned in to his cockloft he proceeded to the cottage and opening the door without ceremony discovered the rural apostle seated in his chair of meditation with his back toward him and too deep in thought to be roused by so quiet a visitor henry stopped and contemplated him for a few moments with a placid delight kind soul he said within himself thy thoughts are occupied in benevolence and thy communications are with heaven then going up to him and putting his hands upon his shoulders over the back of his wicker throne called upon him by name to wake from thought and welcome a friend ezekiel started at the wellknown voice sprung from his chair and threw himself upon henrys neck praised be heaven he exclaimed praised be heaven i am blessed above my hopes in embracing thee once more thou child of my affection he then took two or three strides across the room rubbing his hands and crying out what wilt eat what wilt drink i warrant thou art fasting fresh from sea  henry smiled at ezekiels want of recollection and stopping him as he was posting to the store where he kept his provisions told him that the pleasure of seeing him was all the refreshment he stood in need of for the present the good man now became a little more collected but still ran from subject to subject mistaking many things that he might have recollected and repeating others henry was already informed of such as the death of jemima cawdle the arrival of williams the reports about lord crowbery and other anecdotes neither quite new nor overinteresting in his relation of them yet our hero had patience for them all and in the end was repaid for that patience by hearing that the wretched jemima had by ezekiels assiduous remonstrances been brought to a due sense of her condition and a better train of thoughts in her latter moments what money she had scraped together she bequeathed to her husband and every thing in which zachary was interested had been faithfully and discreetly administered by daw himself with the assistance of old tom weevil the miller  ezekiels spirits were now so thoroughly awake that henry would hardly have prevailed with him to think it was time to go to rest had he not pretended that he stood in want of it himself he found his friends at next door expecting his return and every thing set in order for his comfort and repose that susans hospitable care and attention could provide  the next morning brought williams to his bedside with the chearing intelligence that he could now with confidence pronounce his patient to be out of danger his apprehensions thus allayed he felt himself at liberty to make good his conditional engagement to isabella for which he made the necessary preparations after devoting the whole forenoon to his father and declining his generous offers of an immediate establishment suitable to the heir of an ample fortune he left him highly satisfied with the errand he was going upon and much delighted with the happy prospect it seemed to open on his future hopes  relieved from his alarms about the friend he left behind him and impatient to meet the beloved object toward whom his course was now directed our hero with a joyful heart whilst the chaise whirled him rapidly along counted every mile that diminished his distance from isabella sir roger with the punctuality that governed all his motions had calculated to a minuteness the time of his arrival at the inn it was a full hour before this given time when henrys wellfeed postilions drove their panting horses to the door his first care was to examine if the house was in a state of preparation for their expected guests and it was with satisfaction he saw that all his instructions had been punctually obeyed when this was done and the little derangements of his dress repaired he found himself at leisure to make the proper enquiries after tom and his cavalry the brave lad soon appeared upon the summons and gave a good account of his charge he also informed his master that part of sir rogers suite were arrived and that the coach was near at hand with all well withinside of it  at length the muchwishedfor moment arrived that brought the cavalcade in view and henry at the coachdoor received a hand in his whose touch inspired him with delight all inquiries made and resolved isabella now with henry seated beside her all her fond fears dismissed and greeted with the smile of approbation from her beloved father felt that transcendent glow of soul which is the exclusive property of virtuous love and heavens best gift to the thriceblessed few that merit it no traces of her late disorder were any longer to be seen her animated countenance beamed with such lustrous beauty health and joy as made it dazzling to behold henry gazed in speechless rapture sir roger himself sat in fixed contemplation and the very people who attended upon the guests seemed to make errands into the room for the purpose of treating themselves with a glimpse of the lovely stranger unconscious of her charms until she saw them in the glass of henrys face she no sooner perceived the transport they excited than she dropped her eyes with modest sensibility and was covered with blushes  enraptured at the sight henry could no longer command himself though in the presence of sir roger pardon me he cried thou loveliest of women for oppressing thee with my admiration and you my patron and protector be my advocate so far as to confess that her beauty is irresistible  why in very truth henry said the baronet if you could look upon that form without rapture i must think you would not be so worthy as you are of an interest in her heart  how generous is that apology exclaimed the happy youth how flattering to my presumptuous hopes by heaven i would go to death for the father of my isabella  you have done more than that for me replied sir roger when you preserved my child she is under providence your gift to me what can i do less than endow you with that blessing you so gallantly redeemed  the gratitude and joy which henry now felt were not to be expressed by words his first impulse was to throw himself at sir rogers feet a motion on the part of that gentleman which forbade the attempt and a certain look which reminded him of the place he was in brought him to instant recollection yet he seized his hand with ardour and pressed it to his lips isabellas beauteous and blushing countenance in the mean while took a deeper tint she too like henry was silent the good baronet understood enough of nature to interpret rightly for both parties and accordingly took an early occasion to relieve their sensations by starting some topic more apposite to the place they were in but a more effectual stop was soon put to all conversation on this subject by the preparations for supper and the bustle those maneuvers never fail to produce amongst the waiters of an inn the joy however which our hero now experienced was too discoverable to be overlooked by her who was the cause of it how far her own sensations accorded with it was only to be guessed at by the sagacity of a lover for modest timidity kept in check all emotions that might lead to observation and nature only showed herself in a complacent smile and now and then a tender glance that escaped as it were involuntarily and by surprise  sir roger meanwhile was in high good humor with every body and every thing exercise had given him appetite and he had a heart to partake of the happiness he had bestowed he declared his entertainment to be excellent chatted familiarly with the landlord praised his house and promised never to pass it without a call there is certainly something in an inn which by contrast with other scenes is oftentimes found highly pleasing it gives an ease and relaxation from those domestic attentions which though they may not be irksome in general are sometimes interruptions to occupations more amusing it may be presumed sir roger felt it at this time and we agree with him in the following remark  that the man who cannot find contentment in a decent english inn is a four unpleasant fellow and a companion no one would wish to travel with  moments passed thus happily pass quickly and our lovers found themselves summoned to their repose before they were sensible of any wish for it the next morning they were early stirring for sir roger proposed reaching home by dinnertime whilst henry on horseback took a circuit by crowbery under promise of coming to manstock house in the evening if he found nothing to prevent him on his visit to his father as far as to the point where his road branched off he accompanied sir roger and his beloved mistress whose look at parting told him how unwelcome the moment was that carried him out of sight from this intimation he very naturally inferred that the interval of absence was not to be lengthened by his voluntary delay no sooner therefore had he uttered the word farewell than giving the reins to his horse he put him to a pace that made quick dispatch with the solitary remainder of his way  he was welcomed by williams on his return with the same good news and had the happiness to find his father advancing fast in his recovery williams was still sole manager in office though zachary was arrived the good man was certainly not apt to undervalue his own abilities but in this case he made no attempt to interpose his advice for any change of system which probably would not have been accepted by delapoer from the first authority in england as for doctor zachary cawdle surgeon apothecary and manmidwife though his name and titles still glittered on the skyblue scroll that bestrode the posterns of his gate yet had he now touched the happy period that closed his medical career and delivered him bodily over to ease indolence and the gout for the rest of his days the annuity devised by lady crowbery and jemimas bequest made up a comfortable independency and it was for the purpose only of introducing his successor into business with a better grace that he kept his name in the firm as to all money arrangements for stock in hand good will or any other description of particulars delapoer himself had so generously stood forward in that essential part of the negotiation that nothing was left to the chance and uncertainty of any afterreckoning between the contracting parties  having thus disposed of our honest doctor we shall probably find little other occasion to call upon him in the further progress of this history except with our hearty good wishes for health and long life to enjoy the tranquillity and repose which his good fortune has provided for him  as for sawney kinloch he by his own choice seceded from the shop and beat his retreat to his beloved town of aberdeen with a fortune which reduced into scotch pounds made no contemptible display in his own country  an example amongst many others of the very extraordinary things which close and persevering economy can effect  chapter iv when marriages are making it is a sign the drama is drawing nigh to it is catastrophe williams now found himself in condition to think seriously of matrimony without the painful sensation of considering himself as the pensioner of a wife susan on her part had all due partiality for him and there can be little doubt but he was satisfied with the proofs of it yet the arrival of henry was an incident of some importance and the effects of it had been watched by williams with all that attention which wary lovers are apt to bestow upon a newcomer whom they suspect to be in greater favor than themselves susans deportment however had been such that the result of this scrutiny had not been unfavourable to her or discouraging to her admirer the same smile was reserved for williams when they met in private and if occasionally a cloud was seen to pass over her brow or a sigh to escape from her bosom the voice of love soon restored her to peace he was therefore firmly bent upon rivetting the nuptial chain yet a previous word or two with henry by way of preface to the awful deed was anxiously sought by him and as our heros visits to his father were daily repeated that opportunity soon offered itself when the following dialogue took place  i have fully reflected said williams upon our friend susans situation in life and i think i may say truly and without reserve that my feelings are entirely reconciled to put up with the consequences of her involuntary connection with the father of her child if my mind was not made up upon this point to a perfect acquiescence for all time to come i would not do her as well as myself so base a wrong as to engage with her on any terms but represented as the transaction has been to me and i cannot doubt the truth of it she appears in heart so innocent that i confess to you sir i feel no hesitation in resolving to propose to her and i trust i never shall find cause to blush at the connection  there is no ground to suspect you ever will said henry you was her first love my friend and she i understand was yours a thief indeed stole in and made some pillage of your treasure but you yourself had first unlocked the chest  that is true that is true quoth williams coloring i owe the debt of honor and will pay it yet give me leave to say i suspect there will be a sort of blank in her heart for a while to come but what of that i must trust to her good sense and my own attentions to fill it up before long  and how can you doubt of either rejoined henry  i will not doubt replied williams nay i do not doubt for she has conducted herself hitherto in a manner to my perfect satisfaction and it would be injustice to suppose she will fail me in future nevertheless if i am not asking too great a favor and intruding on your kindness and condescension further than i ought i confess it would be a very singular gratification to me to know the state of her mind in these particulars from your examination and report of it  to this henry made answer that he saw no reason to doubt of susans sincerity neither was he convinced the method he proposed of putting it to the test was altogether advisable  nevertheless added he if you are resolved to put the probe in my hand and insist upon my using it as it is your profession to understand the application so it must be your business to stand to the effects of it  williams smiled and replied he would abide by the consequences  these words were scarce out of his mouth when susan entered the room and williams glancing a significant look at henry left them together a leading kind of conversation was started by henry on the subject of her little boy under his charge which he contrived to train toward the point he had in purpose to discuss  i think susan he said as business will gather upon your hands with the growth of your child it might not be amiss to look out in good time for some honest and welltempered man to be your partner in the task susan blushed but at the same time had a certain arch intelligence in her look whilst she smiled upon him that gave him to understand she was aware at whom his introduction pointed  i see you are beforehand with me said henry but if i am touching upon an unwelcome topic tell me so with sincerity and i will say no more but if i am still as much in your confidence as i used to be and you are not disinclind to open your mind to your friend why should we not discuss this subject together as naturally as any other and surely none can be more interesting and important  certainly replied susan none can be so interesting to a person in my circumstances nor have i any friend on earth to whose opinion i shall attach so much attention and respect as to yours yet i know not how nor ought i perhaps if i knew how to describe the sensation it gives me to find myself addressed by you on this subject in every matter i can lay my heart before you without scruple or reserve in this only i feel a backwardness and repugnance which ought not to be there nor shall it be if my utmost efforts can prevent it therefore i humbly pray you to proceed and if i misbehave myself by any sudden weakness i am not able to control let me rather meet your pity than incur your displeasure or contempt  fear not replied henry that you can possibly be exposed to either one or the other nor suffer yourself to believe i have any motives but those of the purest friendship for pressing this unwelcome explanation upon you you and i susan have been in certain situations for which i must remain your everlasting debtor in gratitude and in the course of which the benevolent warmth and sensibility of your heart have been so far interested in my favor that i feel myself in such a degree responsible for your happiness and secure establishment in life as to make it a matter of conscience with me to see you settled and content before i can enjoy with perfect peace of mind the happiness i myself have so flattering a prospect of you have known my friend williams longer than i have and i need not speak to you of his worth as little need i say that he loves you to the length of marrying you  here susan demanded if williams had said that voluntarily and of his own accord or if henry had urged him to it in consequence of any thing that had been talked of in confidence between them to this henry replied i am free to confess to you that all i have to tell him he already knows but as i have had nothing to tell except what makes for your credit and recommendation he views your character in its best and fairest light a soft side perhaps toward the tender passion he may credit you for but of me he has no right to be jealous and for himself he has no reason either to glance at what has past or apprehend for what may be to come a handsome fellow at all points as he is can have nothing to fear from an honesthearted girl like you whose very first lesson of love was of his teaching  susan cast her eyes down and blushed henry proceeded he is now established in a profession where his diligence and skill will ensure success what can you better determine upon than to join your means with his and fix for life with an amiable and worthy man who has a heart to love you an understanding to advise you and a spirit that will protect and uphold you under all events of life  thank you for your good counsel replied susan keeping her eyes fixed on the floor i have a great opinion of mr williams but   here she paused if you are so condescending as to be his advocate in this matter you will advise him not to talk to me on the subject for some two or three days to come  i understand you said henry and rightly judging that a longer pleading would not help his client hastened out of the room  chapter v some of the principal characters in this history are winding up their parts when our hero had concluded his conference with susan he repaired to his father and had the satisfaction to hear him say he found himself so well recovered that he proposed with williamss permission to accept sir roger manstocks kind invitation and pay him a visit the very next day if our reader has not heard of this invitation we have his pardon to solicit as well as that of the hospitable baronet for our neglect to record it at the bottom of the stairs as he came down from his fathers room he was met by old weevil who came to return thanks for his kindness to his son tom was now returned home to the great joy of his family who contemplated his scars with triumph and heard his tale with rapture and delight his father proposed to him to take on with the trade of the mill and sir roger manstock had offered to put him into a small farm but tom was a lad of an enterprising spirit and in his short cruize had contracted a passion for the sea the cut in his skull had not cooled the courage at his heart and a seafaring life was so decidedly his choice that captain carey at the suit of our hero had promised him employment and as we are now more at leisure to attend to his particular history than we shall probably be when nearer to the conclusion of our general one we shall take the opportunity of informing our readers by anticipation that thomas weevil through careys interest obtained the lucrative employ of purser to his frigate and in the course of a successful warfare earned enough to provide a comfortable retreat for himself in time of peace  henrys conversation with the miller was now cut short by a more consequential visitor his late antagonist captain crowbery was in the parlour and requested a few words with him in private he understood mr delapoer had intended his noble relation the honor of a visit when he was taken suddenly ill that his lordship was now from home and in his absence he wished mr delapoer to be informed that if the business was such as he could execute or was thought worthy to be entrusted with he should gladly receive his commands  henry made answer that from what he understood of mr delapoers mind on the subject he had no present wish of troubling lord crowbery or any of the family upon the business in question it simply related to a design which he had laid aside at all events it did not apply to him the captain and if it should be taken up afresh he presumed lord crowbery would be at home again in a few days to this the captain replied he was sorry to say that was not likely to be the case as he must confess it was not a very honorable way he had taken of terminating a rash engagement by running away from it it could not be denied that miss claypole was unfairly treated for matters had gone great lengths and now my lord had taken leave of her in a very abrupt fashion by going out of england without any warning either to her or to her uncle who accompanied him to town upon the pretense of arranging matters for the marriage that mr claypole was now come back having had a letter put into his hand after his lordships departure in which he avows his resolution of discharging himself from his engagements upon prudential reasons and says he has probably taken leave of england for some years to come  i have sought occasion of telling you this added he because i would fain stand clear in your opinion as to my part in the transaction which is simply that of being left here in a most unpleasant predicament the nearest relation of a man whose conduct i cannot approve but whose interests at the same time i must not abandon my situation will i trust apologize for this and i protest to you upon my honor i have not been his lordships adviser in the proceeding i should have expected that decency alone would have kept him out of an engagement so unseemly and precipitate whilst that affair was carrying on i was banished from the castle to which i am but just recalled there to be left in trust of his concerns with the distressful aggravation of being made witness to a scene that beggars all description and now having trespassed on your patience with a detail little interesting perhaps to you i have only to add that if mr delapoer as your friend has any thing to propose within the compass of my power to gratify him in i shall be happy in the opportunity of showing my regard to you by the attention i shall pay to his commands  captain crowbery said our hero i am much beholden to you for the kindness of this offer the candor with which you mark a conduct that cannot be justified by any principle of honor leaves me nothing to add to your comments on that proceeding i am sorry for the lady but as i suspect no other passion but ambition has part in the disappointment i hope she will the sooner forget it with regard to her uncle i am afraid it is not in my heart to find much pity for his mortification in the mean time sir i shall impart to mr delapoer the very handsome manner you have expressed yourself in toward him and i doubt not but he will be duly sensible of your politeness  this said captain crowbery took his leave and in a few minutes after whilst henry was sitting alone pondering on these events to his unspeakable surprise the door was thrown open and fanny claypole herself without any previous ceremony hastily and wildly burst into the room  i was resolved she cried to see you once more for the last time and if you have any pity in your heart for an injured woman you will not refuse to hear me that monster crowbery that murderer of his wife has assassinated my reputation but i have found out his hiding place and i am setting out this moment in pursuit of him villain as he is he shall rue my vengeance after the most seducing promises the most sacred vows to marry me he has fled from his engagements out of england and before i follow him persuaded it will never be my fate to see you more i cannot go in peace till i have declared to you my contrition and implored your forgiveness oh henry there is one moment of my life i must never cease to think upon without horror thank heaven you survived it i was mad and desperate to destroy you  say no more of it replied our hero banish it from your memory as i shall bury it in silence and be assured i cordially forgive you  i know said she you are capable of every thing that is great and noble and i implore of heaven to reward you in the arms of the best and most beautiful of her sex your beloved isabella i only loved you she loves approves and deserves you  i have heard resumed he how basely you have been treated but what else could you expect from such a wretch so far from allowing you ought to regret his flight as a misfortune it appears to me you should rejoice in it as an escape out of the hands of a villain which to a lady in your situation is a most providential rescue  ah henry she replied it is my situation that makes him a villain and the worst of villains but i repeat to you that i will not be injured with impunity and when you hear of me again you shall hear i am revenged england i shall never visit more and now before we part for ever if you are sincere in your forgiveness of me you will hear with favor this my last request my uncle poor deluded man is brokenhearted on his own and my account he repents from his soul his ingratitude to sir roger manstock and his enmity to you he justly despairs of regaining your lost opinions but as he has no where to resort but to his residence at manstock he ardently solicits your good offices to secure him such a reception on his return as may encourage him to resume his functions with some degree of comfort and not entirely disgrace him in the eyes of his parishioners when i am gone his situation will be sad indeed my indiscretion and his own ambition have destroyed his peace your benevolence may preserve him from absolute despair have you the magnanimity to extend it to him and return good for ill  i am satisfied you have  i hope replied henry we both are capable of returning good for ill no one who ever tasted that sweet transport can regret the sacrifice of such a direful passion as revenge the virtue of forgiveness is in its own nature so lovely so congenial to man that if it had not been prescribed to us as a duty we should have practiced it as an indulgence when we are instructed to forgive our enemies knowing them to be such it is a precept that does not take away our sense of injuries it only abridges us of the privilege of revenging them and you who swell with rage against the wretch that has betrayed you who threaten to pursue him with your vengeance tell me is it a pleasurable sensation you now nourish in your heart would it not be a happy reformation were it possible to change the tempest into a calm with the word of power religion has that power mercy can speak that word she can breathe peace into your bosom and purify the heart in which she dwells till nothing evil can approach it  mercy is that virtue which offers opportunity to all for who is there that has not something to forgive although he may have nothing to bestow it is general as the sun no solitude can exclude its emanation cast me upon a desert coast an exile from society where animated nature does not draw the breath of life still i can find some object to engage my care the plant that feebly vegetates for want of soil the rill that struggles for a clearer channel will demand my help and mercy like heavens general dew shall fall upon the naked earth though not an insect that has life be present to partake of it  i must not hear you on this subject cried the relentless damsel my nerves are braced to the undertaking my wrongs will not be reasoned with my heart pants for revenge the intercession of an angel could not shake me from my purpose farewell for ever  with this terrible denunciation she sprung out of the room leaving our hero to pursue his fruitless meditations by himself  chapter vi when the judge is in league with the advocate it is easy to predict the issue of the suit the scene last recorded made so deep an impression on the sensibility of our henry that when he returned to manstock house in the evening the effect was so discoverable that he found it necessary to impart to the enquiring isabella what had caused it when he had finished his recital which though not colored to the height was sufficiently horrible to account for what she had remarked she produced a letter that day received from the unhappy object of their conversation wherein she takes shame to herself for her conduct toward henry and paints his character in the highest terms of praise she speaks of lord crowbery as a wretch too base to live and takes a final leave of isabella with the warmest wishes for her happiness recommending as her last petition her repentant uncle to pardon and protection and entreating her to employ her generous efforts for mitigating the just resentment of sir roger there is justice at least said isabella in this poor creatures heart though it is the slave of passion and revenge alas i fear she is desperate enough to execute any dreadful act she meditates but what is to be done with this poor deluded uncle of here is whom she recommends to our pity methinks it would be hard to refuse him that now he has seen his error and smarts for it so severely it cannot be expected my father should ever entertain the same affection for him as before nor is it perhaps to be wished he should but i think i may answer for it that he will never show him any marks of his resentment i am told he came early to the vicarage this morning and no doubt it is a heavy moment with him whilst he is uncertain what reception he will meet from this family by whose notice or neglect all the parishioners will govern themselves poor man he wants a comforter i know the tenderness of your heart henry and i wish you could prevail upon yourself to pay him a charitable visit  may all your wishes be as readily anticipated replied henry i have done that already  have you she exclaimed how like yourself is such benevolence i cannot tell you henry what delight i take in every thing that does you honor but what is that but saying every action of your life diffuses pleasure to your friends  that praise is more than i deserve said henry for i really sought my own gratification in visiting mr claypole who is so much an altered man that i got rid of some unpleasant impressions i had received in his disfavour and when a man has the good sense to see and heartily to confess his errors so far from being lessened in my opinion he seems to me a more amiable character than before he had committed them  i dare say i should think as you do replied isabella if i did not recollect there is one person in the world who has never taken that method to increase my good opinion of him  that only proves your partiality is greater than your memory rejoined henry looking tenderly upon her but whilst my whole heart is yours and every thought which it conceives is inspired by the ambition of approving myself to you following that impulse how is it possible i should err  ah flatterer she replied if my approbation is your object that is long since obtained  in saying this she yielded him her hand whilst her enraptured lover pressing it to his lips dropped on his knee at her feet and may i not he said presume upon that approbation to solicit the surrender of this lovely hand for life when will the charming isabella deign to bless her fond devoted supplicant whom she has condescended so to praise and honor above all that he can merit oh when will that soft heart so full of pity yield to my intercession and consent to shorten my suspense how many anxious days have i to number betwixt hope and happiness  days she exclaimed what are you thinking of  of you the first in all my thoughts the fairest loveliest object in creation of myself next the wretchedest of beings if after a few weeks i must be doomed to bear the pangs of separation from all that is dear to me in life  and why of separation she demanded my father it is true will be called up to town at the meeting of parliament but you will be with us henry i am sure my father does not mean to part with you dont you perceive he is never happy without you  he is very good to me he replied but still i cannot look forward to that time without alarm london is my terror what can i do in it i have never been in the habits of a london life nor can i accord to them adieu to the soft shades of manstock and our delightful walks beneath them farewell our peaceful evenings undisturbed by noise uninterrupted by intruders no more morning rides amidst flocks and herds and cultivated farms to visit the improvements of the husbandman and the works of the labourer no peaceful cottager will be standing at her door to greet my isabella with a blessing as she passes no infant children clothed by her bounty no aged objects feeding on her bread all tranquil pleasures will vanish and perhaps the very senses themselves change with the scene that shifts before them the eye may lose its purity of speculation the ear its chaste abhorrence of unmeaning folly or insidious flattery and the heart surpised by novelty and sappd by dissipation may in time be perverted from its simplicity and these venerable towers the seat of hospitality and peace when visited again may present nothing to the imagination but the gloomy haunts of solitude and melancholy  heavens what a picture she exclaimed but can these fearful predictions be realizd no henry i have been trained to domestic habits and to them i will adhere my duty leads me to attend upon my father and to that alone i will devote myself you shall never have to seek me at public places and assemblies we will pass our evenings at home and hold to the old fashions of manstock house till it is our happy destiny to return to it again and then you shall witness if my spirits sink upon the sight of it  would to heaven that day was come rejoined henry with a sigh or that my adorable isabella would be graciously disposed to save me from those agonies that parting must inflict  again you talk of parting where is the necessity for that  because i am a son he replied and have as yet no nearer no superior duty to oppose to natures call upon me can i desert my father in his declining state his melancholy station as you know is fixed and nothing can allure him from it how then can i acquit myself to conscience and be justified to him unless my lovely advocate will furnish me with a plea to put to silence all opposing claims can the most generous of her sex reflect that she has power to bless me with a word and will she not pronounce it  he accompanied this appeal with a look so touching and action so tender that the fond and unopposing isabella was disarmed and vanquished the dread of separation on the one hand and the impulse of allpowerful love on the other conspired to second and enforce his suit as she meditated upon a reply her color came and went as alternate emotions succeeded one another delicacy suggested some repelling thoughts the recent death of lady crowbery opposed a strong impediment to hasty measures but then she called to mind two months were yet to pass before her father would be called from home and then the same objections of decorum would not remain in the same force she perceived that every hour improved her lovers interest with sir roger and in two long months there were many hours to mature that interest till what was henrys wish might be her fathers also and then her precipitation would not stand in need of an excuse in short these same intervening months were such a resource in her reasonings upon this petition and love is so ingenious to avail himself of every resource against hesitation and delay that she did not feel herself necessitated to quash his hopes by a peremptory refusal but on the contrary turning her eyes upon him with a smile that would have animated any heart which had not totally forborne to beat and blushing with a consciousness that she was to speak upon a subject that awakened all her sensibility she said she hoped he was more ingenious than sincere in stating an alternative to puzzle her poor wits and make a choice of difficulties so artfully devised that she could only say he had found that one circumstance to alarm her with more terrible on reflection than all she had to dread by yielding to his importunity  oh henry added she her sweet voice trembling and sinking into tones the most tender it is plain you know the power you have upon my heart when you menace me with a separation i have not fortitude to bear and represent yourself in affliction and distress of mind which you tell me is in my power to relieve you from with a single word convinced as you must be there is no sacrifice i would not make to purchase your release if in this straight therefore you are resolved to hem me in by terrors on both sides i freely own i have not the heart to make you wretched and do not want the courage to resort to that alternative which takes the inquietude from you and fixes it on me alone  henry replied to this with such respectful but impressive tenderness and though his heart overflowed with gratitude he tempered it with such delicacy that before their interesting conversation was concluded every objection isabellas timidity had opposed was removed and her fond heart became so complete a convert to the rhetoric of love that when they broke up their conference it would have been hard to decide could their secret thoughts have been discovered which of the two was most impatient for the happy moment that was to unite them for life  chapter vii occurrences upon a visit at manstock house the next morning henry rode over to crowbery and found his father preparing himself for his visit to sir roger manstock stock it was a bold experiment but his heart was so much bent upon the undertaking that williams no longer opposed it at the hour appointed sir rogers horses came over and delapoer stepped gaily into his chaise after taking a most grateful leave of the hospitable women and honest ezekiel who were assembled on the occasion and with many kind wishes attended him to the carriage the day seemed to smile upon his enterprise and he arrived at the gates of the venerable mansion with strength and spirits recruited by the freshness of the air and the gentle exercise which the vehicle had given him on the first step before the door the worthy baronet received his visitor and welcomed him with that hospitable grace which was peculiarly his own as he entered the stately hall through two files of domestics ranged on each side he was struck with a peculiar delight in contemplating a scene that so strongly contrasted every thing his eyes had of late been accustomed to and carried his imagination back through centuries past to the times of feudal state and chivalry he seemed never weary of praising and admiring every thing he saw nor was sir roger backward in explaining every object of his curiosity he knew the owners of each shield and corselet had the history of their battles by heart could point out their portraits in the picturegallery and elucidate every banner and bearing of the family coat to all which delapoer who was an adept in heraldry gave a willing and attentive ear  in the midst of this discourse when sir roger had brought down his narrative so near to modern times as to be just then engaged in relating an anecdote of his great grandmother very much to the credit of her beauty delapoers attention was drawn off by the entrance of isabella in whose person he beheld a living model of such exquisite perfection that he could not resist whispering to the baronet that whatever might have been the charms of the ancestor he was persuaded they were outdone by those of the descendant sir roger smiled and probably was not displeased with the apostrophe though he still seemed unwilling to give up his great grandmother  murmuring in an under voice that he could assure him lady rachel was a famous woman in her time isabellas manners were of that natural and engaging sort that all the graces which others gain by study she seemed to possess to a superior degree by the gift of nature how then could she fail to charm a man of delapoers sensibility who at the same time recognized in her fine person a family likeness of that beloved image which sad remembrance had indelibly impressed upon his mind his figure though in decay had still a grace and highborn elegance about it which neither lapse of years in a debilitating climate nor the more fatal inroads of corroding melancholy could so efface but that there still remained the venerable ruin of a noble form his address though certainly not that of the present era was not so stiffened by oriental forms as to be troublesomely ceremonious it had all the gallantry and goodbreeding of the old court with some slight tints perhaps of its pedantry and precision this in sir rogers eye was the very model of a fine gentleman and no instruments in unison ever harmonized more perfectly than the good host and his guest  sir rogers style as we before observed was in point of open hospitality that of the feudal ages and his return to manstock brought a great resort of the neighboring gentry to his house where the board might literally be said to groan with plenty but the most interesting spectacle to delapoer was that of the domestics at their dinner ranged at three distinct tables according to their gradations and degrees this is true magnificence he cried this is a princely manner of administering a great estate some venerable personages at the head of the garrison particularly struck him when a greyheaded senior who presided at the upper table giving a signal for silence rose from his seat and lifting a can to his lips proclaimed aloud  prosperity to the house of manstock which was repeated by all with the like action and in the like posture whereupon the libation being finished the whole company broke up and dispersed to their several occupations and employs  in the great parlour where sir roger entertained his guests delapoer was much amused by the series of family portraits exhibiting curious specimens of characters and dresses in the several fashions of their times whilst the gothic windows of painted glass reflected variegated gleams of the prismatic colors which played upon the faces of the company with a singular and whimsical effect zachary cawdle in particular who was one at the table sat directly in the stream of so broad a glare of crimson light that he exhibited a most ferocious and resplendent mask of foil that would not have discredited the hue of bacchus himself in the gayest of his frolics  when the ladies had retired after dinner something was said of lord crowbery by a gentleman who sat next to henry he might have known it was a topic not very acceptable or polite at sir rogers table and as he seemed going into an account of his attachment to miss claypole henry in a whisper reminded him that there were some present who would be thankful to him if he would change the subject he was upon the young man was proud illmannered and irritable he took henrys hint as an affront and turning to him with an indignant look said in a tone that marked his purpose to be heard by every body round him i dont know how i have deserved your reprimand sir nor by what right i am stopped in my speech when i was neither addressing it to you nor about to speak disrespectfully of lord crowbery to whom i have the honor of being related and for whom i entertain a very high regard and esteem  all eyes were instantly upon the angry gentleman sir roger was preparing to interpose and delapoer had drawn himself up into a martial attitude when our hero with the most perfect composure not elevating his voice nor retorting the acrimonious tone in which he had been addressed replied that he was not aware of his connection with lord crowbery but since that was the case he would compromise the matter without any further interruption to the company  for if you sir added he will be pleased to say nothing more as to your opinion of his lordship i will be perfectly silent as to mine  you will do well sir replied mr hardham for that was the name of the speaker to be silent in this and every other company where that noble lord is named  then rising from his seat he said  with your leave sir roger we will adjourn to the ladies  hold sir cried henry we are both at issue before this good company and if either of us has received an insult let him that gave it deliver an apology if there is here one gentleman that pronounces me in fault i am instantly prepared to make atonement on the spot  no no no was echoed by every voice and one gentleman added that he dare say mr hardham would apologize  if that is your opinion he replied you will be pleased to tell me in the first place for what i am to apologize and next to whom for to this moment i never heard what name the gentleman chooses to be addressed by  by mine replied delapoer by a name which he inherits as my son and by which he is entitled to exact satisfaction from any gentleman that has the hardiness to insult him  these words were calmly though pointedly delivered mr hardham paused for a few moments then addressing himself to mr delapoer said  i am answered and from what i felt as a relation of lord crowbery can allow for what you must feel as so much nearer allied to this gentleman to you therefore as his father i refer myself implicitly and whatever you in your candor think proper to dictate that i will repeat  then sir replied delapoer i can be at no loss to pronounce you have already said enough and all i have further to wish for my son is that he may have the honor and happiness of being better known to you  thus by the timely application of a few patient words an altercation was put a stop to which threatened fatal consequences for mr hardham was a young man of a very forward spirit and had more than once been engaged in what are called affairs of honor he had withal a full sense of his own consequence being a man of great property in the county son of the lately deceased member and the very person whom his party meant to have set up as candidate had not sir roger met the wishes of the coalition and prevented a contest his petulance nobody wondered at for that was habitual to him how he came to be so rightheaded in getting out of the quarrel was matter of welcome surprise to every body but there was a latent motive which operated upon him for curbing his temper in the presence of sir roger and it was not so much the firm words of delapoer as the fair eyes of isabella that were the peacemakers on this occasion he had watched her during the entertainment her manners charmed him her beauty enchanted him but there was something in her looks at times that directed his suspicion toward the person of our hero and this together with a report that had reached his ears of an attachment in that quarter threw a spark of jealousy upon the combustibles of his frame which accounts for the explosion that so suddenly took place the event however shows that this quarrelsome gentleman like others of the like quality had temper at command when it suited him to make use of it  few things could have given greater pain to the hospitable heart of sir roger manstock than to have had the peace and good order of society disturbed beneath the sacred protection of his roof the harmony that now succeeded was of course grateful to him above all and he spared no pains to convince mr hardham of this by repeated marks of the most pointed attention after a few cheerful and conciliatory glasses it was again proposed to adjourn to the drawing room here the pacified gentleman had a fair opportunity of renewing his attentions to the lovely isabella without any interruption from henry now closeted with his friend williams who had galloped over from crowbery to impart the glad tidings of his approaching nuptials with his fair betrothed who had consented to yield what alone she had withheld her hand in marriage on the day but one next ensuing henry was truly rejoiced at the news but put as much gravity into his features as the felicity of the occasion would admit of all which williams who read his thoughts understood without a comment mr delapoer was likewise called into conference not only for the purpose of congratulation but to undergo certain medical interrogatories that williams had to put to him all which were discussed to the mutual satisfaction of both parties for nothing was now wanting but gentle exercise and cautious regimen on the patients part to confirm his recovery and thereby establish the professional fame of the bridegroom elect  chapter viii a certain gentleman repeats his visit when henry returned to the drawing room he found nobody there but the father and daughter the company were all gone and mr hardham the last his attention to isabella had been so marked that when upon taking leave of sir roger he begged permission to wait on him the next morning upon an affair of consequence there was little doubt to be made but that it had respect to isabella this was conveyed to sir roger in a whisper as he passed through the hall to his carriage and the baronet had now been imparting it to his daughter with his comments upon it to the above effect her own observations also coincided with the same idea and the point was not long in debate what should be the nature of the answer to the proposal if it came for independent of all prior engagements mr hardham had not the happy faculty of recommending himself to the good graces of either party sir roger indeed acknowledged that his pretensions were unexceptionable in point of fortune and family but he thought him of a proud imperious nature and when he came to reflect upon his behavior at table toward henry he thought he could discover other motives for his acquiescence than what resulted from pure candor and conviction isabella said she had never found herself so embarrassed by the attentions of any man in her life his whole address seemed artificially put on to cover a character and temper very different from what he assumed but of all the persecutions she ever suffered by being looked out of countenance none was to be compared with what his eyes had the faculty of inflicting when she found them for ever fixed upon her in short throwing all comparisons out of the question mr hardham was positively in her opinion the most unpleasant man she had ever met with  in this period of their discourse henry entered the room and related what had passed between him and williams a new subject was now started and of a pleasanter nature henry spoke in the highest terms of williams and as his father was now retired to his chamber for the night he gave an account of all he had done for williams and how he had adjusted matters with zachary on his behalf by which he had set him out clear in the world with a fair prospect of success in his profession and of a happy connection with the girl of his heart now comfortably established isabella asked if he was fully apprised of susans history henry assured her he was acquainted with every particular of it and had little difficulty in reconciling himself to circumstances more imputable to illtreatment than misconduct  and was susan very readily consenting  march had she no sruples to overc  wholly and solely attached to  smiled and turning to sir  appealed to the court if these were questions he was bound to answer  i can understand replied the worthy magistrate that they are questions you wish to evade however as susan was her own mistress and under no control we must suppose she had good reasons for the choice she has made and i think isabella herself will allow that is a fair conclusion  mr hardham was mentioned and henry in a kind of whisper asked sir roger if he did not think it would be right for him to pay that gentleman the compliment of a visit the next morning sir roger answered that he should have thought so but that mr hardham had signified his intention of coming over to manstock and if he conjectured rightly of his business the ceremony of a visit might very well be dispensed with henry took the hint cast a tender look upon isabellas blushing countenance and immediately gave a turn to the conversation by speaking of mr claypole he had been with him that morning and found him in great affliction on account of a letter he had received from his niece by which it appeared she had taken the desperate resolution of pursuing her base deceiver out of england and was then on the point of embarking in a packet for that purpose is the girl mad said sir roger to run after a rascal that any other woman would think herself happy to be rid of what can she propose to gain by such a crazy expedition  revenge cried henry if i am to believe her own professions and if i may judge from the frantic menaces she vented against him when she surpised me with a visit at susan mays i would not ensure his lordships ribs from a stiletto if once he falls within her reach  a wretched catastrophe truly cried sir roger that would be but a striking moral for tyrants mr hardham will then have to mourn the loss of his respected friend and relation and this misguided this unhappy man poor claypole will bring his politics to a miserable end it is ever thus with overcunning men  but he has thoroughly repented of his ingratitude said isabella and is now a real object for your pity and forgiveness  he is welcome to them both rejoined sir roger and to every thing that i can subscribe to his consolation and relief but what i cannot command my affection and esteem them i have not in my power to bestow when once ingratitude has chilled the heart that glowed with friendship who can kindle it afresh i speak strongly and explicitly to you my dear children upon this subject because i know that both henry upon this occasion and you isabella upon others as well as this have purposely introduced it with a kind design of reinstating claypole in my good opinion by setting forth his sufferings and contrition the attempt does honor to your hearts it is amiable in the extreme and i rejoice that you are capable of being advocates for one that was no advocate for you but artfully abused my confidence and turned what interest he had in me and that i own was not a little insidiously against you both baffled in this project and disappointed of his malice he betook himself to a wretch whose very name is poison to my ears and there began an infamous cabal which having ended in miscarriage and disgrace he now repents of but remember children it is repentance after punishment and therefore when i say that i forgive him i have said enough  i have nothing more to do with mr claypole  to this no answer was attempted and probably from this time till certain circumstances hereafter recorded came to light neither henry nor isabella felt in themselves any disposition to revive the subject claypole in the mean time kept himself retired from all society except when henry occasionally paid him a charitable visit or sir roger cheared him with a civil word which every sunday he took care to address to him after divine service in the sight of the congregation  the next morning came and sir roger was observed to be more than ordinarily thoughtful during breakfast his mind was occupied with the expectation of his unwelcome visitor when he reflected upon what had fallen from him at table where he was interrupted by henry he called to mind so many unpleasant marks of a purposed affront so much arrogance in his manner and such indications of a suppressed resentment even in the very act of atoning for his insult that he was not without suspicion that the flame of his temper would find some other vent if upon the presumption of his proposing for miss manstock he was to meet him with an instant and abrupt refusal on this account he was not a little perplexed how to deport himself in the conference so as neither to irritate him against henry as a rival nor encourage him to consider isabella as a lady he was warranted to pursue with his addresses and the whole result of sir rogers meditations amounted only to this that he had a clearer sight of his difficulty than of the way to lead him out of it it was therefore not a little to be regretted that before he had gained any distinct perception of the line he was to follow mr hardham was announced and of course immediately admitted to a private conference  mr hardham prefaced his more material business by apologizing for words that had escaped from him yesterday in the heat of conversation which as far as they alluded to lord crowbery he feared might have conveyed an impression in his disfavour as seeming to imply that he approved of his lordships conduct in general when in fact he only alluded to that part of his character which was uppermost in his thoughts the steady support which he had always given to the county interests of his family that he was not then apprised of the just reasons sir roger had to resent his treatment of an amiable lady unfortunately lost to the world neither was he informed of the late disgraceful step he had taken of flying from engagements which though rashly made could not be honorably abandoned  these circumstances he confessed had been heartily explained to him that very morning by captain crowbery and it was but fair to say that upon that statement he felt himself obliged to give up his noble relation as indefensible on both accounts and this he hoped would suffice to set him strait in sir rogers good opinion if he had unfortunately endangered it from any thing he had inadvertently been led to say the day before  here he came to a stop and seemed to expect some answer from sir roger  sir roger replied that it was a point with him to enter into no discussion of lord crowberys conduct especially with lord crowberys relations his niece was dead and whatever were her sufferings in this life they were now at an end as to miss claypoles case he had nothing to do with it it was a story he did not wish to lend his ear to in like manner he begged leave to say that with respect to any opinions mr hardham might adopt in favor or disfavour of the lord in question he hoped he understood himself too well to interfere in any shape with them much less was he disposed to revive the mention of a trifling altercation which was so completely done away to the honor of both parties and for that reason should be buried in perpetual oblivion  then if i may indulge the hope he rejoined that my condescension in accommodating myself to the gentlemans vivacity was acceptable to sir roger manstock let me presume to draw one obvious conclusion from it and take for granted that he understood the sacrifice to have been what it truly was a mark of my respect to him and an ambition so to recommend myself to his opinion as to ground some title to his favor and protection in a suit which i have now to make and on the issue of which the happiness of my whole life depends  mr hardham paused for a reply but none being made he proceeded to explain  i flatter myself i need not dwell upon particulars so much within your knowledge as my family or fortune they are such i trust as will entitle me to credit when i assert that neither interest nor ambition have any share in the sincere and pure attachment which i profess to have for your most amiable daughter no sir it is by the heart alone i am attracted to miss manstock and as i hope my character may boldly face the light and never need the veil of mystery i hold it fair and honorable to apprise you of my wishes and request your sanction to the tender of my most humble addresses to your lovely daughter  sir roger paused a while and then with much gravity and in a deliberate tone said your pretensions mr hardham in point of fortune and family are as you say too well known to stand in need of any explanation they are such as qualify you to propose for any lady in this kingdom and certainly sir in the attachment you profess for my daughter i have every reason to believe you guided by no other motives than those of free choice and disinterested inclination when therefore you appeal to me that i would sanction the tender of your addresses to miss manstock i believe i use your own expression i can have but one answer to make so long as your reference is confined to but one point and that simply to demand a passport to my daughter no father i believe whatever may be his views for his child will refuse that to mr hardham  to this he replied if i have explained no further to you on this interesting subject sir i hope you will consider it as a very natural wish on my part to owe my success if i am so blessed as to obtain it wholly and solely to my own interest in the ladys good opinion who is to constitute my happiness and as i cannot doubt but miss manstock is incapable of condescending to bestow her regards on any man of dubious character or just emergd from meanness and obscurity i trust if i am permitted to approach her i shall at least not have to combat with a heart preoccupied by any rival or if by any not by one that will disgrace her preference and make me feel myself degraded by the competition  as you put no question to me in the matter replied the baronet briefly and coldly i am not put to any answer  you have free access to miss manstock  this brought the proud suitor to a pause he perceived he had gone too far and carried his language too high and he saw himself in the necessity of qualifying what he had said with an apology or throwing up the negotiation at once i am afraid said he that i have expressed myself too warmly and unwarily but i entreat sir roger manstock will be assured that i entertain a most profound respect for his person and character and if i spared to solicit his good favor and protection to my suit it was solely dictated by an ambition which i hope will be thought both natural and commendable  here he turned his eyes upon sir roger  a silent bow was all the answer he obtained  i perceive added he i am unfortunate in my manner and deficient perhaps in something which in the character of a petitioner i ought to carry about with me but i am new in the predicament and having failed to conciliate the fathers favor i will not choose so unlucky a moment for requesting an audience of the daughter i am not quite prepared to receive two rebuffs in the same breach  with these words he quitted his seat and sir roger rising at the same moment they took a silent leave and mr hardham mounted his curricle in waiting highly out of humor with his reception his proud heart swelling with vexation to find his selfimportance humbled and prepared to vent his spite upon two unoffending horses whose tender skins soon smarted under the ceaseless lash of their unfeeling tyrant  oh what a wretch is man when pride and selfimportance seize upon his heart the scorn of every noble mind the pest of all society a monster amongst men begone from me thou selfswolen blockhead who art at once too foolish for my resentment and too mischievous for my pity in some bye turn and crossing of my walk in life when i chance upon thee for nothing else but chance can throw me in thy way no sooner do i recognize thy staring owleyed visage than i post down a promise in my tablets to sketch thy gloomy portrait from the life and hang thee up to public mockery as satires lawful prize but when i stretch the canvas and begin to daub it with thy ugliness i soon perceive thou do not own a single feature that can furnish any thing but loathing and disgust too dull to help my fancy to a jest too despicable to inspire it with a serious thought and too hardened to be mended by correction  i cast thee from my thoughts discovering thee to be so mere a caput mortuum that no chemistry can extract so much virtue out of thee as would even serve to give physic to a dog  chapter ix why is earth and ashes proud mr hardham instead of returning to his own house drove to crowbery castle to make report to his friend the captain and consult him upon the posture of affairs at manstock the advice he got here was on the whole very prudent but he was not just then in the best temper to receive it captain crowbery as we have before observed entertained a very high opinion of henry and ever since his rencontre with him had taken all occasions of doing justice to his behavior not only in that affair but in every other that had come to his knowledge particularly as to the share he had in careys action with the frigate when hardham therefore spoke contemptuously of him as a rival and seemed to reproach himself for having stooped to any apology crowbery plainly told him that he could by no means be a party in any steps for grafting a serious quarrel on a silly altercation that had been once fairly dismissed for his own part he had been already flagrantly in the wrong toward henry and had turned out with him in consequence of it it must then be a very strong case indeed that would call him out again either as principal or second  and was it not a strong case hardham demanded when the character of lord crowbery was glanced at in such pointed terms and in a public company by a fellow who had no right to use his name in any place or on any occasion but with deference and respect  i thought replied crowbery that i had opened enough to you in our mornings conversation on this subject to justify the words that henry used had they been even stronger than you state them i can now truly say that if you and i as relations of that unhappy man have any ground left us to stand upon in his defense we owe it to the candor of the very person you complain of the melancholy news i received this day led me to turn some papers over which at blachfords death were honorably delivered up by henry that in some hands would have been arms no mortal could have parried if he opened them we are at the mercy of his honor for keeping them secret if he returned them unexamind we are indebted to his delicacy for our possession of them you may believe me mr hardham that those papers which i have now destroyed would have brought to light very dark dealings and made the title that has now by a most dreadful accident devolved on me a title of disgrace and shame  hardham eagerly demanded what accident he alluded to  the death of lord crowbery he replied his lordship had landed at ostend and from the position of the armies had been stopped there for some days in the mean time a villain found means to assassinate him in the streets as he was coming home late at night to his hotel he was taken up by the patrole mortally stabbed and incapable of giving any account of what had passed every means had been taken by the commandant for discovering the murderer but hitherto without success he had strong suspicions in his mind which pointed to a certain person who had closely followed him out of england but these he would not make public being determined to set out the next morning and pursue his enquiries on the spot  i am shocked replied hardham at the account and whilst i congratulate your lordship on your accession to the title of your family i must deplore the catastrophe that has devolved it upon you under circumstances of so melancholy a cast if i can be of any service to you here in your absence or even by accompanying you in your journey i am at your command  your offer said the new lord crowbery is most kind and friendly and in part i will accept it as you may be of most essential use and service to me here if you will consent to put my mind at peace with respect to a family for whom i entertain the highest reverence and esteem i mean the house of manstock there is nothing lies so heavy on my heart as the treatment they have met with from the unfortunate deceased i am the last man living that should speak too harshly of lord crowbery my benefactor but i have been made a painful witness to such things as make me shudder to reflect upon i hold it therefore my first duty to make all the atonement in my power to that muchinjurd family and in doing this i think i shall approve myself a real friend to the memory of the deceased and now my dear sir suffer me to appeal to you and put it to your heart if in honor you have any just cause of animosity against that excellent young man who if i am well informed is firmly engaged to the lady you proposed for is he in the fault of that or are you warranted to affront and decry him because he is approved of by miss manstock whom you hardly knew by sight and never thought of before yesterday  i dont know from authority that he is engaged to miss manstock sir roger did not tell me that  you did not ask him i believe replied lord crowbery but the fact is easily ascertained if you choose to take the direct course of applying either to sir roger or to the lady herself  i confess to you said hardham it would not be very pleasing to me to be so informed by either of them though i should not be sorry to come at the truth by any other channel i am not ambitious to be marked as a rejected suitor to any lady who prefers mr henry delapoer  here a servant came in and announced the gentleman last mentioned  show him into the saloon said my lord and say i will wait upon him immediately you have now an opportunity said he applying himself to mr hardham of granting me the favor i have requested if you will condescend to remain here a few minutes whilst i step out to him and will allow me to bring him when i return to take you by the hand which i persuade myself he will gladly do you are both men of honor and only need to be known to each other to be the best of friends  i know you to be such replied hardham therefore do by me as you think right and i will wait your pleasure lord crowbery hastened to his visitor  am i beforehand with my information said henry or is it known to you that i am now to address you as lord crowbery he was informed of the event  i should have to apologize for this visit resumed our hero if it was not purely on a case of conscience but i cannot keep a circumstance concealed that may in any way affect the investigation of a crime so horrible as murder  here he recited the conversation of fanny claypole when she forced herself upon him and concluded with expressing his regret that he had suffered such menaces to pass without taking instant measures for preventing their effect  if you have any thing to regret on that account said my lord how much more cause have i to reproach myself who was so immediately in the way of her fury and a witness to the whole torrent of it but i considered it as the impotent raving of a disappointed woman and let it pass  he then explained the measures he intended to pursue for tracing it if possible to a discovery by resorting to the spot  but before i depart from this place added he upon that mournful business there is a matter of a most pressing nature on my mind which i earnestly request you will so far take charge of as to pledge me to sir roger manstock in the most respectful terms for every satisfaction in my power to make not only with regard to the liquidation of the funeral expenses by him defrayed but also of my entire acquiescence in the will of the lady crowbery which i suspect there was a meditation of contesting and at the same time i shall give orders that every article personally appertaining to that lady in this house which i am sorry to say were permitted to be put out of their places shall be brought together and collected for his revision and miss manstocks whom i shall request to make choice of any such things which they may put a value upon as remembrancers of one so worthily lamented and beloved and this i desire you will tell them i tender as the only atonement in my power to make on the part of an unhappy man who if life had been spared to him would i flatter myself have seen his error and done what i now do in his name and in honor to his memory  my lord cried henry rising from his chair and taking his hand i thank you you have justified the high opinion i conceived of you and have greatly honored me by this commission  here he stopped for his voice faultered and glancing his eyes upon a picture of his mother over the chimney which gave a striking character of her in youth and beauty nature forced her way and putting his handkerchief to his eyes he yielded to the irresistible emotion and said no more  we will adjourn to the library said lord crowbery where a friend of mine is waiting who wishes to pay his compliments to you suffer me only to ask you before you go if you think that picture will be an acceptable present to miss manstock and i name her in preference because i consider it in effect the same as giving it to you i persuade myself added he i am not premature in supposing her interests and yours are one and the same  to this henry made a modest and grateful reply neither affirming nor denying the assumption above stated but said he would report to miss manstock his most obliging offer lord crowbery then informed him who the person was that expected him in the library and after a few words introductory to their meeting took him by the hand and ushered him to mr hardham addressing himself to each in turn with many civil speeches and professions of esteem hoping it might be his good fortune as common friend to both to bring forward such an explanation as might have no grounds for future misunderstanding on the part of either mr hardham said he trusted the gentleman could not doubt his readiness to do away affronts whether justly or unjustly taken up and he presumed it was no small proof of his continuing in the same disposition that he had waited his leisure for the sole purpose of paying him his compliments in lord crowberys presence henry on his part assured him that he had devoted that morning to the honor of paying him a visit at his own house but had been told he would be from home he hoped mr hardham had carried with him no impressions from their last meeting that made a second explanation necessary respecting any thing which had there occurred if it was so he was perfectly ready on his part to renew the assurances he had then given him of his entire acquiescence in the manner he had taken for terminating that trivial dispute  here the lord crowbery interposed he hoped there was no intention on either side of looking back to what was past but on the contrary by looking forward to prevent occasion of disputes in future and this he added may be easily effected where two men of honor meet mutually disposed to deal heartily with each other should they find themselves competitors in the same pursuit  i do not quite pledge myself to that said mr hardham as i would not choose to engage in any pursuit where i did not see myself either fairly pitted against any that might oppose me or well assured of surmounting competition much as i respect miss manstock i have no ambition to be pointed at as her discarded suitor and great as my opinion may be of mr delapoers extraordinary merits i must own i do not covet the honor of being known as his rival in a struggle for that ladys favor if he has already secured her affections and been approved of by sir roger as his soninlaw  and does mr hardham expect said henry that i should account to him for my proceedings having no desire to make enquiries into his would it become me to speak out of sir roger manstocks family of what i know or believe to be passing in it that i will never do these lips shall never presumptuously profane the name of miss manstock nor will i suffer any others so to do in my hearing with impunity  then i must take the liberty to tell you   said hardham and was proceeding when lord crowbery putting his hand upon his breast said stop i conjure you sir if it be only for my sake and let us argue calmly or dismiss the subject i was the promoter of this interview and am pledged for the issue of it could i have supposed that you my friend and relation would have expressed yourself in a style so lofty and so irritating i would as soon have burnt this house over my head as suffered it to have been made a scene of quarrel and contention what mr delapoer has said is not one word too much for the occasion that gave rise to it how else could you expect a man of honor to reply to such a speech in which you seemed to make your own selfconsequence your whole concern methinks of all men living mr hardham you should keep a guard upon yourself and being so quick to feel in your own person should be cautious how you wound the feelings of others i speak plainly sir but i have the rights of hospitality to protect and if you are offended with me for it i must meet the consequences  all this while hardham sat with a contemptuous smile upon his countenance affecting to receive every reproach as a compliment bowing with an air of counterfeited respect when perceiving that lord crowbery had concluded he replied i am infinitely obliged to you my lord for your extraordinary politeness and shall endeavor to convince you that i have not lost one word of your edifying lecture by the early opportunity i shall take of requesting you to hear the comments i have made upon it  lord crowbery with quickness replied use your own pleasure sir i shall be at home for the day when you are ready with your comments i shall expect you and for securitys sake you may bring a prompter with you  chapter x pride meets its punishment and love its reward let him go said lord crowbery as hardham bounced out of the room he has the pride of lucifer  henry expressed great uneasiness at what had passed and strongly contended that the affair was his own this lord crowbery would not admit nor did he look to be farther troubled with his angry cousin he had had many such sparrings with him which had passed off as he supposed this would for he never spared him when he was in that vaunting style however if he should chance to be just then in one of his fighting fits for his courage came by starts though his petulance was constitutional it would not he owned be amiss to be ready for him  henry hoped he would have no farther trouble with him felt great responsibility for the consequences and would hold himself at his call either in his lordships house or at williams the surgeons so long as there was any chance of his services being wanted  i will intrude upon you no longer than for two hours of your time he replied within which if our angry gentleman does not make his appearance i shall think no more of him if in that interval you can amuse yourself in this library or prefer going to mr williams i will overhawl my artillery in the interim and put my hand to a few papers not quite so convenient to be left at the issue of chance and accident  this said they parted henry taking his course to his friend susans where he found williams and his betrothed this being the eve of their wedding day here he took the first opportunity of telling williams in a whisper the probability there was of an affair taking place where his attendance would be most acceptable which he readily engaged for he then with as much gaiety as he could assume made his congratulations to susan and whilst this discourse was going on as he stood by the window sir roger manstocks chaise was discovered coming across the green and making directly for the house it was quickly at the door when he heard himself joyfully greeted by his beloved isabella who was seated at the side of her father they quitted the carriage and after a most respectful welcome on the part of susan williams having modestly retired they were at their own request left in private with our hero  sir roger opened the business by informing him of mr hardhams proposal and the anxiety thereby occasioned not only to isabella but himself from the known impetuosity of that haughty suitors temper and the dread he had of consequences thence resulting he would not disguise from henry that his sudden disappearance that morning so quickly following hardhams unsuccessful visit had so alarmed his daughter that at her desire he had come over thither with her in hopes of finding him as fortunately they had done  i let you into this secret said he smiling though isabella is here present and hears herself betrayed by me because to say the truth there is now an end to all reserve between us and my only wish is to put a final stop to all solicitations by joining your hands without delay and rendering my souls darling into your entire protection and i pray god to bless you my dear children in each other and me in both  henry who was seated between them took the hand of each and pressed it to his heart in speechless ecstacy isabella suffused with blushes of the deepest dye and not venturing to raise her modest eyes which sensibility had filled with tears kept still silence which was not interrupted till sir roger resuming his discourse and addressing himself to henry said now if you are questioned by that haughty interloper tell him you have my authority to say that isabella manstock is  what shall i bid you say tell him at once and stop his importunity  she is your wife  now ask her if i have said a syllable too much  the reference was obeyed upon the instant  the enraptured lover was at the feet of his mistress the unopposing mistress was enfolded in the arms of her lover  after a proper portion of time had been devoted to joy and gratitude on the part of our hero sir roger began to comment on the circumstances of lord crowberys assassination the deed was horrid the suspicions it involved afflicting but the removal of such a worthless being out of life was providential he had seen that unhappy man the uncle of a desperate creature stained as he greatly feared with the blood of the deceased he comforted him as well as he could yet he perceived his mind was immersed in deep despair and melancholy  whether he is informed said sir roger of any circumstances that fix the guilt upon his niece i forbore to enquire but i should fear he knows more than he thinks proper to reveal  henry perceived that claypole had been less communicative to sir roger than to him for he had actually exhibited to him in confidence a letter under his nieces hand exulting in the completion of her revenge and boasting that she had found a hand to punish perfidy a frenchman who had been lurking about london for evil purposes and had been warned out of england took his passage in the same packet with her to ostend she sounded him and found him the fittest agent for her desperate purpose being deep in all the massacres that had deluged paris with human blood he had made good his escape and was safe amongst his brother sansculottes for her part she defied pursuit she had lodged herself where no search could follow her  let her uncle therefore set his mind at rest she should never be heard of more and bade him everlastingly farewell  time had imperceptibly slipped away during this conversation and sir roger had just recollected to order his chaise when williams came into the room and whispered henry that lord crowbery expected him at the castle in spite of all his selfcommand he changed color at the summons and isabella instantly caught alarm honor demanded instant obedience to the call yet henrys ingenuity could hardly suggest an excuse sufficient to bear him out the best apology he could devise upon the sudden was that lord crowbery being on the point of setting out for ostend and understanding he had had an interview with fanny claypole just before her leaving crowbery had requested him to come to him without delay  tell me only said isabella that you are not going to meet that hateful hardham and i shall be at peace  i have nothing to say to mr hardham replied henry and i conjure you not to think about him  so saying he hurried out of the room and bidding williams follow him as fast as he could made the best of his way to the place of assignation  isabellas apprehensions were by no means quieted for his agitated looks and impatient motions augured something on his mind more important and more pressing than the cause he had assigned she ran to susan may and asked for williams  he was gone with henry  this was a circumstance to aggravate her terrors duels and wounds immediately occurred why else should he take a surgeon with him even sir rogers equanimity was not proof against this at one time he would go to the castle himself  this isabella would not hear of  he would send a servant to spy what was going forward  he would contrive a message to lord crowbery himself  he could neither reconcile his mind to the one nor invent the other the chaise was at the door but isabella could not stir from the spot her fears had rooted her and dame may who foresaw there would be a demand upon her closet was busied in providing resources against faintings and hysterics susan strove to administer the consolation of reason but no sooner did the apprehension of henrys danger seize her fancy than she ceased to reason against imaginary fears and by subscribing her own to isabellas aggravated both  in the midst of this confusion zachary cawdle came into the house a newcomer in such situations let him come from whence he will gives a spring to curiosity and awakens hope  did he know if mr hardham was at the castle  he saw him pass his door toward lord crowberys not many minutes ago  it was the sentence of temporary death to isabella she fell back in her chair pale as ashes  hell and confusion exclaimed zachary what devil has bewitched my tongue that it should stumble on this mischief  he then bestirred himself to retrieve the damage he had done and dame may was dispatched for the requisites whilst the father stood motionless and aghast zachary had his fingers on her pulse  courage worthy sir he cried the defection is passing off the pulsation of the artery is perceptible we begin to revive  god be praised exclaimed the father in a transport  when in the same instant a voice was heard from without calling aloud upon doctor cawdle and in a few moments after susan who had run out upon enquiry came back with the joyful tidings that henry was perfectly safe zacharys assistance was wanted for mr hardham who was shot by lord crowbery in a duel  jump into my chaise said sir roger and bid them drive to the wounded mans relief as fast as they can gallop  fair and softly worthy sir quoth zachary i can neither jump nor gallop to his rescue williams is on the spot and is well used to gunshot wounds he only wants me as surgeons mate  zachary now with due deliberation seated himself in the chaise and the messenger having mounted behind it gave directions where to drive hardham was found on the ground and williams had just then succeeded in staunching the haemorrhage the ball had entered a little above the knee and had lodged itself by a slanting course up his thigh as he stood in a crouching posture when he gave his own fire and received that of his opponent almost at the same moment he fell and fainted on the ground when he came to himself he was earnest with williams to be taken to his own house but in this he was not indulged when zachary arrived they found means to convey him into lord crowberys house and henry now at the earnest wish of his principal took zacharys seat in the chaise and hastened back to the party at susan mays great was their joy at his return and every countenance but chiefly that on which his eyes were first fondly fixed was brightened at his presence to them he related the particulars of the rencontre in the event of which the overweening pride and insolence of hardham who was obstinate against all accommodation was proportionably chastised  chapter xi the drama closes and the curtain falls henry accompanied the chaise to manstock house and to gratify isabella no less than himself was hardly ever out of sight by the way hardham in the mean time was deposited with all possible care in the house of his antagonist during six days williams who remained in the closest attention found no moment when the operation of extracting the ball could be undertaken with safety to his life which remained in so precarious a state that lord crowbery felt himself obliged to postpone his intended expedition and sent his lawyer properly instructed to pursue all necessary measures at ostend on his behalf  on the seventh morning williams successfully extracted the ball and symptoms became so favorable as to flatter him with a cure some time after this hardham was carried to his own house and lord crowberys mind was relieved from its weight of anxious suspense his journey however was now entirely laid aside from the report of his agent whose attempts to trace the murderer had been entirely fruitless the body of the deceased was brought over and committed to the vault of his ancestors  williams was in such favor with his patient that no other surgeon was permitted to approach him one important business there was in which the fair susan had a share that suffered a postponement by his attendance upon hardham the matrimonial knot was not yet tied this indeed in the present case was simply the delay of a ceremony and the very first leisure morning williams could with a safe conscience avail himself of that ceremony was effectually performed and susan took possession of that honorable title which her fidelity and good conduct ever after maintained through a series of many prosperous and happy years  in manstock house love took his station undisturbed by any cares or interruptions save only those chaste tremors which the gentle breast of isabella felt whilst time for ever on the wing was weaving the soft silken fetters now almost complete and ready for the hand of hymen that artist who too often makes but blind and bungling work coupling illsorted pairs with coarse and clumsy tools not such our hero and his fair betrothed  lovely in person lovelier in their virtues their soft and tender hearts melted into each other with a coalescence so entire that soul with soul never more sweetly harmonized yet sometimes when the ardour of his looks alarmed her she would chide him with her blushes sometimes she would turn away and hide her face or bid him go from her and join the company this had he done he would have misunderstood the spirit of the order totally instead of which he had a way of making peace that nature pointed out which gained him pardon by repeating the offense  you are incurable she would tell him at these times and i give you up another time i will lock my door and keep you out  the minutes still rolled on and yet the door was not locked the offense was still committed and the menace though repeated was never executed  what are you musing upon she said one day as he sat rapt in thought  i am reducing days to hours he replied and hours to minutes that i may calculate each fraction of the interval twixt this and monday  add to it another year she cried and you will be nearer to the sum dont talk of monday i will not hear about it  at that moment the porters bell announced an arrival isabella ran to the window and descried doctor sandford coming up to the door  there there she cried you are all together in a plot against me i will not go down to doctor sandford much as i esteem him i will not quit my chamber this whole day i know for what he comes  he comes to bless your henry by entitling him to call the loveliest object in creation his he comes to ratify the vows that i have made to honor love and serve you with my life and what is there so terrible in this that should disturb my isabellas gentle spirits what does the ruler of my passions discern in her devoted henry that she should shrink from with affright command me task me as you will and i will obey so you do not forbid me to adore you and to dote upon you as i do this moment have done ever and to lifes latest period ever must  say isabella are these arms thus pressing thus encircling you bonds that you wish to break chains that you fain would fever and cast from you question my heart it is yours ask if there is mercy in it for my isabella mark if it does not throb with tender pity and compassion for your virgin fears and witness if the drops that fall from it are half so dear as these which your soft eyes distill oh my souls treasure are you not at rest upon this faithful bosom do you not feel a conscious satisfaction thus to know yourself beloved protected cherished by a friend who lives but on your smiles nor has a sense of earthly happiness but what the contemplation of your charms bestows upon him  oh henry she replied and sunk upon his breast i render you my heart and all that it contains even my terrors are fled from me and nothing now remains but allsubduing love your words your looks bespeak such mild consideration for your poor trembling isabella and i well know there is such mercy in your manly nature that i am yours this day this hour this instant and for ever  silence ensued what else their thoughts supplied love found expressions for more eloquent than words the minutes were not few but rated to their value they had outweighed years of common price  isabella now was not averse to welcome her late dreaded visitor the worthy doctor sandford  severed from the arms of her enraptured henry with love in every glance and grace in every motion she came forth in beautys richest bloom a form to charm all eyes and captivate all hearts  every body was occupied in preparations for the approaching journey great as was the sacrifice sir roger made to the peace of the county when he took upon himself the painful duty of attending parliament there were some circumstances that qualified the disagreeable necessity at the present moment as he had affairs of great consequence on his hands with respect to isabellas marriage which could only be adjusted in london mr delapoer the father of our hero had also business not less important and agreed to accompany him and a house large enough to receive the whole party and perfectly commodious had fortunately been secured for sir roger and was already well aired and occupied by part of his household sent before him for that purpose his plan was to have the wedding on the morning of his departure and as private as possible the rev mr claypole in a bad state of health was gone to bath and dr sandford had been invited from hagley to perform the ceremony the bride and bridegroom were to take their departure together and reach town that evening sir roger delapoer and sandford were to follow in the family coach by easy stages and sleep by the way  on the morning before these events were to take place henry rode over to crowbery and took a friendly leave of the lord of the castle he had also a parting conversation with mr and mrs williams and the good dame to ezekiel he devoted a full hour which the good man filled up after his manner with admonitory lessons for his conduct in the metropolis that sink as he pronounced it of infamy and corruption ejaculations prayers and blessings in abundance he cordially superadded and at last let him depart with this exhortation  that if affluence and prosperity should await him he would never forget that he had felt the sorrows of poverty and distress but on the contrary if disappointments and misfortunes which heaven avert should prove to be his lot then let him take religion to his aid and place his whole reliance on that allgracious master who never fails his servants in affliction when they piously resort to him  the awful morning arrived and isabella beautiful as an angel and fresh as the dew of heaven rose with the dawn and having attired herself with a simplicity pure as her thoughts and elegant as her manners came forth from her chamber and presented herself to the eyes of her expecting lover he led her down the stairs to the room where her friends were assembled and the rev dr sandford was in readiness to perform the solemn office and pronounce the nuptial benediction which service being closed turning to her father whilst henry yet held her trembling hand she dropped on her knees at his feet and jointly with her husband in the like reverential attitude received his fatherly blessing accompanied with tears of joyful sensibility and tender embraces the same suit was preferred to the father of henry and the same affectionate return was made to it by that amiable person in a style peculiarly impressive and affecting a few old and faithful domestics were admitted and honest zachary cawdle by claim derived from long attachment and services as old in date as the first breath that henry drew was present on the occasion and now in his ardent manner joy boiling over at his eyes pronounced them to be indisputably the most lovely couple that ever plighted their faith to each other  and by the blessing of heaven added he upon their laudable endeavors i predict they will give being to others as beautiful as themselves  they now sat down to a hasty breakfast which being dispatched sir roger again embraced his daughter and then resigning her hand to its happy possessor attended them to the door where their chaise with posthorses was in waiting which whirled them in their rapid course to london where they arrived with happy omens as the evening closed and found all things ready for their reception  the following day the worthy baronet punctual to his appointed hour arrived with his friends mr delapoer and dr sandford the latter of whom took up his abode with a relation at the other end of the town sir roger was well pleased with the airy situation of his house and still more delighted with the unremitted attention of his son and daughter who devoted to him and delapoer all those hours which some bestow on frivolous amusements some on less innocent occupations in the course of their residence here every thing that the sage provision of the law could do for them and their posterity was completed and at sir rogers suit our hero had a grant by royal license to take the name and bear the arms of manstock thus becoming the adopted representative of that ancient and opulent house  when the session was closed and they returned to the family seat at manstock the festivities they had fled from were celebrated with becoming splendour and the hospitable doors were thrown open to their neighbors both rich and poor heaven blessed their days with prosperity and crowned their wishes with a beauteous offspring faithful to ezekiels charge henry never forgot the lessons of adversity nor those faithful friends whom his adversity had tried and approved  to zachary to the house of williams and to ezekiel in his humble cottage he was ever the same grateful cordial and unaltered friend the charge of young blachfords affairs he devolved upon ezekiel with a proper allowance but still under his own superintendance lord crowbery also put the good apostle into certain offices of trust which brought him some profit and what was more grateful to his spirit a situation of some respectability amongst his neighbors williams throve in his profession and susan was not wanting to provide him with those that served to keep his house aside and his industry alert  delapoer retired to his mansion near hagley where he had every year the pleasure of embracing his children when they visited their maternal mansion and property in those parts  if perfect happiness was ever dealt to mortals it was surely the peculiar lot of henry and isabella  domestic harmony that knew no interruption hearts fondly united and tempers happily matched the good will of all who knew them the abundant gifts of fortune and the grateful blessings of the poor compounded their enjoyments meanwhile the beauteous form of isabella never yielded up one fleeting charm to the widewasting hand of time but heaven restored the loss by adding every hour fresh beauties to her mind  finis
