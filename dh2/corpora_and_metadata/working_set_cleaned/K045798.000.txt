de hondt in the strand mdcclxxi  advertisement the eager and almost universal curiosity which the late installation of the knights of the order of the garter excited in the public seemed in a manner to command our attention and justify our endeavors to exhibit a representation of it in the following masque the difficulty was to give an adequate idea in a small compass of the various circumstances of this great solemnity consisting of the installation procession and feast  the late mr gilbert west published some years ago a dramatick poem called the institution of the order of the garter which has been much admired it was however impossible to bring it on the stage as it was originally written because though rich in machinery it was little more than a poem in dialogue without action some select parts of it however with a few necessary alterations and the addition of some comic scenes were thought a proper vehicle for the different ceremonies of this great festival the scene is laid in the reign of edward the third who was the founder of the order after having restored that of the knights of the round table which we have supposed with some writers to be continued at the institution of the garter  no expense has been spared nor we hope any object of attention overlooked which might conduce to make the following masque as short as various and as faithful to the original institution as possible  the songs choruses and serious dialogue are published that they may be better underderstood from the stage the comic parts which are intended merely for the preparation of the principal scenes are not printed as they would lose much of their effect by being separated from the action of the performer  mr west in order to give a greater variety and to introduce some particular characters into his poem has taken as he acknowleges in a note the advantage of a license usually allowed to poets of departing a little from chronology and postponing the institution of the order for a few years  under the sanction of this authority we have ventured to make use of the same poetical license by throwing the institution of the order as many years backward as mr west has brought it forward we have made the black prince nine years younger than he was when he was knighted and we flatter ourselves that this anachronism will be excused for the sake of the application  some other liberties of less consequence are necessarily taken for the sake of rendering the whole more theatrical we have had too long an experience of the public indulgence not to know that they will be readily overlooked should the rest of the performance have the good fortune to be approved  the songs choruses etc in the masque called the institution of the garter after the overture the

chorus hail mighty nation ever famed in war lo heaven descends thy festivals to share celestial bards in living lays shall sing britannias glories and her matchless king  end of the masque the following extracts from seldens titles of honor and ashmoles order of the garter are inserted to show the authority upon which we have founded some part of our installation and so much the rather also because we know by others of our own country that in the selfsame year a solemn and great meeting of knights was appointed by the king at windsor castle for the setting up of his round table there etc  and it seems that out of the plot and purpose of this round table at windsor erected in the same year wherein the order of the new garter was instituted and appointed to be celebrated on st georges day of the same year as we may collect out of froissart also the order itself had chief part at least of its original and the other traditions touching the garter of the queen or of the countess of kent and salisbury may well stand with this thus far that the word and the use of the garter began as the traditions suppose but that the order was raised chiefly out of this of the round table of that time as out of a seminary for the round table was in special use in those ages for the drawing together of the braver knights and ladies etc  froissart likewise says et ordonna edward the third que dan en an le jour saint gregore sen feroit la feste dedans le chateau de vindesore le quell chateau le roy artur avoit fait fair autreffois edifier et in icelui tenir la noble table ronde etc  seldom edit      page     king edward the third having designed to restore the honor of the round table held a just at windsor in the   th year of his reign but there is an old manuscript chronicle that has these words king edward in his   th year begun his round table and ordained the day annually to be kept there at whitsuntide and this meeting in truth occasioned the foundation of the most noble order of the garter as shall be noted by and by  ashmole edit      page    he edward the third did thereupon first design as being invited thereto by its ancient fame the restoration of king arthurs round table which he exhibited with magnificent hastiludes and general justs to invite hither the gallant and active spirits from abroad and upon discovery of their courage and ability in the exercise of arms to draw them to his party and oblige them to himself  though king edward so far advanced the honor of a garter as that the order did derive its title and denomination from it yet it is most evident that he founded this more famous order not to give reputation to or perpetuate an effeminate occasion but to adorn martial virtue with honor rewards and splendour to increase virtue and valor in the hearts of his nobility or as andrew du chesne says to honor military virtue with some glorious favors and rewards that so true nobility as is noted in the preface to the black book of the order after long and hazardous adventures should not enviously be deprived of that honor which it has really deserved and that active and hardy youth might not want a spur in the profession of virtue which is to be esteemed glorious and eternal  upon these grounds no doubt does our learned seldom affirm that this order was raised chiefly out of the round table of that time the knights thereof being in the flower of that age as out of a seminary  ashmole page     finis
