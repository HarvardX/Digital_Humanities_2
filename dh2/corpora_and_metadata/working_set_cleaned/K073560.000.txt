speech of mr sheridan in the house of commons on friday the   st of april      on the motion to address his majesty on the present alarming state of affairs mr sheridan rose and said i trust sir that it will be impossible for any man who views the situation of the country at this moment to conceive that i rise to oppose any part of the present address undoubtedly if i had been present upon a former occasion when the right honorable and learned gentleman brought in his bill for the better defense of the country though i might have excepted to particular passages i should certainly have given it my most cordial and zealous support and in doing so i beg to have it understood that in the main points of it i do not consider it as having conferred any new powers upon the crown sir i trust there is no man who does not know that in cases of peril out of the ordinary course and contemplation of the law the king is armed with full powers to call out the whole energy of the kingdom in domestic outrages this is in the power of a common constable undoubtedly then it is not supposed by the constitution that in the danger and apprehension of a foreign invasion the king is to be a mere looker on in that respect therefore i think that whatever service any man may give he will do no more than he is bound by his allegiance to do but what i wish superadded to this is to see a superior zeal to animate the country a zeal which it is not in the power of any minister to call forth  sir in times like these a common spirit will not do and when i say that i wish to see a superior spirit animate the country i rejoice to say that i do see it rising yet at the same time i must also say that there is a sort of supineness and apathy i admit which i hope and trust this house will supply all society is interested in the subject of an invasion it is a topic of universal conversation and curiosity but really there are those who consider it as a strange phenomenon which they may wonder at but which they have no business with they seem to wait for it as a show rather than dread it as a peril and sir this does not proceed from dissaffection or disloyalty from want of good will or from attachment to the enemy much less does it proceed from any sullenness or resentment of wrongs and injuries which they may feel but from a sort of supineness and apathy which makes them not sufficiently alive and awake to the real danger that surrounds us sir symptoms of this supineness appeared i am sorry to say in the voluntary subscriptions i confess for one that i was a friend to that measure and i hope the house will not think it arises from any vanity that i call their attention to the motion which i then made  i moved sir after having recommended the voluntary subscriptions without any bill in order to give the country an opportunity for doing this for giving a practical pledge for showing that upon this one subject at least they would be unanimous and cordial i moved sir the suspension of the assessed tax bill for one month i should be sorry indeed that any men who had voted with me upon that question should afterward revile the measure as a begging box for what sort of consistency would mine be of recommending the suspension of the assessed tax bill if i should immediately turn back and call it a begging box of the ministers  i should be sorry i say to think that any such language should have been made use of i wished the measure of voluntary contributions to be tried without the bill because i wished it as a practical pledge and proof of the zeal and spirit of the country at present however no inference is to be made from the names of persons who contributed to the assessed taxed not appearing in that list  sir with regard to that apathy and supineness i have not the slightest idea but that immediately upon the appearance of real danger it would disappear but there is much in previous preparation not merely as to discipline and defense but in the prompt avowal of the determination of the country sir i have no doubt that the first drop of british blood that shall be shed by frenchmen on british ground will raise such a spirit of valouros fury as must be invincible and irresistible an universal cry of hear hear  but gentlemen have not sufficiently calculated what the effects would be of any successful impression of french force upon the country sir without retracting any one opinion which i have ever held i do not conceive that there ever was any period of our history in which the conquest of the kingdom by a foreign power would bring such total ruin upon it as the conquest of great britain by the present french republic  sir though deprecating the calamities to which the republic has given rise i never wished the restoration of monarchy in france i am not rejoicing that france has attained such power that she arrived at it by the coalition of the powers of europe against her and that if she had been suffered to remain as she was she would not have attained that power but i am saying that the impression of french force now would be more fatal than at any former period of our history yet when i assert that i still hold my opinions perhaps the right honorable gentleman may not think this observation well placed but i do think that if the unfortunate person who may be entitled to the crown of france should from a general spirit of loyalty in the country and by a restoration as little expected as our own in the time of charles the second be raised to the throne and the emigrants who had suffered most by the revolution were to be called back i say sir i do not believe that it would abate one atom of the ambition of france or induce her to give back one particle of her power i do not believe that her councils though composed of persons who had been most encouraged and protected in other countries would relinquish one conquest achieved by the republic would give up one inch of the boundary of the rhine withdraw one man from italy abandon an acre of the low countries or above all depart from the principle of doing every thing to wrest the sovereignty of the seas from great britain though i dread the republic of france i should not dread less the monarchy of france and in speaking of the republic i beg not to be understood as a person mixing in that spirit of personality and invective which has been adopted and which i must express my regret at seeing continued in a clause of a bill which has lately passed  sir when we have been asking for peace with the government of france i do not think it wise to charge them with cruelty injustice and oppression equally too should i reprobate any idea of animating the country by the coarse expressions of monster hoche and ruffian general which have been imputed to a person in a high situation in another country sir instead of resorting to such expressions i would on the contrary pay the french a solid and sincere compliment and i will tell you what that compliment should be by knowing what they have done and judging what they are capable of i would omit no one human preparation that might enable us to make a successful resistance to the utmost their daring could attempt that is the compliment i would pay them  that is the way i would meet them it is not in any mortal power to say they shall not subdue us but at least we may take care they shall not despise us sir if i were to allude to bounaparte i would not recur to such invective i would neither call him monster nor a ruffian  he is certainly a great man and if he takes the command of the expedition against this country he will not tarnish his laurels by deserving those epithets but i would at least distrust his professions  right restored freedom regained peace to commerce peace to cottages he will come for the humane and liberal purpose of establishing liberty can any thing be more glorious i had almost said more godlike than this but is there any englishman so absurd so besotted and befooled as to give credit to one word of it but may not republics be actuated by great and generous sentiments undoubtedly they may but i must first look to the nature and constitution of those republics  in the early and virtuous times of rome they did conquer for glory and to restore to people their rights in the spartan republic too i can conceive the same and that they might conquer for fame and not for the acquisition of those luxuries which they considered as inimical to the republican spirit but let gentleman look to the constitution and practice of the republic of france do they not see that their tree of liberty is planted in the garden of monarchy and that it bears the same luxuriant fruit are they not eager for all the luxuries and refinements to make their capital the school and mart of elegance for the world what do they want glory they are gorged with it territory they have more perhaps than they will be able to retain what is it they want ships commerce manufactures cash capital and credit or in other words they only want the finews bones marrow and heartsblood of great britain   loud and universal cries of hear hear accompanied with clapping of hands give them that and they will give you as much liberty in return as you please they call you a nation of merchants well they style you so by way of derision but at least in dealing with them for their commodity i should deal as merchants indeed as merchants give no trust to the mere name of a commodity but are apt to enquire into the reality of the article no i would have our political merchants just ask whether the liberty they have for foreign exportation is or is not different from what they keep for their own home consumption on this ground alone the barter must proceed   laughter hear hear but sir look to what must be the policy of the french we know how little real liberty they have at home  i will not take upon myself to judge how far in a revolutionary state these measures may or may not be necessary i am willing to grant that if the men are entrusted with the will of the majority of france whose desire is that france shall be a republic they must do that which is requisite to fulfill that end but then sir without throwing any blame on those men i would ask whether they would let us have more liberty in england than they possess in france would they leave us unimpared the important right of the trial by jury would they  in short sir would they leave this country to be a contrast to the violence practiced in france and to be an eternal and marked reproach to the conduct of the directory no they would be madmen if they did  well sir after having considered what would be their policy we must look to another motive we must consider the nature of their enmity again i will avoid saying any thing harsh upon the provocations given them i will do nothing but regret the personalities that have been used both individually and generally i purposely refrain from all comments but that we have provoked and insulted them beyond human patience is the fact i will not now discuss whether we were the aggressors or not but the more i think we were so  the more i think we indulged in personalities  the more must i give them credit for the sincerity of their revenge against this country will any man believe that vengeance would be discriminating or moderate sir with this view of the consequences of any successful impression upon the part of the french unquestionably the next consideration is what measures are necessary to ensure a successful resistance  without asking any person to lay aside animosities to government who i should trust have too much spirit to steal an indemnity from those who may arraign their conduct i think it should be manifested throughout the country that upon this point of resisting the enemy there is but one heart and one opinion if i should hear persons say we would do every thing to oppose the french but how can we do it without supporting ministers i would say i cannot stop to discuss that point now  i will oppose the french first and then i will talk with you upon it if there are persons who assert that they who brought us into this situation ought to bring us out of it i should reply that i do not object to their logic but i object a good deal to their prudence because if they say that our present situation is owing to the incapacity of his majestys ministers and if they wish to resist the french they must be sure that the french will be foiled and in that case they do not believe in the incapacity of ministers or if they do believe in their incapacity they are not sincere in wishing the french to be resisted  there are gentlemen who are decidedly adverse to the french yet they will not come with their whole zeal against them they measure off so much of their enmity to the french against so much of their enmity to ministers they say they feel great grievances against the present government and yet that they think a french invasion the worst of all evils that can befall the country if such men do not think it necessary to do their utmost to resist that evil they have no more common sense than they who think the present to be the best of all possible governments sir it is childish in any person to say that they will wait till the french have effected a landing in gods name if the enemy are to be resisted let us do it effectually it is no part of effectual resistance that the mind of the country should be manifested and the preparations be prompt sir to say that we will not pledge ourselves but in the last extremity is pledging ourselves only to a modified opposition and to a diluted spirit it is lending the left arm to our country but saying that we reserve the right  it is taking the field with a pistol but declaring to go the length of a musket on these grounds it is that i wish to behold a higher zeal manifested than at present seems to pervade the country though i confess i see such a zeal rising and at the same time when i wish to see private party give way to public duty i must also hope that the same principle will influence the conduct of government and that whoever offers his services in whatever rank or situation he may offer them they shall be joyfully accepted services from the highest station have been offered and from the most gallant and approved officers  sir i will not mark more strongly what i have alluded to and i hope no person will find it necessary to recur to the observation there are many matters of detail connected with this measure to which undoubtedly ministers will turn their minds without making large masses of idle men there are great bodies who might produce a considerable force to these the attention of government should be immediately directed it is idle to see persons asking what will become of us with two hulking fellows behind their coaches there is sir another description of persons who i am conscious do not want spirit but the idea has not yet occurred to them whom i should be glad to see employed in another way i mean those young gentlemen of high rank who pass their time in forageing the fruit shops in patrolling bondstreet and piccadilly previous to their taking the field in rottenrow sir i am not saying that indulgence in these luxuries is to be condemned nor will any one suspect me i believe of being a too rigid censor no man is more disposed to give credit to those persons and sure i am that in the hour of peril they will be seen at their posts and not found to be dependant emigrants  and now sir with every desire to see the most vigorous preparations made to resist the enemy i must yet hope that the enemy not being landed undoubtedly the desire for peace so far from being checked will be more manifest and eager sir i have no hesitation in saying though it looks but in reality does not detract from our means that the real deathblow to this country will not come from the arms of france but from the utter impossibility if the present scale of expense is to be persevered in of collecting the burdens from the people yet if it be necessary we must show the enemy for their ruin whatever they may boast to the contrary would infallibly follow ours that we can if they destroy our resources be as desperate as they but the real fire and sword which i fear will alone lay waste the british empire is to be found in the pen and tongue of the british chancellor of the exchequer in that pen and tongue whose eloquence great as undoubtedly it is furnishes pretexts to the house to adopt all his measures i have said thus much in order that no preparations however vigorous no confidences however great in his resources may deter his majestys minister from concluding peace excepting only in one situation and in that one much as i wish for peace yet i would have any minister unless under circumstances which i will not allude to beware how he treats for peace with a french army landed in this country and in arms that would indeed break the spirit and heart of the country we might get rid of the enemy for a week or two but the wound would be mortal we should break the heart of the navy for ever  loud cries of hear hear from every part of the house  i am glad to see that i need not press the point more  with regard to the principles upon which i would recommend unanimity i hope and trust no man will understand that i mean to recommend a jobbing shifting union with the present administration  no sir no  there are sins on this subject which i will not now reproach but which i never shall forget the unanimity i wish is against the french and it is the only unanimity which can be successful i do say that all public spirit all confidence in public men has been more discouraged and crushed by those who lest the whig party under the pretense of assisting the cause of religion and morality than by any men that ever lived and here i must do the right honorable gentleman and his friends the justice to say that i have not discovered such a rage and eagerness for pensions and emoluments in them as in those who joined the standard of religion morality and civil society these beyond all other men should endeavor to repair the injury they have done when therefore i speak of union i mean prompt and vigorous union against the french  eternal separation from his majestys ministers we must have no more coalitions the country is tired of and abhors them men talk of the mischief of party disputes but i say sir that late party reconciliations have done more to break the spirit of the people than all the party enmity that ever existed i think at the same time that it is not necessary if the people are properly roused to a sense of their situation that they should look to the lead which this or that man may give them no man thinks higher of the head and heart the soul and spirit of my right hon friend than i do he i am sure as much as any man looks with abhorrence at the attempts of the enemy that these are his sentiments i have no doubt but i say that looking after men does not become the spirit of the people in times like these  when i am told that in a country of eight millions of men enlightened as they are and who have so long enjoyed liberty subject now undoubtedly to restrictions when i am told i say that there are only one or two men who can save it my answer is that may be the case but that the country is not worth saving and cannot be saved some there are who may think the right hon gentleman opposite to me others my right honorable friend and some that a noble earl for whom certainly i have a high respect are the fittest persons to save the country but will any man tell me that there are only two or three men who can do it i say if they do tell me so i repeat that it is not worth being saved and cannot be saved sir refer it to the people themselves ask them what they will do i dont want a return of legs and arms but give me a return of the heart and spirit of the country and i will tell you then whether it can be conquered nay if all the great men were banished from the country i do not believe that it could be hustled out of its station and importance there would then i have no doubt be found men capable of preserving it  sir i am ashamed to say a few words upon one subject but we are speaking in shabby times and i may therefore be excused i think it right for myself to say though i am not such a coxcomb as to hint that i was ever tempted and gentlemen may rise and do me the justice to suppose i act from principle but speaking in suspicious times i think it right sir to declare that my political enmity is irreconcilable to the present administration separately and collectively personal enmity i have none that my attachment to my right honorable friend is unalterable that my determination to persist in procuring reform is unshaken that it is the greatest security we can have and that the time i trust will yet come for calling his majestys ministers to account for their conduct these are the pledges which i feel it necessary to give and by which i wish to be tried  but i must say that i should think myself the meanest of mankind if from preference to party praise from enmity to the right hon gentleman from prejudice to friends and above all if from a base and unmanly fear of bringing myself into a situation of peril i should refrain from doing every thing with my whole heart and soul to resist the worst calamity that could befall the country  sir upon this ground i think it right to call upon all persons upon those who have profited by the war for what in others would be patriotism in them is duty i call upon the personal friends of the right hon gentleman who value his safety i call upon those who are friends to parliamentary reform and of whom it has been said that they used it only as a pretense and stalkinghorse for treason i call upon them to show that they have been libelled i call upon those who have pledged themselves to bring his majestys ministers to account to prove that they are worthy of that important office  sir i trust i need not say that this and every measure which tends to provide resistance against the enemy and a remedy to the danger which surround us shall have my warmest and most cordial support  finis
