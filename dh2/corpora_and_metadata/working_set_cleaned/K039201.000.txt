lewis baboon turned honest and john bull politician being the fourth part of law is a bottomlesspit  printed from a manuscript found in the cabinet of the famous sir humphry polesworth and published as well as the three former parts and appendix by the author of the new atalantis  london printed for john morphew near stationers hall      price  d  the preface when i was first called to the office of historiographer to john bull he expressed himself to this purpose sir humphry i know you are a plain dealer it is for that reason i have chosen you for this important trust speak the truth and spare not that i might fulfill those his honorable intentions i obtained leave to repair to and attend him in his most secret retirements and i put the journals of all transactions into a strong box to be opened at a fitting occasion after the manner of the historiographers of some eastern monarchs this i thought was the safest way though i declare i was never afraid to be chopped by my master for telling of truth it is from those journals that my memoirs are compiled therefore let not posterity a thousand years hence look for truth in the voluminous annals of pedants who are entirely ignorant of the secret springs of great actions if they do let me tell them they will be nebusd with incredible pains have i endeavored to copy the several beauties of the ancient and modern historians the impartial temper of herodotus the gravity austerity and strict morals of thucidides the extensive knowledge of xenophon the sublimity and grandeur of titus livius and to avoid the careless style of polybius i have borrowed considerable ornaments from dionysius halicarnasseus and diodorus siculus the specious gilding of tacitus i endeavored to shun mariana davila and fra paulo are those amongst the moderns whom i thought most worthy of imitation but i cannot be so disingenuous as not to own the infinite obligations i have to the pilgrims progress of john bunyan and the tenter belly of the reverend joseph hall from such encouragement and helps it is easy to guess to what a degree of perfection i might have brought this great work had it not been nipd in the bud by some illiterate people in both houses of parliament who envying the great figure i was to make in future ages under pretense of raising money for the war have padlockd all those very pens that were to celebrato the actions of their heroes by silencing at once the whole university of grubstreet i am persuaded that nothing but the prospect of an approaching peace could have encouraged them to make so bold a step but suffer me in the name of the rest of the matriculates of that famous university to ask them some plain questions do they think that peace will bring along with it the golden age will there be never a dyingspeech of a traitor are cethegus and cataline turned so tame that there will be no opportunity to cry about the streets  dangerous plot will peace bring such plenty that no gentleman will have occasion to go upon the highway or break into a house i am sorry that the world should be so much imposed upon by the dreams of a false prophet as to imagine the millennium is at hand o grubstreet thou fruitful nursery of towering geniuss how do i lament thy downfall thy ruin could never be meditated by any who means well to english liberty no modern lycaeum will ever equal thy glory whether in soft pasiorals thou sung the flames of pampered apprentices and coy cookmaids or mournful ditties of departing lovers or if to maeonian sirains thou raised thy voice to record the stratageies the arduous exploits and the nocturnal scalade of needy heroes the terror of your peaceful citizen describing the powerful betty or the artful picklock or the secret caverns and grottos of vulcan sweating at his forge and slamping the queens image on viler metals which he retails for beef and pots of ale or if thou were content in simple narrative to relate the cruel acts of implacable revenge or the complaints of ravished virgins blushing to tell their adventure before the listening crowd of city damsels whilst in thy faithful history thou intermingles the gravest counsels and the purest morals nor less acute and piercing were thou in thy search and pompous description of the works of nature whether in proper and emphatick terms thou did paint the blazing comets fiery tale the stupendous force of dreadful thunder and earthquakes and the unrelenting inundations sometimes with machiavelian sagacity thou unravellest the intrigues of state and the traitorous conspiracies of rebels giving wise counsel to monarchs how did thou move our terror and our pity with thy passionate scenes between jackcatch and the heroes of the old bailey how did thou describe their intrepid march up holbornhill nor did thou shine less in thy theological capacity when thou gave ghostly counsel to dying felons and recorded the guilty pangs of sabbath breakers how will the noble arts of john overtons painting and sculpture now languish where rich invention proper expression correct design divine altitudes and artful contrast heightened with the beauties of clarobscur embellished thy celebrated pieces to the delight and astonishment of the judicious multitude adieu persuasive eloquence the quaint metaphor the poinant irony the proper epithet and the lively simile are fled to burleigh on the hill instead of these we shall have i know not what  vid bp of st asap preface the illiterate will tell the rest with pleasure i hope the reader will excuse the digression due by way of condolance to my worthy brethren of grubstreet for the approaching barbarity that is likely to overspread all its regions by this oppressive and exorbitant tax it has been my good fortune to receive my education there and so long as i preserved some figure and rank amongst the learned of that society i scorned to take my degree either at utrecht or leyden though i was offered it gratis by the professors there  the contents chap i the sequel of the history of the meeting at the salutation page   chap ii how john bull and nic frog settled their accounts p   chap iii how john bull found

of the history of the meeting at the salutation  where i think i left john bull sitting between nic frog and lewis baboon with his arms akimbo in great concern to keep lewis and nic asunder as watchful as he was nic found the means now and then to stear a whisper and by a cleanly conveyance under the table to slip a short note into lewiss hand which lewis as slyly put into johns pocket with a pinch or a jog to warn him what he was about john had the curiosity to retire into a corner to peruse these billet deux of nics wherein he found that nic had used great freedoms both with his interest and reputation one contained these words dear lewis thou see clearly that this blockhead can never bring his matters to bear let thee and me talk to night by our selves at the rose and i will give thee satisfaction another was thus expressed friend lewis has thy sense quite forsaken thee to make bull such offers hold fast part with nothing and i will give thee a better bargain i will warrant thee  in some of his billets he told lewis that john bull was under his guardianship that the best part of his servants were at his command that he could have john gagged and bound whenever he pleased by the people of his own family in all these epistles blockhead dunce ass coxcomb were the best epithets he gave poor john in others he threatened that he esquire south and the rest of the tradesmen would lay lewis down upon his back beat out his teeth if he did not retire immediately and break up the meeting  i fancy i need not tell my reader that john often changed color as he read and that his fingers itchd to give nic a good slap on the chops but he wisely moderated his choleric temper i saved this fellow quoth he from the gallows when he ran away from his last master because i thought he was harshly treated but the rogue was no fooner safe under my protection than he began to lie pilfer and steal like the devil when i first set him up in a warm house he had hardly put up his sign when he began to debauch my best customers from me then it was his constant practice to rob my fish ponds not only to feed his family but to trade with the fishmongers i connived at the fellow till he began to tell me that they were his as much as mine in my manor of eastcheap because it lay at some distance from my constant inspection he broke down my fences robbed my orchards and beat my servants when i used to reprimand him for his tricks he would talk saucily lie and brazen it out as if he had done nothing amiss will nothing cure thee of thy pranks nic quoth i i shall be forced some time or another to chastise thee the rogue got up his cane and threatened me and was well thwackd for his pains but i think his behavior at this time worst of all after i have almost drowned my self to keep his head above water he would leave me sticking in the mud trusting to his goodness to help me out after i have beggared my self with his troublesome lawsuit with a pox to him he takes it in mighty dudgeon because i have brought him here to end matters amicably and because i will not let him make me over by deed and indenture as his lawful cully which to my certain knowledge he has attempted several times but after all can thou gather grapes from thorns nic does not pretend to be a gentleman he is a tradesman a selfseeking wretch but how came thou to bear all this john the reason is plain thou conferrest the benefits and he receives them the first produces love and the last ingratitude ah nic nic thou art a damned dog that is certain thou know too well that i will take care of thee else thou would not use me thus i will not give thee up it is true but as true as it is thou shall not sell me according to thy laudable customwhile john was deep in this soliloquy nic broke out into the following protestation  gentlemen i believe every body here present will allow me to be a very just and disinterested person my friend john bull here is very angry with me forsooth because i will not agree to his foolish bargains now i declare to all mankind i should be ready to sacrifice my own concerns to his quiet but the care of his interest and that of the honest tradesmen that are embarked with us keeps me from entering into this composition what shall become of those poor creatures the thoughts of their impending ruin disturbs my nights rest therefore i desire they may speak for themselves if they are willing to give up this affair i shall not make two words of it   john bull begged him to lay aside that immoderate concern for him and withal put him in mind that the interest of those tradesmen had not sat quite so heavy upon him some years ago on a like occasion nic answered little to that but immediately pulled out a boatswains whistle upon the first whiff the tradesmen came jumping into the room and began to surround lewis like so many yelping curs about a great boar or to use a modester simile like duns at a great lords leve the morning he goes into the country one pulled him by the sleeve another by the skirt a third hallowed in his ear they began to ask him for all that had been taken from their forefathers by stealth fraud force or lawful purchase some asked for manours others for acres that lay convenient for them that he would pull down his fences level his ditches all agreed in one common demand that he should be purged sweated vomited and starved till be came to a sizeable bulk like that of his neighbors one modestly asked him leave to call him brother nic frog demanded two things to be his porter and his fishmonger to keep the keys of his gates and furnish his kitchen johns sister peg only desired that he would let his servants sing psalms a sundays some descended even to the asking of old clothes shoes and boots broken bottles tobaccopipes and ends of candles  monsieur bull quoth lewis you seem to be a man of some breeding for gods sake use your interest with these messicurs that they would speak but one at once for if one had a hundred pair of hands and as many tongues he cannot satisfy them all at this rate john begged they might proceed with some method then they stopped all of a sudden and would not say a word if this be your play quoth john that we may not be like a quakers dumb meeting let us begin some diversion what do you think of roulypouly or a countrydance what if we should have a match at football i am sure we shall never end matters at this rate  chap ii how john bull and nic frog settled their accounts  j bull dvring this general cessation of talk what if you and i nic should enquire how moneymatters stand between us   nic frog with all my heart i love exact dealing and let hocus audit he knows how the money was disbursd   j bull i am not much for that at present well settle it between ourselves fair and square nic keeps friends together there have been laid out in this lawsuit at one time   000 pounds and  0000 crowns in some cases i in others you bear the greatest proportion   nic right i pay three fifths of the greatest number and you pay two thirds of the lesser number i think this is fair and square as you call it   john well go on   nic two thirds of   000 pounds are   000 pounds for your share and there remains   000 for mine again of the  0000 crowns i pay   000 which is three fifths and you pay only   000 which is two fifths   000 crowns make  000 pounds and   000 crowns make  000 pounds   000 and  000 make   000   000 and  000 makes   000 so there are   000 pounds to my share of the expenses and   000 to yours   after nic had bambouzled john a while about the   000 and the   000 john called for counters but what with slight of hand and taking from his own score and adding to johns nic brought the balance always on his own side  j bull nay good friend nic though i am not quite so nimble in the fingers i understand cyphering as well as you i will produce you my accounts one by one fairly writ out of my own books and here i begin with the first you must excuse me if i dont pronounce the law terms right  john reads l s d fees to the lord chapter justice and other judges by way of dividend  00  0 0  fees to puny judges  0 00 00 to esquire south for post terminums  00  0 0  to ditto for non est factums  00 00 00 to ditto for discontinuance noli prosequi and retraxit  0  0 0  to ditto for a non omittas and filing a

computandum  00  0 0  to frogs new tenants per account to hocus for audita querelas  00 00 00 on the said account for writs of ejectment and destringas  00 00 00 to esquire souths quota for a return of a non est invent and nulla habet bona   0  0 00 to  for a pardon in forma pauperis  00 00 00 to jack for a melius inquirendum upon a felo de se  00 00 00 to don diego for a defecit  0 00 00 to

his bill out of his pocket and began to read  nicholas frogs account remains to be deducted out of the former account l s d to hocus for entries of a rege inconsulto  00 00 00 to john bulls nephew for a venire facias the money not yet all laid out  00 00 00 the coachhire for my wife and family and the carriage of my goods during the time of this lawsuit  00  0 0  for the extraordinary expenses of

believe i paid for diegos defecit   john bull as for your venire facias i have paid you for one already in the other i believe you will be nonsuited i will take care of my nephew my self your coachhire and family charges are most unreasonable deductions at that rate i can bring in any man in the world my debtor but who the devil are those two majors that consume all my money i find they always run away with the balance in all accounts   nic frog two very honest gentlemen i assure you that have done me some service  to tell you plainly major ab denotes thy greater ability and major will thy greater willingness to carry on this lawsuit it was but reasonable thou should pay both for thy power and thy positiveness   j bull i believe i shall have those two honest majors discount on my side in a little time   nic frog why all this higgling with thy friend about such a paltry sum does this become the generosity of the noble and rich john bull i wonder thou art not ashamed oh hocus hocus where art thou it used to go anotherguess manner in thy time when a poor man has almost undone himself for thy sake thou art for fleecing him and fleecing him is that thy conscience john   j bull very pleasant indeed it is well known thou retains thy lawyers by the year so a fresh lawsuit adds but little to thy expense they are thy customers i hardly ever sell them a farthings worth of any thing nay thou have set up an eatinghouse where the whole tribe of them spend all they can rap or run if it were well reckoned i believe thou gets more of my money than thou spends of thy own however if thou will needs plead poverty own at least that thy accounts are false   nic frog no marry will not i i refer my self to these honest gentlemen let them judge between us let esquire south speak his mind whither my accounts are not right and whither we ought not to go on with our lawsuit   j bull consult the butchers about keeping of lent i tell you once for all john bull knows where his shoe pinches none of your esquires shall give him the law as long as he wears this trusty weapon by his side or has an inch of broad cloth in his shop   nic frog why there it is you will be both judge and party i am sorry thou discoverest so much of thy headstrong humor before these strange gentlemen i have often told you that it would prove thy ruin some time or another   john saw clearly he should have nothing but wrangling and that he should have as little success in settling his accounts as ending the composition since they will needs overload my shoulders quoth john i shall throw down the burden with a squash amongst them take it up who dares a man has a fine time of it amongst a combination of sharpers that vouch for one another honesty john look to thy self old lewis makes reasonable offers when thou have spent the small pittance that is left thou will make a glorious figure when thou art brought to live upon nic frog and esquire souths generosity and gratitude if they use thee thus when they want thee what will they do when thou wants them i say again john look to thy self  john wisely stiffled his resentments and told the company that in a little time he should give them law or something better  all law law sir by all means what is twenty two poor years toward the finishing a lawsuit for the love of god more law sir   j bull prepare your demands how mamany years more of law you want that i may order my affairs accordingly in the mean while farewell   chap iii how john bull found all his family in an vproar at home  nic frog who thought of nothing but carrying john to the market and there disposing of him as his own proper goods was mad to find that john thought himself now of age to look afer his own affairs he resolved to traverse this new project and to make him uneasy in his own family he had corrupted or desuded most of his servants into the extravagantest conceits in the world that their master was run mad and wore a dagger in one pocket and poison in the other that he had told his wife and children to lewis disinherited his heir and was going to settle his estate upon a parish boy that if they did not look after their master he would do some very mischievous thing when john came home he found a more surprising scene than any he had yet met with and that you will say was somewhat extraordinary  he called his cookmaid betty to bespeak his dinner betty told him that she begged his pardon she could not dress dinner till she knew what he intended to do with his will why betty forsooth quoth john thou art not run mad art thou my will at present is to have dinner that may be quoth betty but my conscience will not allow me to dress it till i know whither you intend to do righteous things by your heir i am sorry for that betty quoth john i must find some body else then then he called john the barber before i begin quoth john i hope your honor will not be offended if i ask you whither you intend to after your will if you will not give me a positive answer your beard may grow down to your middle for me i gad and so it shall quoth bull for i will never trust my throat in such a mad fellows hands where is dick the butler look ye quoth dick i am very willing to serve you in my calling do you see but there are strange reports and plaindealing is best do you see i must be satisfied if you intend to leave all to your nephew and if nic frog is still your executor do you see if you will not satisfy me as to these points do you see you may drink with the ducks and so i will quoth john rather than keep a butler that loves my heir better than my self hob the shoemaker and pricket the tailor told him they would most willingly serve him in their several stations if he would promise them never to talk with lewis baboon and let nicolas frog linnendraper manage his concerns that they could neither make shoes nor clothes to any that were not in good correspondence with their worthy friend nicolas  j bull call andrew my journeyman how goes affairs andrew i hope the devil has not taken possession of thy body too   andrew no sir i only desire to know what you would do if you were dead   j bull just as other dead folks do andrew this is amazing aside   andrew i mean if your nephew shall inherit your estate   j bull that depends upon himself i shall do nothing to hinder him   andrew but will you make it sure   j bull thou mean that i should put him in possession for i can make it no surer without that he has all the law can give him   andrew indeed possession as you say would make it much surer they say it is eleven points of the law   john began now to think that they were all enchanted he enquires about the age of the moon if nic had not given them some intoxicating potion or if old mother jenisa was not still alive no of my faith quoth harry i believe there is no potion in the case but a little aurum potabile you will have more of this by and by he had scarce spoke the word when of a sudden don diego followed by a great multitude of his tenants and workmen came rushing into the room  d diego since those worthy persons who are as much concerned for your safety as i am have employed me as their orator i desire to know whither you will have it by way of syllogism enthymem dilemma or sorites   john now began to be diverted with their extravagance  j bull let us have a sorites by all means though they are all new to me   d diego it is evident to all that are versed in history that there were two sisters that played the whore two thousand years ago therefore it plainly follows that it is not lawful for john bull to have any manner of intercourse with lewis baboon if it is not lawful for john bull to have any manner of intercourse correspondence if you will that is much the same thing then a fortiori it is much more unlawful for the said john to make over his wife and children to the said lewis if his wife and children are not to be made over he is not to wear a dagger and ratsbane in his pockets if he wears a dagger and ratsbane it must be to do mischief to himself or some body else if he intends to do mischief he ought to be under guardians and there is none so fit as my self and some other worthy persons who have a commission for that purpose from nic frog the executor of his will and testament   j bull and this is your sorites you say with that he snatched a good tough oaken cudgel and began to brandish it then happy was the man that was first at the door crouding to get out they tumbled down stairs and it is credibly reported some of them dropped very valuable things in the hurry which were picked up by others of the family   that any of these rogues quoth john should imagine i am not as much concerned as they about having my affairs in a settled condition or that i would wrong my heir for i know not what well nic i really cannot but applaud thy diligence i must own this is really a pretty sort of a trick but it shall not do thy business for all that  chap iv how lewis baboon came to visit john bull and what passed between them  i think it is but ingenuous to acquaint the reader that this chapter was not wrote by sir humphry himself but by another very able pen of the university of grubstreet  john had by some good instructions that was given him by sir roger got the better of his choleric temper and wrought himself up to a great steadiness of mind to pursue his own interest through all impediments that were thrown in the way he began to leave off some of his old aquaintance his roaring and bullying about the streets he put on a serious air knit his brows and for the time had made a very considerable progress in politics considering that he had been kept a stranger to his own affairs however he could not help discovering some remains of his nature when he happened to meet with a football or a match at cricket for which sir roger was sure to take him to task john was walking about his room with folded arms and a most thoughtful countenance his servant brought him word that one lewis baboon below wanted to speak with him john had got an impression that lewis was so deadly a cunning man that he was afraid to venture himself alone with him at last he took heart of grace let him come up quoth he it is but sticking to my point and he can never overreach me  lewis baboon monsieur bull i will frankly acknowledge that my behavior to my neighbors has been somewhat uncivil and i believe you will readily grant me that i have met with usage accordingly i was fond of backsword and cudgel play from my youth and i now bear in my body many a black and blue gash and scars god knows i had as good a warehouse and as fair possessions as any of my neighbors though i say it but a contentious temper flattering servants and unfortunate stars have brought me into circumstances that are not unknown to you these my misfortunes are heightened by domestic calamities that i need not relate i am a poor old battered fellow and i would willingly end my days in peace but alas i see but small hopes of that for every new circumstance affords an argument to my enemies to pursue their revenge formerly i was to be banged because i was too strong and now because i am too weak to resist i am to be brought down when too rich and oppressed when too poor nic frog has used me like a scoundrel you are a gentleman and i freely put my self in your hands to dispose of me as you think fit   j bull look you master baboon as to your usage of your neighbors you had best not dwell too much upon that chapter let it suffice at present that you have been met with you have been rolling a great stone uphill all your life and at last it has come tumbling down till it is like to crush you to pieces plaindealing is best if you have any particular mark mr baboon whereby one may know when you fib and when you speak truth you had best tell it me that one may proceed accordingly but since at present i know of none such it is better that you should trust me than that i should trust you   l baboon i know of no particular mark of veracity amongst us tradesmen but interest and it is manifestly mine not to deceive you at this time you may safely trust me i can assure you   j bull the trust i give is in short this i must have something in hand before i make the bargain and the rest before it is concluded   l baboon to show you i deal fairly name your something   j bull i need not tell thee old boy thou can guess   l baboon ecclesdown castle i will warrant you because it has been formerly in your family say no more you shall have it   j bull i shall have it to mown self   l baboon to thy nown self   j bull every wall gate room and inch of ecclesdown castle you say   l baboon just so   j bull every single stone of ecclesdown castle to mown self speedily   l baboon when you please what needs more words   j bull but tell me old boy have thou laid aside all thy equivocals and mentals in this case   l baboon there is nothing like matter of fact seeing is believing   j bull now thou talk to the purpose let us shake hands old boy let me ask thee one question more what have thou to do to meddle with the affairs of my family to dispose of my estate old boy   l baboon just as much as you have to do with the affairs of lord strut   j bull ay but my trade my very being was concerned in that   l baboon and my interest was concerned in the other but let us drop both our pretenses for i believe it is a moot point whether i am more likely to make a master bull or you a lord strut   j bull agreed old boy but then i must have security that i shall carry my broadcloth to market old boy   l baboon that you shall ecclesdown castle ecclesdown remember that why would thou not take it when it was offered thee some years ago   j bull i would not take it because they told me thou would not give it me   l baboon how could monsieur bull be so grossly abused by downright nonsense they that advised you to refuse must have believed i intended to give else why would they not make the experiment but i can tell you more of that matter than perhaps you know at present   j bull but what say thou as to the esquire nic frog and the rest of the tradesmen i must take care of them   l baboon thou have but small obligations to nic to my certain knowledge he has not used me like a gentleman   j bull nic indeed is not very nice in your punctilios of ceremony he is clownish as a man may say belching and calling of names have been allowed him time out of mind by prescription but however we are engaged in one common cause and i must look after him   l baboon all matters that relate to him and the rest of the plantiffs in this lawsuit i will refer to your justice   chap v nic frogs letter to john bull wherein he endeavors to vindicate all his conduct with relation to john bull and the lawsuit  nic perceived now that his cully had elopd that john intended henceforth to deal without a broker but he was resolved to leave no stone unturned to recover his bubble amongst other artifices he wrote a most obliging letter which he sent him printed in a fair character  dear friend when i consider the late ill usage i have met with from you i was reflecting what it was that could provoke you to it but upon a narrow inspection into my conduct i can find nothing to reproach my self with but too partial a concern for your interest you no sooner set this composition afoot but i was ready to comply and prevented your very wishes and the affair might have been ended before now had it not been for the greater concerns of esquire south and the other poor creatures embarked in the same common cause whose safety touches me to the quick you seemed a little jealous that i bad dealt unfairly with you in moneymatters till it appeared by your own accounts that there was something due to me upon the balance having nothing to answer to so plain a demonstration you began to complain as if i had been familiar with your reputation when it is well known not only i but the meanest servant in my family talk of you with the utmost respect i have always as far as in me lies exhorted your servants and tenants to be dutiful not that i any ways meddle in your domestic affairs which were very unbecoming for me to do if some of your servants express their great concern for you in a manner that is not so very polite you ought to impute it to their extraordinary zeal which deserves a reward rather than a reproof you cannot reproach me for want of success at the salutation since i am not master of the passions and interests of other folks i have beggared my self with this lawsuit undertaken merely in complaisance to you and if you would have had but a little patience i had still greater things in reserve that i intended to have done for you i hope what i have said will prevail with you to lay aside your unreasonable jealousies and that we may have no more meetings at the salutation spending our time and money to no purpose my concern for your welfare and prosperity almost makes me mad you may be assured i will continue to be  your affectionate friend and servant nic frog   john received this with a good deal of sang froid transeat quoth john cum caeteris erroribus he was now at his ease he saw he could now make a very good bargain for himself and a very safe one for other folks my shirt quoth he is near me but my skin is nearer whilst i take care of the welfare of other folks no body can blame me to apply a little balsam to my own sores it is a pretty thing after all for a man to do his own business a man has such a tender concern for himself there is nothing like it this is somewhat better i trow than for john bull to be standing in the market like a great drayhorse with frogs paws upon his head what will ye give me for this beast serviteur nic frog you may kiss my backside if you please though john bull has not read your aristotles platos and machiavels he can see us far into a millstone as another with that john began to chuckle and laugh till he was like to burst his sides  chap vi the discourse that passed between nic frog and esquire south which john bull overheard  john thought every minute a year till he got into ecclesdown castle he repairs to the salutation with a design to break the matter gently to his partners before he entered he overheard nic and the esquire in a very pleasant conference  esquire south oh the ingratitude and injustice of mankind that john bull whom i have honored with my friendship and protection so long should flinch at last and pretend that he can disburse no more money for me that the family of the souths by his sneaking temper should be kept out of their own   nic frog ant like your worship i am in amaze at it i think the rogue should be compelled to do his duty   esquire south that he should prefer his scandalous pelf the dust and dregs of the earth to the prosperity and grandeur of my family   nic frog nay he is mistaken there too for he would quickly lick himself whole again by his vails it is strange he should prefer philip baboons custom to esquire souths   esquire south as you say that my clothier that is to get so much by the purchase should refuse to put me in possession did you ever know any mans tradesman serve him so before   nic frog no indeed ant please your worship it is a very unusual proceeding and i would not have been guilty of it for the world if your honor had not a great stock of moderation and patience you would not bear it so well as you do   esquire south it is most intolerable that is certain nic and i will be revenged   nic frog methinks it is strange that philip baboons tenants do not all take your honors part considering how good and gentle a master you are   esquire south true nic but few are sensible of merit in this world it is a great comfort to have so faithful a friend as thy self in so critical a juncture   nic frog if all the world should forsake you be assured nic frog never will let us stick to our point and well manage bull i will warrant ye   esquire south let me kiss thee dear nic i have found one honest man amongst a thousand at last   nic frog if it were possible your honor has it in your power to wed me still closer to your interest   esquire south tell me quickly dear nic   nic frog you know i am your tenant the difference between my lease and an inheritance is such a trifle as i am sure you will not grudge your poor friend that will be an encouragement to go on besides it will make bull as mad as the devil you and i shall be able to manage him then to some purpose   esquire south say no more it shall be done nic to thy hearts content   john all this while was listening to this comical dialogue and laughed heartily in his sleeve at the pride and simplicity of the esquire and the sly roguery of his friend nic then of a sudden bolting into the room he began to tell them that he believed he had brought lewis to reasonable terms if they would please to hear them  then they all bawled out aloud no composition long live esquire south and the law as john was going to proceed some roared some stamped with their feet others stopped their ears with their fingers  nay gentlemen quoth john if you will but stop proceeding for a while you shall judge your selves whether lewiss proposals are reasonable  all very fine indeed stop proceeding and so lose a term   j bull not so neither we have something by way of advance he will put us in possession of his manor and castle of ecclesdoun   nic frog what do talk of us thou mean thy self   j bull when frog took possession of any thing it was always said to be for us and why may not john bull be us as well as nic frog was us i hope john bull is no more confined to singularity than nic frog or take it so the constant doctrine that thou have preached up for many years was that thou and i are one and why must we be supposed two in this case that were always one before it is impossible that thou and i can fall out nic we must trust one another i have trusted thee with a great many things prithee trust me with this one trifle   nic frog that principle is true in the main but there is some speciality in this case that makes it highly inconvenient for us both   j bull those are your jealousies that the common enemies sow between us how often have thou warned me of those rogues nic that would make us mistrustful of one another   nic frog this ecclesdouncastle is only a bone of contention   j bull it depends upon you to make it so for my part i am as peaceable as a lamb   nic frog but do you consider the unwholesomness of the air and soil the expenses of reparations and servants i would scorn to accept of such a quagmire   j bull you are a great man nic but in my circumstances i must be even content to take it as it is   nic frog and you are really so silly as to believe the old cheating rogue will give it you   j bull i believe nothingbut matter of fact i stand and fall by that i am resolved to put him to it   nic frog and so relinquish the hopefulest cause in the world a claim that will certainly in the end make thy fortune for ever   j bull will thou purchase it nic thou shall have a lumping pennyworth nay rather than we should differ i will give thee fomething to take it off my hands   nic frog if thou would but moderate that hasty impatient temper of thine thou should quickly see a better thing than all that what should thou think to find old lewis turned out of his paternal estates and mansion house of claypool would not that do thy heart good to see thy old friend nic frog lord of clay pool then thou and thy wife and children shall walk in my gardens buy toys drink lemonade and now and then we should have a countrydance   j bull i love to be plain i would as lieve see my self in ecclesdouncastle as thee in claypool i tell you again lewis gives this as a pledge of his sincerity if you will not stop proceeding to hear him i will   chap vii the rest of nics fetches to keep john out of ecclesdouncastle  when nic could not diswade john by argument he tried to move his pity he pretended to be sick and like to dye that he should leave his wife and children in a starving condition if john did abandon him that he was hardly able to craul about the room far less capable to look after such a troublesome business as this lawsuit and therefore begged that his good friend would not leave him when he saw that john was still inexorable he pulled out a caseknife with which he used to sneakersnee and threatened to cut his own throat thrice he aimed the knife to his wind pipe with a most determined threatening air what signifies lise quoth he in this languishing condition it will be some pleasure that my friends will revenge my death upon this barbarous man that has been the cause of it all this while john looked sedate and calm neither offering in the least to snatch the knife nor stop his blow trusting to the tenderness nic had for his own person when he perceived that john was immovable in his purpose he applied himself to lewis  art thou quoth he turned bubble in thy old age from being a sharper in thy youth what occasion have thou to give up ecclesdouncastle to john bull his friendship is not worth a rush give it me and i will make it worth the while if thou dislikest that proposition keep it thy self i would rather thou should have it than he if thou hearkens not to my advice take what follows esquire south and i will go on with our lawsuit in spite of john bulls teeth  l baboon monsieur bull has used me like a gentleman and i am resolved to make good my promise and trust him for the confequences   nic frog then i tell thee thou art an old doting fool with that nic bouncd up with a spring equal to that of one of your nimblest tumblers or rope dancers falls foul upon john bull to snatch the cudgel he had in his hand that he might thwack lewis with it john held it fast so that there was no wrenching it from him at last esquire south buckld to to assist his friend nic john halld on one side and they two on the other sometimes they were like to pull john over then it went all of a sudden again on johns side so they went seesawing up and down from one end of the room to the other down tumbled the tables bottles glasses and tobacco pipes the wine and the tobacco were all spilt about the room and the little fellows were almost trod under foot till more of the tradesmen joining with nic and the esquire john was hardly able to pull against them all yet he never quit hold of his trusty cudgel which by the contranitent force of two so great powers broke short in his hands nic seized the longer end and with it began to bastinado old lewis who had slunk into a corner waiting the event of this squabble nic came up to him with an insolent menacing air so that the old fellow was forced to skuttle out of the room and retire behind a dungcart he called to nic thou insolent jackanapes time was when thou durst not have used me so thou now take me unprovided but old and infirm as i am i shall find a weapon by and by to chastise thy impudence   when john bull had recovered his breath he began to parley with nic friend nic i am glad to find thee so strong after thy great complaints really thy motions nic are pretty vigorous for a consumptive man as for thy worldly affairs nic if it can do thee any service i freely make over to thee this profitable lawsuit and i desire all these gentlemen to bear witness to this my act and deed yours be all the gain as mine has been the charges i have brought it to bear finely however all i have laid out upon it goes for nothing thou shall have it with all its appurtenances i ask nothing but leave to go home  nic frog the counsel are feed and all things prepared for a trial thou shall be forced to stand the issue it shall be pleaded in thy name as well as mine go home if thou can the gates are shut the turnpikes locked and the roads barracadod   j bull even these very ways nic that thou toldest me were as open to me as thy self if i cannot pass with my own equipage what can i expect for my goods and wagons i am denied passage through those very grounds that i have purchased with my own money however i am glad i have made the experiment it may serve me in some stead   john bull was so overjoyed that he was going to take possession of ecclesdoun that nothing could vex him nic quoth he i am just a going to leave thee cast a kind look upon me at parting  nic looked sower and grum and would not open his mouth  j bull i wish thee all the success that thy heart can desire and that these honest gentlemen of the long robe may have their belly full of law   nic could stand it no longer but flung out of the room with disdain and beckoned the lawyers to follow him  j bull buy buy nic not one poor smile at parting will not you shake your dayday nic buy nic with that john marched out of the common road cross the country to take possession of ecclesdoun   chap viii of the great joy that john expressed when he got possession of ecclesdoun  when john had got into his castle he seemed like ulysses upon his plank after he had been well sousd in salt water who as homer says was as glad as a judge going to sit down to dinner after hearing a long cause upon the bench i dare say john bulls joy was equal to that of either of the two he skipd from room to room ran up stairs and down stairs from the kitchen to the garrets and from the garrets to the kitchen he peeped into every crany sometimes he admired the beauty of the architecture and the vast solidity of the masons work at other times he commended the symetry and proportion of the rooms he walked about the gardens he bathed himself in the canal swimming diving and beating the liquid element like a milkwhite swan the hall resounded with the sprightly violin and the martial hautboy the family tripd it about and caperd like hailstones bounding from a marble floor wine ale and october flew about as plentifully as kennelwater then a frolic took john in the head to call up some of nic frogs pensioners that had been so mutinous in his family  j bull are you glad to see your master in ecclesdouncastle   all yes indeed sir   j bull extremely glad   all extremely glad sir   j bull swear to me that you are so  then they began to damn and sink their souls to the lowest pit of hell if any person in the world rejoiced more than they did   j bull now hang me if i dont believe you are a parcel of perjured raseals however take this bumper of october to your masters health  then john got upon the battlements and looking over he called to nic frog  how do you do nic do you see where i am nic i hope the cause goes on swimmingly nic when do thou intend to go to claypool nic will thou buy there some highheads of the newest cut for my daughters how come thou to go with thy arm tied up has old lewis given thee a rap over the fingerends thy weapon was a good one when i weilded it but the buttend remains in my hands i am so busy in packing up my goods that i have no time to talk with thee any longer it would do thy heart good to see what wagon loads i am
