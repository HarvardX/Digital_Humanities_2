accommodation a poetical epistle etc  accommodation a poetical epistle to john ashby esquire  by rowley thomas  qui mores hominum multorum vidit  hor shrewsbury printed by j eddowes for the author mdcclxxv  accommodation etc condescension in the muse severest critics will excuse condescension in the man is the skilful winning plan by condescension here i mean accommodation in the scene of life  will a  y condescend to view the trifler in the friend that friend who ever has and will protect his character from ill give up life  all fancys power to cheer his every anxious hour then surely a  y cannot refuse the whimseys of a flighty muse a bland goodnaturd muse that must protect the good  the great  the just protect the wise  protect the brave  all  all  but coward fool and knave and cowards fools and knaves shall be the objects of her charity then a  y surely will excuse an idle truant laughing muse a muse that ever will incline to favor a  y with a line   his gentleness can never refuse the fondly  overweening muse that often in person will attend him and counsel quaint will freely lend him then a  y never can refuse the gambols of this frolic muse how  says sir critic  not to brand with infamy the murdering hand and every character that can sink to the brute from reasoning man  avaunt rash criticism  learn ye he served his time to vile attorney and vile attorneys never can be fit subjects for a lash from thee  we then should too much condescend  what  give our satire for no end no  let him canter over the hill of wild parnassus with his quill and stumble on without a note from us who think and write by rote the conscious muse in native charms laughs  till she bursts  at such alarms dares every critic to defiance  she never wishes such alliance dares every critic with a frown  to laud her  up to blast her  down with indignation now she burns and gladly to that friend returns  who gave her with a gentle hand and feeling heart each sweet command  what to embrace  and what to fly during her term of slavery kind  gentle spirit  yet even he can scarce escape severity whose noble mind  and swelling heart their virtues cheerfully impart to man at large  without a dream of selfs attractive  darling theme that luscious  dear  engaging thing which sways alike the clown  the king  at every place  at every hour  gives strange exemplars of it is power the cheerful reader too ll excuse the queer digressions of the muse and give her credit for awhile for every laugh  for every smile  which she engages to exert  neither too timorous  nor pert as opportunity permits  and she can strike some lucky hits her first essay  and all her own  sir critic fie  suppress that frown   solicits favor from   a friend  and if she meet with his applause will lengthen out her little cause   by daring in some future plan analysis of the human character  begun by the author of this little performance  showing popes essay on man unintelligible as a finished  philosophical piece but largely subscribing to the inimitable beauties of it as a merely poetical one to analyze that creature man whether in poetry or prose is insignificant to those who think  who act  from natures school and never idly play the fool   as whilom thomas often did without his ever being chid  except by such  as never knew skilful to give the finespun clew to mild conversions calm retreat   where all the muses  graces meet  and every ghost  and every shade of godlike man  that god has made midst scenes of wildest dissipation lost  his sensibility too often crossed  through the kindliest warmth of blood deserting every social good this and that perverse vexation springing all from circulation of boiling blood  through every vein quicktrembling to it is source again  the heart  whence every rapture flows for every good which it bestows on kindred man  without a thought of being asked for  being sought spite of all the rage of fashion  spite of every wayward passion  spite of natures opposition  he means to make a strange transition from bad to good  offhand reclaim each immoral youthful aim and stranger still  for quirking seats barter the muses green retreats hold  cries dame prudence  hold your hand and listen to this sage command  beware young man  with caution rove over legal bank  through quibbling grove  let law and reason  prudence join  then then you strike a good design                                         curse on your tame  your frigid notions and all such quack  cathartic potions the god of nature gave us passions  to grace us with on all occasions and gave us reason to control the frantic sallies of the soul past follies  nature ought to bear and think him highly worth her care                                         with all his faults  and all his folly he is freed at length from melancholy and her attendant  apathy   dull  cynic apathy  whose boast and blunted praise is always lost  by seldom thinking  never acting  and yet it ever seems transacting a mere machine  we use at will and keep it going on  or still as fancy leads  a moping jade  a piece of clockwork  only made for keenest cuts of comic wit  just when my ladys in the fit to flourish over wild natures page and stamp the wretch of every age the cruel critics still abuse the whimsical  meandrous muse  without one social feeling dare to blast my first  my only care and dully criticizing say  the pillars when they artless lay the superstructure must betray  quickly the castles undermined and by a trifling gale of wind so fare the laurel and the bays of such a rhymesters jingling lays   his canting  puling  lukewarm  the brawling brats of coldest climes  the laurel claim and blooming bays without the least pretense to praise   let gentlest breezes gently come they shake his highaspiring plume  which trembling drops  without a tear from us who give him  every fear and now aerial genius  now stoop to my muse  she will teach you how to sweep the skilful  winning bow bend genius  bend  accept this new  this grand  accommodating clew  nobly defend the muses claim a mirthful muses honest aim   and when dull apathists perceive that you the mystic muse can believe  they will crawl it on  in faith with you and own themselves highhonoured too   let but the lower ranks comply  you will have the muses leave to fly  and soar it to your native sky first let the towering genius dare to make high worth his constant care  next let the towering genius bend to make each honest heart  his friend and never think it worth his part to court the head without the heart   we grant  that where they kindly meet the union forms an higher treat  but a good heart  the deity will own  far  far excels  the merely laureled crown
