concise as possible except in those articles which are in a great measure peculiar to this district some of which we have reason to think may be adopted with advantage in others  it is scarcely possible in an undertaking of this kind to describe all the minutiae of practice or to notice every local improvement but we hope that the most prominent features of the agriculture of northumberland as existing in      will be found faithfully recorded in the following sheets  as weights and measures vary in different districts we think it right to apprize our readers that in the following reports of northumberland and cumberland  an acre is the statute acre of    0 square yards a bushel  gallons winchester a rood  yards in length a fothera two horse cartload of lime dung etc a stone of wool  lb avoirdupoise a stone of every other article  lb ditto in the report of westmoreland the customary acre is generally meant which contains    0 square yards or   a   r    p statute measure  it may also be proper to explain the following provincial terms  a hog is a name given to young sheep from   months old till they are shorn a gimmer an ewe sheep from the first to the second shearing a dinmont a wether sheep from the first to the second shearing a quey  an heiser a steer  a three years old ox kyloes a small breed of cattle bred in the highlands of scotland byer  a house for tying up cattle in winter fog  aftermath scaling  spreading abroad mole hills dung etc agricultural survey of northumberland chapter i geographical state and circumstances section    situation and extent the district included in this survey is the whole of the county of northumberland and those detached parts of the county of durham called norhamshire islandshire and bedlingtonshire  it is bounded on the east by the german ocean  0 miles west by roxburghshire and cumberland  0    north by berwickshire    south by the county of durham  0 making the whole circumference     miles it is situated between the latitude of    degrees    min and    degrees    min north and longitudes of   degrees 00 min and   degrees    min west from london its greatest length from north to south is    miles and breadth    and contains    0 square miles which may be divided into lands that are or may be cultivated by the plough acres     00 and mountainous districts improper for tillage   0000 making in the whole      00  sect    division the county of northumberland is divided into six wards  viz tindale ward coquetdale ward glendale ward bamborough ward morpeth ward and castle ward  the three first are situated in the western part of the county and include the whole of the mountainous district with a considerable portion of enclosed cultivated country  the three latter adjoin the sea coast and being exempt from mountainous district have been long under cultivation the vast resources of coal castle ward in particular possesses and the increased population the coal trade occasions give them a decided preference in point of riches and population though in point of magnitude considerably the smallest occupying less than one fourth of the county  norhamshire and islandshire are situated at the northern extremity of the county of northumberland and comprehend a triangular space the two sides of which are formed by the river tweed and german ocean and the base the northern boundary of glendale and bambro ward it contains about    square miles of wellinclosed cultivated country  bedlingtonshire is situated at the southeast corner of castle ward bounded on the east by the german ocean and on the north and south by the rivers wansbeck and blyth and contains about  0 square miles  sect    climate the climate  in regard to temperature is subject to great variation upon the mountains snow will often continue for several months and may frequently be seen there of a considerable depth when there is none in the lower districts the weather is very inconstant but mostly runs in extremes in the spring months the cold piercing easterly winds are most prevalent and our longest droughts are always accompanied by them in some places they have acquired the name of seapines from the slow progress vegetation makes whenever they continue for a few weeks rain is of little use while they prevail from the great cold which always attends them  the mild western and southern breezes rarely take place before june they are certain harbingers of rain and vigorous vegetation and are the most prevailing winds through the summer and autumn in the latter season they often blow with tempestuous fury dash out the corn and disappoint the just hopes of the industrious farmer  our greatest falls of snow or rain are from the south or southeast and whenever we have a very high west wind it is a certain sign that a great quantity of rain is falling to the westward in cumberland and roxburghshire  sect    soil and surface a strong fertile clayey loam  occupies the level tract of country along the coast and reaches as far up in general as the great post road it is well adapted to the culture of wheat pulse clover and grazing  sandy gravelly and dry loam  or what is here more generally understood by turnip soil is found on the banks of the tyne from newburn to haltwhistle on the coquet about and above rothbury on the aln from its mouth to alnwick and down tweedside but the greatest quantity of this kind of soil is found in the vales of breamish till and beaumont the hills surrounding the cheviot mountains are mostly a dry channelly sharppointed gravelly loam  moist loams  on a wet cold clayey bottom occupy a large portion of this county being unsafe for sheep and unfit for turnips they are principally employed in growing grain rearing young cattle and feeding ewes and lambs this soil prevails most in the middle and southeast parts of the county  black peat earth  is the prevailing soil in most of the mountainous districts and is found in many places through the lower parts of the county  the aspect of this county in respect to surface is marked with great variety along the seacoast it is nearly level toward the middle the surface is more diversified and thrown into large swelling ridges formed by the principal rivers  these parts are well enclosed in some places enriched with wood and recent plantations but the general appearance is destitute of those ornaments  the western part except a few intervening vales is an extensive scene of open mountainous district where the hand of cultivation is rarely to be traced  of the mountainous districts those around cheviot are the most valuable being in general fine green hills thrown by some of those convulsive changes which this globe has at some time experienced into numberless variety of forms the verdant swiftsloping sides of which enclose and shelter many deep narrow glens through the whole of this district no mineral or other kind of stone is found except brown red and gray whinstone  they extend from the head of coquet down to allenton from thence northward to prendwick branton ilderton wooler kirknewton and mindrim and occupy at least an area of  0000 acres  the other mountainous districts lie chiefly on the western part of the county some of which adjoin the county of durham but the largest portion extends from the roman wall to the river coquet with a few intervening enclosed vales and to the moors north of rothbury  they are not marked by any striking irregularities of surface being in general extensive open solitary wastes growing little else but heath and affording a hard subsistence to the flocks that depasture them  sect    minerals coal  is found in abundance through the greatest part of this county particularly in the lower district in the southeast quarter it is of the best quality the coals found in this district are of the variety called caking coals which melt in the fire burn to a strong cinder in the open air and the best kinds produce very few ashes and the most numerous and thickest seams from whence those vast quantities are exported which supply the great consumption of the london market as well as the coasting and foreign trade  this coal trade is the foundation of the commerce of the county and the principal source of its wealth as well as a neversailing nursery for some of the best seamen in the british navy  of the quantity of coals raised in this county we have not been able to form a probable conjecture for want of sufficient data to estimate the quantity used at home but have obtained what are exported from the river tyne in which a considerable portion raised in the county of durham is included and which may probably come near a balance for those consumed in this county  some idea of the magnitude of this trade may be formed by the following statement of  the exports of coals from newcastle in           0 newcastle chaldrons        0000          0         0                            this is the only year in which we find the quantities raised in northumberland and durham are kept distinct and which are in the county of northumberland         chaldrons in the county of durham        in all               0   0  from hence it appears that this trade is increasing at an amazing rate there being not less than onethird more coals exported now than were exported  0 years since from hartley and blyth there are exported yearly between  0000 and  0000 chaldrons if these be added to the average export from newcastle for the last three or four years the quantity exported from this county may be fairly estimated at   0000 newcastle chaldrons or      0 london chaldrons the newcastle chaldron being to the london chaldron in the ratio of   to     the value of the above quantity to the various parties concerned will appear by the following  calculation of the cost and charges upon a sopload of coals containing  0 keels a keel of coals is    ton   cwt and contains   newcastle chaldrons so that each chaldron is    cwt  a london chaldron contains    heaped winchester bushels and weighs on an average near    cwt according to the quality of the coals which weights being nearly in the ratio of   to    it is always reckoned that   newcastle chaldrons make    london chaldrons or   0 newcastle chaldrons delivered in the port of london paid at newcastle l s d to the

deducted from  00l the amount of the cargo as above leaves    l  s  d for the freight of the ship  as we are not able to procure sufficient information of the number of people in the coal trade we shall take the liberty of extracting from mr mnabs letter to mr pit that the number of persons employed and dependent on the coal trade in the year      were on the river tyne       on the river wear     0 total        to the coalowners the winning and working these collieries are very expensive and frequently attended with considerable risque for though very large fortunes have been made in the business yet many have been lost the unexpected alteration of the strata from dykes and other troubles the frequent and dreadful explosions from inflammable air the great depth of the shafts and increasing quantities of water to be raised from them baffle the most experienced artists and overcome the amazing powers of the fireengine which of late years has received many improvements and been made to perform what was thought absolutely impossible at its first introduction we were informed that there was only one fireengine in the neighborhood of neweastle about  0 years since  that it raised the water only  0 yards which at that time was thought a wonderful performance at present water is raised and probably in greater abundance   0 yards and upwards   these powerful machines are now applied to the purposes of drawing coals which business was formerly universally performed by horses frequently   to a shaft where great quantities were drawn and dispatch was necessary but by the invention and application of the drawing machines a great many horses were dismissed from the collieries which has considerably reduced the consumption of oats in this neighborhood  many of the collieries are situated at a considerable distance from the river to which the coals are conveyed from the pits in a peculiar kind of carriage called a new castle coalwaggon pl   fig   it has   small wheels about    inches diameter fixed to the axles with which they turn round and move on a road called the waggonway made on purpose with wood which is formed by long pieces of wood ra rails about   inches square laid lengthways upon sleepers of wood sss and the thickness of the rail above the plane of the rest of the road and at the exact distance of the wagon wheels from each other as it is upon those rails the wheels run  a new waggonway including timber levelling graveling and workmanship will cost about  s per yard or   0l per mile and the expense of keeping it in repair is generally about  d per chaldron on a quantity of   000 chaldrons annually or   l   s 0d per mile it has been suggested that a waggonway might be substituted in lieu of turnpike roads for the conveyance of heavy goods but we presume that the expense of first making laying out in nearly a level line or so as to have little or no ascent and keeping in repair would greatly overbalance the additional weight to be drawn by one horse as the wood rots and wastes nearly as much by a small quantity of carriage passing along it as a larger   the dimensions of the body of these wagons are as follows ft ins length at top   0  bottom     breadth at top   0  bottom   0 height      they hold a chaldron of coals or    cwt and are drawn by a single horse  a gentlyinclined plane is the most desirable position for those waggonways but few situations will admit of this upon levels or easy ascents a single horse draws the wagon on such parts of the way where the declination is sufficient for the wagon to move by the power of gravity the horse is taken out and follows behind and where the descents are such that the wagon would move with too great rapidity by its own weight or run amain the motion is regulated by a crooked piece of wood called a convey coming over the top of one of the hind wheels upon which the waggonman presses with such force as he finds requisite to regulate the motion of the wagon this mode of conveyance has been used here upwards of   0 years   in has been asserted that the coals in this county are inexhaustible  mr williams in his natural history of the mineral kingdom is of a different opinion and think it a matter of such importance as to deserve the serious attention of the legislature  toward elucidating this point it may be of some use to estimate what number of acres are wrought yearly in this county to supply the above quantity of coals in order to accomplish this object the thickness and number of workable seams of coal must be first ascertained for which purpose we have been favored with sections one of st anthons about   miles below newcastle by mr johnson the other of montague main about   miles above newcastle by mr thomas exhibiting the thickness and depth of the various strata in some of the deepest pits in the county which will not only be useful for the present purpose but we hope will be acceptable to many of our readers who are curious in

th and   th making together   yds   ft   ins of workable coal if the medium be taken betwixt this and st anthons it will be nearly   yards thick of workable coal from which may be formed  a calculation of the quantity of coal in an acre of ground supposing the aggregate thickness of the various seams amount to   yards an acre of ground contains    0 square yards which multiplied by the thickness   yards gives   0 0 cubic yards in an acre from which deduct   for waste and the part o pillars necessary to be left in working    0 there remains     0 cubic yards to be wrought  and as three cubic yards of coal when wrought afford a newcastle chaldron  therefore     0 divided by   gives      newcastle chaldrons per acre  the coals exported yearly from the rivers tyne and wear with hartley and blyth amount to about    000 chaldrons from newcastle   0000 chaldrons  sunderland    000 ditto in all    000 which with the home consumption of the two counties of northumberland and durham will make the quantity of coals raised yearly about  000000 chaldrons  and the chaldrons raised yearly  000000 divided by the chaldrons per acre      gives     acres nearly per year cleared of coal   yds thick  and by estimating the breadth occupied by the caking coals to be on an averge   miles broad and    miles long in the two counties we shall find there will be about  00 square miles or    000 acres of coal proper for exportation  then the whole area    000 divided by the yearly consumption         years the time before this space will be wrought out  but there are some reasons to think that a thickness of seam equal to   yards will not be obtained over an extent of  00 square miles probably not more on an average than   yards in which case the coal will be exhausted in   0 years and if the aggregate thickness of the seams to be obtained should prove only three yards then little more than  00 years will be the term of continuance but it is probable that before the half of that time be elapsed the price to the consumer will be considerably increased from the increased expense of obtaining them and the increased length of carriage from the pits to the river this last we presume may be reduced in some situations by adopting canals instead of waggonways which we have often wondered have never yet been attempted  from the above investigation it appears that mr williamss apprehensions are not so chimerical at have been represented how far it may be right for the legislature to interfere we leave to the consideration of those more conversant in political speculations  of the coal found all through bambro ward islandshire and those parts of glendale ward east of the river till the seams are very thin mostly from   to   feet thick and of a very inferior quality yielding a great quantity of ashes and neither caking in the fire nor burning to a cinder they are used only for homeconsumption and for burning lime for the latter purpose they are well adapted by their property of neither caking nor burning to a cinder and it luckily happens that through all this district the coal and lime are generally found together a circumstance which greatly facilitates and lessens the expense of burning lime  if a line be drawn from alemouth to a little west of bywell on the river tyne very little of this kind of coal and limestone will be found to the east of it and from this line to the sea coast no limestone whatever appears except a small patch of a different limestone that puts in at whitley near tynemouth and runs from thence in a southwesterly direction through the county of durham etc in this space betwixt these two ranges of limestone lie the caking coals of superior quality above described and the same breadth of coal may be traced through the county of durham stretching in the same direction and bounded on the east and west in a similar manner by stretches of limestone of different kinds  it would be a curious investigation to trace these minerals through the different counties across the island and show where the strata of each species rise to the surface and the deviations caused in them by cross veins or dykes etc we believe it will be found that very little or no coal lies to the east of this line and that no chalk lies to the west  limestone  of an excellent quality abounds through all bambro ward islandshire and that part of glendale ward situated on the east side of the river till it stretches from hence in a southwesterly direction through the central parts of the county and is found at shilbottle longframlington hartburn rial corbridge etc and at numberless other places to the westward of these but the southeast quarter which is so rich in coal is destitute of lime except a small patch at whitley near tynemouth as is also that part of glendale ward west of the river till  stone marl  abounds in many places near tweedside and shell marl is found in a few places in glendale ward the greatest quantity is at wark and sunnylaws where it has been formed by a deposit of various kinds of shells both univalve and bivalve many of which are yet perfect forming a stratum several feet in depth of pure calcareous earth but the exact depth of this bed of marl has never yet been ascertained for want of a proper level to carry off the water it probably may afford matter of speculation to some readers to be informed that in the middle of this marl there is an horizontal stratum of sand about    inches thick and also that a few years since a red deer stag in the attitude of running and in every part complete was found embedded in the marl horns of the same animal have been found at different times in perfect preservation and a part of the scalp with the cores of a pair of horns belonging to some animal of the bos taurus species were lately found here we have never seen any breed of cattle the horns of which were of equal magnitude for though the outside shell or horn part was wanting yet the core was    inches long and    inches circumference at the root and when in a perfect state and covered with the outside shell must have been about   inches diameter their form is a gentle curve and have all the appearance of a pair of bulls horns but probably of a different breed of cattle to any we have at present  clay marl  is also found in small quantities but in situations where it could not be conveniently used with effect  lead ore  has hitherto never been found in any quantity but in the mountainous districts on the southwest part of the county toward the head of that branch of south tyne called allendale and a small quantity at fallowfield a little to the north of hexham the lead mines in allendale produce about   000 bings of lead ore annually which at  l  s od per bing is upwards of  0000l a year   in this county lead ore is wrought by the bing a measure containing   cwt of clean ore the workmen being paid by the owners of the mine at different prices from  s to   s per bing for getting and washing or cleaning according to the richness quality or hardness of the mine if the owners sell any of the ore in this state the price is generally from  l  0s to  l  0s per bing but they mostly have smelt mills of their own where they smelt it at their own cost take the silver out of it by refining the alendale lead ore is smelted and refined at dukesfield smeltmill and produces about   or   ounces of silver from each fother of lead what is got at fallowfield contains so little silver that it will not pay the expense of refining while some ore got in alston moor in cumberland yields    oz of silver per fother the process of refining greatly improves the lead by making it more ductile   and then cast the lead into long pieces called pigs of   cwt each  pig lead is sold by the fother a quantity containing    cwt which is reckoned to sell at a fair price when at   l or   l per fother in      it was as low as   l and in the beginning of      it was   l  s  in      it rose gradually to   l  0s per fother which was several pounds higher than it was ever sold at before but in the following year it sell to   l or   l per fother which shows the fluctuating price of this article  the ore of zink  is found in great abundance embedded with spar in most of the veins producing lead ore but its distance from any brass manufactures and from water carriage renders it of little value in these mines are also found great variety of crystallizations of spar quartz etc etc  the mines which produce lead ore are very fluctuating and uncertain in point of profit to the adventurers but tend to a general good by giving employment to a numerous class of industrious workmen who being situated in a climate improper for the production of grain are obliged to receive the greatest part of their provisions from the more fertile districts of the county and by those means encourage its agriculture  iron ore  may be had in many parts of the county of late years the convenience of shipping it at holy island has induced the carron company to have considerable quantities from thence  freestones  of various kinds abound in almost every part of the county and are applied to all the purposes of building many of the quarries afford tolerable slates for roofing and flags for floors at some of them excellent grindstones are got of which a great many are exported from camus and warkworth  sect    waters the principal rivers which act as estuaries to the rest are the tyne blyth wansbeck coquet aln and tweed the innumerable streams which lose their names in the above spread in every direction through the county  the tyne branches into nearly two equal streams a little above hexham which are distinguished by the names of north tyne and south tyne the main branch of north tyne is the reed and of south tyne the allen the principal streams which empty themselves into the tyne east of hexham are the devilswater and the derwent and the river till is the only stream of any note which empties itself into the tweed in this county  the tyne and tweed are the most eminent for their navigation the tide flowing up the former    miles and up the latter eight or ten the navigation of the other rivers is confined to a small distance from their mouths of these the blyth and aln are of the most importance from the convenience which the first affords to its neighborhood for the exportation of considerable quantities of coals and both of them for corn etc and the importation of timber iron and other useful articles  the tyne and tweed have been long celebrated for their salmon fisheries in the latter a rent of  00l a year is paid for a fishing of  00 yards in length near the mouth of the river and the same rent is paid for other  above the bridge not more than   0 yards in  the fish taken here are the salmon bulltrout whng and large common trout and nearly the whole of them sent to london in the conveyance of which a great improvement has taken place of late years by packing them in pounded ice by this means they are presented nearly as fresh at the london market as when taken out of the river for the purpose of carrying them and keeping up a constant and regular supply vessels called smacks sail   times a week and being purposely constructed for swift sailing frequently make their run in    hours these vessels are from  0 to   0 tons burden on an average    men are employed in each vessel and make about    voyages in a year and not less than    boats and  00 fishermen are employed in taking the fish in the river tweed  chapter ii state of property sect    estates estates vary in their annual value from  0l to upwards of  0000l a year  one in particular is upwards of  0000l  small estates from  0l to  00l a year are found in the southern and middle parts of the county but very rarely in the northern  there are probably few parts of the kingdom where estates have made such rapid improvements as in this county there being several instances of the value being more than trebled within the last  0 years many causes have certainly been aiding to produce this great effect but the principal one is attributed to letting large farms and leases for    years by which means the tenants of capital were encouraged to make those great exertions from which such advantages have resulted not only to themselves and proprietors of the land but to the community at large from the very increased produce and superiority of its quality  the usual mode of letting farms is to fix a rent under certain conditions and covenants   or    months before the expiration of the lease but upon one of the largest estates in the county the earl of tankervilles the tenants have an offer of their farms   or   years before the expiration of the lease which is a mutual benefit to both landlord and tenant and is attended with so many advantages that it is in a fair way of being generally adopted  on some estates the practice of letting farms by secret proposals is still in use this is a dark and mysterious mode which frequently defeats the end it is intended to accomplish and instead of obtaining an excessive high rent the prize has been often gained at a very inferior value and in the language of the turf where only one has entered the lists by walking the course and we have known some of the first farmers in the county forego their farms rather than submit to contend in the dark upon most estates it is generally stipulated that a certain portion of the best old grazing lands on each farm shall be kept in grass during the whole term  the quantity of land to be in ploughing is mostly limited to a certain number of acres and at the expiration of the term where the tenant quits on the   th of may he is allowed to have a crop of corn from off twothirds of the arable lands this is called the waygoing crop the entering tenant has the straw and leads the crop into the stackyard  the houses hedges gates drains etc are kept and left in repair by the tenant who likewise pays all taxes cesses etc  of the annual value of the estates in this county no authentic information could be obtained but a probable guess may be formed by supposing that there are  00000 acres of cultivated land and that this on an average is worth   s per acre  and that   0000 acres of mountainous district is worth  s per acre  then  00000 acres at   s  0000l and   0000 acres at  s   000l gives the total value of the lands per ann l 0 000  sect    tenures the land property in this county is mostly freehold  there are to be found in a few places some small parcels of copyhold and in those districts which belong to the county of durham some leaseholds for lives or years held under the church  there are also two or three manors of customary tenure toward the head of south tyne  chapter iii buildings sect    houses of proprietors the seats of the principal proprietors of this county consist of venerable castles old halls and elegant modern mansions  to give particular descriptions would be too extensive for an agricultural survey those who wish for information on this subject we beg leave to refer to hutchinsons view of northumberland pennants tour etc etc  sect    farm houses offices etc buildings  for the use and convenience of farms were formerly very shabby and ill contrived but those that have been erected of late years are better adapted to the various purposes wanted for extensive farms and improved cultivation  the most approved form of distributing the various offices is on the east west and north sides of a rectangular parallelogram which is generally divided into two foldyards for cattle of different ages the south being left open to admit the sun and for the same reason and also for the sake of cleanliness and health the farm house is removed in front thirty or forty yards between which and the south wall of the fold is a small court for coals young poultry etc as in the annexed plan a scale of  00 feet   a the farmhouse b the barn    feet by  0 c sheds over which are granaries d d ditto upon which are built cornslacks one of which is for wintering yearling calves the other for holding implements of husbandry e buyers for cows and workoxen    feet by    f stables g pigstyes with henhouse above h h foldyards for cattle of different ages repairs are mostly done by the tenants on the large farms complaints are seldom made of their being neglected but upon small farms the landlord is frequently obliged to lend his assistance  sect    cottages such cottages as have been erected a number of years are built with stone and clay and covered with thatch those that have been built of late years are of stone and lime covered with tiles and mostly a floor of lime and sand they consist of one apartment    ft by    to dwell in with a small one at the entrance for a cow coals working tools etc   ft by    and are only one story high very few of them want the accommodation of a garden  the materials used for building are stone and bricks but mostly the former straw thatch used to be the universal covering but it is now nearly fallen into disuse and tiles or slates substituted in its stead the small dark blue slate from scotland is the kind generally used here and are much superior to tiles for though they are more expensive at first yet it is probable that in a few years they may be as cheap from the repairs tiles so frequently require especially where they are so ill manufactured  fir timber is universally used for all the purposes of building  chapter iv mode of occupation sect    farms and character of the farmers the size of farms  varies considerably in this county in glendale and bambrough wards the farms are large from  00l to   00l a year very few under  00l in the other parts of the county they are from  0l to  00l a year some tenants in the northern parts of the county farm from  000l to  000l a year and upwards  the capitals necessary for such farms entitle them to a good education and give them a spirit of independence and enterprise that is rarely found amongst the occupiers of small farms and short leases their minds being open to conviction they are ready to try new experiments and adopt every beneficial improvement that can be learnt in other districts for this purpose many of them have traversed the most distant parts of the kingdom to obtain agricultural knowledge and have transplanted every practice they thought superior to those they were acquainted with or that could be advantageously pursued in their own situation and scarce a year passes without some of them making extensive agricultural tours for the sole purpose of examining the modes of culture of purchasing or hiring the most improved breeds of stock and seeing the operations of newinvented and most useful implements  the character of a farmer is here so respectable that gentlemen who possess landed property from  00l to   00l a year think it no debasement to follow the profession and so high a name have many of the farmers obtained for their superior knowledge in rural affairs that they are seldom without pupils from various and distant parts of the kingdom with whom they have very handsome premiums generally  00l per annum  amongst the present pupils may be reckoned the son of an parl and the son of a baronet  who from their abilities attention and anxious readiness to learn and work at every operation we hope will do credit to the profession and render the most essential services to their respective districts  sect    rent the rent  of lands in this county used formerly to be clogged with payments in kind and personal services but these have been long disused and the whole is now paid in money  the rents are mostly due on the   th of may and the   d of november but payment is seldom required till four or five months after being due  the rent per acre must vary with the quality of the land and other circumstances at a distance from towns and for the purposes of farming only lands may be had from one shilling per acre up to  0 and  0 shillings  last year a farm of upwards of  000 acres was let for  0s an acre uninclosed but tithefree of grain  one of  00 acres at   s per acre pays all tithes  another of  00 acres at   s per acre tithefree well enclosed and in high condition and several other large farms that pay tithes of every kind have been let as high as from    to   s per acre and some old rich grazing pastures along the seacoast let for  0s per acre  sect    tithes of this bane to agriculture we do not find any thing peculiar to this county which is not common to the rest in some parts the tithes are collected with moderation in others with all the severity that law can enforce some let for a term of years at a fair rent whilst others value and let every year  sect    poor rates in newcastle they vary from  s  d to  s  d in the pound in times of peace but at present all saints parish is as high as  s per pound owing to the seafaring people living mostly in this parish and the sailors being impressed their wives and children come for support upon the pairsh  at hexham they are  s  d  morpeth  s  d  alnwick  s  0d  belford  s  d  berwick  s  d  wooler  s  d  and in other parts of the county we find they vary from  d to  s per pound  sect    leases leases  for twentyone years are let on most of the principal estates especially in the northern parts of the county some proprietors of land in the other districts let only for nine twelve or fifteen years the general time of entry is the   th of may upon the duke of northumberlands estate the time of entry is lady day and the offgoing tenant has no waygoing crop the covenants vary with circumstances but we think the following the best calculated for improvement and the benefit of both landlord and tenant  after the usual reservations of mines woods etc and provisoes of reentry on nonpayment of rent or alienation etc the tenant covenants to pay the rent  all taxes  keep and leave all in repair  not to sell hay straw or other fodder from off the premises  to lay the dung on the premises except that bred the last year  not to sow any hemp flax mustard or rape except the last for green food  not to depasture more stints the last year than were depastured for two years preceding  to destroy the moles yearly and scale the grass grounds  to thresh the waygoing crop in an uniform manner and deliver a daily supply of straw to the next tenant  to keep uneaten the lands sown with grass seeds in the last year of the term from the first of october except one half to be eaten by the offgoing tenant after the  st of april to the end of the term  to permit the lessor to sow grass seeds on the waygoing crop  and to plough the lands intended for fallow five months before the expiration of the term  to have no more ploughing than generally from onethird to near onehalf on the larger farms but on some small farms it is more acres at one time  to fallow yearly for wheat turnips or other green crops onethird of the tillage lands and lay upon every acre cart loads of lime where necessary or in lieu thereof cart loads of dung  not to keep any land in tillage more than three years at one time  to lay to grass yearly onethird of the tillage lands and sow upon every acre pounds of clover etc or other seeds suited to the soil to keep such lands in grass at least two or three years weak soils improper for corn should continue in grass     or   years or until it is thought they want refreshing by ploughing which is only used in such situations as being subservient to stock before they are ploughed out again  to lay down to grass or have in grass the last three years all those fields called  to keep in grass during the whole of the term and at the end thereof leave in grass all those fields called these are generally old rich grazing pastures or meadows  and all such lands as shall be converted into watered meadows  to be at one half the expense of making new quick senses and of cleaning and rearing them for seven years after first planted  and others that situation or circumstances may require  the lessor convenants that the tenant shall have peaceable possession and a waygoing crop from off twothirds of the tillage lands with the use of the stack yards barns and granaries for twelve months after the expiration of the term also to be at onehalf the expense of making all new quick fences and of cleaning and rearing them for seven years after first planted with other covenants that may be agreed on respecting building etc  sect    expense and profit the expense upon a farm may be estimated pretty near the truth for a certain number of acres but the profits depend upon so many precarious circumstances such as seasons mode of culture produce markets etc that we think any estimate of profits upon a particular farm would be a very vague criterion for judging of the rest and most probably would not suit any other farm of the same rent or magnitude in the county we shall therefore state the expense of cultivating an acre supposing a farm in the rotation of three years arable and three years grass  viz    year oats   turnips   barley   clover and other grasses   clover and other grasses   clover and other grasses and that the first years clover carries six sheep per acre the second year four and the third year two sheep per acre  then the expense will be as follows  first year  for oats l s d ploughing and

acres        or per acre   0    the expenses incurred for cultivation will be nearly the same whatever the soil but the produce will vary according to the quality of the land  on good lands the produce may be  st year  oats    bush per acre at  s per bush    0 0   turnips per acre   0 0   barley    bush per acre at  s  d do    0 0 carried over    0 0 l s d brought over    0 0  th year

required to carry on a farm in tillage at  s per acre that it does one at   s per acre  therefore a farm of good land of  00l per year will require less capital than a farm of bad land of  00l per year and also that when the value of the crops in   years amounts to no more than   l such lands are improper for arable and will pay no rent  of course the most profitable mode of employing such soils is to let them remain in pasturage  chapter v implements the carts  used in this county are mostly drawn by two horses they are in general heavy clumsy and illformed and such as we think few districts would wish to imitate they are rightlined rectangular parallelopipedons the general dimensions for a twohorse cart are    inches long  0 inches wide and  0 inches deep and contain    winchester bushels streaked measure  the usual load for two horses in winter is  0 bushels of wheat and in summer    the first about    cwt and the latter about  0 cwt or one ton the neatest most useful and best contrived carts we know are those made in many parts of the north riding of yorkshire  the singlehorse carts of this construction used for carrying coals from the county of durham into yorkshire are  0 inches long    inches wide and    deep hold    bushels of coals when set round the sides with large coals and upheaped  a man or boy drives three of these two of which are equal to the greatest quantity ever carried by three horses  mr charge of newton sends three of these carts for coals every day which bring    bushels of coals the distance    miles there and back and is performed in    hours by one man  the same gentlemans twohorse carts bring    bushels of the same coals   singlehorse carts  are becoming more prevalent in several parts of the county  mr james johnson a common carrier at hexham has a horse    hands high that commonly carries from hexham to newcastle    cwt and  0 cwt back again and there are instances of his having carried    cwt from newcastle to hexham which is a very banky heavypulling road  wagons  drown by four horses are used by some farmers for leading coals and lime but we hope a few years will show the absurdity of employing such unwieldy carriages so destructive to roads and of so little utility to farmers  the swing plough  made in imitation of the rotherham plough is in general use through every part of this county the farmers of this district have always had the good sense not to load their teams with wheel ploughs as wheels in general destroy a considerable portion of the power of the team besides their additional weight hence the absurdity of recommending norfolk ploughs to those districts where the simple swingplough has been used and properly understood its form is constantly varying no fixed rules being known for its construction scarce two carpenters making them alike differing widely in length and height of the beam point of yoking form of mouldboard etc etc  to remedy these defects it was intimated in the first edition of this report that an essay on the construction of the plough deduced from mathematical principles would be soon offered to the public  this essay is now published for messrs robinson london price  s from which we have extracted the following   practical construction for determining the position and dimensions of the most essential parts of a plough that the operation of ploughing may be performed with the least loss of power it is necessary to know the height and inclination of the horses shoulder  while a horse is in the act of pulling the inclination of his shoulder varies from    to    degrees according to circumstances the medium is    degrees and the medium height of the point of draught on the shoulder of a horse    hands high is    inches  these data being got from experiment and the depth to be ploughed suppose   inches given  draw a right line ab and at any point fig   pl   a erect a perpendicular ap equal to    inches  with ap as a radius from p as a center describe a quarter of a circle aq which divide into  0 equal parts or degrees  from p through    degrees draw a right line to meet ab in b  set the length of the traces and swingtrees from p to h this is commonly  0  inches  from h upon ab let fall a perpendicular hi which measured on the scale that ap was taken from will give the height of the beam hi   inches  then at the distance of half the depth the land is intended to be ploughed in this case   inches draw a line parallel to ab and from c where it intersects pb let fall a perpendicular upon ab to s which will

harrow some people use two horse harrows joined in the middle by crooks and loops and also small light harrows with short tines for putting in grass seeds  rollers  for reducing cloddy land rolling wheat in the spring and grass seeds are mostly made of wood they are generally   feet long and from    to  0 inches diameter those used for slattening the tops of onebout ridges for drilling turnips upon are   feet long and  0 or    inches diameter the framing is various but that shown in the annexed drawing is the most general  pl   fig   the rope by which the drill is drawn is fastened to the bar b and is slipped from one end to the other at every turning to suit the sowing to prevent the accumulation of earth upon the roller a thin piece of wood c is placed at its back to act as a scraper  a drill for sowing turnips on the tops of oneboul ridges  when this mode of cultivating turnips was first introduced the only drill used was a hollow cylinder of tin with a small hole in the bottom through which the seed was shook if this orifice be made of such size as to deposit a proper quantity of seed it is very liable to stop and of course large spaces are totally missed if made so wide as to prevent this inconvenience it then sows far too much this defect induced me some years since to construct one upon different principles which is now coming into general use  the most essential parts of this drill consist of a solid cylinder c  fig   pl   of iron or brass   inches diameter and   inch broad on the surface are made or punched    or    cavities of the form of a semiegg fig    fig    fig    fig    cut lengthways and so deep as to hold   or   seeds each on the back part of this cylinder a little below the top is placed the hind part of the hopper to which is fixed a piece of iron or brass ga one inch long and broad hollowed on the inside into the form of a gothic arch as in fig   the sides of which meeting the sides of the cavities in an oblique angle prevent the seeds from bruising at the lower end of this piece of iron which may be called a gatherer is made a slit   0 of an inch long and   0 wide and at the back of it a thin flat piece of iron te moves up and down by means of a screw s at the top of the hopper which enlarges or lessens the orifice o directly above the cavities and increases or diminishes the quantity of seed delivered as the operator thinks necessary  this slip of thin iron which may be called a regulator is let into a groove made in the board which forms the back part of the hopper  this cylinder cy before the cavities are made is fixed on an iron axle ll   inch square and turned very true as well as are those parts of the axle which turn in the collars or thimbles fixed in the shafts or handles dd  fig   pl   to the ends of the axle are fixed two wheels ww    inches diameter that turn the axle and cylinder round which in passing through the hopper h filled with turnip seed bring forward in each cavity a number of seeds and drop them into the spout p which are conveyed by it to the coulter c that forms a channel on the top of the onebout ridge sd  fig   pl   for receiving them  where s is the channel and d the dung directly under the seeds  if the cavities be made to hold   seeds when the regulator or tongue is screwed close down and there be    cavities it will then deposit  0 seeds in one revolution and as the diameter of the wheel is    inches the circumference will be    in this case  0 seeds will be deposited in    inches or nearly    in a foot  from this minimum quantity by screwing up the regulator the number may be increased gradually to  0 or  0 in a foot which is far too much unless in very particular and unfavourable situations  the price of this drill is  l  s  drills  for sowing the different kinds of grain used in this county not being able to regulate the quantity of seed to suit different soils seasons etc we mentioned in the first edition of this report that a drill was then making which would remedy those complaints a description and drawing of which being published in the appendix to the essay on ploughs mentioned in p    we take the liberty of extracting from thence  a description of a drill upon a new construction for sowing all kinds of grain in any quantity and at any distance  the inside part of the drill by which the quantity of seed is regulated is represented by fig   pl   where ax is an iron axle   or   inch square upon which are fixed at   or  0 inches distance five six or more brass fluted cylinders the flutes being rather more than a semicircle of an inch diameter or wide and  deep  rm are hollow cylindrical rims of hammered iron which have segments turned down at right angles to fit exactly the flutes of the brass cylinders the cavities of which are increased or diminished by the segments of the iron cylindrical rims sliding backwards or forwards in the flutes this is performed in all the cylinders at the same time by a rectangular space n being made in the brass cylinders through which passes a straight piece of iron in moving on friction wheels at j and fastened to the plates at lk and also to the cylindrical rims rm  lv is a lever the fulcrum of which is f and moved fig    fig    by a screw s passing through the frame at v the end at lk is forked and made to fit exactly the sides of the collar or plates of iron jk  by turning the screw s the lever moves the whole of the rims at once and the cavities are increased or diminished at pleasure this is done with the greatest facility and readiness even while the machine is going and at work which is frequently necessary where the land varies considerably in quality upon different parts of the same ridge and almost instantaneously to sow any kind of grain and in any proportion which is shown upon the scale eop by the index ko fixed to the end of the lever at k   fig   pl   is a view of the machine when ready for work the coulters and spouts may be hung differently as represented by the dotted lines and which is probably the better mode for hilly lands  and for a more particular description for regulating the depths distances etc we beg leave to refer to the abovementioned essay  for turnips  the large hopper is taken off and a set of small ones sixed upon the halfegg cavities at the end of the brass cylinders the quantity is regulated by a tongue screwing up and down as described in the turnip drill  fig   pl    for sowing beans or pease at wide intervals viz from    to  0 inches i use a drill with only one wheel and one cylinder which a man wheels before him in the furrow or what i find much better it may be fixed in the body of a small plough drawn by a single horse with one stilt that passes between the wheel and the seedbox  fig   pl   by this means the wheel moves along a smooth surface between the landside and mouldboard m and the seed is deposited at a regular depth two inches answers very well for beans with the same small plough and drill i have sown both wheat and barley at different intervals from   to    inches and   or   inches deep with good success and for small concerns this cheap and simple apparatus will probably be found the most eligible  it is fixed to the plough by two pieces of iron going from the ends of the drill one to the beam at b and the other to the stilt at c and moving round on bolts allow the wheel w to fall and rise with every accidental hollow or eminence  the low part of the coulter is kneed or bent to bring it to the same plane with the land side of the plough  threshing machines  are now becoming general in the northern parts of the country they are all upon the principle of the flax mill which principle was first introduced into this county for threshing corn by mr edward gregson near    years since the machine he used was worked by a man who could thresh with it    bushels of wheat in a day but being hard work and mr gregson dying soon after it was neglected mr wm menzie who was servant with mr gregson at the time says that his master took the idea from a small flax mill which a scotchman traveled the country with for the purpose of swingling the flax which the farmers grew for their own use this portable flax mill was carried in a cart from one farmhouse to another being a cylinder of   or   feet diameter and    inches wide the switchers were driven by his foot with a crank like a cutlers wheel and that the threshing machine mr gregson had was made at that time and exactly the same as the said flax mill  mr tho gregson thinks that his brother edward had seen something of a similar nature in scotland probably the same which mr d meldrum gives an account of about the same time in a letter to mr william charge of cleasby in the county of york which he describes as being the same as the flax mill that it threshed   0 bushels of oats a day which dropped through a skreen into a winnowing machine that dressed at the same time  some time after this mr oxley erected a threshing machine at flodden moved by horses in which the corn was fedin betwixt two fluted rollers and struck by switchers placed as those are in the present machines only they are hung on hinges those in use now are fixed as were those of mr gregsons the complaint of mr oxleys machine was that it did not thresh common oats clean probably for want of velocity for it is found in the machines now used that if the switchers move with a velocity of   00 feet per minute they will not thresh clean and experience has proved that to thresh common oats clean requires a velocity of   00 feet per minute  mr ilderton erected two threshing machines one at ilderton and another at hawkhill worked by horses the principle of which was to rub the grain out by projecting pieces of wood on the circumference of a large cylinder rubbing against several fluted rollers he used it many years but it was frequently necessary to put the straw twice through before it was perfectly clean  we were informed by the late sir francis kinlock bart of gilmerton scotland that while he was attempting to perfect mr ildertons machine he saw a portable flax mill made for the use of poor families worked by a man it struck him that it would thresh corn and he got one made with the addition of two smooth rollers for taking in the corn the work being too hard for a man he sent it to mr mickles mill to have it tried by water soon after mr mickles son built a threshing mill at kilbogie and after ten or twelve had been erected in the neighborhood by other workmen he applied to mr kinlock to take out a patent who told him that he did not look upon it as an original invention and that a patent would not be of any use some time after this mr mickle took out a patent for england only in his own name for the purpose we suppose of securing to himself his own combination of wheels etc for movement of the various parts as the leading principle of the machine had been applied to the same purpose at least  0 years before mr mickle is a very ingenious mechanic and though it appears he has not the merit of being the original inventor yet he has added many useful improvements   at their first introduction into this county the corn and straw were thrown out together upon the floor and caused great confusion to remedy this a skreen was added through which the grain dropped into a winnowing machine and from off the skreen the straw was taken by a man but a circular rake invented about eight years since by mr balley who first applied it to his machine at chillingham performs the operation much better and at the same time saves a considerable expense this rake is now added to all those that have been lately erected and only causes an addition to the machinery of one light wheel these machines are moved both by water and by horses two four and even six of the latter are sometimes employed the former is certainly the best power where it can be obtained  from a review of the whole it appears that the principle of the flax mill had been applied by different persons at different times for the purpose of threshing corn and since its being more generally used different persons have invented and used various combinations of wheels and other contrivances to effect the same purpose and render the machine more perfect  the simplest and most useful combinations and contrivances are certainly the best but whose are entitled to this appellation we do not pretend to determine the public must judge for themselves  the combination we shall offer is different to any we have seen for which reason and being that where the first circular rake was applied we shall give  a description and calculation of a threshing machine erected at chillingham in pl   fig   bb is a horizontal board or table   feet long by   ft   ins broad on which the corn cc is evenly spread and presented to the castmetal fluted rollers rr   inches diameter which take it regularly in and by their weight and sharp edges hold fast the straw while it is struck switched or threshed by the switchers or pieces of wood ssss fixed in the cylinder dd and projecting   inches from its surface this cylinder is made with strong arms on which are fixed the switchers and cased round with narrow inch deals the whole secured from flying off by strong iron hoops surrounding them at each end the switchers are covered with plate iron to prevent their wearing these when they strike the corn move in an upward direction re with great velocity and throw the corn as it is threshed and the straw as it leaves the fluted rollers against the circular rake kk and upon the wire skreen g from whence the straw is taken by the rake and delivered upon the sloping board l down which it slides to the floor n while the corn passes through the skreen g into the hopper h and from thence to the inclined board i but in falling from h to i a strong current of air raised by the fanners fff blows the chaff over the sloping board o and the light corn against it which falls into the space p and the chaff into m while the good grain slides down the inclined board ii to the floor at q from whence it is taken and put into a second winnowing machine in which are placed proper riddles to suit different kinds of grain this second machine is moved by a rope going over a pulley fixed in the axle t and is set agoing or stopped at pleasure by a stretching pulley as occasion requires  where the situation will admit of the board ii being placed about   feet from the floor the second winnowing machine may be placed directly under it and save the trouble of lifting the corn  to find the velocity of the particular parts  we must divide the product of the number of cogs in the driving wheels by the product of the number of cogs in the driven wheels and the quotient will be the number of revolutions made by the last moved part for one of the first moving part  the whole is put in motion by an overshot water wheel    feet diameter which makes from   to   revolutions per minute according to the supply of water on the axle of this water wheel is fixed a large spur wheel aa of   0 cogs     inches diameter which drives a castmetal pinion b of    cogs       inches diameter on the axis of which is placed another spur wheel c of    cogs  0   inches diameter that drives the castmetal pinion d of    leaves       inches diameter on the axis of which is fixed the cylinder dd   feet diameter and   feet long with the four projecting pieces of wood or switchers ssss that switch or thresh the corn as described above  then   0   x            the revolutions of the cylinder for one of the water wheel which multipled by    the medium revolutions of the water wheel per minute gives        the revolutions of the cylinder per minute this multiplied by   the number of switchers  view of the threshing machine erected at chillingham      with the circular rake and annrs dressed corn q  light corn p  c m  straw n    gives       the number of strokes per minute  and as the diameter of the cylinder is   feet the circumference will be      therefore         the revolutions of the cylinder per minute multiplied by      feet the circumference of the cylinder gives    0 feet the velocity of the switchers per minute  the large spur wheel a also drives the light cog wheel  of    cogs  0   inches diameter fixed on the axis kl of the rake for taking away the straw  then      the number of revolutions which the rake makes for one of the water wheel multiplied by    the revolutions of the water wheel per minute gives      nearly    the revolutions of the rake per minute which having   arms will clear the screen of straw    times per minute  the rollers  are moved by the pinion b of    leaves working into the slight castmetal wheel f fixed on the iron axis ii of the lower roller on which axis is also fixed a small pinion g of   leaves working into another h of equal number fixed on the axis this axis is fixed into the upper roller either by an universal joint or with a square tapering end to allow the upper roller to rise and fall according as the corn is fedin thicker or thinner and the concave board re is hung on a bolt to allow it to rise and fall with the roller of the upper roller which gives the two rollers an equable motion for taking in the corn  then       x    0       the revolutions of the rollers for one of the water wheel multiplied by    gives      the revolutions of the rollers per minute  and the diameter of the rollers being   inches the circumference will be       inches therefore       inches the circumference of the rollers multiplied by      the revolutions of the rollers per minute gives  0   inches of straw passing through the rollers per minute which  0  inches receive     strokes of the switchers in that time or nearly three strokes to an inch  when the rollers are required to move swifter or slower they may be driven very conveniently from the end of the axle of the rake by fixing a castmetal faced wheel on it with three rows of cogs    0 and    working into a shifting pinion of   leaves fixed on an iron axle at the other end of which is put a small bevel wheel of    teeth working into another of   teeth on the end of the axle of the lower roller  the fanners  are moved by a crossed rope passing over a pulley t  0 inches diameter fixed on the axis of the cylinder and another v of   inches diameter on the axis of the fanners then as the axle of the cylinder makes       revolutions per minute we have       x  0     0  revolutions of the fanners per minute  from the above it appears that when  the water wheel makes   revolutions in   minute the cylinder will make     ditto the rollers     nearly the rake     ditto and clears the skreen of straw    times per minute the fanners    0 ditto the switchers make     strokes per minute and move with a velocity of    0 feet per minute the rollers take in nearly  00 inches of corn per minute the medium length of good oats is about  0 inches and supposing half a sheaf put in at a time a whole sheaf will then be equal to  0 inches  therefore  00 0    sheaves per minute which agrees with the usual rate of going of this machine when supplied with a medium quantity of water from some experiments lately made   0 sheaves of oats were threshed in    minutes and yielded    bushels which is at the rate of    bushels per hour or     this must be considered as a medium quantity of short early oats   0 bushels might be threshed in the same time and of wheat with long straw not more than   0 bushels but a great deal depends on the care and constant attention of the feeder a trifling neglect in this point will make a considerable deficiency in the above quantities which we find is too often the case  where there is plenty of water so that a whole sheaf may be put in at once the quantity will be double to the above per day of   hours  the expense for the attendance on the threshing and dressing part of this machine is only that of three women viz one to feedin another to hand the sheaves to the feeder and the third to take away and riddle the corn after it is winnowed of course the expense of threshing and dressing     bushels is only  s  d  the expense of threshing the same quantity by the flail would be one twentyfifth part the wages here for threshing are one twentieth part of the grain when the thresher folds or bundles up the straw  and one twentyfifth when the straw is taken away loose as fatt as he threshes it the thresher assists in winnowing and finds a woman for the same purpose the farmer finds a man and two women or  0 bushels which at  s per bushel is   s to which must be added  s the expense of a man and two women to assist in winnowing making in all   s  the expense of erecting a threshing machine of this kind was from  0 to  0l but since the advance of wood iron and wages it will be now near  00l  machines of small dimensions are erected for about  0l which with   horses will thresh and dress   0 bushels of oats or  0 of wheat in   hours  rollers or small millstones are added to many of these machines for crushing or grinding grain for horses swine etc knives for cutting straw and many other useful appendages might be added  the winnowing machine is in universal use here we believe very little if any corn is dressed by any other means they were first made by a farmer of a mechanical genius called rogers who lived at cavers near hawick and whose grandson now a carpenter there still makes them perhaps of as useful a form as any other person and at as low rates as from  l  s to  l  old rogers we are told by his descendant happened in the year      to see a machine thrown out of the way as useless in an old granary at leith of which he took such notice that on his return home he set about making one the utility of which soon recommended it to many principal farmers in a few years they were universally used and are now become so absolutely necessary where large quantities of corn are to be dressed that it would be attended with considerable inconvenience to do without them of such great utility has been the superior discernment of this ingenious and unnoticed individual  the present mr rogers says he believes the machine his grandfather saw at leith was brought from holland an anonymous remarker who signs himself a scotch farmer states that it was first introduced by the late celebrated andrew fletcher of saltoun along with the barley mill from holland in the year      and we have somewhere read or heard that the dutch brought it from the chinese which is corroborated by the information we lately received from the honorable mr douglass a son of the earl of selkirk who was shown when on his travels in france by the late duke de rochefoucalt a set of chinese drawings representing the culture of rice in all its stages from the first planting to its being prepared for sale and that the last drawing was a representation of the dressing or winnowing which was performed by a machine exactly similar to that we now use for the same purpose  dr desaguliers blowing wheel which he presented to the royal society in      is exactly on the same principles  two men and three women will winnow dress and measure up into sacks   0 bushels of oats or   0 bushels of wheat per day  the expense  s  d  a pair of pruning shears represented in fig   pl   have been particularly recommended by mr tweddell of threepwood to the president of the board as being superior to any other implement for the purpose of cutting hedges  they consist of a strong sharp knise   inches long moving betwixt two squareedged cheeks the upper handle is   feet   inches long and the other   feet   inches  there are many other implements used in this county but as we believe most of them are such as are well known in other parts of the kingdom it would be of little use to describe them here  chapter vi enclosures the parts of this county capable of cultivation are in general well enclosed by live hedges the only exception is a small part of the vales of breamish till and glen but even here the advantage of having wellfenced fields is so well understood and so much desired by the tenants that we hope in eight or ten years the whole of this valuable district will be enclosed by proper fences  the size of enclosures varies with the size of farms in some parts from two to six or eight acres in the northern parts where the farms are large the fields are from  0 to  00 acres  the fences most generally used for new enclosures are earth mounds at the base of which and on the edge of the ditch out of which they are raised are planted the quicks generally upon a turned sod six inches high which we think too low as we always find the quicks grow much better when planted three sods high with the thickness of two surface sods laid under their roots this in most cases doubles and in thin soil trebles the surface soil and forms a thick bed of the best earth for the roots of the quicks to grow in as will be more clearly seen in the annexed sketch of such a sense fig   pl   where ab is the ditch   feet wide at top bcd the mound the base bd six feet wide and height cd four feet q the quicks planted upon three turned sods at least    inches high with surface sods and soil    inches thick under and behind their roots  the expense of making this kind of fence is  s  d per rood of   yards exclusive of quicks and railing  the quicks should never be planted nearer each other than nine inches and upon good land a foot quicks four or five years old with strong clean stems are always to be preferred to those that are younger and smaller  it is a custom in some parts to clip young quicks every year this makes the fence look neat and snug but it checks their growth and keeps them always weak in the plate v fig    fig    fig    fig    fig    fig    stem and when they grow old open at bottom while those that are left to nature get strong stems and side branches which by interweaving one with another make a thick and impenetrable hedge and if cut at proper intervals of nine or ten years will always maintain its superiority over those that have been clipped from their first planting in point of profit and of labor saved there is no comparison and for beauty we prefer nature and think a luxuriant hawthorn in full bloom or laden with its ripened fruit is a more pleasing enlivening and gratifying object than the stiff formal sameness produced by the shears of a gardener  walter trevelyan esquire of netherwitton showed us a new mode of raising fences  he erects an earth mound fig   pl     feet wide at bottom ab   feet wide at top cd and   feet high on the middle of the top he plants a row of quicks q and on each side at   feet distance puts in willow slakes ww an inch in diameter and   or   ft long sloping outward which take root and form a live fence for the preservation of the quicks in the middle  these stakes are at first bound together by a kind of oddering at the time we saw them they had been only two years done of course no judgment could be formed for some years to come whether it possessed superior advantages to the mode abovedescribed it appeared to us an experiment yet undetermined in some situations we are inclined to believe it may be very useful especially in cold soft marshy soils whether it will be superior in all we still entertain some doubts but are persuaded that a full trial will be given by the spirited improver who is making the experiment  the expense is  s  d per rood of   yards  stone walls are also used for fences in some situations the usual dimensions are   feet at bottom    or    inches at top and   to   feet high about half way up a row of throughstones are put at the rate of   or  0 in a rood of   yards and on the top a coping of sods or stones set edgeways the latter is preferable as being the most lasting and presenting a more awful aspect to deter the highland sheep from attempting to leap them  the expense of making these walls is from  s  d to  s  d a rood of   yards for winning and walling the expense of leading depends on the distance  twelve or fourteen cart load will do a rood  the advantages of enclosing private property in this county principally arise from separating lands of different qualities which can by these means be employed in such culture or depastured by such stock as the occupier thinks most suitable and where sheep are kept they feed with more facility and readiness being freed from the whims of the shepherd and the teazings of his dog and by separating the dry ground from the wet a stockmaster has it more in his power to avoid that fatal malady the rot  gates are made of various forms but agree nearly in size being generally   feet wide and from   to   feet high with   strong bars about   inches deep and a weaker one about   inch square placed between the two lowest bars  the lighter a gate is especially in the forepart the better provided it be sufficiently strong for this reason the top bar should be considerably stronger than the rest as it is the most liable to be broken especially where horses are kept if not made so high that they cannot easily get their necks over it the most approved form is that represented fig   pl    hanging gates so as to have a proper fall or tendency to shut of themselves being little understood by carpenters we hope the following directions for effecting that purpose may be acceptable  having set the post perpendicular let a plumbline ab be drawn upon it on this line at a proper height place the hook c so that it may project   inches from the face of the post and at a convenient distance below this place the lower hook d   inches to one side of the perpendicular line and projecting   inches from the face of the post then place the top loop or eye   inches from the face of the hawtree and the bottom loop   inches  thus hung the gate will have a tendency to shut in every position for if the weight of the gate be represented by the line cd fig   pl   this by the resolution of forces is resolvable into other two ce and de the former representing that part of the weight which presses in a perpendicular position and the latter that part of the weight which presses in a horizontal direction and gives the gate a tendency to shut   this principle has been long known and practiced in hanging gates that open both ways  chapter vii arable land sect    tillage the arable lands of this county being under various systems and directed by various opinions the management of the tillage must differ considerably  in the operation of ploughing it is generally agreed that the breadth of the furrow should be about   inches and the depth from   to   or   inches  it was formerly the general practice not to plough the lands intended for fallow till after spring seedtime and very often delayed till may or even june but now the fallows are ploughed before winter to meliorate by the frost  in the middle of april or beginning of may those that are intended for turnips or potatoes are harrowed and ploughed across and where necessary rolled with a heavy roller the same operations are repeated two or three or more times until it is thought sufficiently fine and clean for sowing or planting  those that are intended to be naked sallow for wheat receive three four of five ploughings through the summer but are seldom harrowed it being thought an advantage to wheat to have the land cloddy  on those fallows where quickens or couch grass etc are found every exertion is used to extirpate them by harrowing gathering and burning or leading off so long as the smallest remains are visible the lime and manure are mostly laid on before the last ploughing  for barley it is the general custom to plough only once but the best cultivators seldom sow this grain without giving two or three ploughings especially when the land is to be sown with clover and grass feeds  every other species of grain is sown after one ploughing except when beans or pease are to be drilled  trench ploughing is practiced by a few it is an excellen mode for breaking up grass lands and is performed by two ploughs following each other in the same furrow the first plough paring off the surface from   to   inches thick and turning it into the bottom of the lastmade furrow while the second plough going   or   inches deeper turns upon it a sod of friable earth which being destitute of tough fibrous roots harrows to a sine mould with little difficulty  this practice entirely obviates the objections to drilling upon clover lea and the additional expense will not be more than  s per acre which put in competition with the advantages to be derived from it will leave a considerable balance in favor of the practice in breaking up old swards on clayey lands the expense is almost saved in the harrowing on such soils it will be found of great service if they are thus ploughed in autumn they may be easily drilled with beans or pease in the spring and the subsequent hoeings performed with facility operations that would be very difficult to perform when ploughed in the manner usually practiced  the ridges are of various forms and sizes  on the deep soiled lands that were used as arable some centuries since the ridges are mostly very high broad and crooked it is a dangerous experiment to attempt to level and straighten ridges of this description too suddenly we have seen much mischief done by it upon lands that have been lately brought into cultivation they are straight nearly flat and in general about twelve or fifteen feet broad on dry lands they are quite flat and alternately gathered and split a breadth of fifteen feet answers best for sowing broadcast at two casts  a few years since the ploughing and various other purposes for which draughts are wanted upon a farm were performed by horses which in ploughing or harrowing are always yoked double and driven with cords by the ploughman and in general plough an acre a day but in the season of sowing turnips one and a half or even two acres are frequently ploughed on fine light soils but since the great advance in the price of horses oxen have been more used especially for the purposes of ploughing and carting about home  they are harnessed both with yokes and collars where three or four are used a boy is allowed to drive when two two oxen are sound very sufficient for ploughing light fallow lands in summer but for almost every other purpose   or   are used the man that holds the plough drives with cords they only plough half a day at a time one half of a team being used in the forenoon and the other in the afternoon  sect    fallowing the practice of making naked fallows on all kinds of soils once in   or   years was general through this county till the introduction of turnips in a few years the fallows of the dry lands were covered with this valuable plant on such other soils as were found improper for this root the naked fallows still prevail with an almost universal opinion that it is absolutely necessary to the fertility of the land yet there are some few who dare to doubt this longestablished doctrine and presume to think that naked fallows might be dispensed with in many situations by cultivating leguminous crops drilled at wide intervals to admit being ploughed or horsehoed between to which if proper handhoeings be added the land will be as well prepared for wheat as if it had been a complete naked fallow  this is not advanced on speculation or theory instances can be produced where no naked fallows have been made on fields of strong loam for    years yet they are as clear of quickens couchgrass or other pernicious weeds as any fields in the district that have been under naked fallow two or three times in the same period it may be necessary to observe that previous to the adoption of this system the land was cleared of quicken or couchgrass by a complete summer fallowing   whether fallowing is or is not necessary has been much agitated of late years so much so that the different partisans have obtained the appellation of fallowests and antifallowests it happens to be one of those subjects which can never be determined by reasoning opinions or bold assertions fair experiments only can resolve it and whatever may be the results of such experiments it may be justly concluded they will be the same in similar soils climates and situations  though we are diffident in giving a decided opinion upon so important a subject yet from observations made on the above facts we cannot help being inclined to think that the quantity of maked fallow might be very much reduced and in another century will probably be totally abolished if no fortuitous circumstances arise to check the exertions and spirit for improvement which have been so prevalent of late years and so generally diffused through this district  sect    rotation of crops the most prevailing rotation was   fallow   wheat   oats   fallow etc repeated for two three or four fallowings  upon the strong lands along the seacoast instead of oats after wheat they generally substitute pease or beans or beans and pease mixed when laid down to grass it is sown with grass seeds and continued in grass seven or more years  on dry soils after ploughing out from grass the rotation was   oats   oats   turnips sown broadcast limed and dunged and twice handhoed   barley or wheat sown up with clover and raygrass and continued in grass from four to seven or more years depastured principally with sheep   the best cultivators use the following rotations according to soil situation and circumstances  clayey soils   fallow   wheat   clover for   or   years depastured with sheep   beans or pease strong loams   turnips drilled at  0 inches intervals   barley     clover and grass seeds for   or   years depastured with sheep and a small proportion of cattle   oats   beans or pease drilled at  0 ins intervals horse and handhoed   wheat drilled from   to    ins intervals horse and handhoed sandy and dry light loams  after being ploughed out from grass   oats   turnips drilled at  0 ins intervals   barley or wheat drilled from   to    ins intervals hoed and sown up with clover and grassseeds depastured with sheep and a small proportion of cattle for three or more years   this last rotation has been practiced of late years and is becoming more general not only upon the turnip soils but upon the strong clayey lands substituting naked fallows or beans drilled at  0 ins intervals instead of turnips and those who have tried it on such strong lands find that after two or three years clover and grass seeds depastured with sheep the land will grow good crops of oats which they could never get it to do under their old system  those who have practiced the norfolk system on thin light soils find their crops grow worse especially the turnips and clover and many have been obliged to adopt this system by which they find their lands renovated and instead of having to complain that their soil was tired of turnips and clover they now find that it produces abundant crops and that every rotation brings it nearer its former fertility  sect    crops commonly cultivated wheat the preparation for the greatest quantity of wheat raised in this county is naked summer fallow  of late years considerable quantities have been grown after turnips it is also grown after rape clover beans pease tares and potatoes  the kinds of wheat grown here include many varieties and as they are known by different names in different districts we are afraid that by barely mentioning their names a very different variety may be taken for the one we mean and though we despair of pointing out such marked distinctions as accurately to distinguish them in all cases the shades of difference being often very small yet we hope there are some leading features which may help us to attempt an arrangement and in some measure better enable our readers to ascertain the variety intended for this purpose we shall divide them into two orders viz the smooth chaffed and the downy chaffed of which we shall enumerate the principal varieties now grown in this district we could wish to see this subject undertaken by professor martin who is well qualified to do it justice     smooth chaffed with a few short awns toward the top of the ear  zealand  ears long and large spicula very wide set   in   inches chaff white sometimes with a tinge of brown opening and showing the grain straw very long grain white and large  whitekent  ears middle sized   spicula in   inches chaff white opening and showing the grain when ripe straw shorter than the last grain white  golden ear  ears short spicula very close set   in   inches chaff a yellowish light brown short the grain white and easily shook out by the wind  burwellred  ears long and large spicula very wide set   in   inches chaff a dark brown red large and closed on the grain straw long grain red this variety has been much used of late years especially upon crude or newly broke up lands with great success and has in a manner superseded the common red wheat   ii downy chaffed with a few short awns toward the top of the ear  woollyear  ears middle sized spicula close set   in   inches chaff white closed on the grain straw long grain white  velvet ear or little wheat  ears small spicula close set   in   inches chaff white closed on the grain straw short grain white smaller shorter and plumper than the last the form of the grain of this variety is the most perfect of any other we have seen and from the shortness of the straw it is the best adapted to sow upon rich soils where there is a danger of the crop lodging and the appearance of the ear is less in every dimension  the downy chaffed wheats have shorter straw and are less liable to have the grain shaken out by winds the chaff embracing the grain more closely than the smooth chaffed tribes which is a considerable advantage but then we are apprehensive that this downiness makes them retain the dews and moisture upon the ear much longer than the smooth chaffed kinds and probably renders them much more liable to be affected by those diseases which give a dusky dark shade to the chaff and a rusty cankering upon the straw as we recollect few instances of smooth chaffed or red wheat being troubled with this disease of course the downy chaffed kinds are most proper for windy open situations and the smooth chaffed to well sheltered enclosed districts  the seed is selected with great attention from the most perfect samples and the practice of changing seed is thought advantageous for this purpose more or less new seed is every year imported from distant parts as kent essex huntingdonshire cambridgeshire etc  new seed is preferred to old and that immediately after being threshed rather than what has lain long in a granary  steeping in chamberlye and powdering with quick lime immediately after to make it sufficiently dry for sowing is generally practiced the smut is seldom seen where this is properly performed in a practice of  0 years the messrs culley have only had one instance of smut in their crops of wheat and this was where the seed had not been steeped and for a number of years they have not grown less than from four hundred to six hundred acres yearly and some go so far as to say that it will cure smutty seed a field at chillingham was sown in      with wheat in which were a few balls of smut onethird of the seed was steeped in chamberlye and limed onethird steeped in chamberlye dried and not limed the remainder was sown without either steeping or liming in the harvest of      the whole had a few straggling heads of smut but appeared to be most in that which was unsteeped  mr thompson of chillingham barns made a similar experiment and had smut equally alike in the pickled and unpickled but the head ridges were considerably the worst from hence it appears that steeping in chamberlye is not a preventive in all cases  it may be proper to remark that there are more complaints of smut this year than any other we remember in some places even barley was very much affected  we believe that on examination the stamina will always be found adhering to the balls of smut from which a suspicion arises that the cause may be owing to some defect in those parts probably from injuries received by insects weather etc as we frequently find the same ear bearing the most perfect grains along with grains of smut  the same experiment was repeated in      and intended to be continued for some years  it is done by throwing the wheat into a vessel full of chamberlye stirring it about with a strong stick and skimming off the light grains as they appear on the surface when this is done the liquor is let off by a plug or cock at the bottom of the vessel and the wheat taken out and mixed with quick lime after this the sooner it is sown the better because it is apt to heat and spoil if suffered to continue in the sacks or in large heaps but if dried and spread thin on a granary floor will keep several days  if the grain remains too long in very putrid chamberlye its vegetative powers will be injured   or  0 minutes are as long as it should be suffered to continue  the quantity sown is from two to three bushels per acre broadcast according to times of sowing nature and condition of the land etc  those who drill at  0 or    inch intervals find   bush per acre amply sufficient  the time of sowing on the lands that receive a naked summer fallow is september and october after drilled beans october and november and after turnips all through the winter as the land is cleared and weather suitable until the middle of march  in the year      many hundred acres were sown in glendale ward so late as the beginning of april which was all well harvested and produced on an average about    bush per acre of excellent grain in many cases superior to that sown in the autumn which was rather singular as it is generally expected that wheat sown so late does not produce the grain so well perfected as that which is sown earlier  this lateness of sowing was occasioned by the snow lying so late in the spring  and we are disposed to think from many experiments that on those light soils the month of february is the best and safest seedtime for wheat maslin and rye of all others in the year  for spring sowing the golden ear and the burwellred wheats are preferred to all others except where the land is in such high condition as to endanger the crop lodging then the velvet ear is used as not being so apt to lodge from the shortness of the straw in february      a field of   acres was sown after turnips with wheat a part with zealand the remainder with velvetear the produce from the zealand was  0 bushels per acre the velvetear    bushels but the latter was injured by a blight which was attributed to the moisture hanging longer on the chaff of the velvetear than on the other from which it appears that even zealand wheat may be sown in the spring with advantage the grain was as well perfected as heavy and sold for as high a price as any shown in the market that season  the triticum aestivum siberian wheat or springwheat was introduced and strongly recommended about twenty years since but wherever we have seen it tried the crops have been uncertain and produce small and though this flinty kind will ripen if sown even as late as april or beginning of may yet it has not been able to maintain a struggle with the varieties above specified and is now totally given up  the culture whilst growing of the broadcast crops consists only in handweeding  such as are drilled are hoed once or twice as well as handweeded where wanted these hoeings not only destroy the weeds but make a fine preparation for the clover and grass seeds which seldom fail where this operation is properly performed  for drilling  we find that ridges of    inches wide are the most convenient on these we drill   or   rows the horse going in the furrow   or   rows are deposited on each side and being afterward deeply waterfurrowed the land is kept much drier through the winter than when in broader ridges a matter of considerable importance to a wheat crop on moist soils  the produce varies considerably according to soils seasons culture etc from    to  0 bush per acre may be taken as a fair average crop under favorable circumstances as high as  0 and even  0 bush per acre sometimes occur  the manufacture of wheat into flour for exportation is principally carried on at alemouth waren and a few mills near berwick what is done in the vicinity of newcastle and other places is principally for home consumption  rye was formerly the principal grain grown upon all the dry sandy and light soils but since the use of lime and the introduction of turnips and artificial grasses it is rarely cultivated xcept upon very sandy soils the soils which formerly were occupied in growing rye are now so much consolidated and improved by the use of lime that they produce abundant crops of excellent wheat several thousand acres of which are now grown every year after turnips where thirty years since scarce a single bushel was ever produced it is sown after turnips or clover from september all through the winter till the beginning of april  the quantity sown is about two bushels per acre  the produce from twenty to thirty bushels per acre  upon lands intended for turnips next summer it is frequently sown in august and september along with rape as spring feed for sheep which often proves very valuable in the month of april  manufacture  the principal part of the rye grown in this district as well as considerable quantities imported from abroad is consumed in the southern parts of the county it being the most general bread of the laboring people in that quarter  after being leavened until it gains a considerable degree of acidity it is made into loaves and baked in a large brick oven or made into thick cakes   or   inches thick called four cakes and baked on the girdle  the bread is very firm and solid dark colored and retains its moisture or juciness longer than any other bread we know  maslin that is wheat and rye mixed is sown in some parts of the county the preparation quantity sown and produce are much the same as wheat its application is for household bread for which purpose many people think it superior to wheat alone especially when the proportion of rye is betwixt and of the whole  it has been remarked that when wheat and rye are grown mixed in this manner the grains of each are larger and more perfect than when grown singly without any admixture  barley is generally sown after turnips  in glendale ward a few farmers cultivate it in drills with   or    inch intervals  the kinds most commonly cultivated are   st the common long eared barley which being early productive and best liked by the maltsters is by far the most prevalent  this variety is distinguished from the next by the skin having a light red or purplish tinge a little before it is ripe and being marked with   dark red lines running longitudinally along the back of the grain and may be called the red stroked or dark skinned barley   d a variety of the long eared barley the awns of which drop or are easily shaken off when ripe from the grain being shorter plumper and rounder bodied than the common sort it is preferred by the millers for making into pearl barley  this variety ripens later than the common kind or red stroked barley by near a fortnight and is distinguished from it by the grains being closer set and the skin having a light yellowish tinge and not being marked by dark red lines it is also shorter in the straw and may be called the yellow or paleskinned longeard barley   d battledoor or spratbarley is sometimes grown and is preferred for sowing upon land in high condition where there is a danger of the other kinds lodging it is about three weeks later of ripening than the common kind   th bear bigg or fourrowed barley used to be the only species of barley cultivated in the county  it is now rarely sown except upon raw crude soils on which it is found to answer better than any other more especially if late sown owing to the turnips having been kept longer than usual in a cold backward spring for the use of the feeding and store stock  the quantity sown is from   to   bushels per acre broadcast when drilled at   to    inch intervals it is found that from   to   bushels per acre is sufficient  the time of sowing from the beginning of april to the latter end of may  the produce from  0 to  0 bush per acre  manufacture  great quantities are made into pot or shelled barley not only for home consumption but for exportation in the northern parts of the county very few corn mills are now to be found without the appendage of a barley mill  barley or barley mixed with gray pease or beans is the common bread of laboring people in the northern parts of this county previous to grinding they are mixed in the proportion of two parts barley and one of pease or beans after being ground the meal is sifted through a fine sieve made of wood to take out the rough husks and coarse bran it is then kneaded with water made into thin unleavened cakes and immediately baked on a girdle over the fire  in this district barley or mixed meal is seldom if ever leavened and baked in loaves  oats are universally grown throughout every part of the county they are sown after every species of grain as well as grass or clover lea  the varieties usually cultivated are   st poland oat  a variety of which called churchs oat from the name of the person mr church first had them from mr james robson apprentice of messrs culley who brought them out of scotland and gave mr church a handful those he brought to fenton were lost who first introduced them are now in high estimation and are the best early oat yet known for sowing upon loamy lands in good condition they are early very productive and much liked by the millers who give twopence per bushel more for them than the common oat this variety is known by the grains being remarkably short large plump round and well filled and not in the least tailed a bushel generally weighs    lb   d the dutch friezland or holland oat  were almost the only species of early oats grown here before the introduction of the church oat they are now only grown upon dry light lands to which they are better adapted than the poland oat   d peebles oat in some places it is called the red oat probably from its being not so fair as the common oat but it is very different from the red oat grown in the midland counties and ought not to be called by the same name for this reason we call it peebles oat  a variety of common oat but much earlier has been lately introduced from peebles shire in scotland it is a very proper oat for hilly districts not only for its earliness but in not being easily shaken by the wind the grains are the smallest of any other oat we know but from the very thin skin it meals well and is liked by the millers and ripens nearly as early as the dutch oat   th common oat the best seed of this kind of oat is got from blainsley in scotland  is grown upon all such lands as are not thought in sufficient condition for the poland or dutch kind   th angus oat  a variety of common oat has been introduced of late years from angusshire it is a better bodied grain than the common oat produces more straw and answers very well in early situations but its being later in ripening than the common oat will militate against its general adoption in a country where early harvests are so desirable this oat answers beyond every other in poor dry rabbit warren soils from its throwing up so much straw and on such soils ripens early enough   th tartarian oats  after several trials by different people about  0 years since were given up on account of the inferiority of the grain and the strong reedy straw being of little value for fodder we now find them cultivated in the midland parts of the county on rather an extensive scale being found there more productive than any other kind they have tried they speak of some crops being as high as  0 bushels an acre but we suspect these are under peculiarly favorable circumstances as we find that in comparison with angus oats both grown in the same field in the year      they produced no more than  0 bushels per acre though estimated by a strong advocate for them at near double that quantity the angus oats were more productive per acre and worth more to the millers by  d per bushel   th black oats  are seldom grown in this district we do not remember seeing them more than three or four times and then only by way of experiment  in point of earliness they succeed each other as classed above the angus oat being at least three or four weeks later than the poland and dutch  the quantity sown in general is seven bushels per acre of the poland and six of the dutch oats these quantities are necessary as they do not tiller much and are large bodied grain but for the other kinds we think four or five bushels sufficient  the time of sowing  is march or april and the early kinds are sown sometimes as late as the middle of may  the produce of common oats is from twenty to forty bushels per acre of the poland and dutch from forty to sixty there are some instances of seventy or eighty bushels per acre but these were generally attended with some favorable circumstances we have been informed by a principal corn merchant in berwick that the oats grown in glendale are fold in the london market for  s  d per quarter more than any other oats presented there   on fresh land and crude moory soils oats are probably the most profitable crop that can be sown old wornout tillage and strong clay land are improper for producing this grain it being found that in such situations they are scarce worth cultivating such soils are much better adapted to the culture of wheat pease beans vetches and other leguminous crops  the manufacture of oatmeal is carried on to a considerable extent both for exportation and home consumption oatmeal being a principal article of food with the great mass of inhabitants not as bread but in crowdies or hastypudding provincially meal kail for breakfast and supper the former is made by pouring boiling water upon the oatmeal and stirring it in with a stick or spoon shank till it be so very stiff that the stirring implement can with difficulty be got round it is then eaten with butter or milk this is the breakfast of many of the laboring people especially in the southern parts of the county and with which they reckon they can work longer hours than with hastypudding or a breakfast of bread and milk  hastypudding is made by putting oatmeal gradually into boiling water and stirring it about with a peeled stick thivel and letting it continue to boil in that thickened state until sufficiently enough when it is taken off the sire and poured out of the pan into pots or dishes to cool and then eaten with butter or more commonly skimmed milk it is an agreeable nutritive and healthy food and is the general breakfast and supper of the laboring people in the northern parts of the county  beans have time immemotial been a prevailing crop upon all the strong lands in the county especially along the sea coast to the southward they generally succeed wheat clover or old grass  the kinds cultivated are the large and the small horse bean and sometimes the mazagan they are sown in february four bushels and a half per acre broad cast and never hoed the produce very uncertain  0 bushels per acre a fair average broadcast crop  in this district the soil of which is so well adapted to the growth of beans it is surprising that drilling them should be totally neglected and that this beneficial mode of culture for both beans and pease should be confined to a few farmers in glendale ward and tweedside with these few they are drilled from  0 to    inches distance horsehoed or ploughed between and handhoed the crops good and the wheat that succeeds equal to that upon the summer fallows adjoining we find that two or three ploughings or horsehoeings between the rows and twice handhoeing in the rows are generally sufficient  the first horsehoeing or ploughing takes the earth from the rows and the second turns it back again to earth up the beans which are then in full bloom and from    to  0 inches high if the land be so very hard that a plough cannot penetrate it the horsehoe described page    must be first used  where beans are intended to be drilled we plough the land in autumn immediately after the corn is off gathering each ridge and harrowing it lengthways then set it up in onebout ridges at  0 inches distance and if the land be in broad high ridges directly across the ridges water furrowing after the whole is done and opening the hollow intervals into the water furrows this keeps the land dry and exposes the greatest quantity of surface to the influence of the atmosphere and amelioration of frosts  if any dung or manure be intended for the fallow we put it in the hollow intervals and cover it by splitting the onebout ridges with the plough and drawing a harrow once over in the direction of the onebout ridges the beans are then drilled upon them by the drill plough fig   pl   a field that in the usual rotation would have been naked fallow was thus prepared after oats and in february      drilled at  0 inches with large horse beans   bushels per acre the produce    in november it was drilled with wheat   bushels per acre at   inch intervals which was reaped in september following the produce    bushels per acre in      another field was drilled with beans at    inch intervals the produce    bushels per acre and in november drilled with wheat at    inch intervals the crop in july      is promising to be at least    bushels per acre and both fields are as clean or clear of quickens or other weeds as any lands in the county that were naked fallow one of them has been under this system for upwards of ten years   where the land is level it may be ploughed into ridges of    or    inches wide on the former with the large drill fig   pl   we drill two rows of beans and on the latter three in the first case the horse goes in the furrow and the machine drills a row on each side of it the distance of the rows    inches in the latter case the horse may go on the top of the ridge or what is better two horses may be yoked to it so that one may go in each furrow  pease were formerly a more general crop than at present they are mostly grown upon such lands as have been worn out by running too long in ploughing on such old tillage lands it is found that wheat pease vetches or tares are the only species of grain that can be raised to advantage the early and late gray pea are the only kinds cultivated here the latter is usually sown in february or march and the former in april three bushels is the quantity sown per acre broad cast and the quantity reaped depends very much on seasons no grain being so uncertain a crop as pease a good crop is reckoned at twentyfive to thirty bushels per acre they are also cultivated in drills from    to    inch intervals and horse and handhoed  spring tares  are grown principally for cutting as green food for horses to supply the vacancy between the first and second cutting of red clover used for the same purpose and for the same intention  winter tares  have been lately introduced and promise to answer well both kinds are grown upon the fallow lands intended for wheat or late turnips  the winter tares are sown in september and the other in march  potatoes of this invaluable root the varieties cultiviated here are very numerous and frequently changing many of the kinds that were formerly in repute being now in a manner lost as the true kidney the rough white the blood red the tawny etc and their places supplied by others  for the table the sorts most in repute at present are three or four different kinds of long whites one of which having a red end is called redsnout or redneb and several sorts of round whites and the pinkeye or red streak which is a late potatoe and the best for eating in the spring of any we know  it is frequently used till the beginning of july  for stock the principal kinds used are the champion and the blackamoor or blackpotatoe  they are generally cultivated in drills from    to  0 inches distance whole potatoes are seldom or never used for sets but cut into pieces containing one or two sprouts or eyes these are planted about    inches distance in the bottom of the drill the dung laid upon them and the soil turned upon the whole by the plough splitting the onebout ridges they are kept clean by handhoeing and ploughing between the drills and as the stems advance in height they are earthed up by a common or double mould board plough with which implements they are frequently taken up by splitting the drills in which they grow and the roots gathered by women and children  they are seldom grown for the use of stock except for horses to which they are given raw the practice of preparing potatoes by steam has not yet taken place in this county we believe it would be a material improvement after the rate of two pecks per day each horse and found very useful in the spring when the straw and hay become dry and are serviceable for preventing grease or other disorders by keeping the horses cool and open they are sometimes given to cattle and sheep in the spring when a scarcity of turnips prevails  the mode of preserving them through the winter is by laying them in heaps upon a piece of dry ground and covering them with straw   or   inches thick and over the straw another cover of soil about a foot thick which soil is got by making a ditch from    to    inches deep round the heap a bed of straw should be laid at the bottom  turnips have not been used in this county as food for supporting cattle and sheep much above seventy years mr edward nisbet who is now near  0 years of age says that it is upwards of  0 years since mr proctor the proprietor of rock brought andrew willey a gardener to cultivate turnips at rock for the purpose of feeding cattle that willey afterward settled at lesbury as a gardener and was employed for many years to sow turnips for all the neighborhood and his business this way was so great he was obliged to ride and sow that he might dispatch the greater quantity the practice of hoeing was also introduced at this time for this purpose they were first grown in the northern parts of the county it is but of late years they have been cultivated on part of tyneside  the varieties  are the green top the red top and the white top which last is by far the most general and in the greatest repute being superior to the others in size and sweetness  there is a small hard white kind preferred by some on account it is said of standing the winter better than most others but it does not grow near so large a quantity upon an acre  at their first introduction they were sown broadcast and hoed by gardeners and other men at extravagant wages the late ingenious mr ilderton about twentyseven years since had the merit of first reducing the price of hoeing by teaching boys girls and women to perform the work equally as well if not better than men the mode he took was simple and ingenious by a light plough without a mouldboard he divided the field into small squares of equal magnitude and directed the boys and girls to leave a certain number of plants in each square in a short time they became accurate regular and expert hoers and in a few years all the turnips of the country were hoed by women and boys at half the expense and better than by men  the present mode of drilling turnips was first introduced into this county about the year    0 the advantages with which it is attended have so far recommended the practice that very few are now sown broadcast the broadcast culture of turnips in the northern parts of the county for many years previous to this was not inferior to any we ever saw and in respect to accurate regular clean hoeing superior to what we ever observed in norfolk suffolk or other turnip districts which we have frequently examined and as we think it is an operation that may be serviceable in other districts we shall be more particular in describing the manner of performing it  the land being made sine prepared etc as in the broadcast method the ploughman draws his first furrow as straight as possible in returning he keeps his far side horse in the new made furrow and his plough at such a distance as to form a onebout ridge like l by proceeding in this manner the land when finished will appear thus llllllll the distance of these little ridges is from twentyseven to thirty inches a less distance does not admit of ploughing between the drills  the next operation is spreading the dung which is performed by a cart going down every third or fifth furrow and laying the dung in small heaps women and boys follow with small threepronged forks and spread it evenly in the bottom of three or five furrows that is the one where the dung is dropped from the cart and those on each side of it this done the ploughman splits the onebout ridges before raised and covers up the dung exactly in the middle but before the seed can be sown these last formed onebout ridges require to be flattened at the top by a small roller that flattens two ridges at once upon the top and exactly in the middle of these flattened ridges the seed is deposited by one or two drill machines tied to the roller by a rope six or seven feet long at which distance they follow the roller each machine being guided by a man see fig   pl   when finished the work appears in this form where s represents the feed and d the dung directly under it which is wholly employed in promoting the vegetation of the turnips  the roller is drawn by one horse driven by a boy setting up the ridges and covering in the dung is performed by a common swing plough the quantity of seed sown from one to two pound per acre it being better to have an abundance of plants for fear of accidents the quantity of dung used is from ten to fifteen twohorse cartloads per acre  when the plants have four leaves we begin to hoe and as they have so much room sideways we leave them only eight or nine inches distance from one another in the rows or drills the hoers go sideways and pull the surplus plants weeds etc into the hollow intervals between the onebout ridges and the turnips are left as regular as if they were planted this work is performed by women and children with the greatest care and exactness at the expense of four shillings per acre  as soon as the plants are recovered which will be in eight or ten days a small plough see fig   pl   five inches wide at the bottom behind and eleven inches at top drawn by one horse takes the earth from the turnip rows and with the soil covers the weeds etc which the hoers had pulled into the hollow intervals between the ridges a second hoeing takes place when the plants are strong enough and otherwise necessary and a few days after the soil or earth before ploughed from the turnip rows into the hollow intervals is now equally divided and laid up to each drill or ridge again by the same small plough and one horse or with a double mouldboard plough  this finishes the business unless the land has been very wild and out of condition and requires more hoeing and ploughing between the drills  if the drills are made in the same directions of the ridges at the next ploughing for corn the surface will be irregular and the dung unequally distributed to avoid this on dry level lands the drills are made diagonally across the field but where the ridges are high it is best to make the drills directly across the ridges and draw a plough down the furrows to take off the water  it is generally supposed that a weightier crop is produced by the drill than the broadcast method turnips drilled in this manner were sold in      for  l an acre for feeding cattle and sheep a much higher price than was given for any sown broadcast and we have known instances upon thin poor light soils that the crop of turnips was of more value than the fee simple of the land upon which they grew which we hope will remove the doubts of those who have suspected that this mode would not answer upon weak thin soils to such soils it is certainly the best adapted of all others but even admitting them equal in this respect the superiority as a fallow crop must be allowed to the drill for the repeated ploughings in the intervals and handhoeings in the rows effectually extirpate the whole race of annual weeds and so much surface being exposed through the winter makes a higher preparation for any succeeding crop another advantage is the facility with which they are hoed as a boy or girl nine or ten years old can hoe them with the greatest ease and generally better than experienced broadcast hoers who are apt to take too many plants away while the young ones from the apprehension of making them too thin will leave them at any distance you show them  the application of turnips in this county is mostly to feeding and rearing cattle and sheep and some small quantities for raising seed  when used for cattle they are always led off from where they grow being previously cleared of the earth and fibrous roots as they are pulled in order to keep them as clean as possible when the cattle are tied up in sheds which we think much better than being out in the fields they are foddered with turnips eight or nine times a day and with straw or hay twice great attention ought to be paid to keeping their cribs clean  when the convenience of sheds cannot be had they are given to the cattle in a dry grass field scattered as thin as circumstances will admit a crib with straw in it should be constantly in the field for the cattle to serve themselves whenever they choose  for sheep they are sometimes eaten upon the ground where they grow particularly if a dry light sandy soil but more generally led off into an adjoining field the fields into which the turnips are led to be eaten are such as are intended to be ploughed up next year for wheat or oats  thus every field in rotation reaps the benefit of having the turnips eaten upon it which we find much preferable to the system of eating them upon the field where they grow which we think a much better and more economical practice the sheep getting a daily regular supply of fresh food and the shells being kept clean are eaten by young cattle or those that are to be fattened next summer upon grass  sometimes every other ridge is led off and the remainder eaten upon the ground where they grow  when eaten upon the ground the sheep are not turned upon the whole at once but have it portioned out to them by hurdles or nets so that they may have a fresh break once a week or ten days  for seed the turnips of the best form are selected and transplanted in the month of october november or december into a piece of ground properly prepared to receive them in july or august following it is generally reaped tied up in sheaves and when dry put into a long stack where it is kept through the winter and threshed out in april or may  the trouble of selecting and transplanting is sometimes dispensed with but the seed raised in this manner is sold for onehalf or onethird the price of the transplanted seed that is when the transplanted seed is sold for  s per lb the other is sold for  d or  d  the produce is very variable being subject to many casualties  the average crop may be reckoned about  0 bushels or half a ton per acre  the land should be good and well manured after the crop as we find the soil much impoverished by it  history of drilled turnips to trace useful discoveries from their origin through their various stages of improvement is in most cases both useful and entertaining and teaches us not to despair though our first attempts may be unsuccessful but rather hope that by perseverance and varying modes and circumstances we shall at last attain the object sought for the method of cultivating turnips described above is an encouraging instance of this observation  as we find that mr tull first cultivated turnips at three feet distance  for in his essay on the principles of tillage and vegetation under the article turnips page    he says when i drilled upon the level it is impossible to hoeplough them so well when planted upon the level as when they are planted upon ridges for if we plough deep near to the row the earth will come over on the left side of the plough and bury the young turnips but when they stand on ridges the earth will almost all fall down on the right side into the furrow in the middle of the interval at three feet intervals a trial was made between those turnips and a field of the next neighbors sown broadcast at the same time whereof the handhoeing cost ten shillings per acre and had not quite half the crop of the drilled both being measured by the bushel on purpose to find the difference and i have since found that turnips on the same land planted on ridges with six foot intervals make a crop double to those that are planted on the level or even on ridges with three feet intervals   drilled turnips by being no where but in the rows may be more easily seen that those which come up at random and may therefore be sooner singled out by the handhoe which is another advantage because the sooner the sooner they are made single the better but yet when they are not very thick they may stand till we have the best convenience of singling them without much damage but when they come up extraordinary thick it will be much more difficult to make them single if they are neglected at their very first coming into rough leaf they are singled out the better they will thrive page     we need not be very exact in the number or distance the distance need not be regular for when a turnip has six inches of room on one side and eighteen on the other it is almost as well as if there was one foot on each side we set them out at we contrive to leave the master turnips when there is so much difference in them and spre such when near one another and leave the more space before and behind them but if there be three master turnips together we take out the middlemost page  00  dung and tillage together will always attain the necessary degree of pulverization in less time than ploughing can do alone therefore dung is more useful for turnips because they have commonly less time to grow than other plants page  0   i have had great crops of turnips in rows three feet asunder and much greater than i could ever obtain from rows thirty inches asunder but one reason why i like six foot rows better is that the largest turnips are best for oxen and are pulled up and loaded with the least expense  i find that the least competent number will cateris paribus always be the largest preface page ix  several lands of turnips drilled on the level of three foot rows ploughed and doubly dunged and also horsehoed did not produce near so good a crop of turnips as six foot rows adjoining horsehoed though no dung had been thereon for many years  there was no other difference than that the three foot rows did not admit the hoeplough to raise half the artificial posture as the six foot rows did the dung ploughed into the narrow intervals before drilling could operate no farther with any great effect than the hoeplough could turn it up and help it in its pulverization  from these extracts it appears that mr tull cultivated turnips in rows not only on the level but on the tops of two and a half and three feet ridges and both horse and handhoed as at present but whether he put dung in the bottom of those ridges is not so clear from the expression the dung ploughed into the narrow intervals before drilling it is unfortunate that this ingenious gentleman to support a whimsical theory should not allow that dung was of any other use in vegetation than in pulverizing the soil though he is obliged to admit that for cabbages turnips carrots and potatoes it will make the crops greater and the cattle will like them never the worse page      but his disciples entertained juster notions of the properties and value of dung to neglect it as will appear in the sequel  we are informed by a gentleman who went to direct the management of an estate in dumfriesshire in      that mr craik of arbigland near dumfries had then drilled turnips betwixt twenty and thirty years by taking the medium his first beginning would be about      the mode he pursued was as follows  in the autumn as soon as the corn crop was off he ploughed his land into twobout ridges in which state it continued all winter next spring these ridges were ploughed and harrowed until sufficiently pulverized and at last split to make a hollow furrow for depositing the dung which was covered in by the plough going twice about making a ridge near four feet wide then this twobout ridge was harrowed a singlewheel drill turning round a hollow cylinder of tin with holes in it deposited the seed directly over the dung the drill had a small roller behind to cover in the seed and was drawn by one horse when the plants were ready for hoeing they were set out at ten or twelve inches distance one from another in the rows and the intervals ploughed between through the summer as often as necessary  from this place it is probable that the practice had traveled into cumberland for in the year      philip howard esquire of corby first cultivated turnips in that county in drills with four feet intervals finding the distance too wide he reduced it to two feet and continued it for ten years before it was followed by the farmers who now pursue the same mode with little variation except that they make the distance of the intervals about twentyseven inches the onebout ridges in which the dung is deposited are here called stitches and are flattened at the top by drawing a piece of wood over them instead of a roller or a harrow  about the year      or      mr pringle formerly a surgeon in the army who had an estate near coldstream in berwickshire was the first person in that neighborhood who cultivated turnips in this manner his drills were at three feet and a half distance mr cox a sergeant whom mr pringle brought home with him for a servant says that his master took his hints from mr tulls book and that he also drilled all his corn crops until he had overcome the annual weeds  mr william dawson who was well acquainted with the turnip culture in england having been purposely sent to reside in those districts for six or seven years where the best cultivation was pursued with an intention not only of seeing but of making himself master of the manual operations and of every minutia in the practice was convinced of the superiority of mr pringles mode over every other he had seen either in norfolk or elsewhere and in      when he entered to frogden farm near kelso in roxburghshire he immediately adopted the practice upon a large scale to the amount of  00 acres yearly he began by drilling at three feet distance but a few years after trying various widths of intervals he reduced it to two feet and a half which he still continues as far as we have been able to obtain information he was the first that used a roller for flattening the tops of the onebout ridges  it may not be improper to remark that mr pringle pursued this mode for several years yet none of his neighbors followed the example but no sooner did mr dawson an actual farmer adopt the same system than it was immediately followed not only by several farmers in his vicinity but by those very farmers adjoining mr pringle whose crops they had seen for ten or twelve years so much superior to their own it is also deserving of notice that when mr dawson settled at frogden the whole of that district was under the most wretched system of cultivation and the farmers unacquainted with the value of turnips artificial grasses and lime at first his practice met with many opponents and was ridiculed by the old the ignorant ant and the prejudiced but his superior crops and profits soon made converts the practice in a few years became general and this district is now amongst the best cultivated in the kingdom the land trebled in value and the aspect of the country greatly improved it is a pleasing reflection that the example and exertions of one man has been capable of producing so great so lasting and inestimable benefits and it is more than probable that this mode of cultivating turnips would have died away with mr pringle and the practice been lost to this district had it not been for the discernment and intelligence of this individual  we remember seeing about twentyfive years since turnips cultivated in this manner by mr christopher benson of stainsby near ripley in yorkshire an ingenious gentleman and great advocate for drilling and who had drilled all his corn crops for many years his nephew mr donkin informs us that he had cultivated turnips in this manner more than twenty years before this which will be prior to the year    0  in mr bensons practice described by himself in dr hunters georgical essays page     the seed is drilled upon the dung and that and the seed covered together by harrowing across the ridges his nephew says the dung and seed were covered in by a double mouldboard plough set wide and then harrowed in this paper he very properly sums up the advantages of this mode of cultivating turnips he observes the seed being placed upon the moist dung will vegetate early in all circumstances of the weather and the manure being well covered will be secured from evaporation in the hotest seasons the turnips being placed immediately over the manure have a ready passage by means of their tap roots into rich bed of nutriment which will accelerate their growth and increase their size as the crop grows upon ridges with a trench on each side it is obvious that the turnips will remain dry in the wettest seasons a circumstance of the utmost utility to those advantages we may add the doubling of the soil which i consider as an important article in all situations where the staple of the land happens to be thin  from a review of the whole it appears that the present mode of cultivating turnips by drilling in rows at two feet and two feet and a half distance had occurred to different people in different parts who all at first began according to mr tulls directions with the addition of dung put in the bottom of the ridge and after trying various width of intervals found that the best and most convenient distance was from twentyfour to thirty inches but it is very clear that mr tull is the root from whence this excellent practice first originated  this mode of cultivating turnips is now spreading far and wide with great rapidity besides this county it is also the general practice of roxburghshire and berwickshire and has been lately adopted by the best cultivators in various districts of scotland as well as different parts of england amongst which the county of norfolk will particularly prosit by it as a firstrate cultivator who holds a large farm in that county has procured the proper apparatus from hence and sent his son to be instructed in the different operations it has also found its way into dorsetshire we had the pleasure of seeing it practiced with great success by the ingenious mr boswell of piddletown and to the farmers of devonshire it has been particularly recommended as the best system known by the celebrated mr marshall who has minutely examined and is well acquainted with the agriculture of the greatest part of the kingdom this gentleman has published the rural economy of norfolk yorkshire midland counties gloucestershire the west of england etc  and the president of the board adds that this gentleman informed him that the best cultivators and most intelligent farmers he had ever seen were those who practiced this system on tweedside  sect    crops not commonly cultivated ruta baga  has been tried by a few but not so long as is necessary to draw any positive conclusions respecting its comparative merits with us it is not near so valuable as the common turnip hares are remarkably fond of it and will not touch the other turnips while there is one of these in the field  rape  is seldom grown for feed and perhaps not so often for sheep as it ought on lands improper for turnips upon lands that have grown early oats and are intended for fallow next year it is sometimes sown in september as spring seed for sheep to supply the vacancy between turnips and clover for this purpose a little rye is sown along with it  cabbages  were cultivated but gave way again to turnips it being thought that the latter answer as good a purpose and are obtained with less trouble  carrots  have been frequently tried but have hitherto made little or no progress probably from the great trouble attending their cultivation compared with potatoes which in some measure answer the same intention as food for horses  flax  was formerly cultivated in small quantities for family use but is now in a great measure given up it having been found that land which had grown flax was so much impoverished as to require an extra manuring before it could be brought to the same state of fertility as the rest of the field  woad isatis tinctoria  this plant the leaves of which are so useful in dying it is not only much used by dyers for its blue color but also for the basis of many other colors it was with the juice of this plant that the ancient britons stained their bodies to make them appear more terrible to their enemies is cultivated at newburn only on the banks of the tyne by messrs rait pollock and dun  the ground is ploughed with a deep furrow before winter and made as fine as possible against april in which month it is sown at the rate of   bushels per acre broadcast in about a fortnight after it makes its appearance above ground particular care is taken to keep it clear of weeds which is done by boys and girls from  0 to    years of age two workers to an acre from the beginning of april to december is the general allowance who have each a spade about   inches long and   inches broad which they use with one hand to dig up the weeds and with the other gather them this process is repeated two or three times before cropping which is done by wringing off the leaves of the plant with their hands and putting them in baskets  the first crop is generally gathered the latter end of july the second the last week in september and the third in november but this is only from off such parts where the second crop was gathered first it is carried from the field in carts to the mill where it is ground into a green paste and made into balls about   inches diameter when it is set upon ranges under sheds to dry which is done in two or three weeks after this it is put into the house or pen and kept till all the fields are gathered and afterward manufactured mr rait in a letter to the president states that he had discovered that indigo might be made from the juice that is pressed out by the mill in manufacturing the leaves but it seems he has not yet accomplished it as in a subsequent letter he says my views upon the whole of this business terminate in one of two points the first is to have the particles of color separated from the liquor and made a marketable article by itself as indigo is failing of that to apply it to the use of vats along with the liquor or juice in which it is in the most improved state we can arrive at   sect    corn harvest the corn harvest  in the vale of till and upon tyneside near hexham frequently begins the first week in august while upon the cold backward soils and situations oats will be often uncut the latter end of october or beginning of november but the most general harvest is in september most of the corn is cut with sickles by women seven of whom with a man to bind after them generally reap two acres per day  oats and barley are sometimes mown  wheat is set up in stooks of twelve sheaves each oats and barley are gated set up in single sheaves and when dry bound tight at the bottom and led home or set up in stooks of ten sheaves each the stacks are mostly round but some of the best farmers set up their barley and wheat in long narrow stacks which keep the corn much better and dryer and the practice of placing corn upon stone pillars with a cap or cover over them to keep out the mice and a frame of wood over all is gaining ground and cannot be too much recommended as it not only prevents the mice getting to it but keeps the corn dry and airy it is an excellent method for grain that is to be kept until summer and one principal advantage is that wheat may be led from the field and set upon those stands almost as soon as reaped  they are made both round and oblong but most of the latter  chapter viii grass sect    natural meadows and pastures what is generally understood by natural meadows are such lands as are overflowed by rivers and produce a crop of hay every year without any returns of manure of this description of meadows we have very few in this county what are called meadows here are such old grass lands as are employed for growing hay almost every year the greatest part of which are uplands to enable them to stand this severe cropping they are or ought to be manured on the surface every third or fourth year if this operation be neglected they impoverish very fast where they cannot conveniently be dunged as above they are depastured one year and mown the other or what is better depastured two years and mown the third the produce from   to   tons per acre a fair crop the aftermath or fog is frequently let from  0 to    shillings per acre and is mostly consumed in fattening oxen and cows  lands that are intended for meadow are freed from being depastured with any kind of stock at different times in the spring from the beginning of april to the middle of may as best suits the convenience of the occupier particular attention is paid to the molehills dung etc being scaled spread abroad and the stones and other matters that might obstruct the operations of the scythe are carefully gathered off  natural pastures or old grass land are most prevalent along the sea coast these are depastured with both sheep and oxen the general mode of stinting being two acres to an ox and the same quantity of ground to   or  0 sheep through the summer and from   to   sheep per acre through the winter the latter are either the store flock or ewes for fat lambs  sometimes cheviot wethers   years old in good condition are put in those pastures after the fatting cattle are taken out and pay well if they get sufficiently fat to be sold to the butchers about christmas  sect    artificial grasses the artificial grasses most commonly cultivated in this county are red clover trifolium pratense white clover trifolium repens and raygrass lolium perenne with these some people mix ribgrass plantago lanceolata and upon sandy soils hopmedic this in some places is called hoptrefoil a name properly belonging to a very different plant viz  trifolium agrarium medicago lupulina is sown with success  few of these grasses are ever grown alone except red clover when intended to continue only one year and even then a small portion of raygrass from one to three gallons per acre is generally sown with it we think with much propriety as it not only comes early in the spring but thickens the crop and facilitates making the clover into hay  but when land is intended to continue for three or more years in grass they are generally mixed in the proportion of eight or ten pounds of red clover four pounds of white clover and half a bushel of raygrass per acre to the above quantities are sometimes added three or four pounds of ribgrass and hopmedic as the soil suits when red clover is grown alone  0 or    pounds an acre are sown upon dry friable soils and from    to    pounds upon strong loams or clays they are sown in march april and may upon lands fallowed the summer preceding for wheat or turnips succeeded by barley and ought always to be harrowed in as well as rolled harrowing is particularly necessary upon strong lands growing wheat and across the ridges is the best mode of performing the operation we find that where corn is drilled and the intervals hoed it pulverizes the soil and makes the finest preparation for grass seeds of all others where this is properly done and harrowed once across after the seeds are sown they seldom or never miss long experience having proved that nothing requires a finer tilth than clover and grass seeds  upon the best soils the clover and raygrass mixed are generally ready to depasture with fat sheep by the beginning of april and from may through the summer will carry six or eight sheep per acre according to the luxuriance of the crop and fertility of the soil the second and remaining years they are depastured by the store flock these pastures are frequently mown when the raygrass begins to flower which not only increases the bottom grass but a quantity of excellent hay is obtained of considerable value  when the clovers are not depastured but kept for hay they are generally mown about the latter end of june the average produce about   tons per acre the second crop is rarely cut for hay but depastured by cattle or sheep chiefly the latter when cattle are put into a fresh clover fog especially in wet weather they sometimes hove by the sudden fermentation of the clover to prevent this inconvenience cattle are put upon it in the middle of the day when it is free from dew or any moisture they being first filled with natural grass which hinders them from eating so greedily as if put on hungry if the clover once pass they seldom take any harm afterward by using this precaution we have not had any cattle hoven for several years  when very much swelled an instrument is used similar to that used by surgeons in tapping for the dropsy it is so contrived that after being thrust in between the hip and rib on the near side one part pulls out while a tube remains in the orifice through which an amazing quantity of fetid air escapes and relieves the animal but they are very apt to hove again afterward  we have heard of hoven cattle being relieved by giving them an egg shell full of tar  the practice of keeping horses in the house sheds or foldyards all summer upon cut clover tares etc was introduced into this county about the year    0 it is now generally adopted by the best farmers who find their horses thrive better are cheaper kept than depasturing at large and also that a quantity of manure is gained by this means which otherwise would have been in a great measure lost or of very little use as the dung of horses when dropped in pastures is mostly destroyed by insects in the summer season  an acre of good clover used in this manner will keep from   to   horses from the beginning of june till the end of october about  0 weeks  saintfoin lucern and chicory have been tried on a small scale but do not seem to come into general use the crops of clover being thought more valuable  in order to draw any fair comparative value between the produce of old grass lands and artificial grasses the soil and situation ought to be exactly alike and experiments accurately conducted for want of such data no just conclusions can be made but we believe that general observation and experience have established an opinion that the same lands which in a state of old grass carried   sheep an acre will for the first year of clover and raygrass grass depasture   or   on rich old grazing pastures the difference will probably not be so great and what they fall short in summer will be made up by their superiority in winter on clayey soils it would certainly be a dangerous experiment to convert those rich grazing pastures into tillage as a certain portion of such is a valuable acquisition to every farm but they are so rarely scattered that few farms are so fortunate as to enjoy so desirable an appendage  sect    hay harvest the hay harvest is seldom begun before the middle of june the mowers cut from half an acre to three quarters a day and that very ill the haymakers are equally indolent and inactive after the grass is cut it is by some tedded strewed or spread abroad and repeatedly turned till dry we never ted or strew clover when mown but turn it in the swathe with the head of the rake backward and forward until it be fit to put into large cocks or pikes which we prefer to every other mode we have seen as it preserves the leaves upon the clover much better than when strewed abroad others the day after it has been tedded or strewed put in into foot cocks wappings which can scarcely be too small if the weather keeps dry it is in two days more put into large cocks if the weather proves wet we know no mode by which it will save better or waste the smell less as the rain passes through them and a small quantity of air or sun dries them again or they are easily turned over  in either mode when sufficiently dry it is put into ricklets provincially pikes of about half a ton each in the field which stand there for two three or more weeks until a convenient opportunity offers for leading them home to be put into one large stack in these ricklets the hay takes a first sweating which prevents its heating when put into larger masses  for the purpose of drawing it together to be put into pikes or ricklets it is either cocked or put into large heaps which are trailed in by one horse yoked to the ends of a long rope put round the bottoms of those cocks or heaps upon the hind part of which a boy gets with his feet to keep it down and prevent its slipping over the top of the hay when arrived at the place wanted one end of the rope is taken off the hook at the horses shoulder and being thus loosened at one end the horse moves forward when the rope draws through under the hay and leaves it  when the hay is neither put into cocks nor large heaps but remains in a thick row tis then necessary to use two horses viz  one yoked to each end of a strong sweeping rope and two persons to get upon the rope with their feet one on each side the row who rest with their arms upon the hay and step forward on the rope as the hay gathers to prevent the hay from slipping off behind a small cord is fastened to the hind part of the sweeping rope and extended to each persons hand which they let out as they step forward or find otherwise necessary by either of the above modes the hay grown upon a field of   or  0 acres may be drawn together in a few hours and is much more expeditious than either fledges or carts  when the large stack is made in the field the pikes are drawn to it by putting a strong rope round their bottom the two ends of which are fastened to the hind part of a cart in which are yoked   or   horses  this saves the trouble of forking and loading them in carts and is done in much less time  sect    feeding on  are mostly grazed in the eastern part of the county and a few in the vicinity of whittingham they are bought in may or june and sold as they become ready to supply the large fleets of colliers and other trading vessels belonging to newcastle shields sunderland hartley and blythe  some few graziers buy only such oxen as are forward by having got turnips in the spring these generally go off in june and are followed by cows heifers or kyloes an excellent breed of small cattle from the highlands of scotland of which those that do not get fat on the pasture to be sold through the summer are put upon fogs aftermaths and sold in november and december the cows are also bought in the spring months and are chiefly used for home consumption the kyloes are bought at falkirktrysts meetings or at newcastle fair in the autumn and wintered upon coarse rough ground or straw sometimes a few turnips are given in the spring and are sold all through the summer as they become fit for the butcher to supply newcastle and other markets those that are ready to go off in june always leave the most profit beef being frequently sold at that season for a shilling a stone more than the ordinary prices  the profit of grazing like all other speculations varies with circumstances but we believe we may venture to average it at  l or  l  0s for keeping on grass from may day to michaelmas cows in general leave more than oxen in proportion to their weight but they are subject to disorders of the udder that frequently reduce the profit and deter many people from grazing them  some few graziers follow the old custom of keeping only one kind of stock upon the same ground whilst others we think with more propriety intermix with oxen and cows a few sheep and two or three colts in each pasture which both turn to good account and do little injury to the grazing cattle in some cases sheep are a real benefit by eating down and destroying the ragwort senecio jacobaeo which disgraces some of the best pastures in the county where oxen only are grazed  sheep that have been wintered upon turnips are put to the earliest grass that can be obtained the clovers and raygrass are generally ready in april the old grass lands not before may in both situations they are continued till shorn and sold off from the latter end of may through all june and part of july from  l to  l   s each in      the prices were from  l  0s to  l  0s each the draft ewes or shearling wethers intended for turnips next winter succeed them and thus a regular rotation is kept up of late years some farmers have sold their shearling wethers in july when only    months old to the butchers for as high prices as from  0 to    shillings each in      they sold from  0 to    shillings each and in      as high as  0 shillings after shearing a fleece worth   shillings  a large portion of the lands of this county being liable to the rot and unsafe for a breeding flock the occupiers of such situations venture ewes for fat lambs for one year these are bought in the autumn put to tup early some in august the lambs sold in may june and july after which the ewes are fatted and sold in october and november  such lambs as are early and go off in may often sell for  0 shillings each but the others average at about   s  d the price of fat ewes depends much on their being of a good or

year 0    0  mr hay of lesbury and mr watson of waren not having so ready a market for the great quantities of bran pollard and oatchimmings which their extensive manufactures of flour and oatmeal produce have applied it to feeding different kinds of stock they both agree that for feeding pigs it is of little value one of the gentlemen says that from some experiments he had read he was induced to enter largely on the business and persevered in it till he lost upwards of a thousand pounds  for horses  they both think it very valuable along with hay or straw instead of corn mr watson allows his horses   bushels of bran or   bushels of pollard and   of oat seeds per week the average price of which is about   shillings the horses are in high condition and sleek as ravens but not more so than those that have   bushels of oats per week the price of which at  s per bushel is equal to the value of the bran  for cattle  mr hay says that in the beginning of october i tie up my cattle in sheds and place before every beast a crib for bran and another for turnips and to each give a peck of pollard morning and evening with full allowance of turnips well cleansed and topped i frequently mix oat sheeling seeds and oat dust which makes them fonder of the pollard if stale or old kept three months stallfeeding in this way is equal to   months in the usual way  in order to form some idea of the utility of the above mode we must estimate the expense of the pollard in addition to the full allowance of turnips pollard being a finer kind of bran is sold for  d a bushel more of course when bran is  0d per bushel pollard will be  s and allowing that an ox will fatten as much in  0 weeks with the above keeping as he will in  0 by the common mode the account will stand thus  l s d  0 weeks  pollard  0 bushels at  s    0 0 ditto  turnips at  s  d     0  attendance 0  0 0     0 l s d  0 weeks  turnips at  s  d    0 0 ditto  straw 0  0 0  attendance   0 0   0 0  hence it appears that feeding with pollard and turnips is not cheaper than the common mode even allowing that it is done in half the time  mr watson put   oxen into a foldyard with a shed in it on the  0th of may in   weeks they had eaten   0 bushels of bran and oat seeds mixed with which they had for the first three weeks coarse hay the other four cut clover with this their cribs were kept constantly full the value of bran and oat seeds amounts to about  s per per week each beast of the hay and clover no account was kept but it cannot be estimated at less than  s which makes with attendance  s per week each beast near double the expense of grass and more than the improvement of the cattle would pay though they were certainly in very thriving condition  mr watson once attempted to keep two heifers on bran only they grew worse and worse and were obliged to have other food when they got grass they eat much more bran than when they got bran alone  for sheep  these gentlemen allow   bushels per week per score to their store ewes on grass that is  s  0d per week or  d per sheep besides grass  mr hay wintered   0 ewes on    acres they had    bushels per week of bran but this land would have wintered  0 ewes without any assistance therefore the bran was applied to the support of the  0 additional ewes of course the expenses per week will be l s d    bushels of bran at  0d per bushel which divided by  0       gives the expense per week of keeping a store ewe 0 0   which is near double the price usually paid for turnips  mr watson is summering     ewes on spindlestonhill a bare rocky pasture to this flock he allows    bushels of bran per day or     bushels per week which at  0d per bushel is  d per week per sheep besides the grass they are in excellent condition but it is a price for keeping store ewes that most farmers would state at  to a flock of    yearold fat wethers he gives    bushels of bran per week which is near  d per week per sheep they are depastured upon good land at the rate of about   sheep an acre which is scarcely double the number the same ground would keep equally well without bran of course these sheep cost above  s per week per sheep a price that the appearance of the sheep does by no means promise to repay  these are all the facts that have come to our knowledge respecting feeding with bran from which it appears that it is not so beneficial a practice as had been represented to the board  chapter ix gardens and orchards in gardening we do not find any practices in this district but what are generally known to the profession and in respect to orchards they are thinly scattered indeed  the frosty nights and northeast winds from the german ocean which are so prevalent here in the spring months are very inimical to fruit crops and it is probably owing to this circumstance that there is such a scarcity of orchards so much so that we believe nine tenths of the apples consumed in this county are imported from kent essex and other southern counties  chapter x woods and plantations woods growing in a natural state are found mostly on the banks of rivers those of the north and fouth tyne the wansbeck coquet and their tributary streams have by far the greatest quntiy of old oak timber from eighty to one hundred and forty years growth the probable value may be about  0000l of which twothirds can only be said to be proper for building ships of great burden  the demand by the collieries and lead mines for small wood has induced the proprietors of woods on the derwent tyne etc to cut them at an early age from twentyfive to thirty years growth is the general term for oak elm and ash but birch willow and aller are cut sooner and hazle for corfrods corves are a kind of large wickerwork baskets used for bringing coals out of pits made of rods from to   inch diameter once in three or four years  the price of ash and elm is from  s to  s per foot of oak from  s to  s per foot of birch aller etc for pit props six feet long and from four to six inches diameter  d each corf rods  d per hundred oak bark last year was sold for  l per ton under this management and at those prices an acre in thirty years will produce on n average  0l clear of expenses there has been instances of an acre of wood thirtytwo years old felling for  00l and another of sixty years growth worth  00l per acre but these were in particularly favorable situations  in the management of these woods the general practice is to cut all away together the system of anthony surtees esquire of newbiggen we think preferable he takes his away in patches and as the older trees interfere with the younger springs and where a thriving healthy oak is in a convenient situation he lets it stand for timber by this means the young spring is sheltered and an annual produce of upwards of  00l is obtained from sixty acres of woodland  plantations on an extensive scale are rising in every part of the county and are almost in every instance doing well and promise not only to repay the spirited exertions of the proprietors but will add greatly to the ornament and improvement of the country  amongst the great variety of trees we have observed in those plantations the larch rises proudly preeminent above the rest and in almost every situation far outstrips the various species of firs and pines wherever we have noticed them planted promiscuously together in many plantations in the northern parts of the county the spruce firs between  0 and  0 years old have diedoff and this in so many very different soils and situations that they are now in a great measure discarded from the plantations that have been made of late years the cause of this failure has not been yet satisfactorily accounted for  chapter xi wastes the commons  in this county capable of being converted into profitable tillage land are now very trifling the greatest part having been enclosed within the last thirty years the whole amounting to near   0000 acres of this the commons belonging to the manors of hexhamshire and allendale contain  0000 acres a great part   000 of which are high exposed heathy mountains these are to be converted into stinted pastures not being thought capable of any other improvement  the increased value of such enclosed commons depends as we have stated in our report of cumberland entirely upon the system of cultivation pursued upon bulbeckcommon there are lands which in a state of common were not worth more than  s an acre a part of which has been in tillage twentyfive years and grown three white crops successively betwixt one fallowing and another this land is now dear enough at  s an acre while mr hoppers of blackhedley is worth  0s or   s his system is when first broke up from heath to pare and burn and plough in the autumn next spring plough across lime and sow oats then fallow and lime    bushels per acre and sow turnips after which oats and grass seeds four pounds red clover five pounds white and one bushel of ray grass and continue in grass six or seven years then to plough for oats  turnips  oats  and sow up with grass seeds as before there are instances where the increased value is in the ratio of twelve to one or even more but these are where the commons were of no value to the proprietor which is in general the case the stinted common of holy island was divided in    0 the allotments that were gotten for a right which never let for more than  l are now let for   l or   l per ann and in a few years will be worth upwards of  0l   the extent of waste lands  or open mountainous districts incapable of affording profit by cultivating with the plough is very great as we have before stated considerable quantities of which are private property and of course may be depastured by sheep or other stock to the greatest advantage of those that are common it would certainly be best for every man to know his own share  draining would be highly useful to many parts of these districts there are also many excellent situations for planting and of all other purposes to which such lands are convertible this species of improvement seems to us the most promising to make the greatest returns  chapter xii improvements sect    draining draining  is one of those improvements that has lately made its way into northumberland and is now mostly practiced in the middle and northern parts of the county the theory is pretty well understood in those districts and the practice is becoming more prevalent every year hollow drains are generally used filled with stones where they can be got where these cannot be obtained but at a great expense sod drains are the only resource especially in the northern parts where there is little wood  sect    paring and burning paring and burning is not much practiced in the eastern and northern parts of the county in the midland and southern parts it is most prevalent but even there it is confined to old swards and coarse rough rushey and heathy lands for the first breakingup of such ground it is certainly very convenient and preferable to any other mode we have ever seen but though we are fully convinced of its beneficial effects in such situations yet we have our doubts whether it could be used with advantage upon lands that have lain a few years in grass and that would produce good crops of grain immediately on being ploughed out which is not the case with coarse rough heathy lands or even very old swards on rich fertile soils it being found that crops on the latter are frequently very much injured by leaping for two or three years which paring and burning entirely obviates and ensures full crops to the farmer who need not be under any apprehension of his soil being ruined by it provided he pursues the following course    turnips    oats    fallow well limed for turnips    barley sown up with clover and grass seeds and depastured with sheep for three or four years and afterward if not intended to lie in grass continue it in the rotation mentioned page    it is the injudicious cropping more than the ill effects derived from paring and burning that has been the chief cause of bringing such an odium on this practice which is certainly an excellent one in some situations and properly conducted but like the fermented juice of the grape may be too often repeated and improperly applied  the popular clamor against this practice that it destroys the soil we can by no means admit and are inclined to believe that not a single atom of soil is abstracted though the bulk of the sod or turf be diminished this arises from the burning of the roots or vegetable substances which by this process afford a considerable portion of alkaline salts phlogistic or carbonic matter and probably other principles friendly to vegetation as we find those ashes produce abundant crops of turnips which fatten stock much quicker than those after any other dressing or manure we have ever seen and the succeeding crops of corn are so very luxuriant as to tempt the injudicious cultivator to pursue it too far and for the sake of temporary gain may be said to rip it up as the boy did with his goose that laid golden eggs  sect    manuring in some parts of this county where the turnip culture is carried to such extent every exertion of ingenuity is practiced to raise a large portion of farm yard dung for without this valuable article it is well known that good turnip crops are not to be expected and the farmers of strong soils are sufficiently sensible of the advantage of dung to their crops not to use every endeavor to increase its quantity  the farmers of turnip soils in order to have their dung sufficiently rotted lead it out of the fold yard in the winter make it up in large dunghills in order to increase the putrefactive process and prepare it for that state of dissolution by which its component parts are ready to be assimilated into new bodies and in which state only is can be of use in vegetation  upon the hillfarms around cheviot we have been often surprised to see at the doors of the shepherds houses such immense dunghills the accumulation of unnumbered years probably centuries to avoid this increasing nuisance many of them have ingeniously contrived to build their houses near a burn side for the convenience of having it taken away by every flood notwithstanding they have lands adjoining upon which if this manure was properly applied the greatest improvements would ensue and considerable quantities of excellent hay be produced for the support of the flocks in winter storms in which seasons they are very often under the necessity of purchasing hay in the lowlands and of having it conveyed on horseback to the top of these hills in the deepest snows at a very great expense we were glad to see mr smith mr marshall and a few others departing from this trait of barbarism and applying their manure in a very proper manner   lime  is found in many parts of this county of an excellent quality in bambro ward where it has been long used many intelligent farmers begin to doubt of its efficacy and the propriety of continuing to lay it upon their old tillage lands upon the dry soils in glendale ward where it has not been used much above  0 years mr james hall of thornington was the first person that ever carried a cart load of lime across the river till for laying upon land the first year he prevailed upon his father to allow him to lead  0 cart load which had so wonderful an effect that the quantity was increased next year and in a few years after the use of it became general its effects are more conspicuous especially upon such lands as have been seldom or never limed in its natural state the soil of this district is dry duffy light full of fibrous roots and when in fallow on passing over it you sink to the ancles after being sufficiently limed the fibrous roots disappear the soil becomes denser firm to the tread retentive of moisture and produces better and more abundant crops of grain than before when laid to grass the effects of the lime appear to an inch by the superior verdure which takes place as far as it has gone about twelve years since when looking over the farm of thornington with mr james hall the late tenant we were surprised with the sudden alteration in the verdure of the land which took place immediately at the junction of two ridges one side was a fine dark green caten very bare and covered with a thick mat of white clover and raygrass the other was a dingy brown principally composed of fine bent and sheeps fesque and in a great measure neglected by the sheep an explanation was desired for so great a contrast and mr hall informed us that when this parcel of land was last in fallow the part which was eaten so bare and looked so green was well limed the other which the sheep neglected had never been limed it has been said and repeatedly copied by writers on agriculture and botany that sheep prefer the festuca ovina to all other plants in the above instance it was quite the contrary from which and from other observations we have made we are inclined to believe that the idea has probably originated more in conjecture than experiment it has also been remarked by botanical writers that sheep refuse to eat ragwort senecio jacobaea the fact in they are so very fond of it they will not allow a plant to flower wherever they depasture   many of these dry soils after being limed grow white clover naturally where not limed it seldom appears but they cover principally with agrostis capillaris fine bent which is seldom eaten by any kind of stock if they can get other food when land has been sufficiently limed this plant disappears and wherever it is found it may be safely concluded that the soil on which it grows has not had its due quantity of lime  about seven years since mr george reed of southmiddleton near wooler cleared from broom  0 or  0 acres of light dry channelly soil that had never been limed which was sown with rye the rye stubble was ploughed in the autumn and the worst part of it limed at the rate of  00 bushels per acre next summer the whole was drilled with turnips dunged etc as described page    which came up all alike and continued to do equally well for three or four weeks but little or no rain falling in that period and the weather continuing droughty those turnips upon the land which had no lime died away whilst those upon that part which was limed were discernible to an inch flourished with unabated vigor and produced an excellent crop for such land worth at least  l  0s an acre many similar instances might be produced but this is the most striking we recollect to have noted  the made of burning lime in this county is mostly in drawkilns of the form of an inverted cone with two or three eyes or mouths for drawing out the lime and admitting air these kilns are kept burning and drawing perpetually some of the large sale kilns will afford  0 or  0 cart load a day a cart load of coals is reckoned to burn two cart loads of lime  the price at the kilns is from  s to  s  d for    upheaped bushels  the quantity laid upon an acre is from    to   0 bushels  the general practice of using lime is to lay it up in heaps of three or four cart loads each and as soon as the clods are fallen slacked or reduced to the state of quicklime it is spread evenly upon the land and harrowed and ploughed in as soon as possible after sometimes instead of laying it up in heaps of   or   cart loads each it is laid upon the land in the clod state in little heaps of about a bushel each which are covered with earth until sufficiently flacked or fallen and then spread abroad  in either mode or in whatever manner lime is applied it certainly has the greatest effect when both it and the soil are in the most pulverized state  upon the turnip soils where very large quantities of lime are used it would be extremely difficult to get a sufficiency in the early part of summer previous to the turnip season in such situations it is usual to lead as much as possible through the summer and autumn which is laid up in very large heaps from  0 to   0 loads each and before winter covered with sods or thatched with straw to prevent the rain from penetrating it if well secured it is found in a very quick state in the spring sometimes a great portion of it remaining unslacked  the opinions respecting the good or ill effects of lime are exceedingly various some asserting that it can never be used in too large a quantity whilst others contend it is of no use whatever our own practice authorizes us to say that upon some soils the application of lime or calcareous earth in some other form in considerable quantities is absolutely necessary in order to bring them to their most fertile state and to prepare them for the action of other manures whilst upon other soils lime produces no sensible effect and if used in large quantities will prove very detrimental  thus may one of the most valuable applications we know for the improvement of many soils be condemned by those who draw positive conclusions from partial observations of facts the practice of paring and burning we believe owes the opprobrium which some have thrown upon it to a similar mode of reasoning  stone marl has formerly been used in considerable quantities near tweedside but the more immediate effects of lime have entirely set aside the use of stone marl  shell marl is used with great advantage at the rate of  0 or  0 cart loads an acre on the farms of wark sunnylaws and learmouth  sea wrack sea ware or marine plants  driven ashore by the tide are used with great effect wherever they can be had of these the fucus vesiculosus and its relatives f serratus and inflatus skeir ware are not held in much estimation and when used require to be laid up in large heaps to putrify if laid upon the land as the others are when taken immediately from the shore they dry and turn to a black coriaceous substane the fucus digitatus wassels is the great favorite and another species called mayweed which we cannot point out by its linnaean name not having had an opportunity of seeing it but from the descriptions we have heard suspect it to be the young plants of the fucus digitatus  coal ashes  are chiefly used in the vicinity of the principal towns as a dressing for grass land for this purpose they are found of considerable benefit especially upon strong coarse and wet lands  sect    weeding weeding corn is universally practiced the broad cast crops are handweeded in which operation the thistles being rather unpleasant to handle are in some parts drawn by a pair of large pliers nippers with flat cheeks in others they are cut over by a weeding hook made in the form of a l with sharp edges on the inside but this mode of cutting is only a temporary relief as they spring again very soon after pulling up by the roots ought certainly to be practiced in every instance as there is not a weed the farmer has to contend with more difficult to eradicate than the corn thistle carduus arvensis  the drilled crops are both horse and hand hoed at least twice each and with so much attention that no kind of weeds are sussered to remain the whole being kept in the cleanest and compleatest gardenlike culture  the most prevalent weeds that give the northumbrian husbandman the greatest trouble are of the perennial kind triticum repens  couch wheat these all go under the general names of quickens couch or twitch grass the holcus principally on light dry soils avena elatior  tall oat this is readily distinguished from the other kinds of quickens by its bulbous or granulated roots these all go under the general names of quickens couch or twitch grass the holcus principally on light dry soils holcus mollis  soft holcus these all go under the general names of quickens couch or twitch grass the holcus principally on light dry soils seratulae arvensis or corn thistle carduus arvensis linnaeus has classed this plant with the seratula but lightfoot has very properly removed it to the carduus corn thistle annuals sinapis arvensis  wild mustard charloc sinapis alba  white mustard charloc raphanus raphanistrum  wild radish charloc avena fatua  wild oat   those of less note and more partial visitants are  galeopsis tetrahit hemp

speedwell scandiae pecten veneris shepherds needle sect    watering watered meadows  were first introduced into this county by messrs culley about    years since and notwithstanding the manifest advantages of this operation yet so slow is knowledge in making its way that it was near  0 years before any other person ventured to pursue the practice and profit by the example it is now beginning to spread in the neighborhood and we hope in a few years will be adopted in every situation that can derive benefit from it  sir william lorrain with a spirit that marks his wish for improvement brought two men from leicestershire to drain his grounds at kirkharl this business they seem to have understood and executed well but we think they have misled the worthy baronet in telling him they understood laying out land for watering we were sorry to see a first attempt executed in so bad a style which may tend more to discourage the practice than forward its introduction  sect    embankments in the vicinity of wooler a large tract of low flat ground called haughs adjoining the rivers till and glen being subject to be frequently overslowed an attempt was first made to embank them at yevering in the year      which answered the purpose and soon after was adopted on the haughs of turvilaws doddington ewart etc by which the lands that could not be let for more than   s per acre from the great hazard of losing the crop are now let for more than double the sum  the height of these banks is from   to   feet the form is represented by a section fig   pl   where the height

earth  the expense from  s to  s per rood of   yards  chapter xiii live stock sect    cattle the different kinds of cattle bred in this county are the short horned  the devonshire  the longhorned  and the wild cattle  the short horned kind have been long established over the whole county the other kinds are found only in the hands of a few individuals who have introduced them with a laudable view of comparing their merits with the established breed of the country  they differ from the other breeds in the shortness of their horns and in being wider and thicker in their form consequently feed to the most weight in affording the greatest quantity of tallow when fatted in having very thin hides and much less hair it is probably from the thinness of their hides and hair that they are accounted tenderer than most other breeds upon them than any other breed the alderneys excepted but the most essential difference consists in the quantity of milk they give beyond most other breeds there being instances of cows giving    quarts of milk per day and of    firkins of butter being made from a dairy of    cows but the more general quantity is   firkins per cow in a season and    quarts of milk per day their color is much varied but they mostly are an agreeable mixture of red and white from their being in many places called the dutch breed it is probable they were originally brought from the continent  they have been much improved of late years by the exertions and attention of enterprising breeders who have already improved them so far as to be sold fat to the butchers at   years old the weight of the carcass is in general from  0 to  0 stone    lb to the stone but there are instances of individuals attaining much greater weight  sir h gray bred and fed two sevenyears old oxen that weighed     stone   lb the four quarters only and a spayed heifer     stone   lb ditto mr smith of togstone a cow     stone    lb ditto  but large size is not now considered as an excellence quick seeders that lay their sat upon the most valuable parts and have the least offal in the coarse parts are the kind which every enlightened breeder wishes to be possessed of  the long horns have been introduced from the improved stocks of the midland counties at different times and by different breeders but have in most instances given way again to the improved breed of short horns  the devonshire breed is only in the possession of walter trevelyan esquire of nether witton who introduced them about three years since their offspring has not yet got to a proper age to form a judgment of their comparative merits  the wild cattle  are only found in chillingham park belonging to the earl of tankerville and as it is probable they are the only remains of the true and genuine breed of wild cattle in chillingham park that species of cattle we are no strangers that there may be found in two or three different parks of the kingdom breeds of cattle which pass under the denomination of wild cattle but are inclined to believe that they have been contaminated by crossing and that those in chillingham park are the only remains which answer the description given by boethius of this species of cattle we shall be more particular in our description  their color is invariably white muzzle black the whole of the inside of the ear and about one third of the outside from the tip downwards red horns white with black tips very fine and bent upwards some of the bulls have a thin upright mane about an inch and an half or two inches long the weight of the oxen is from    to    stone and the cows from    to    stone the four quarters    lb to the stone the beef is finely marbled and of excellent flavor  from the nature of their pasture and the frequent agitation they are put into by the curiosity of strangers it cannot be expected they should get very fat yet the six years old oxen are generally very good beef from whence it may be fairly supposed that in proper situations they would feed well  at the first appearance of any person they set off in full gallop and at the distance of two or three hundred yards make a wheel round and come boldly up again tosting their heads in a menacing manner on a sudden they make a full stop at the distance of forty or fifty yards looking wildly at the object of their surprise but upon the least motion being made they all again turn round and gallop off again with equal speed but not to the same distance forming a shorter circle and again returning with a bolder and more threatening aspect than before they approach much nearer probably within thirty yards when they make another stand and again gallop off this they do several times shortening their instance and advancing nearer till they come within a few yards when most people think it prudent to leave them not choosing to provoke them further as it is probable that in a few turns more they would make an attack  the mode of killing them was perhaps the only modern remains of the grandeur of ancient hunting on notice been given that a wild bull would be killed upon a certain day the inhabitants of the neighborhood came mounted and armed with guns etc sometimes to the number of an hundred horse and four or five hundred foot who stood upon walls or got into trees while the horsemen rode off the bull from the rest of the herd until he stood at bay when a marksman dismounted and shot at some of these huntings twenty or thirty shots have been fired before he was subdued on such occasions the bleeding victim grew desperately furious from the smarting of his wounds and the shouts of savage joy that were echoing from every side from the number of accidents that happened this dangerous mode has been seldom practiced of late years the parkkeeper alone generally shooting them with a rifled gun at one shot  when the cows calve they hide their calves for a week or ten days in some sequestered situation and go and suckle them two or three times a day if any person come near the calves they clap their heads close to the ground and lie like a hare in form to hide themselves this is a proof of their native wildness and is corroborated by the following circumstance that happened to the writer of this narrative who found a hidden calf two days old very lean and very weak on stroking its head it got up pawed two or three times like an old bull bellowed very loud retired a few steps and bolted at his legs with all its force it then began to paw again bellowed stepped back and bolted as before but knowing its intention and stepping aside it missed me fell and was so very weak that it could not rise though it made several efforts but it had done enough the whole herd were alarmed and coming to its rescue obliged me to retire for the dams will allow no person to touch their calves without attacking them with impetuous ferocity  when any one happens to be wounded or grown weak and feeble through age or sickness the rest of the herd set upon it and gore it to death  dairy  this county cannot boast of its dairies those who live in the vicinity of newcastle and other populous places make a handsome return by the sale of milk fresh butter etc but upon most of the large farms in this county dairies are not held in much estimation  breeding young cattle  is practiced in almost every part of the county upon the large farms cows are kept more for this purpose than the profit of dairying there are instances of  0 or  0 calves being brought up in one season by one farmer who did not milk more than fifteen cows calves are certainly best reared with milk but where such numbers are bred many different things have been mixed with or substituted for this nutritive and natural diet oats and ban meal oil cake lintseed boiled turnips etc are used and have their various advocates but lintseed is most approved eggs are excellent for mixing in the calfs food when cheap in the spring perhaps they cannot be better employed in the summer the calves are turned to grass and in the first winter get turnips and straw after being a year old they are kept in summer on coarse pasture and in winter on straw only  hiring bulls  for the season is practiced in this county as high as  0 guineas have been paid for a bull of the shorthorned breed for one season and from   to   guineas given for serving a cow but the more common premium is a guinea  sect    of sheep in this county there are three distinct breeds  the cheviot sheep the heath sheep and the longwooled sheep  the cheviot sheep  are hornless the faces and legs in general white many of the cheviot sheep have dark faces and were more so formerly we were informed by mr chisholm mr readhead mr marshall etc that these darkfaced ones grew equally as fine wool were as hardy and equally as good thrivers as the whitefaced ones but that the people to whom they sold their sheep and especially tups preferred white faces for which reason they have endeavored to get quit of black faces the best breeds have a sine open countenance with lively prominent eyes body long fore quarters wanting depth in the breast and breadth both there and on the chine fine clean small boned legs thin pelts weight of carcass when fat from    to    lb per quarter fleeces from   to   lb each and sold in      for   d per lb the wool is not all sine there being in a fleece of   lb weight only   lb of sine wool worth one shilling per lb when the whole fleece sells at  0d per lb and one pound of coarse worth only   d per lb  they are bred only upon the hilly districts in the northwest part of the county and do not extend much farther south than reedwater  the best kind of these sheep are certainly a very hardy and valuable mountain sheep where the pasture is mostly green sward or contains a large portion of that kind of herbage which is the case with all the hills around cheviot where these sheep are bred for as to the mountain of cheviot itself no kind of sheep whatever are bred upon it and we find it an universal practice amongst the most experienced sheep farmers to depasture the heathy a ram of the cheviot breed a cheviot ewe districts with old sheep gimmers and wethers but they never attempt to keep a breeding flock upon them mr robson of chatto informed us that ewes and lambs would not do upon his farms of common burn near wooler and felhope and carshope at the head of coquet on such situations the gimmers are found to be hardier or do better than the wether sheep of the same age called dinmonts   blindburn is probably the highest and coarsest pasture in this county where this kind of sheep are bred we examined the herbage and found that the ewepasture had a considerable portion of green sward the coarsest parts of which consisted of nardus stricta wirebent the english names inserted after the latin ones are such as the cheviot shepherds know them by juncus squarrosus stoolbent scirpus caespitosus deer hair eriophorum vaginatum the leaves ling in the county of durham yorkshire and some other parts erica vulgaris is known by the name of ling this plant grows in wet mossy places it generally springs in february and march the sheep are remarkably fond of it not only the flowering stem but the roots and will sratch away the mossy soil six or eight inches deep to obtain it we have seen them working up to the eyes for this purpose the shepherds tell wonderful tales of the nutritive powers of this plant asserting that sheep reduced by hunger will recover faster and thrive much better upon this plant than turnips it is certainly a valuable plant for three or four weeks but after it has flowered the sheep totally neglect the flower stem moss and depasture only on the leaves ling it is somewhat singular that the cheviot shepherds should consider the flowering stem and the leaves of this plant as two distinct species nor could some of them be convinced to the contrary until the plant was taken up and they were shown that their moss and ling grew both from the same root   eriophorum vaginatum the flowering eriophorum vaginatum stem moss erica vulgaris heath or hadder   the shape of this breed of sheep has been much improved of late years but all those who have been aiding in making such improvements readily acknowledge there is still much to be done especially to the fore quarter which they all agree is very defective but we hope it will not long remain so as we think we see a spirit of investigation arising amongst these breeders that in a few years will remedy not only this defect but will discover others which at present they are not willing to admit but as knowledge is progressive we cannot expect the perfection of this breed of sheep can be obtained at once it must proceed by slow gradations as every other improvement has done it is a great point gained that we admit defects and are desirous to amend them  that breed of sheep which brings the most profit to the farmer will always be pursued by him whatever his situation but that object we presume is not to be obtained in this district from fine wool alone perfect mountain sheep should be active hardy well formed and quick seeders these qualities will always recommend them to the grazier who will never purchase a slow feeding animal while he can get one of a different sort though at a considerable advanced price but if to these qualities so essential to the sale of a mountain farmers stock can be added a fleece of fine wool a breed of sheep would then be obtained the properest for a hilly district of any we have yet seen there is little doubt but this may be accomplished by proper selection and probably the best kind of cheviot sheep from their hardiness and producing a portion of fine wool are the properest stock for laying the foundation of so desirable an improvement  mr robson of belford now of chatto says he improved the shape of his sheep very considerably particularly the forequarter and the wool in having less buttocks by using three rams which he purchased in lincolnshire thirtythree years since and we know other instances of improvement by using tups of or dishley blood in all these cases we do not find the sheep less hardy or wool of less value but the carcass materially improved mr smith of woodhall had some of his cheviot ewes put to a tup of mr thompsons the produce of which were examined when    months old by mr robert thompson and the report was that the form was amazingly improved and the gimmers stood the winter remarkably well this gentleman is pursuing the experiment and we hope will find the produce of the third or fourth cross sufficiently active and hardy for seeking their food on many of the hilly pastures around cheviot   mr readhead of chatto is of opinion that there are some situations amongst the cheviothills where the south down sheep might be successful those who are possessed of such would do well to make a fair experiment should it succeed a very great improvement of the cheviot wool in point of fineness would be derived by crossing with this breed but probably what it gained in fineness it would lose in weight for it is not the value per pound which constitutes the farmers profit but the value per fleece or rather that breed is the best which brings the most profit in fleece and carcass jointly this criterion militates very strongly against the spanish sheep unless they can be found with carcases of superior form and inclination to fatten to any we have yet seen from the same ground in equal times opinions and conjectures will never decide this matter it can only be done by fair experiments conducted by persons of judgment and impartiality  the mode of management  amongst the sheep farmers of these hills is to divide their flock into different parcels viz lambs hogs gimmers ewes and wethers and each parcel kept on such pasturage as is thought most proper for them every parcel is attended by a shepherd who is bound to return the number of sheep delivered to him either alive or in his account of dead sheep which are in general sold at different prices according to their goodness  the ewes are   years old before they are put to the tup and are kept till five or six years old the loss of lambs is sometimes very considerable not only on being dropped but also from other disorders as the milkill which attacks them from   to   days old the quarterill etc which mr chisholm of clennel estimates at not less than    per cent taking one year with another and mr smith of woodhall says that although the cheviot breed be as healthy as perhaps any yet there can hardly be an instance adducible of any of the different sheep flocks coming all to the shears much less the hogs out of which it is common to allow two out of each score  the heath sheep  have large spiral horns black faces and legs a fierce wildlooking eye and short firm carcasses weighing from    to    lb per quarter covered with long open coarse shagged wool the fleeces weigh from three to four pounds each and sold in      for sixpence per pound they are an exceedingly active and hardy race and seem the best adapted of all others to high exposed heathy districts such as we find them in possession of here from the western parts of the county of durham to north tyne  mr hopper of blackhedley buys year old wethers of this kind of sheep for  0s  d each and twoyear olds for   s which he depastures upon a heathy moor of  000 acres from whence he takes them at   years old to turnips and sells the may following from    to    shillings each he has tried the cheviot sheep in the same manner but thinks the other a hardier and better feeding sheep mr hopper says that the best sheep of this kind he has tried are bred about moffat in scotland   a ram of the heath breed   the breeders of this kind of sheep on the south west corner of the county are very confident that they are a much hardier sheep than the cheviot breed and upon their high exposed heathy mountains where there is very little green herbage much more profitable while the cheviot farmers assert that theirs are equally hardy and that the greater value of the fleece gives them a decided superiority we have before stated that the fineness of wool is not a proper criterion by which the merits of a breed of sheep are to be determined it can only be done by fair experiment in which all the circumstances of the case are included but we do not find that this has ever been done by either party and though it is only opinion against opinion yet both parties are so positive that they are ready to quarrel with any person who happens to express an opinion of his own we shall therefore content ourselves with stating that the question can only be properly decided by a parcel of each kind of ewes suppose  00 being depastured and kept in every respect equally alike upon some of those high exposed situations the height of which is much more elevated and the herbage much coarser than the cheviot pastures and almost totally covered with heath or hather erica vulgaris and at the end of five six or seven years that breed which has brought the greatest number of sheep to market and made the most profit will deservedly be deemed the hardiest best and most eligible for such situations  until some experiment of this kind determine the matter we hope we shall not give offense to either party by stating that we have seen the heath sheep bred with advantage upon higher and coarser pastures than common burn or those others around cheviot which are deemed improper for a breeding flock of the cheviot kind and that it may probably turn out that each breed is particularly adapted to particular situations the one to coarse exposed mountains where the luxury of green herbage is thinly scattered or rarely to be found the other to hilly pastures where considerable portions of verdant surface predominate such as characterize the pastoral districts around cheviot  the longwoolled sheep  which formerly occupied the lower district of this county were called muggs probably from their faces being covered with a muff of wool close to their eyes these being a slow feeding tribe have given way to the dishley breed which were first introduced into this county in the year      by messrs culley and by their superior merit have so far made their way against every prejudice and opposition that it is probable in a few years there will be a difficulty in finding a flock that is not more or less related to the dishley blood  the improved breed of longwoolled sheep  are distinguished from other longwoolled kinds by their fine lively eyes clean heads straight broad flat backs round barrellike bodies very fine small bones thin pelts and that singular property of making fat at an early age perhaps more than any thing else gives them a superiority over the other breed in this island  the weight of the carcass in general is ewes three or four years old from    to    lb per quarter the wool upon an average  lb a fleece the length from   to    inches sold in      at  0d per lb  the most approved mode of management of this breed of sheep is as follows the ewes generally lamb in march when we give them a few turnips to increase their milk the latter end of june or beginning of july the lambs are weaned and sent to middling pasture but a good pasture would certainly be a more eligible practice the ewes are milked two or three times to ease their udders and such a new shorn ram of the improved long wooled breed as are not intended to be continued for breeding are culled or draughted out and put to clover when this fails they get turnips and are sold about christmas to the butchers very fat the price from    to  0s each frequently measuring four or five inches thick of fat on the sides and two or three inches down the back all the way from head to tail and though this breed be not eminent for much tallow yet ewes under such circumstances have been known to produce from eighteen to twentyfour pounds of tallow each  the lambs after being weaned take the name of hogs they are generally put to turnips the beginning of november and continue at them till the middle of april or beginning of may when the wether hogs are put upon good pasture or second years clover the second winter they have turnips until the clovers are sufficiently grown to receive them which is generally about the middle of april they are clipped or shorn about the middle of may when we begin to sell them and are mostly all sold by the middle or end of june morpeth is our best market where the two shear wethers are generally sold for from forty to fifty shillings a head in      they sold for  l per head on an average at this age they are equally fat as the ewes before described  of late years it has been customary to fell the shearling wethers in june or july to the butchers fatter than most other breeds will be at two or three years old the weight of these shearling wethers is from    to    lb per quarter  we generally reckon one third of the ewes to have twin lambs they are put to the tup so as to have lambs at two years old and kept for breeding until three or four years old except such as are of particular good forms or have other valuable properties these we keep as long as ever they will breed such as are defective in shape suspected of being slow feeders or other unprofitable qualities we never put to the tup or attempt to breed from them  letting tups  to serve ewes for the season has been a practice in this county for near  0 years and is becoming more prevalent daily the prices vary from five to one hundred guineas for the use of one sheep and ewes are frequently taken in to be served by a favorite ram at as high rates as from   to   guineas each the number of ewes to be served by a shearing tup is generally stipulated not to exceed  0 and for an aged sheep   0  at the first introduction of this breed of sheep a great prejudice was raised against them and clamorous outcries made that their adoption would be the ruin of the country and no means were left untried to depreciate their value but every obstacle has been overcome by their superior merit which seems now to be universally acknowledged as may be judged from the following circumstance  in october      mr thompson of chillingham barns having quitted a farm he advertised to sell by auction  00 ewes in lots of   each l s d the first  00 ewes sold on an average for    0 0 per lot of   each the second  00 for  0     ditto the first  00 gimmers for    0 0 ditto several lots of the gimmers sold for above   l each lot one in particular for   l or  l   s each sheep  the highest lot of ewes was   l or  l   s each  the purchasers amounted to upwards of  0 amongst whom were several that a few years before were the most violent and loudest exclaimers against any change or innovation in the established breed of the country  breeding sheep  of the longwoolled kind to be sold to graziers to fatten is practiced by the occupiers of such farms as do not afford a sufficiency of turnips or such as do not produce any those who are in the latter predicament either take turnips for wintering their hogs or put them upon good old grass pastures the wethers are generally sold in september and october being then shearlings for from   s to   s each and the ewes three and a half years old from   s to   s each in      they were as high as  l each  there are few or no sheep bred in those parts of the county called castleward bedlingtonshire and the south east corner of morpeth ward  the modern maxims of breeding were introduced into this county by one of mr bakewells first disciples upwards of  0 years since previous to which big bones and large size were looked upon as the principal criteria of excellence and a sacred adherence to the rule of never breeding within the canonical degree of relationship but those prejudices are at this period in a great measure done away and the principal farmers of this district may now be classed amongst the most scientific breeders in the kingdom who have pursued it with an ardour and unremitting attention that have not failed of success it is this knowledge of breeding and the nice discrimination of selecting proper stock for grazing added to their improved mode of cultivation that gives them a celebrity of character for their extensive knowledge in rural affairs and that has for some years back made this district a school for agriculture where pupils from various parts have come to be instructed   salving  was formerly universally practiced and it was thought the sheep could not do well without it in the lower districts it is now almost totally disused and some of the hill farmers have laid it aside and find their flocks do equally well as before and the wool sells for a much better price than when it is salved but it is of less weight as may be naturally expected from the want of near of a pound of salve upon each fleece  this salve is composed of    lb of butter and   quarts of tar mixed well together while warm which quantity serves    sheep the number a man will salve in a day  milking  it used to be a general practice through all this county to milk ewes after the lambs were weaned for six eight or ten weeks from this milk great quantities of cheese were made and sold for about  d per pound when kept to three or four years old it is exceedingly pungent and on that account some people prefer it to cheese of a much better quality  to milk ewes two or three times after the lambs are weaned is a useful practice but when continued to eight or ten weeks it becomes very detrimental keeps the ewes lean and ill prepared for meeting the severities of winter  this custom has been long disused by the intelligent farmers in the lower districts and we are glad to sind it much laid aside by the most considerable hill farmers the profit of milking ewes for six or eight weeks is estimated at  d per ewe and it is generally agreed they are decreased in value at least  s  d per head of course there is a loss of about  s per head by milking in one instance of milking longwoolled ewes last summer there was a loss of at least  s per head  sect    horses the best draught horses used in this county are brought from clydesdale in scotland they are in general from    to    hands high strong hardy remarkable good and true pullers a restive horse being rarely found among them  those bred in the county are of various sorts descended from stallions of different kinds from the full blood racer to the strong heavy roughlegged black from the full blood stallions and country mares are bred excellent hunters road and carriage horses and from the other kinds of stallions are bred the draught horses which in general are middle sized active animals well adapted to the husbandry of the country  we have before observed that since the price of horses had been so very high several oxen had been used for the draught but whether with propriety or advantage will appear from  a comparative statement between horses and oxen for the purpose of the draught by way of preliminary it will be necessary to admit as data that a horse which eats  0 bushels of oats per year will not consume of other food so much as an ox that gets no corn this is deduced from the following experiments three working horses about    hands high eat in    days    stones of hay which is for each horse at the rate of    stones a week with an allowance of oats    gallons per week  mr thompsons of chillingham barns    horses in    days eat   0 stones of hay which is    stones per week each horse allowance of oats    gallons per week  mr atkinsons of yevering eat per week    stones of hay   bushels of potatoes and    gallons of oats  mr jobsons of newtown   years old working oxen with a full allowance of hay had each ox   quarts of oats per day  in    days   oxen eat     stones   lb of hay which is after the rate for each ox of hay    stones per week of oats  0 gallons ditto   three days after the same oxen were put to hay only and in   days eat    stones  0 lb or  0 stones each ox per week which is only stone more than when they got  0 gallons of corn in the same time this is a singular circumstance and deserving of further investigation  an unworked ox   years old was put to good old meadow hay the   th of november and eat    stones in    days or per week    stones   lb  an idle horse    hands high eat of the same hay  0 stones in  0 days or per week    stones  had no corn   but in the following estimate we shall allow horses to eat as much as oxen as the difference is not yet sufficiently ascertained  that the oxen are yoked at   years old and are worked till six and for the first year require   to do the work of   horses but after having been worked a year and become tractable and stronger   are equal to   horses either by being yoked three at a time or two and driven by the holder with cords of course the expense of a driver may be estimated to be saved for one half the year  that the expenses of a ploughman the plough and other articles that are the same in both teams need not be taken into the account  and that oxen to work regularly through the year cannot work more than half a day at a time  expense of an ox per ann l s d summering  grass

quantity of work as   horses  0 0 0  the conclusions to be drawn from the above statement are so obvious as to need little elucidation but we cannot help remarking how strong the force of prejudice must be to continue the use of   horses and heavy clumsy unwieldy wheel ploughs where a simple swing plough and   horses yoked double and driven by the holder would do the same quantity of work equally well and at one third the expense  but before any proper conclusions can be drawn whether ox teams or horses are the most eligible it will be necessary to consider whether the quantity of land employed in supporting those animals be used in the most profitable mode to the community as well as the occupier  with the latter the first question for consideration is whether   oxen used in the team or in grazing will pay him the most money  suppose   oxen at three years old were put to the plough and plough   acres per week which at  s  d if to this  s  d be added  s  d the wages for the ploughman and driver it will make  s the usual price for ploughing an acre in this district per acre is  0 shillings and if they work    weeks in a year then their whole earnings after deducting  l for expenses of harness shoeing etc will be   l but if they plough only   acres per week which is probably nearer the truth then their whole earnings will be only   l  the same oxen put to graze to pay the same money should improve in value  l  s each in the first case and  l  s in the latter but we are inclined to believe there are few situations if the cattle are of a good quick feeding kind where they would not pay considerably more  in respect to the community the account will be nearly as follows from the above statements we find that an ox for summering and wintering requires   acres  therefore a   ox team will require    ditto and   horses for grass and hay per ann require   ditto for corn and straw   ditto land necessary for keeping   horses per ann    ditto the difference is the quantity of land required for a team of oxen more than horses  0 acres  hence it appears that a team of   oxen requires  0 acres more land to maintain them than a team of   horses which will do the same work and of course the produce which might be derived from this  0 acres is lost to the community suppose it be one half in grass and the other half in ploughing then we shall have   acres of clover or grass   ditto of oats   ditto of turnips or fallow   ditto of wheat   it would then send to market yearly at the lowest computation   cwt of beef   quarters of oats and   ditto of wheat   from this view of the subject it appears that if oxen were universally used for the draught in the room of horses there would be a considerable defalcation in the supply of the markets both in corn and animal food in this county it is estimated that there are capable of cultivation  00000 acres and allowing of this to be in tillage that is        acres and that every  0 acres in tillage will require a team to manage it properly of course there will be at least      teams but for the sake of round numbers call it  000 teams l then  000 x   cwts beef     00 cwts beef at  0s     0  000 x

used in their stead   and the loss to the farmer would be the profit derived from the produce which by the usual mode of allowing onethird for the farmers profit would in this case be about  0l  sect    swine the berkshire pigs and the large white breed were formerly the most prevalent in this county but the small black chinese breed has in a great measure supplanted them especially upon the large farms and these are likely to give way to a small white breed lately introduced remarkably quiet inoffensive animals on which account they are principally preferred to the chinese breed  sect    rabbits rabbits are found in considerable numbers among the sand hills along the coast and are probably the most eligible stock for such situations having been sold of late years for    per couple  sect    goats goats  are kept in small numbers on many parts of the cheviot hills not so much as an object of profit but the shepherds assert the sheep slocks are healthier where a few goats depasture this probably may be the case as it is well known that goats eat some plants with impunity that are deadly poison to other kinds of domestic animals  the chief profit made of these goats is from their milk being sold to invalids who come to wooler in the summer season  sect    poultry poultry  in a district like this where they are sold so low are the most unprofitable stock kept upon a farm the value of the corn consumed by them being generally double to what they are sold for and the laboring people are so well convinced of their inutility that they constantly and universally sell them knowing from experience that if the value received for them be laid out in either beef or mutton it will be much more serviceable and this piece of economy is so well understood that we believe there is scarce an instance of a laboring person ever making use of poultry for his own family they are always considered as articles purposely bred to pamper luxuty  chapter xiv rural economy sect    labor

turnpike roads are mostly in good order those that have an opportunity of getting whinstone or limestone are the best but they certainly would be better if the surveyors would order the stones to be broken smaller and the roads made wider one great objection to some of these roads is the many steep banks they are disgraced with some of the worst might have been avoided but it seems the original settersout of these roads had a predilection for climbing and descending steep banks this is notorious on both the roads upon rimsidemoor without even the plea of being nearer as the leveller road would have been nearer traveled in much less time and with far less fatigue some similar cases appear on the post road which we hope will be remedied in the next application to parliament for a new act  the township roads are in some places good but by far the greatestpart are deserving of a different appellation the cause of this deficiency is in most cases to be attributed to the neglect and manner of performing the statutework  one mode of remedying this neglect would be to appoint a surveyor with a small salary who should be empowered to collect the composition due for statutework and mploy th money for repairing the road where most necessary for the public in general without having regard to the convenience or influence of individuals  a book should be kept by the surveyor and yearly examined settled and signed by a committee of inhabitants before it went to the magistrates we know from experience that by this means the road would be much better made and in near double the quantity for when a farmer sends his cart to perform statuteduty it seldom carries more than half a load and the servants practice every maneuver to put off time and do as little as possible which would not be the case with hired carts as every inhabitant would be ready to report any malpractices  sect    canals in this county there are no canals and notwithstanding heir manifest utility to a district like this where such immense quantities of heavy articles are to be conveyed yet we believe no attempt was ever made or even so much as a canal projected in any part of the county before      when some gentlemen on tweedside had it in contemplation to make a navigable canal from the collieries and lime works near berwick to kelso in scotland and from thence up the tweed and tiviot but a survey being made by mr whitworth it was dropped probably on account of the great expense  the next public notice we can trace was given by mr dodd in      of a canal from newcastle to carlisle or mryport in cumberland to join the east and west seas this was to pass on the south side of tyne but mr chapman proposed a line to pass on the north side of tyne the peculiarity of which was that it should come from haydonbridge to the upper parts of newcastle upon one level without a lock and the goods conveyed from thence to the river either by a kind of staircase of locks or in wagons on an inclined plane by this proposal the principal supporters of the grand canal were divided intotwo parties the consequence of which was that the money to complete the great design of uniting the two seas could not be raised and of course it was given up one on the north side proposed to stop at haydonbridge and another on the south side at hexham the subscriptions for defraying the expense of the north line we were informed were filled and application was made to parliament in      to obtain an act for making a canal on the north side but it met with so strong an opposition from the land owners that it was thought proper to withdraw it  the subscribers for a canal on the south of the river still persevere in their endeavors to accomplish the line to hexham or haydonbridge and we have not heard that any opposition to the measure is intended by the proprietors of lands through which it is to pass  sect    fairs the principal fairs in this county are may  th  wooler  for a few cattle

choice of every kind brings great numbers of dealers from london and various other distant places its celebrity has increased very much of late years and we believe it may be justly classed amongst the first horse fairs in the kingdom  the show of cattle is also very great not only for the breed of the country but also for large droves of kyloes scotch cattle which are purposely driven from the

tuesday  hexham  for corn and other provisions  ditto  belford  the chief support of this market is the sale of corn great quantities of which are sold by sample for exportation  ditto  newcastle  a small market for provisions of various kinds  wednesday  morpeth  for corn butchers meat butter etc and for fat cattle and sheep of the former on an average not less than  0 weekly and of sheep and lambs   00 mr thomas spours who has attended this market for upwards of  0 years says that  0 years since there was not half this number and he remembers that for several weeks in the winter very few sheep or cattle if any were exhibited which are bought up for the consumption of newcastle shields sunderland it may be proper to remark that  0 or  0 years since the butchers of those places were obliged to purchase a great deal of fat stock in the neighborhood of darlington and other parts of the county of durham the produce of the north not being equal to their demands but the scales are now turned the northern farmers being able not only to supply the increased population of those places but to send great numbers of both fat cattle and sheep every year to leeds wakefield manchester etc etc  thursday  wooler  principally for corn considerable quantities of which are sold by sample mostly for exportation  friday  rothbury  this market is little more than nominal there being only one butcher who sells a few carcases and which constitutes nearly the whole of the market  ditto  allendale  for corn butchers meat and considerable quantities of potatoes and garden stuff from hexham all

for corn butchers meat and other articles of provisions at both this market and alnwick considerable quantities of corn are sold by sample for exportation  sect    commerce the commerce of this county is derived principally from the coal trade the ships belonging to the port of newcastle in      are stated by mr pennant to be      their tonnage         the principal exports are coals lead lead shot wrought iron grindstones pottery glass etc  the exports from berwick are chiefly corn flour oatmeal shilled barley potatoes fish eggs wool etc coastways which has increased very much of late years the foreign trade is chiesly to the north of europe  the number of vessels belonging to this port is about  0 making upwards of  000 tons the receipts of the customs are upon an average about  000l per ann  the port of alemouth also employs a few vessels in exporting corn flour etc  and a few vessels are employed in the summer season in carrying lime from the neighborhood of bambro to different parts of scotland  sect    manufactures this county is not distinguished by any staple manufactures the principal are derived from or connected with the coal trade and mines as shipbuilding roperies forges founderies copperas coal tar soda or marine alkali white lead potteries glass works etc  hexham has been long famed for its manufacture of gloves which employs about  00 hands  to establish manufactures of woollens two or three essays have been lately made at alnwick mitford and acklington and a cotton mill has been lately erected at netherwitton all of which from present appearances we hope are doing well  there is one species of manufacture carried on in this district with an agricultural production of small value viz that of straw which is not only made use of as a covering for the heads of the wives and daughters of the humble cottager but has also lately been converted into ornaments that might accompany the richest and most splendid dress which the palace or the drawing room exhibits and for the honor of the plough has not only been converted into buttons for the men but also into rings and earrings for the ladies  agriculture is certainly benefited by manufactures in the consumption of its produce by the great number of people employed but we do not find any new modes of practice or improvements in agriculture introduced in their vicinity or resulting from the exertions of those connected with them  sect    poor we do not find any mode of managing the poor in this county different from that generally used in other districts  in those townships where they are collected and maintained in poor houses the rates are easier than where they are relieved at their own houses we are inclined to believe that workhouses under proper regulations would not only considerably lessen the rates but the poor might be supported more comfortably  sect    population of the population we could not collect sufficient data from whence even a tolerable guess could be made  chapter xvi obstacles to improvement in our journey through this county wherever we enquired what was the chief obstacle to improvement the answer was universally tithes  an imposition so pregnant with mischief and so often the source of violent dissensions betwixt the clergy and their parishioners should if possible be removed either by purchase commutation or any other means by which a fair equivalent shall be rendered for them for so long as they exist it is impossible to expect that agricultural improvements will be carried on to the extent of which they are capable in our survey of cumberland we have shown the great uncertainty of employing money in speculations of improving land and that the tithes in such cases are a large portion of a mans capital in trade and not a tenth of he natural produce of the earth which some have thought was all that was intended by the original imposers who no doubt meant them for a good purpose but if through a succession of ages a change of manners of sentiments and of cultivation has taken place and the ill effects of tithes be universally felt and acknowledged to lesson the quantity of food obtainable from a considerable portion of this kingdom a change in the mode of paying tithes would also be desirable for the proprietors of such lands are not only losers but the community at large it is surprising that a grievance of such magnitude should have so long evaded the revision and regulation of the legislature and that it should be always so strenuously opposed by the clergy there being no wish to take any thing from them but to render a fair equivalent for what is their due and which there would be little difficulty in doing notwithstanding the many objections that have been invented to perplex this most interesting question  chapter xvii miscellaneous observations sect    agricultural societies there never was any agricultural society in this county and if any ever had existed it probably would have been soon dissolved if we may judge from the experiments that have been made in some neighboring districts where we find that after a few years continuance they have been given up but whether from a radical defect in the institutions the nonattendance and indifference of members or the injudicious distribution of prizes we are not prepared to say but think that public farms are much more likely to promote improvements in the science of agriculture  sect    weights and measures weights and measures  are in a sad state of confusion a pound a stone a bushel a boll are rarely the same in different markets and frequently vary in the same market for different articles  at newcastle   beatments   peck   pecks   kenning   kennings   bushel winchester   bushels   boll  at hexham for wheat rye and pease   quarts   forpit   forpits   peck   pecks   bushel   bushels   boll equals   winchester bushels for oats and barley   quarts   forpit   forpits   peck   pecks   bushel   bushels   boll    bushels winchester  at alnwick   quarts   forpit   forpits   peck   pecks   bushel winchester   bushels   boll of wheat   bushels   boll of barley or oats  at wooler   quarts   forpit   forpits   peck   pecks   bushel   bushels   boll  a stone of wool in some parts is    lb in others    lb and a stone of every other article is    lb  the board of agriculture could not do the public a greater service than by bringing forward a regulation of weights and measures one weight and one measure derived from the same root and increasing or decreasing in a ten fold ratio would introduce such simplicity ease and perspicuity into all transactions of business where calculations are necessary as would prevent the numberless mistakes and errors which are daily happening  preparations for remedying this great inconvenience have been made at different times and we believe here are sufficient materials for perfecting the measure whenever it is thought proper to bring it forward  sect    vermin moles and rats  are two species of vermin which we think capable of being in a great measure extirpated or so far reduced as to render their depredations of little consequence in cumberland a mole is rarely to be seen this is in consequence of every occupier of land contributing his due proportion toward their destruction a similar plan established in this county for destroying vermin we believe would readily be complied with by every good farmer and the bad ones ought not to have it in their power to injure their more industrious neighbors  crows  of late years have become a very great nuisance not only for rooting up wheat and other grain in a sprouting state but clover and protatoes corn stacks and young plantations are greatly injured by them last spring a collection of sixpence a plough was made by a few farmers in glendale ward for pulling down their nests many thousands were destroyed by this means and we hope the practice will be continued until they are found less pernicious  foxes  are very numerous and very destructive to young lambs in a district like this where so many sheep are bred but while they are so anxiously preserved for the chase we despair of seeing any regulations take place for reducing the numbers of this mischievous animal  dogs  in every place are swarming two thirds of them at least are kept by people who have no manner of use for them and are constantly complaining of their inability to obtain food for their families it would be doing these people an act of justice to exempt them from doing statute duty on the highways on condition they did not keep a dog and to supply the deficiency by laying a tax upon dogs which tax should be applied toward repairing the roads since the first edition of this report the legistature have thought proper to lay a tax upon a certain description of dogs but have exempted the only ones which are a nuisance to the community   conclusion review of some particular parts in taking a review of the foregoing report we find that the minerals are of great importance to this county in respect to the coals it appears that they are not inexhaustible and in two or three centuries will probably be so far wrought out that the metropolis will have to be supplied from other districts with this necessary article of a very inferior quality and at a much higher price  the most striking parts in a view of the agriculture are the great extent of farms leases for    years and the opulence intelligence and enterprising spirit of the farmers but the most prominent feature is keeping a due balance betwixt the arable and grass lands so as always to have a large breeding live stock especially of sheep  various systems of husbandry have been tried and the boasted one of turnips barley clover and wheat has been pursued till the crops have evidently declined particularly the turnips and clover and the only means of restoring such lands has been by adopting the system of three years arable and three years grass depastured with sheep and a small proportion of cattle by this mode nature has time to prepare a sufficient leaclod which being turned up for the turnip fallow will ensure a vigorous crop of turnips as it is well known they always flourish upon fresh land or where they find the remains of a leaclod to vegetate in it is from this circumstance and the peculiar and excellent mode of cultivating them that such great crops are produced with not more than  0 or    cart loads of dung per acre crops that are seldom worth less than     or  l per acre for the purposes of feeding cattle and sheep have in some instances been sold for   and  l per acre this mode of cultivating turnips in drills is also of great importance being much superior to the broadcast culture not only for the turnip crop but for every other crop that succeeds them  the proportion betwixt the quantities in arable and grass varies according to the quality of the soil and other circumstances but in most situations it is usual to keep a certain portion of the best and richest old grazing lands constantly in grass as a corpse de reserve in case the artificial grasses fail and on strong clayey soils for depasturing a portion of the store flock upon in winter for this purpose it is necessary upon such soils to have a much larger portion of old grass land than upon dry loams and which is generally eaten lightly in the latter part of summer that there may be a good aftermath against the time the artificial grasses fail  it is this union of stock and tillage and pursuing the system mentioned in page    that enables the farmers to pay such high rents and which keeps the land always in a due state of fertility to produce the most profitable crops there is a certain state of fertility necessary for producing maximum crops of grain land may be too rich as well as too poor for growing corn we have frequently seen crops of wheat rendered of little or no value by the injudicious application of a few cart loads of manure per acre more than was necessary upon lands made too rich corn is very apt to lodge which not only injures the crop of grain but entirely destroys the clover and artificial grasses sown along with it and at the same time is managed and kept clear of weeds at the least expense the portion that is kept in grass for three years breeds and fattens such a number of sheep as leave a considerable profit probably equal if not more than the arable crops the yearly profits of a sheep being estimated at not less than from  0 to  0s   or   of which an acre of clover will fatten and an acre of turnips about double the number  but this system are obtained the principal advantages of folding without any of its inconveniences for if on an average the  st years clover and grass carry   sheep per acre for  0 weeks  d ditto   ditto  0 ditto  d ditto   ditto  0 ditto and the turnips    ditto  0 ditto that is    sheep per acre for  0 weeks which is after the rate of   0 sheep per acre for one week once in six years at the same time that the sheep are leaving on an average a profit of    shillings a year each  by this means and the lime and manure laid on the fallow turnips or drilled beans the lands are kept in the highest state of fertility for producing all kinds of grain and green crops and the profits from the sheep we presume are much greater than could be obtained from the foldingbreeds by the mode of folding practiced in norfolk and some other parts of the kingdom  it our farms were stocked with those breeds of sheep so much extolled for their folding properties and managed under the folding system we are clearly of opinion from having examined the various breeds that a very great diminution of rental would take place in a few years but when the northumbrian farmers are informed that the profits of a norfolk sheep in lamb wool and folding are only from  0 to    shillings per year sussolk report by a young esquire we need not be apprehensive that they will adopt this practice the remnant of a barbarous age when the country was for the most part in open townfields with appendant common but which we hope will give way to a more enlightened system though this prejudice for foldingsheep like many others will probably require a series of years totally to extirpate it the misfortune is that those who know the least about stock are generally the most bigoted for retaining the original breeds of the country and the loudest to raise a clamor against innovation and attempts at improvement  it will be proper to observe that the sheep stock of this district has been so much improved within the last  0 years that they can now be sold fatter at    months old than they used to be at more than double that age yet we find that the same childish arguments were used at that time against changing the established breed of the country as are used by some people at this day in favor of the worst breed of sheep in the kingdom  this improvement in the sheep stock has been accomplished by the practice of hiring tups at no inconsiderable prices and which is now become so prevalent and so many competitors have entered the lists that we hope the spirit of emulation will not slacken and that we shall see additional improvements every year  having thus taken a short review of the most striking features of the agricultural practice of this district we shall next proceed to offer a few hints on the  means of improvement to those few who practice the system of taking two white crops to a fallow and of continuing their land in tillage for nine twelve or more years and of sowing it up with common hayseeds white clover etc and letting it continue as many years in grass as it continued in tillage we would recommend the system in the article rotation of crops page     of drilling beans and pease  we have before expressed our surprise that so excellent a practice should be neglected in all that extensive district along the sea coast where they are so much cultivated we hope that the good sense and enterprising spirit of the wealthy farmers of this district will no longer be swayed by old customs but will be ready to make a fair experiment of a system which has been practiced on similar soils with success and may in all probability be equally beneficial on theirs the difference betwixt a naked fallow and a crop of beans is too striking to need any elucidation  watered meadows  there are many parts of this county capable of deriving great benefits from this practice especially where the waters are unmixed with vitriolic impurities derived from their connection with coal mines or strata of aluminous earth we have also our suspicions of such waters as are strongly tinctured by infusions of peatmoss  draining  is also another operation from which great advantages are to result but they should be hollow drains executed with judgment and well secured and not surface drains a foot wide and six or eight inches deep such are mere temporary reliefs to a tenant but no permanent improvement  in the live stock of this county there is certainly great improvement to be made and like many other branches of science the more we investigate the subject the more we are convinced of its unlimited improvements but improvements of this kind are not so easily spread as those of cultivation if a farmer sees any modes of practice more beneficial than those he knew before he can readily adopt them or if he discovers and selects a new variety of any species of grain more productive and more valuable than any hitherto known it multiplies so fast that it is readily disseminated but improved breeds of stock are not so readily diffused they are much flower in their propagation and much more easily contaminated and are only to be preserved by attention and judgment when these become general we may hope that improved breeds of stock will prevail over the whole county this period is probably more distant than a true patriot would wish but in the mean time we hope that those who are already possessed of improved breeds of stock will not slacken in their pursuits that by their example the knowledge and practice of breeding may by degrees be better understood and a spirit of emulation more generally diffused when we consider and reflect how slow that most valuable breed of sheep now best known by the appellation of the dishley breed has spread and how very small a part of this island they still cover one would be almost led to think that the breeders were not blessed with the senses of seeing and feeling  mr bakewell has been employed above  0 years in the important task of improving this breed of sheep to a degree of perfection unknown at any former period yet it is a very few years since many of his near neighbors pursued a very different and less lucrative species to this day we are pretty well informed that more than half the large fertile county of lincoln continue to breed a slow feeding unprofitable kind though adjoining the county of leicester which is the more to be regretted because that county certainly produces more sheep than any other in the island and perhaps we do not hazard too much if we assert it as our opinion that it sends more mutton to market than any two counties in the kingdom however we flatter ourselves that the labors of the board of agriculture will have a happy tendency toward opening mens eyes and convincing them of the propriety of not only cultivating the ground in a more masterly manner but of stocking their pastures with the most profitable animals  public farms  in every county conducted by proper persons would tend more toward forwarding the perfection of agriculture in all its branches than any other measure that has ever been suggested and as the gentlemen of large landed property would be the most interested in the results of such an institution they certainly ought to be the guardians and supporters of  the principal expense would be at its first institution when once got into a proper system it would require little if any further aid  if estates of  00l a year and upwards were only to contribute  0l per thousand yearly rent it would in this county raise a sum sufficient for setting forward the undertaking we suppose the farms to contain from  00 to  000 acres of various sorts of land some mountain pastures and an opportunity of converting a part of it into watered meadows we know situations of this sort that might be rented for five or six hundred pounds a year  a farm of this kind would not only be a school where youth might be instructed in agriculture but even experienced farmers might often visit it with advantage to learn the results of new experiments and adopt those that promised to be useful  it would be easy to enlarge on this subject and suggest many useful appendants to such an institution should the gentlemen of landed property ever think of carrying a scheme of this kind into execution  cumberland a tly a rtile  with  of turnip soil no coal nor lime b  lam no coal nor lime c  lam no coal limestone on the east side

fertile clays or rather rich strong loams occupy but a small portion of this county formerly this kind of soil was generally employed in grazing or the dairy but since the introduction of growing wheat it has been converted into tillage and produces excellent crops of grain   d dry loams including the various degrees from the rich brown loam to the light sandy soils this is the most prevalent occupying a greater portion of the county than any other not only the lower districts but the fteep sides of the mountains are in general of this soil and in many places even their summits are covered with a dry sound earth producing green sward with little heath we suppose at least one half of the lower or cultivatable district is of this valuable soil excellently adapted to the culture of turnips artificial grasses the various species of grain and of breeding and feeding the most improved kinds of stock particularly sheep it being perfectly sound or safe from the rot   d wet loam generally on a clay bottom the fertility of this soil is various depending on the thickness of the staple and the nature of the clay below it is dangerous for sheep but may be applied with advantage to keeping cows for the dairy breeding young cattle and horses and to the culture of wheat oats clover and ray grass   th black peat earth is most prevalent on the mountainous districts particularly those adjoining northumberland and durham it is also found on moors or commons in the lower parts of the county in some places only a few inches thick upon a white sand well known by those whose lot it has been to cultivate it to be an ungrateful and unprofitable soil  the surface is beautifully diversified with level plains and rising eminences deep sequestered vales and stupendous mountains open braky heathy commons and irregular enclosures in some parts enriched with tufted groves and rising plantations the whole watered with innumerable streams and extensive lakes abounding with fish of various denominations which with plenty of game add to the recreation and luxury of the inhabitants  it naturally divides into two districts the mountainous incapable of being improved by the plough and the cultivatable or all such parts as have been or can be improved by tillage  the mountainous districts are separated into two divisions one of which bounds the east side of the county and is the highest part of that ridge of mountains that divide the eastern and western coasts of the island from derbyshire in england to linlithgow in scotland crossfell hartsidefell geltsdaleforest and spadeadamwaste are the names of that portion of the ridge which passes through this county these mountains are composed of strata of different kinds of stone and are rich in coal lime and leadore but are no way remarkable for any striking irregularities of surface  the other division of mountainous district occupies the southwest part of the county known by the names of skiddaw saddleback helvellin wreynose hardknot scafell etc etc remarkable for their steep broken rocky sides and romantic shapes and are in general one mass of that kind of stone which produces the beautiful blue slate so much and so deservedly esteemed for covering the roofs of houses they are destitute of coal lime or metallic ores but in some measure repay this defect by affording such valuable slates and producing that singular mineral substance blacklead which is found in borrowdale and it is said no where else in the southern part of the kingdom  the height ruggedness steepness of the sides in some places ornamented with wood and projecting rocks the varied forms sublime assemblage and picturesque beauty of these mountains and the lakes they environ form scenes that few other places if any in the island can equal and have at different times exercised the pens of many descriptive writers  it comes only within our province to remark that this kind of slaty stone appears to be very friendly to vegetation the soil which covers the steep sides of these mountains and found in considerable depth at their bases is in great part decayed slate and the most fertile soils in the vales we suspect have a large portion of this slaty matter in their composition this is the case in the vale of keswick and particularly at millbeck and along the western base of skiddaw  from a map of cumberland published by messrs hodgkinson and donald laid down from a scale of two miles to an inch we calculate that acres the mountainous districts contain    000 improvable common   0000 old enclosures   0000 lakes and waters  000 total quantity of acres in the whole county   0000  sect    minerals this county abounds with coal lime and leadore it also produces blacklead copper gypsum lapis caliminaris and excellent slate  coal  as observed in the last section is found in many parts of the eastern mountains and with not many exceptions all along that tract extending in different degrees of breadth from sebergham to whitehaven and along the coast to maryport forming a district of about  00 square miles  cannel coal is got in large quantities in the parishes of caldbeck and bolton  limestone  abounds in most parts of the eastern mountains and in the parishes of graystock dacre penrith broad field common etc and in the neighborhood of egremont and whitehaven  gypsum  is got in the parishes of wetheral and st cuthberts carlisle but has never been applied there as manure  leadore  is got in great abundance in alston moor and in a lesser degree in the parishes of caldbeck and melmerby  in the lead mines is also found the lapis caliminaris  copperore  is found also at caldbeck melmerby and at hesket but at present not worked with that success which formerly attended them  blacklead  is found only in borrowdale a few miles west of keswick  blue slates  of an excellent quality are gotten in borrowdale and inferior sorts in some of the neighboring mountains  freestones  abound in most parts of the county some of which split into good slate but are more heavy less durable and require stronger timber to support them than the blue slate and are also more subject to imbibe moisture  sect    waters though this county enjoys an extent of    miles of seacoast yet it cannot boast of its navigable rivers the tide flowing not more than two or three miles up the greatest part of them even the eden by much the largest is perplexed with shoals and its navigation cannot be said to reach beyond sandsfield though the tide flows a few miles further  there are few places where water is so abundant and good as this district is blessed with for besides the large rivers eden derwent esk etc  every village and almost every farm enjoys the benefit of a pure spring or is visited by a rivulet the larger rivers abound with salmon trout and various other kinds of fish and the smaller brooks with trouts and eels it is also ornamented with many beautiful and extensive lakes which with their pleasing accompaniments have of late years made the tour of the lakes a fashionable amusement and from whence considerable emoluments have resulted to the neighboring inhabitants  chapter ii state of property sect    estates there are probably few counties where property in land is divided into such small parcels as in cumberland and those small properties so universally occupied by the owners the annual value of these tenements varies from  l to  0l a year but the generality are from   l to  0l some few extend to  00l or a little more  the rental of the largest estate in the county is said to amount to about   000l per annum  sect    tenures by far the greatest part of this county is held under lords of manors by that species of vassalage called customary tenure subject to the payment of sines and heriots on alienation death of the lord or death of tenant and the payment of certain annual rents and performance of various services called boondays such as getting and leading the lords peats ploughing and harrowing his land reaping his corn haymaking carrying letters etc etc whenever summoned by the lord  we cannot pretend to be accurate but believe that twothirds of the county are held by this kind of tenure principally in those small tenements described in the last chapter  the remaining part is mostly freehold which has increased with the enclosure of commons and sometimes whole parishe or manors have been enfranchised on these occasions copyhold and leasehold are rarely met with  chapter iii buildings sect    houses of proprietors descriptions of gentlemens seats we presume come more under the notice of a topographical survey than an agricultural one we therefore must refer to different tourists and more particularly to hutchinsons history of cumberland now publishing  sect    farm houses etc through the greatest part of this county the farmhouses are remarkably well built of stone except a small district in the neighborhood of abbeyholm and the northeast extremity of the county particularly in the parishes of bewcastle stapleton kirklinton kirkandrews and arthuret where they are mostly built of mud or clay and form a miserable contrast to the buildings in the other part of the county the blue slate roofs and white dashed walls give them a look of neatness that is peculiarly pleasing and prepossess a stranger with a favorable idea of the cleanliness of the inhabitants an idea which he finds wellfounded on further investigation  these houses have for the most part a kitchen and a parlour in front a toofall backkitchen and milkhouse behind with four or five lodging rooms above the front contains five middle sized sashwindows two below stairs and three above  where farms are so very small no great extent of farmoffices are wanted a barn a byer for housing their cattle in winter and a small stable are in general all that is nenecessary no regular plan for the form or site seems to have been adopted every one building according to what he thinks the most convenient for his stock and situation but they are mostly built at each end of the farmhouse foldyards surrounded by proper offices with a shed for cattle are very rare in many parts of the county we believe they are most prevalent in the parish of hesket and its vicinity the best and largest we noticed was at lord muncasters  we observed in some parts of the county a singular practice of covering the perpendicular walls of their houses with blue slate to prevent we suppose any kind of moisture from penetrating them  repairs are generally made at the joint expense of landlord or tenant the former supporting walls doors and timber and the latter thatch slate glass etc  sect    cottages of this description of buildings there are not many purposely erected for laborers in agriculture very few of that class being wanted in this county as the farms are so small the occupiers and their families are generally sufficient for the work without any foreign aid  chapter iv mode of occupation sect    size of farms on the large estates there are some farms from  00l to   0l a year few reach  00l and we only heard of four or five that got as high as   or  00l a year and one of  00l but the most general size of farms in this county is from   l to  0l a year  cumberland farmers may be divided into three classes the occupiers of large farms the small proprietors provincially  lairds or statesmen and the small farmers  it is to the first class and the gentlemen farmers that this district owes the introduction of any of the modern improvements in agriculture and we were glad to find a spirit of enterprise arising amongst them for the adoption of new modes of culture and improved breeds of stock  to the small proprietors  agriculture we presume is little indebted for its advancement these statesmen seem to inherit with the estates of their ancestors their notions of cultivating them and are almost as much attached to the one as the other they are rarely aspiring and seem content with their situation nor is luxury in any shape an object of their desires their little estates which they cultivate with their own hands produce almost every necessary article of food and clothing they in part manufacture themselves they have a high character for sincerity and honesty and probably few people enjoy more ease and humble happiness  the small farmer  is obliged to raise such crops as will pay him best for the present and avoid every expense of which he does not receive the immediate advantage by which means his farm and himself are always kept in a state of poverty many of these small farmers are also mechanics and agricultural laborers that farm from  l to  0 or   l a year  sect    rent in the vicinity of towns land lets from  l to  l an acre farm at a distance from towns from   to  0s per acre in general the average may be stated at about   s per acre rent is almost universally paid in money  sect    tithes tithes are mostly taken in kind a few parishes pay a modus in lieu of tithes and others are tithefree in consequence of a portion of common being given to the improprietor  sect    poor rates at carlisle  s 0d  wigton  s  d  aldston  s 0d  harnington  s    kirkoswald  s  d  and in many of the country parishes they vary from  d to  0d per pound  sect    leases the noblemen and gentlemen who enjoy the most considerable landed property in this county let no leases some have verbal contracts for seven years which are next to none and of those who let leases the term is only for five seven or nine years besides the usual reservations of mines wood etc the tenant convenants to pay the rent cesses taxes and to keep all in repair some are confined to a certain quantity of tillage and to fallow onefourth yearly others are under no restraint of this kind a few others are consined to lay on a certain quantity of lime and to sow with white clover and hayseeds the lands that are laid to grass these are the principal covenants that affect agriculture to enumerate such as are of a local nature respecting the performance of cusstoms services grinding corn payment of chickens etc would add little to the improvement of agriculture or enlargement of rural science  sect    expense and profit for the mode of investigating this subject we must refer to the northumberland report page     chapter v implements the plough of this county is the swing plough used through all the northern counties in which we observed no improvement  to spend time in describing the harrow roller etc that have been used in almost every part of the kingdom for some centuries would be augmenting this report to little purpose  the carts through the whole of this county are drawn by a single horse and probably originated through necessity from the small farmer keeping no more than one horse in those times simplicity and cheapness were only considered we recollect seeing some of those tumble carrs without one piece of iron about them the wheels were made of three pieces of wood joined by pins of the same material it is probable they had the name of tumble carrs from the axle being made fast in the wheels and the whole turning or tumbling round together but this construction has given way to the wheel with a nave and spokes turning round a fixed axle which is much more managable in quick or short turns the price of a tumble carr is  l  the price of the other kind  l ready for yoking   the advantages of single horse carts are so well understood in this county that we did not see any other used  three single horse carts are driven without any difficulty by a man or a boy or even women and girls along the coast more than half the carts are driven by females and many of these under twenty years of age with as fine forms and complexions as ever nature bestowed on the softer sex we cannot help saying we were disgusted at seeing them put to this employment and especially at their riding in so awkward a manner behind the cartsaddle  double mouldboard ploughs  are used by some farmers to form the onebout ridges for turnips and potatoes and also for earthing them up  winnowing machines  have been lately introduced and are now become very general twenty years since corn was winnowed without any sort of machine and the farmer was under the necessity of waiting for a natural wind sufficiently strong to blow the chaff from the grain and very often had to take it to some eminence at a distance where the breeze was more certain  threshing machines drills for sowing the various kinds of grain and horse hoes have not yet found their way into this district  chapter vi enclosures the mountainous districts are all open and most probably will long remain so the cultivatable parts are a mixture of old enclosures and commons interspersed through every part of the county  the size of enclosures in general is in proportion to the size of farms the ancient fields are small and irregular the fences of various constructions walls earth mounds thorns hazle and other brushwood all lend their aid in a greater or less degree and in two or three places we observed large tracts totally enclosed by whinfences ulex europeans  furze  gorse  whins which have a very ragged slovenly and uncouth appearance from the numberless gaps where the whins have been destroyed by frost an accident to which this plant is very liable nothing but the greatest necessity can justify the use of whinfences  the fields of those commons that have been divided within the last thirty years are laid out in straight lines and mostly enclosed by quick fences which in general have done very well  the advantages that arise from enclosing in respect to increase of produce or value must entirely depend upon the modes of management pursued after the enclosing takes place from the abundant crops produced by land which has never grown grain before the occupier vainly thinks that it will always continue to do so and the deception is still increased by the stimulating effects of lime but alas after having got nine or ten crops the golden prospect vanished the farther they proceed the more they are convinced of their error and growing corn having become a losing trade the land is left to grass but what can it produce already exhausted by repeated corn crops and over dozes of lime it remains a spectacle of the bad effects of such culture and a warning to others to avoid the same course even under this treatment the increased value is in the ratio of three or four to one had these lands been continued in tillage only three years at one time the first year oats second fallow turnips or rape the third wheat or oats or if the soil suited barley sown up with clover and raygrass and depastured with sheep for three four or five years according to circumstances and situations we will venture to say the land would have gone on improving from rotation to rotation would have been more prositable and put on a very different aspect to what it does at present and have been worth double the rent it now lets for  the advantages arising from enclosing of commons in respect to the improvement of stock is obvious while in a state of common every one turns on what he pleases and there is generally double the quantity of stock that there ought to be the consequence is they make no improvement they barely exist the yearly prosits how small should an enlightened breeder wish to improve his sheep how is he to effect it while his ewes mix promiscuously with his neighbors slocks if he had the best tup in the kingdom can he be sure that one of his ewes would be tupped by him while there are probably not less than a score of his neighbors to contest the female with him on the other hand if the common were enclosed every one would stint with that species of stock for which his allotment was best adapted and in such numbers as would insure profit when he can confine his ewes within his own enclosure he can make whatever experiment he pleases by putting a few or many ewes to any particular tup without any fear or apprehension of having a spurious breed by the interference of his neighbors he is also enabled to keep his flock from many disorders few commons but have some tracts of land liable to the rot how are they to be prevented from depasturing upon it or if the scab or other infectious disorders have taken place amongst any flock on the common how is he to avoid it  to the question put by the board has enclosing commons decreased population  we answer that we cannot conceive how enclosing of commons can decrease population unless an increase of corn and cattle an increased demand for laborers and mechanics of various denominations tend to decrease mankind the contrary position must certainly hold good in an eminent degree  the best account we could obtain of commons divided by act of parliament were sowerby about    years since sedbergham about  0 years since stainton  0 culgaith    carlton    skeleton    brampton    irthington newby farlam     at the last four places the lord of the manor had    th for his consent as lord of the soil and making the allotments freehold at most of the others the lord had   th  chapter vii arable land sect    tillage tillageland is here commonly ploughed by horses a team of oxen we believe is not to be found in the county the horses are yoked double and driven with cords by the ploughman an acre is accounted a good days work and on light soils an acre and a half  the ridges are very narrow from   to   feet being the common breadth whether in corn or in grass  fallows for wheat or turnips  are ploughed once in the autumn by the best cultivators and four or five times in the course of the succeeding summer  barley  is sown on one ploughing after turnips but after a white crop as in rotation first they plough twice and manure with  0 or  0 cartloads of dung some add lime  oats  are always sown on one ploughing  sect    fallowing fallowing for wheat and turnips is practiced in many parts of this county four or five ploughings and harrowings is the general practice we saw some very clean and well managed gathered up into neat narrow ridges on which the wheat was looking very healthy  sect    rotation of crops the most prevalent system through a great part of this county is to have a crop of white corn every year while in ploughing such cultivators make no fallows except ploughing twice and manuring for barley can be deemed such  where a field is ploughed out from grass they have oats  oats  barley  oats or oats  barley  oats  oats etc etc for nine or twelve years and then left to grass for seven or nine years some few sow hayseeds and a little white clover but the greatest part leave it to nature on asking a farmer at uldale why they sowed no clover or grass seeds he replied we have no occasion for the land is naturally girsproud those that are experienced in cultivation will readily admit that after growing from six to twelve white crops in succession it can scarcely be otherwise than grassproud there is certainly grass in abundance but of such kind as no good farmer would wish to be possessed of this barbarous system is practiced upon many dry loamy soils which after being thus left to grass cover amazingly fast with moss probably owing to the bad cultivation and exhausting crops of corn more than to the wetness of the climate to which it is generally attributed   where they fallow for wheat the rotation is   fallow   wheat   oats or barley   oats  for   or   rotations and then left for grass for seven or nine years some few sow clover and hay seeds   in those places where the turnip culture is practiced the rotation is   turnips   barley   clover   ditto   oats   ditto or   turnips   wheat   barley   clover   ditto   oats   we are glad to find that two or three individuals have adopted the idea of not taking two white crops in succession and pursue the excellent rotation of turnips  barley  clover two years  then oats or wheat  sect    crops commonly cultivated wheat is a modern production here a general opinion used to prevail that wheat could not be grown in many parts of this county we were informed that it is not much more than  0 years since summer fallows for wheat were first used and it is not twenty years since lord muncaster introduced summer fallows and the culture of wheat in the neighborhood of ravenglass where it is now grown in great abundance as well as all along the coast to scotland and in the neighborhood of carlisle the wheat that is sown after turnips or clover is trifling the main supply is from summer fallows they generally sow two bushels and a half per acre in september or october as the season suits and they reap from sixteen to thirty bushes per acre  barley and oats being the grains from which the bread of the inhabitants is made were probably the first and only corn grown in this county for many centuries bigg or bear with four rows of grains on the ear was the kind of barley formerly cultivated but lately the common early sort with two rows has been introduced they sow two and a half bushels per acre in april or may and reap twentyone bushels on an average  the common oat was the only variety grown in this county and is now by far the most prevalent but of late years a few enterprising individuals have introduced the early varieties of this grain with great advantage they are distinguished from the common oat by the name of layland oat and are the dutch or friesland oat last year mr falder near roes castle introduced the oat known on the east borders by the name of churchs oat a variety and perhaps the best variety known of the poland oat and which will no doubt answer well on all the best rich soils in the county   the quantity sown  is from four to six bushels per acre  the time of sowing  march or april  the produce  from    to  0 bushels per acre but the average of the county was stated to us to be only  0 bushels per acre  pease  in a climate where so much rain falls and where the harvest is so precarious the culture of pease would be attended with so many chances of loss and so few of gain that we were not surprised to find them so generally neglected the difficulty of harvesting them has probably first suggested the idea of building their stacks in the cloughs where the main stem divides into branches of trees and afterward in slender high pyramids round the boles of tall trees to prevent them from blowing over by this method they can also lead and stack them in a damper or moister state and as they do not come near the ground by five or six feet they are seldom troubled with mice the greatest diameter of the stacks is not more than six or seven feet the height of many twelve or fifteen if the tree has not a sufficiency of convenient branches to bear the bottom they nail a stick or two across to form a base when finished they have a very singular appearance  turnips were first cultivated in this county to any effect for the use of cattle by philip howard esquire of corby in the year      his first essay was drilled at four feet distance the crop amazingly good the weight on an average  0 lb each turnip some weighed    lb he afterward continued to grow them at two feet and two and a half feet distance with constant success for eight or ten years before any farmer followed the example at last mr collins of wetherall made a trial and succeeded others soon followed him  it is therefore about thirty years since a few farmers first began to cultivate turnips and considering with what tardiness new modes of practice generally make their way amongst that useful class of society it is no wonder that the growing of turnips should in a great measure be still confined to the vicinity where their cultivation originated and we suppose by the mode of practice that from this source may be traced the various patches of turnips we observed at netherby burgh dalton and a few other places  the land after being made sufficiently fine by repeated ploughings and harrowings is set up in onebout ridges provincially stitches at  0 inches distance the dung is put in the bottom of the hollow intervals and covered with earth by the plough the top of the onebout ridge is flattened by trailing a piece of wood over it and on the flattened top the turnip seed is sown by a drill which a man pushes before him like a wheelbarrow  the drilled turnips are hoed and set out a about eight or nine inches distance in the rows which are ploughed between by a small plough  hoeing broadcast turnips is not understood if any are sown this way they go unhoed and if too thick are handweeded mess williamson and monkhouse paid  0s per acre this year      for handweeding their broadcast turnips  the value of this excellent vegetable is not sufficiently understood in this county otherwise it must have made a more rapid progress probably this may be owing to its being applied to feeding their own breed of sheep we saw several acres of turnips this year that were sold for from  l to  l  0s per acre which a northumberland grazier would have thought worth five or six pounds an acre for feeding the improved breed of longwoolled sheep  potatoes are cultivated in onebout ridges by almost every farmer not only for the use of their own families but for sale where the situation is not too distant from a good market it is only upon the estate of sir james graham at netherby that they are applied to feeding cattle and swine and by lord muncaster to feeding cattle who also gives them to his horses mr lamb and mr blalock favored us with the following particulars  mr blalock feeds cows and says that   0 bushels of potatoes with    stones of oatmeal will fatten a cow in three months equally well as turnips of   or  l value  the small farmers apply potatoes to feeding swine thirty bushels of potatoes and ten of corn made into meal will fatten a swine of eighteen or twenty stones weight equal to corn of  l   s value the potatoes are boiled and meal mixed with them  from these data the value of potatoes may be nearly estimated l s d the expense of feeding a cow with potatoes and meal is      0 from which deduct the value of    stones of oatmeal      0 leaves for   0 bushels of potatoes   0 0 l s d the expense of feeding a swine with potatoes and meal is      0 deduct the value of corn  0 bushels fire attendance etc     0 leaves for  0 bushels of potatoes 0  0 0  from the above it appears that potatoes for feeding cows or swine are worth no more than  d per bushel they estimate a fair average crop of potatoes to be   0 bushels per acre the value at  d per bushel is only  l out of which the seed ought to be deducted the other expenses attending the cultivation of potatoes and turnips being much upon a par  the land on which these potatoes are grown is a most excellent turnip soil and would produce turnips almost any year worth  l per acre for feeding cattle or sheep mr d  asks how can turnips be worth  l per acre for feeding cattle and sheep  we reply nothing is more common they are srequently sold for much more from the above statement it appears that an acre of potatoes is of less value than an acre of turnips for feeding cattle mr lamb has been long convinced of this and says that the practice of applying potatoes to feeding cattle and swine is every year losing ground and the culture of turnips which was pretty general here twenty years since but gave way to potatoes is now in its turn regaining the situation it so justly deserves  sect    crops not commonly cultivated beans  we were informed are seldom cultivated with success the failure may probably be owing to their being sown broad cast without manure and not hoed we would recommend to some spirited cultivator to try them in drills at  0 inches intervals so as to admit of being horsehoed and ploughed between this mode we can recommend on the successful practice of several years see northumberland report   cabbages  have been cultivated by lord muncaster dr harrison of penrith and a few others in that vicinity  carrots  have also been tried by lord muncaster who found them a very troublesome and expensive crop owing to the abundance of weeds occasioned by the great rains and moisture of the climate  flax  is cultivated in small quantities on the northern extremities of the county for family use but much less now than formerly  chapter viii grass sect    natural meadows and pastures natural meadows are generally found in narrow strips by the sides of rivers the largest tract of natural meadow in this county is in the parish of scaleby which lets for   s per acre also between the lakes of keswick and bassenthwaite there is a considerable extent of natural meadow  natural pastures are not very numerous in the cultivateable districts of the county unless such may be called natural pasture which is left to nature to cover with herbage after having been exhausted with growing corn if by natural pastures be understood such as have never been disturbed by the plough there will be found great abundance in this county as not only all the commons in the cultivateable districts but the mountains may come under that denomination  sect    artificial grasses artificial grasses are here confined to a small number  red clover trifolium pratense white clover trifolium repens common hayfeeds with a little rib grass plantago lanceolata and raygrass lolium perenne  we were informed that in      no person in the county had thought of sowing a field down with clover or even hayseeds and that philip howard esquire of corby was the first who sowed a field with clover and taught his countrymen the use of artificial grasses yet it is but a few that have benefited by his laudable exertions  red clover is principally sown where the turnip culture and summerfallowing for wheat are practiced and the land continues only two years in grass it is generally mown the first year and depastured the second the great objection to growing this valuable grass is the hoving of cattle which may be obviated by depasturing it with sheep or by a little caution in having the cattle pretty full before they are turned into it and to take care to put them to it on a dry day some object to it because they have taken a fancy that it impoverishes the soil old ellis says clover is the mother of corn we believe that could the cumberland farmers be induced to make an experiment they would be of the same opinion and would find their profits so superior to what they are at present that they would become converts to the cause we hope we do not exaggerate when we say that the profits of red clover for two years would be double to that derived from the same quantity of ground sown with white clover rib grass and hayseeds and that the profits of the succeeding crop of corn would be nearly in the same ratio  white clover has many advocates and is certainly a valuable plant where land is intended to continue in grass for a few years which is generally the case here and by those who sow any kind of grass seeds it is in great repute it is seldom or never sown alone but accompanied by what is here called common hayseeds which are generally harmless from the heat they mostly get in the stacks and their vegetative powers thereby destroyed where that is not the case we fear more weeds than useful plants would be the produce for when it is considered that of the useful plants which compose a good meadow scarce two of them flower and ripen at the same period and as the time of mowing is governed more by the weather or other circumstances than the collection of useful seeds it may happen that not one valuable plant may then have its seeds in that state of perfection which is necessary for the reproduction of its species at the same time it is probable that you may obtain the seeds of many plants which you would wish to avoid  rib grass is sown in some places where land is intended to continue in grass  raygrass has here but few advocates a general prejudice against this plant seems to have taken place we think unjustly for we are convinced from long experience that under proper management it is a valuable grass it grows in all soils and in all situations early in the spring and late in autumn and even through winter on dry soils and in open weather the only reasonable objection we know of is the great propensity it has to run to seed but this may be easily obviated by eating it bare with cattle or by mowing the pasture just before it begins to flower which increases the eatage by the quantity of bottom grass it sends forth after the operation  it is the properest grass we know to sow along with red or white clover and we would beg leave to recommend it instead of common hayseeds so universally sown in this county with clover both red and white  sect    hay harvest the hay harvest is here in the months of july and august the modes of management various according to the nature of the grass weather and notions of the farmer we do not find any thing peculiarly excellent in their practice the only singularity is that the occupiers of small farms in some parts of the county put the whole of their hay into barns the larger farmers stack theirs at the door  sect    feeding the most general system of grazing is  on the richest grounds cattle with a few sheep on the less luxuriant sheep only  the kinds of cattle usually fatted are the native country breed and scotch cattle both kyloes and the galloway kind of these they sind the kyloes the quickest feeders the galloway next and their own country breed of long horns the slowest  the prosits of grazing cattle depend much on the skill of the buyer in selecting the quickest feeders and when fat in selling them for their full value also not unfrequently on the state of markets  the best grazing lands we saw were at pap castle near cockermouth let at  l per acre and the holm lands on both sides the eden near carlisle let at  l  0s per acre for the purposes of grazing only mr tealson of the former place buys in oxen and heifers in october keeps them all winter upon the pastures out of which his fat stock has been recently sold and gives them a little hay in bad weather after keeping them near twelve months they leave on an average a profit of  l each their weight from fifty to sixty stone but this interligent gentleman was candid enough to confess that he thought sheep mixed amongst cattle a more profitable system and we were glad to find this mode practiced by all the best graziers in the county  of sheepgrazing there are two branches first feeding wethers and secondly ewes for fat lambs they are both bought in the autumn are kept on grass the whole time and get no other food except hay in stormy weather  l s d the profits are a wether sold fat

to manchester and liverpool  the kinds of sheep grazed are the country breed the true blackfaced heath sheep and the cheviot sheep the most experienced graziers all agreed that the true blackfaced heath sheep were quicker feeders and a hardier race than the cheviot we wish to be understood as not stating this as an ascertained fact but as an opinion of the cumberland graziers and farmers   chapter ix gardens and orchards gardens and orchards in this county are considered only as conveniences to private families and not as objects of emolument or commerce as in some other districts  chapter x woods and plantations this county is far from being well wooded the irthing eden and caldew are the only rivers whose banks produce any quantity of natural wood and of these the banks of the caldew seem to have the largest proportion of old oaktimber of the value of the oaktimber proper for the purposes of shipbuilding we could obtain no satisfactory information but suspect from what we saw it is of small extent we fear the oak is not suffered to attain a sufficient age for this purpose as we saw a wood near west ward now felling of upwards of two hundred acres that was little more than thirty years old the whole cut away without leaving any to stand for ship timber  of late years many plantations have been made near gentlements seats which show by their vigorous growth how well adapted the greatest part of this county is for the production of wood from the nakedness of the country along the coast one would naturally conclude that the situation was inimical to that production but lord muncasters extensive and thriving plantations near ravenglass show that the nakedness of the land is owing to other causes if a customary tenant plants wood he cannot cut it without leave of the lord in some cases the lord claims it as his own which sufficiently explains why the occupiers do not plant wood   chapter xi wastes the extent of wasle lands in this county is very great  of mountainous pasture    000 acres which we suppose not capable of improvement from the plough yet many parts of these districts might be applied to planting with considerable advantage and would probably in this way make a better return than if the soil had been in such a situation as to admit of being converted into tillage we were glad to see a large plantation of larches thriving exceedingly well on the steep edge of the west side of skiddaw lately planted by mr story we hope the example will be speedily and extensively followed by every propriertor of similar situations but unfortunately the greatest part of these districts is in a state of common and no improvement of this kind can take place while they continue in that situation of course the first step to improvement is a division and for every proprietor to know his own part if this cannot be done the only means of improvement then left is to convert them from unlimited commons to stinted pastures  the present value per acre of these mountainous districts may be nearly estimated from the following data  mr greenhow of thrkeld takes pasturage for his sheep on skiddaw forest for a year at  s per score which is threepence per sheep and supposing an acre keeps a sheep then will threepence an acre be the yearly value of these mountains they can scarce be in a less productive state an acre of wood if it only grew broomsticks would pay much better  of the commons in the less elevated parts of the county there are many with large tracts of excellent soil capable of being improved by judicious culture proper draining and improved breeds of sheep to many times their present value which is certainly very small probably not more than from one to two shillings per acre in a county like this that does not raise corn sufficient for the consumption of its inhabitants and where it is always onefourth or onefifth dearer than in an adjoining county it is lamentable to see such extensive tracts of good corn land lying waste of no value to its owners and of no benefit to the community instead of the present scarcity of grain large quantities might be yearly exported and instead of the ill formed poor starved meagre animals that depasture the commons at present an abundant supply of good fat mutton would be had to grace the markets of the county and also to send off large supplies to newcastle liverpool manchester and other populous manufacturing places  it is difficult to say what would be the increased value of such land under proper management we think we cannot be wrong in stating that it would be at least from six to eight times the value to the proprietors  but of what advantage would it be to the public  acres we have already estimated that there are of improvable commons in the lower part of the county   0000 out of this deduct for banksides proper for planting and other unfertile places  0000 there will be left for cultivation   0000 suppose this be put into a rotation of three years tillage and three years grass then there will be in tillage yearly  0000  suppose onethird for fallow and of this one half to be turnips the other half naked fallow for wheat then will there be yearly acres bush per ac bush per an price val per acre oats  0000 at  0 is  00000 at  s pr bush is  0000l wheat  0000 at  0 is  00000 at  s pr ditto   0000 barley  0000 at  0 is  00000 at  s

will there be an increase of  0000 sheep yearly the profit of which cannot be valued at less than   s each the amount will be    00 total value of increased produce l    000  chapter xii improvements sect    draining draining is one of those improvements which has been introduced of late years into the northern counties and where it is done with judgment is in many situations of the greatest consequence  cumberland has not been behind its neigbours in adopting this beneficial measure we were glad to observe in many places great advantages gained both by hollow and surface drains some done with great art by one or more hollow drains running in the direction of the outburst of water and cut deep enough to get through the bed of sand or gravel in which the water runs and by that means arrest the source which drowns the land below it but the like intelligence has not in all places prevailed for we often saw the drains running in parallel directions perpendicular to the source and at such distances as the drainer thought the nature of the soil required this is more particularly the case where surface drains are used the hollow drains are filled with stones when they can be got otherwise with sods  sect    paring and burning this operation is seldom performed in this county except on heathy or coarse grounds the expense about   s per acre  sect    manuring farmyard dung is here as in most other places the chief resource of the farmer where turnips are grown it is wholly applied to their culture where they are not grown it is used for the various purposes of dressing grass land and for the barley and wheat crops  lime is found in great abundance in many parts of this county and of an excellent quality the quantity laid upon an acre varies from sixty to an hundred and fifty bushels we found it a general opinion that lime did little good to land that had been long accustomed to it and that those who had used the large quantity of   0 bushels per acre found their lands greatly exhausted and were now fully convinced of their error in continuing it so long especially in such large quantities we have had many opportunities of observing the abuse of lime which most probably is one of the best manures known for particular soils and situations and under peculiar circumstances and proper restrictions yet like many other good things a superabundance may be prejudical or rather we are sensible that too often repeated and in large quantities it becomes hurtful  lime is mostly laid on while the land is in a state of fallow but in some places we found it laid upon the grass land one or two years before they intended to plough it out we doubt the propriety of the latter mode  tangle or seaweed is used along the coast wherever it can be got the quantity per acre is fifty or sixty cartloads this is known to be a valuable manure either for corn turnips or grass wherever it can be had  slake or mud left by the tide is used in the neighborhood of ravenglass with good effect on the grass lands fifty or sixty cartloads per acre  muscles are also used in the neighborhood of ravenglass for manure after the rate of five or six cartloads per acre they are got on the sands adjoining the coast  sea sand  an accidental experiment of lord muncasters showed its utility in destroying moss but it is not used as a manure  compost  it seems a general practice through every part of the county to make a compost of lime and earth in the proportion of one cartload of lime to four or five of earth they use it as a topdressing to their grass lands and find it very beneficial  sect    weeding all kinds of grain are sown broadcast the only weeding it gets is by hand hoeing a crop of corn we believe was never once practiced in the county turnips and potatoes are the only crops in which weeds are destroyed by hoeing  sect    watering the only attempts we saw of this species of improvement that had the least resemblance to a watered meadow laid out by art was at bleatarn about six miles east of carlisle belonging to mr richardson of rickerby to whom his country is highly indebted for the spirited example he has set in many other improvements we were sorry to find there was little more water than what was collected by rains the ridges narrow and long the trenches small and inadequate to carry a sufficient quantity of water for the purpose intended it is unfortunate that the first attempt should have been made in such a situation and under such circumstances in a county so pregnant with favorable situations and the water of such an excellent quality uncontaminated with mineral particles or infusions that are suspected to be inimical to vegetation  sect    improving heath lands the best mode of improving peat earth being a desideratum of great consequence the more facts that can be collected upon this head the more light will be thrown on the subject and the more likely we shall be to obtain the object sought for  at bleatarn mr richardson has made great improvement on a poor black moory soil growing very short heath in its original state not worth sixpence per acre he ploughs in autumn and lets it lie till the autumn following then ploughs across and the next summer makes a complete fallow which he limes after the rate of one hundred and fifty bushels per acre and in april or may following sows it with grassseeds without corn in the following proportion per acre white clover   lb red   lb ribgrass   lb raygrass   bushels and common hayseeds   bushels  another mode is to plough up in the winter and leave it in that state through the summer to rot until next spring when it is ploughed across and made sufficiently fine by repeated harrowings ploughings and burning of the sods to sow with turnips in june to the above quantity of lime is added  0 singlehorse cart loads of dung on a part of the fallow this year we saw some drilled turnips worth  l an acre in addition to the lime they had fifty singlehorse cartloads of dung per acre but as dung is rarely to be procured for improvements of this kind we think that a crop of rape might be got for spring seed without dung which would certainly be better than a naked fallow as in the first mode the lands that have been laid down two years were full of grass from many observations made on similar improvements we have always found the first and second years grass by far the most valuable after this they decline in value and in a few years return to their original heath if not prevented by ploughing and excellent pasture for sheep but to make them thus productive they are loaded with the following expenses which according to mr richardsons estimate including the various ploughings harrowings lime dung grassseeds interest of money etc amount to   l   s  d per acre from which taking the value of the turnips  l leaves  l   s  d the expense per acre on the grass  near naward castle mr ramshay has made great exertions in reclaiming peatmoss by throwing it up with a spade into round ridges seven yards wide the top being from twelve to eighteen inches higher than the furrow which is cut deep enough to act as an open drain in this state it lies all winter in the spring following he covers it nearly an inch thick with a compost formed of five loads of earth to one of lime and upon this dressing sows common hayseeds    bushels per acre raygrass   ditto ribgrass   or  lb ditto where the land is dry enough they plough and to the above quantity of grassseeds add a few pounds of white clover  mr ramshay uses few hollow drains those that require to be three or four feet deep he slopes off at the into which the furrow drains empty we saw some lands that had been done two years the raygrass and ribgrass growing well the woolly holcus holcus lanatus in abundance it comes naturally on all such soils but is a grass that few kinds of stock will eat unless compelled by hunger  mr ramshay informed us the expenses of making these improvements amounted to  0l an acre of course both this and mr richardsons to pay common interest for the money expended ought to let at  0s an acre for a term of    years  chapter xiii live stock sect    cattle the cattle are a small breed of long horns with a few exceptions of the galloway breed intermixed particularly along the coast from whitehaven to carlifle  this breed of longhorns is not distinguished by any peculiar good qualities which is not to be wondered at when it is considered that probably at this time there is not one person in the county that pays any attention to its improvement twenty years ago mr hazle of dalemain had made some progress in this business and gained a very useful breed of longhorned cattle but his successors neglected them and the labors of the good old man are totally lost  the longhorned and the galloway polled cattle are probably the best adapted to this county of any other but the kind of longhorns that occupy it at present may certainly be much improved by paying proper attention to breed always from the best males and females that can be selected this end would be the readiest attained by getting good bulls and heifers from the midland counties where the longhorned breed are brought to great perfection  the dairies are small and mostly employed in making butter of an excellent quality those that are situated in the vicinity of towns sell it weekly by the pound to supply the consumption of the inhabitants in other situations it is put into firkins of    lb each and sent to distant markets  the average quantity of butter from one cow is generally estimated from one to two firkins some cows will give twelve quarts of milk at a meal and make seven pounds of butter per week but the most general average is seven or eight quarts of milk at a meal and from   to   pounds of butter per week through the summer  skimmed milk cheese is the principal kind made here and chiefly consumed at home  on those farms that have a right of common the grass lands are employed through the summer in growing hay depasturing their cows and sometimes young cattle but the latter are more generally summered on the commons and in autumn brought into the old enclosures till the approach of winter when all the cattle are housed  sect    sheep the sheep bred in this county are only of two kinds a herdwick ram and these two are probably something related one of them is peculiar to that high exposed rocky mountainous district at the head of the duddon and esk rivers more particularly known by the names of hardknot sealefell wrynose etc  of this breed of sheep commonly called herdwicks the ewes and wethers are all polled or hornless and also many of the tups their faces and legs speckled but a great portion of white with a few black spots on those parts are accounted marks of the purest breed as are also the hornless tups they have sine small clean legs we were told that the lambs when dropped are well covered the wool is short and form as thick matted fleece much finer than that of the blackfaced heath sheep with which variety they seem to have been crossed as we suspect from some of the rams having spiral horns and from some kemps or hairs being intermixed amongst some fleeces of the wool they are a lively little animal well adapted to seek their food amongst these rocky mountains in many places stony and bare and where covered the soil is thin but the herbage mostly green though heath is found on their summits they have no hay in winter and support themselves in the deepest snows by scratching down to the heath or other herbage indeed it seldom happens but that some parts of the mountains are blown bare which the sheep find out they do not face the coming storm as reported but like other sheep turn their backs on it and in such weather they generally gather together and keep stirring about by which means they tread down the snow keep above it and are rarely overblown  the loss per cent per ann is of hogs provincial term for sheep from six months old till being first shorn from   to  0  ditto ditto of old sheep    to    the ewes are kept as long as they will breed lambs and are often from ten to fifteen years of age before they are sold the wethers go off at four and a half years old both ewes and wethers are sold from these mountains and killed without being put on any better pasture we saw a carcass of one of the wethers at ravenglass very good mutton which weighed    lb a quarter and had  0 or    lb of tallow the ewes weigh from   to   lb a quarter the fleece weighs   lb and soid last year at  d per lb which we think much below its value  the mountains on which these sheep are bred happen not to be common but belong to lord muncaster as do also the stock that depasture them which have time immemorial been farmed out to herds at a yearly sum from this circumstance these farms three or four in number have obtained the name of herdwicks that is the district of the herds and the sheep the appellation of herdwick sheep they have obtained such a character for hardiness of constitution that mr tyson we were told by lord muncasters agent that the family of tysons have lived in this sequestered spot above four hundred years who farms the principal flock sells a number of tups every year into various parts of the county to improve the hardiness of other slocks the price is often as high as two guineas and a half  the sheep through the whole of this county except the herdwicks have been descended from the blackfaced coarsewoolled heath sheep but by crossing with some other kind probably the herdwicks many of them have acquired a large portion of white on their faces and legs some have those parts speckled and others totally black they are in general horned high shouldered narrow backed flat sided strong boned and many with thick rough hairy legs the wool is coarse and long but falls short in both these respects to what is produced by the blackfaced sheep from mossat and linton in scotland and the kentmore sheep in westmoreland the fleece weighs from   to   lb which sold in      for  d per pound  the management of sheep over all this county is very similar through the summer the whole flock is depastured on the commons and range at large without any person to look after them in november the whole are gathered together and salved the salve is composed of butter and tar in the proportion of sixteen pounds of the former to four quarts of the latter this quantity will salve forty sheep the old sheep are turned again upon the common but the hogs are kept in the old enclosures some part of which has been kept uneaten to support them through the winter on the approach of snow the old sheep are brought to the enclosures or to some part of the common adjoining and are daily foddered with hay while the storm continues those who have not a sussiciency of enclosed ground for wintering their hogs take wintering for them in those parts of the low country where they do not breed sheep the price  s per head to have hay in bad weather  in eskdale and mitredale they formerly kept their hogs in the house all winter on hay and drove them to water once a day but this practice is now laid aside and they winter them upon the enclosed grounds which are previously kept fresh for that purpose they give no hay to their sheep here which are a good deal of the herdwick blood  the sheep are sold in autumn to graziers the price of those from the eastern part of the county are wethers at   years old   s to   s ewes from   to   ditto  s to  s from the southwest eskdale wethers at   years old  0s to   s ewes from   to  0 ditto  s to  s skiddaw wethers at   ditto   s to   s ewes from   to   ditto  s to  s  we have no hesitation in saying that the breeds may be improved for there are few places where they have been more neglected at penruddock we observed some singularly rough legged illformed sheep on asking an old farmer from whence they had that breed or where they got their tups he innocently replied lord sir they are sik as god set upon the land we never change any the latter pare of this simple statement we readily believe but that god set upon the land such illformed unprositable animals we cannot so readily assent to and rather think they have acquired their present illform and bad properties by the indolence and ignorance of the owners we wish we could avoid adding that the same practice which guides the men of penruddock is too prevalent in every part of the county  we found in general that the sheep breeders here like those in most other countries are very much attached to their own breed as they have never tried any other they cannot be admitted as proper judges of the comparative merit of different kinds of sheep but supposing for the present their own breed to be well adapted to their situation why not improve them by selecting the best males and females and rear a better offspring of their own kind or by hiring or buying some of mr tysons best formed and finest woolled herdwick tups instead of getting tups from kentmore in westmoreland which appeared from what we saw to have nothing to recommend them in our opinion but size and crseness the shape of these sheep is in every respect the reverse of what it ought to be the back narrow the carcass long and thin supported upon large rough legs with coarse hairy wool hanging down from their throats all the way to their breast which on a wet day gives them as much the appearance of goats as sheep  within the last three years a few longwoolled sheep have been introduced into this county from the yorkshire wolds by lord muncaster from northumberland by mr blacklock of corby mr richardson of rickaby mr porter carlisle mr falder near roes castle mr lamb netherby and probably a few others  and since our visiting this county in      to the above names we are happy to add those of mr graham of barrock lodge mr losh of woodside mr stalker of lambsknow etc who have not only hired tups at considerable prices but even purchased ewes at as high prices as from  l to  l each  sect    horses the horses are middle sized from fourteen to fifteen and a half hands high of various colors but bays and chestnuts seem the most prevalent for a small farm where horses must answer for both draught and riding they are probably most suitable but certainly might be improved by stallions from the north riding of yorkshire the best breed of horses we know for the double purpose abovementioned  about  0 or  0 years since teams of oxen or oxen yoked with horses were very common from that period draught oxen gradually decreased and for some years past we were informed there has not been an ox team in the county  almost every small farmer breeds his own horses and generally more than are necessary for the cultivation of his farm these are often purchased by dealers for the purpose of supplying the light horse regiments  sect    swine swine are bred and fed here in considerable numbers every farmer fattens one or more of these animals and most laborers and mechanics rear and feed each a pig at about  0 months old they are confined in the sty for the purpose of fatting on barley or oatmeal and potatoes their weight is from    to  0 stone  sect    rabbits some narrow tracts of light sandy ground along the coast from harrington to abbeyholm are occupied by rabbits there are also warrens in the parishes of wyberthwaite drig and heskit  sect    poultry the minute division of landed property occasions abundance of poultry the numerous waters lakes and commons facilitate the keeping of large flocks of geese which are fed on the stubbles and supply the market plentifully from the latter end of october to christmas  sect    pigeons are rarely found with the farmers they are principally kept and bred by gentlemen of property as articles of luxury  sect    bees are found through every part of the county and in some situations are very profitable it is a prevailing opinion that they thrive best in the vicinity of heath erica vulgaris hence it would appear that this plant abounds with their favorite food but as it is late of flowering they should also be in the neighborhood of a sheltered early situation to enjoy the benefit of the spring flowers where these cannot be united it would probably be right to remove them from one to the other to suit the seasons  chapter xiv rural economy sect    labor from the number of small farms there is an uncertainty of a day labourer meeting with constant employment as the occupiers want assistance only on particular occasions  on this principle we account for the high wages given in this county through the whole of which there is an universal custom of giving the laborers victuals both men and women the wages are  for men per day  0d and victuals in harvest  s and victuals  for women haymaking  d and victuals  harvest  0d and victuals  the hours from   to    the victuals are estimated at  d per day for men and  d for women servants kept in the house are only hired for half a year to prevent gaining settlements  their wages for that time are a man from  l to  l  women  l to  l  masons without victuals are from  s  d to  s per day carpenters  s  d  when work is done by the piece the prices are as follows s d threshing wheat per bushel 0    barley ditto 0    oats ditto 0   ploughing per acre   0 reaping per acre   0 mowing ditto     walling per square yard 0    sect    provisions grain of all kinds is generally very

is not overloaded with fat what we saw at carlisle and whitehaven was lean indeed  at the latter place we did not see one carcass of decent mutton  the greatest part of it would not have ben suffered to appear in newcastle and many other markets that are accustomed to see good mutton a joint of lean whitehaven mutton is deater at  d pr lb than the same joint of a good sat sheep is at  d on account of the greater proportion of hone to eatable meat in the former to what it is in the latter  the bread geneally used in this county is made of barley or a mixture of barley and rye oatmeal is made into hastypuddings and eat with butter treacle milk or beer for breakfast and often for supper  potatoes for several years have been in general use as a principal article of food few families dine without them and we believe many a dinner and supper are made of potatoes with a little butter or cream for sauce and in many cases only milk or where this cannot be had a little salt  sect    fuel coals are cheap and plentiful in most parts of the county in several places from   s to  0s will procure a years fuel for a small family  peat and turf also abound and are used instead of coals in some districts  chapter xv political economy sect    roads the roads are in general very good both parochial and turnpikes except the road from carlisle to newcastle some parts of which are very bad and very different to what the same road is immediately on entering northumberland  the materials are excellent in general limestone but in almost every instance not broken small enough by one half if these hard stones were broken so small as to pass through a ring two inches in diameter and the roads made wider and flat or very nearly so few counties in the kingdom would be able to vie with cumberland for excellent roads  sect    canals there are no canals in this county in      one was projected from maryport by carlisle to newcastle but did not take place owing to a difference of opinion whether the canal from newcastle should pass on the north or south side of tyne  sect    fairs february  0th  wigton  for horses april  th  wigton  for cattle   th  penrith  for cattle   th

oats and barley  egremont  for corn and other provisions  sect    commerce the commerce of this county consists principally in the exportation of coals from whitehaven workington and maryport to ireland etc the number of vessels employed in this trade amounts to upwards of  00 from  0 to   0 tons burden this lucrative trade has arisen to its present importance within the last hundred years it originated at whitehaven from the exertions of lord lonsdales ancestors to whom the coal in that neighborhood principally belongs  mr curwen is the principal coalowner at workington and mr senhouse at maryport at all those places coal cannot be wrought fast enough to supply the demand vessels have frequently to wait six or eight weeks before they can get a loading a certain sign of an increasing trade  we have not been able to ascertain at what period navigation was advanced in cumberland a survey was taken by commission from the crown in the year      of the trade and shipping of this county inter alia whitehaven was then so far from promising it would ever arrive at its present wealthy and flourishing state that it consisted only of six cottages scattered on the beach and hidden in the creek from the eye of an enemy and to this dejected port one small bark only belonged of nine or ten tons burden nay it is not more incredible than true that there was at that time only one vessel appertaining to the whole county that was of ten tons burden the whole exports of this extensive county were nothing but a small quantity of herrings and cod fish and the inhabitants knew so little of the luxuries and enjoyments of life that the whole of this great coast received no other imports than a little salt  about the year      the earl of lincoln being lord high admiral caused an account to be taken of the ships and mariners within this county when all the vessels amounted only to twelve and not one carried eighty tons the number of mariners and fishermen were     of whom many had never navigated a vessel superior to an open boat  in   0  workington was the chief haven and the place from whence certain criminals sentenced to banishment were exported to ireland hutchinsons history of cumberland   maryport in the year      consisted of only one farmhouse in that year another house was built it is now a neat well built middlesized market town with a small and good harbor enclosed by two piers and in      contained      inhabitants which increase about  00 yearly the ground upon which the town is built belonged to humphry senhouse esquire to encourage settlers he sold off house and yard steads reserving a ground rent the land around it lets for   or  l an acre which would not have been worth more than  l had things remained as they were in       the quantity of

hams of an excellent quality form a part of the commerce of this county the article of butter is said to amount to  0000l per ann the whole chiefly for the london market to which place also considerable quantities of fresh salmon are sent from carlisle  sect    manufactures the manufactures are not extensive printing cottons at carlisle and a check manufacture on a small scale in most of the market towns with four or five cotton mills erected of late years near carlisle dalston and corby with a small factory of corduroys at the latter place is all this county has to boast of  whether the coal trade and manufactures have occasioned any improvements in the agriculture of the county is doubtful but they certainly have encouraged it by making a very increased demand for its produce  the lead mines on aldstonmoor affect the agriculture of this county very little being more intimately connected with northumberland  sect    poor in most of the country parishes the poorrates are low from  d to  d per pound which we believe is partly owing to a sort of pride existing amongst the lower classes of not applying for parochial relief till they cannot possibly subsist without it and also to the number of friendly societies which have been established and we hope are still increasing such useful institutions are deserving of encouragement by every person whose property is chargeable with poorrate  sect    population in messrs nicholson and burns history of cumberland published in      the number of houses are estimated at  0000 and the inhabitants at  00000 by housemans notes in hutchinsons history of cumberland now publishing they amount to    00  chapter xvi obstacles to haprovement one great obstacle to improvement seems to arise from a laudable anxiety in the customary tenants to have their little patrimony descend to their children these small properties loaded with fines heriots and boondays see tenures page     joined to the necessary expense of bringing up and educating a numerous family can only be handed down from father to son by the utmost thrift hard labor and penurious living and every little saving being hoarded up for the payment of the eventful sine leaves nothing for the expenses of traveling to see improved modes of culture and to gain a knowledge of the management and profits of different breeds of stock and be convinced by ocular proofs that their own situations are capable of producing similar advantages and even should they be half inclined to adopt a new practice prudence whispers that should the experiment fail it would require the savings of many years to make good the deficiency  the customary tenure is allowed on all hands to be a great grievance and check to improvement would not this be best done away on the division of commons as was the case at brampton etc where lord carlisle had   th for his consent as lord of the soil and for enfranchising the allotments there are other lords who ask   th for their consent and enfranchising the portion given to the lords of manors for their consent as lord of the soil in most parts of the kingdom is onesixteenth the part to be allowed for enfranchising will depend on the nature of the tenure the yearly value of the various customs fines etc might be easisy settled by commissioners and twentyfive years purchase on this value be the price of enfranchisement which might be allowed out of the allotment upon the division of a common or paid in money at the option of the tenant  on these terms neither party would have reason to complain but where a tenant cannot enfranchise under forty years purchase it would be a humane act of the legislature to relieve these bondagers by law or laudable in the board of agriculture to induce such lords of manors to accept a fair equivalent for these dregs of vassalage  letting no leases or leases for five or seven years is another great obstacle to improvement to such proprietors of land we would beg leave to hint that no tenant will ever make improvements under the uncertainties of a short lease much less where there is none a tenant may be well convinced that by proper culture draining improved breeds of stock etc he could make his farm in a few years worth one third more than it is at present but this cannot be done without laying out money suppose  00l and suppose by this means the increased yearly value of his crop is  0l now it is clear it will be six years before he can be repaid the principal and interest of the sum expended should his lease expire in the fifth year he would be a loser and should he have no lease he might be turned off his farm at the end of the second year under such circumstances the chance of loss is much greater than the prospect of gain by reasoning in this manner he concludes that it is safer to have his  00l at interest at   per cent than risk it in improving his farm under such uncertainties and that it will be the surest game to take every advantage of the farm in his power  on the other hand if his lease had been for twentyone years he would have foreseen that by laying out his  00l he would gain  00l and as the hope of reward sweetens labor he would have doubled his exertions and gone on from improvement to improvement and at the expiration of his term his landlord would have the satisfaction of seeing his tenant had acquired a competency his farm increased in value and the community benefited by the increased produce we have heard it is true some arguments urged in favor of letting no leases such as would have been used by a feudal lord and which we are persuaded cannot long be held by liberal and benevolent minds enlightened by science or anxious to promote the true interests of their country  the payment of tithes in kind is universally agreed to be a material obstacle to the advancement of agriculture according to the present mode of collecting tithes it is not a tenth of the natural produce of the land but a tenth of the capital employed in trade if a man employs  00l in trade he receives his profits without any deduction but if he should lay out this  00l on a speculation of improving a piece of land say draining a bog he finds if his scheme succeeds that the produce is not all his own the tithe owner comes and takes away one tenth which is probably all the profit after deducting common interest for the money expended and this from off land that never afforded any tithe since the creation nor ever would have done had not this spirited improver laid out his  00l on improving this bog rather than employing it in trade where he could have received at least  0 per cent for his money the bog would then have continued unprofitable and the tithe owner would have received no injury for neither he nor any of his predecessors had ever reaped any advantage from it  this obstacle certainly might be removed by giving a fair equivalent for tithes  chapter xvii miscellaneous observations sect    agricultural societies there are none in this county nor we believe has any attempt ever been made to form any  sect    weights and measures the same confusion in weights and measures prevails here as in many other parts of the kingdom  a carlisle bushel is    quarts a winchester bushel is    quarts a penrith bushel is    ditto for wheat and rye a penrith bushel is  0 ditto for barley oats and potatoes a stone of tallow wool yarn or hay is    lb ditto of butchers meat    lb but in many places    lb the pound is    ounces by which butter and various other articles are weighed  conclusion means of improvement the first that presents itself is a reform in the culture of the arable lands to those who have been accustomed to take two three four five etc white crops in succession we would recommend to continue their lands in tillage no more than three years at one time and in the second year to fallow for turnips or wheat according as the soil suits after turnips barley or wheat and on the barley or wheat sow red clover white clover and raygrass to these may be added hopmedic and ribgrass according to circumstances and continue in grass two three or more years according to situation and circumstances where necessity urges the clover may be mown for hay the first year but would recommend to depasture it as much as possible with sheep which of all other stock are the most profitable and the most improving for land that has been exhausted by tillage  it would probably be right in most situations to have onethird or onefourth of the farm in old grass for the purposes of the dairy and the sheep stock in winter and we would observe that where land is worth  0s per acre in grass it would be a dangerous experiment to plough it up in such a climate as cumberland possesses  we know that in some parts of the kingdom lands are let at higher rents for the purposes of tillage only but then their soil climate and situation are peculiarly good and it is a question whether if these lands had been in old grass they would not have been worth more for grazing than they are at present for growing corn probably as good as the land at pap castle let at  l an acre for grazing only  the live stock next offers itself for consideration of the properest breed of horses and horned cattle we have before given our sentiments it only remains to suggest what improvements may be made in the sheep of which there ought to be at least two if not three distinct breeds that is  for the lower districts a breed of improved longwoolled sheep  for the mountainous a breed of mountain sheep adapted to the herbage and situation  for the high heathy ridge of mountains on the east side of the county the true blackfaced heath sheep are probably the best adapted as we think them the hardiest and best calculated for living altogether upon heath of any other breed we know of course a little attention to the improvement of the present breed by good tups of the true heath sheep is all that is here wanted  but for those mountains on the southwest part of the county which have so large a portion of sound green sward we think a finewoolled sheep might be kept to advantage probably the south down or at least a cross betwixt the south down and the herdwick sheep from the known inclination these breeds have to make fat the carcass would certainly be as good and the fleece would as certainly be of double value as that of the present breed  l s d the fleece of the south down sheep is   lb at  s per lb 0   0 ditto of the skiddaw sheep   lb at  d ditto 0     increased value of the fleece 0     but it is probable the wool may be deteriorated by crossing with the herdwick sheep if on this account we allow low is  d there will still be an increased value of  s a fleece  for the lower districts a breed of improved longwoolled sheep of    or  0 lb a quarter would undoubtedly be far more profitable than those that are now bred and depastured upon it and from the great portion of excellent turnip soil distributed through every part of the county almost every breeder would be enabled to fatten his own if he pursued the rotation above recommended and he would find that his wethers at   or   year old would be much fatter than the present breed are at   or   years old and that they would be sold for the following prices l s d a wether at   year old     0 wool   fleece   lb at  d per lb 0   0      0 deduct for wintering on turnips  0 weeks at  d per week 0   0 produce of a longwoolled wether at   year old after deducting the expense of wintering on turnips     0 at aspatria they feed their own sheep and sell their wethers at   years old to the butchers for   0 0 wool   fleeces at  s  d each 0   0     0 deduct for salving   years 0   0 produce of a country bred wether   years old     0  from hence it appears that the present breed of sheep are kept three years for nothing or that the improved breed of longwoolled sheep will leave as much profit in one year as the present do in four or a flock of    of these longwoolled sheep would leave as much profit as  00 of the present race and that for grass only as the expense of wintering on turnips was deducted in the above statement  enclosing of commons  we have already pointed out would be a great source of improvement in this county could it be done at a moderate expense and on equitable terms the charges of obtaining an act of parliament and the various additions made thereto by the practitioners of the law are in some cases three or four times more than all the other expenses put together surely this might be avoided by a general act the house of commons has already laid a foundation by the standing orders respecting such bills  if twothirds of the proprietors request a division we see no reason why they should be put to the expense of obtaining an act of parliament because two or three or possibly only one ignorant or illnatured person or persons are absurd enough to oppose it  watered meadows  is another source of improvement from whence great advantages may be derived the streams are not confined to any particular district they are found equally pure whether they have their source from the limestone rocks on the eastern and middle parts of the county or from the immense mountains of blue slate rock in the southwest district numberless are the rivulets that might be employed with the greatest advantage in watering and in most places would be turned over the land at the least expense being obliged at present to be kept within their bounds by proper fences and seem to solicit their indolent owners to employ them for their own emolument and the benefit of the public  there are also many fine opportunities for employing the larger rivers some hundred acres of the flat tract of land below keswick to the top of bassenthwaitelake might be irrigated and prevented from being overflowed by embanking a large portion near the foot of the lake is capable of the same improvement in eskdale lord muncaster has a fine opportunity of watering an extensive tract we are glad to find that his lordship has taken the hint and brought an experienced person from near cirencester in gloucestershire with a view of introducing this species of improvement into this county he purposes irrigating about  00 acres in different situations and upon different soils and with water of different qualities  near carlton on the pettril on the ellen and at many other places we observed where irrigation might be applied to great advantage  we made an excursion to the bishop of llandaffs at colgarth park where that respectable prelate has a most admirable situation for watering  he purposes to have a man from those parts where the practice is best understood a plan we highly approve and from his known scientific acquirements enlarged ideas activity and perseverance in every good pursuit we have no hesitation in saying that future improvers will revere his memory and admire the man for adding to the character of a good bishop that of a good farmer and for blessing these northern regions by the introduction of a practice from which so many and such great benefits are to result  to this place we hope the cumbrians will resort to be taught the most improved modes of irrigation and by introducing the practice into their own country will reap the rewards which it is so highly capable of affording from this source of improvement  draining  has been practiced with great advantage by a few enterprizing individuals but much remains yet to be done in almost every part of the county to those who are unacquainted with the benefits of draining we beg leave to recommend it to their particular notice as the first of improvements  by embanking great advantages might be gained especially on the marshes of burgh rowcliff abbeyholm and at the mouth of the duddon to point out the mode by which this could be best accomplished would require a more particular survey it is sufficient on this occasion to hint that it may be done and that considerable benefits would acrue from it not only to many individuals but to the public at large the southwest part of cumberland is in a manner insulated and cut off from all easy safe and ready communication with the southern and western parts of the kingdom on the one hand by the barrier of mountains which stretch from kendal and ulverstone to penrith and keswick and on the other by the slow of the tides over the lancaster cartmel and duddon sands by which the passage is not only interrupted for several hours twice a day but also rendered very unsafe and dangerous all which might be avoided by proper embankments and at the same time a great quantity of land gained from the ravages of the sea   to the notice of other districts  we would beg leave to recommend the use of singlehorse carts having been long convinced of their utility we are glad to have an opportunity of stating to the public a few facts which will fully evince their superior advantages  the horses of cumberland are not of a large size one fifteen hands high of a light form that will answer either for riding or drawing seldom draws less in a singlehorse cart than    cwt the common load for a draught horse of the above size is    the carriers from brampton to newcastle over a hilly country carry frequently    we met a carriers boy driving five carts from longtown to newcastle in which were four ton or on each cart    cwt a singlehorse cart carries ten pigs of lead of twelve stone each which is    from the above it may be fairly concluded that the common load for a singlehorse cart will be about    cwt in most countries a twohorse cart seldom carries more than  0 cwt nor a threehorse cart more tha  0 here a boy or a girl drives two singlehorse carts which carry  0 of course two horses yoked in singlehorse carts will draw as much as three horses yoked in one cart  a common carrier at carlisle who many years employed a wagon has laid it aside and now uses singlehorse carts only as he finds he can by that means carry much greater weights  there are few articles which may not be carried on a carriage of two wheels equally as well as upon one of four except long timber and as wagons are so destructive to roads the superior goodness of the roads in cumberland may in a great measure be attributed to the universal use of singlehorse carts  wherever wagons are used they are the destruction of roads especially in hilly countries where they are obliged to lock the wheels the banks are in a manner ploughed up with them and the nine inch wheels are in reality no more than three inch wheels by the artful mode of laying on the middle course of tire which is raised an inch above the rest instead of being nearly exempted from tolls every horse drawing in a wagon ought to pay treble to what should be exacted from a horse drawing in a singlehorse cart why should their use be longer persisted in as it is clear that the same number of horses yoked in single horse carts will draw more than when yoked six or eight together  they are easier loaded and unloaded are much more handy for almost every purpose and six or eight may be driven by a man and a boy which is a trifling additional expense if a middlesized cumberland horse draws    cwt a large strong wagon horse will as easily draw  0 cwt and which is done in some parts of the kingdom  for destroying moles  a most excellent practice is prevalent here for every parish to let the taking of their moles for a term of years at a certain yearly sum which is raised in the same manner as the parochial taxes and does not now exceed a halfpenny an acre which they justly observe was much cheaper than they could have the ground scaled for were the moles not destroyed in this manner it is a pity but there was a law to oblige every parish in the kingdom to destroy their moles in the same manner which is done so effectually here that we scarce ever saw a molehill upon the enclosed grounds of most parts of cumberland  westmorland aaa range of moutains  coal  and lime b fertile vale of various soils clu moist

westmorland  general view of the agriculture of the county of westmoreland with observations for the means of its improvement drawn up for the consideration of the board of agriculture and internal improvement by mr a pringle of balencrieff  introduction great britain had long availed herself of her naturally fortunate position for commerce which encouraged by every means that the wisdom of the legislature could devise had been carried to an extent hitherto unequalled in the universe and the industry of her inhabitants assisted by the fostering hand of government had brought many branches of manufactures to the highest state of perfection while the cultivation of her fields was left to the feeble exertions of the husbandman aided only by bounties on the raising of flax and on the exportation of corn it was reserved for our days to behold a board composed of the first officers of the state and of persons equally respectable for high rank distinguished abilities and independent fortune established to fix the attention of a great nation on the improvement of its soil and to direct and assist in the ancient and most important of all arts that of providing food for man  the eyes of all europe are already turned to this board which it is believed is the first national establishment on a great scale that ever existed in any country in favor of agriculture and the advantages of which now appear so obvious that it is a matter of astonishment that such an institution was not sooner erected  at the time of the landing of the romans on this island corn was raised only on the coasts and even so late as the expedition of severus tillage was altogether unknown in those parts which lay between his wall and that of antoninus but under the dominion of that wonderful people it soon came to be considered as the granary of the western empire and immense quantities of corn were annually exported for the use of the armies in germany and in gaul and in the year     when there happened to be an extraordinary demand upon the continent julian ordered eight hundred ships to be built larger than the common barks and sent them to britain for grain it is not possible to ascertain the capacity of these vessels but it is probable from privileges that were granted to those who built ships above a certain size that many of them would contain more than ten thousand roman modia or upwards of three hundred english quarters  considering the change of manners it is not to be expected that the days of ancient rome will be revived when the most distinguished citizens united the culture of the liberal arts with the tillage of their fields and when the highest officers of the state having left the helm of government did not disdain to lay hold of the stilts of the plough when however we contemplate the rapid progress which agriculture made in this island in the rude days of that superstitious people who were governed in their time of sowing by the age of the moon and the setting of the pleiades what may not be hoped for from the spirit of an enlightened nation fully excited and directed to its proper objects by the newly established board under whose auspices were but the ravages of war to cease for a century great britain would attain to an incredible degree of wealth and cultivation enjoying a soil of great original fertility and a climate favorable to the growth of most branches of the vegetable kingdom its craggy mountains and verdant hills would be clothed with lofty timber or bleat with innumerable slocks its meadows would rear the stately bullock and its fruitful plains would wave with the richest crops of every grain that the influence of a british sun can pour into the lap of plenty the persevering hand of industry would even teach trees and plants to flourish that at present are sickly and droop and can hardly exist through the severity of an inclement winter in a few centuries more others might be cultivated with success which if directly transplanted to our climate would immediately perish when peaches were first raised in italy all the world was surprised that they could be brought to perfection out of persia what would caesar and diodorus siculus say were they told that the most esteemed wines of europe are produced in gaul germany and hungary where they imagined that vines would not grow or strabo if he knew that figs can be propagated in the north of scotland or lucullus that cherries will grow almost any where which in his time were known only in cerasus and the milder climates of europe  trees and plants being altogether passive accommodate themselves very slowly to a change of climate but the idea has been already no apology is due to the author of j w spencers travels for the freedom that is here used with them thrown out that even those of the torrid zone may be made to flourish in northern regions may become gradually inured to the climate that the climate it self may be changed for the better and that some thousands of years hence reposing under their own olive trees future britons may quaff their own wine or sip their own tea sweetened with the juice of their own sugar cane  preliminary observations by the bishop of landaff extent of the county the county of westmoreland was surveyed in      and a map of it upon a scale of an inch to a mile was engraved by thomas jeffreys geographer to his majesty in    0 it appears from this map that the greatest breadth of the county from its southern boundary near burton to its northern one near penrith in cumberland is thirtytwo miles and that its greatest length from east to west is forty miles  i covered this map very exactly with fine writing paper except the estuary near millthrope and windermere lake i then cut out a slip of the paper of an inch in breadth and of ten inches in length and weighed it accurately from another part of the same paper i cut another slip two inches in breadth and five in length and found it to be precisely of the same weight as the first slip and hence as the surfaces of the two slips were equal we may collect that the paper was of an uniform thickness the area of each of these slips was ten square inches and consequently covered a space on the map equal to ten square miles i then weighed the whole of the paper which had covered the map and by comparing the weight of the whole with the weight of what had covered ten square miles i found the number of square miles in the whole to be     now there are   0 statute acres in a square mile and consequently   0 00 acres in the whole county  i measured this map in the ordinary way by resolving it into triangles and found its area to be equal to     square miles or  0 0 0 statute acres  templeman in his survey of the globe makes the area of the county of westmoreland equal to     square miles and consequently according to him it contains  0   0 acres the medium of these three different estimates though i am most disposed to rely on the first is   0     professor zimmerman in his political survey of europe estimates england and wales at        square miles amounting to        0 statute acres templeman in the work above mentioned says that england and wales contain     0 square miles or      000 statute acres the mean of these two gives        0 statute acres for the whole surface of england and wales and hence the county of westmoreland may in superficial content be esteemed a seventythird part of england and wales  proportion between the cultivated and waste lands in the county in      when a bounty was first granted on the exportation of corn onethird part of the land in england and wales or about eleven millions of acres was supposed to lie in uncultivated commons if this was then a just proportion between the cultivated and waste parts of the kingdom we may safely conclude that much above onethird part of westmoreland was then waste land as it is evident from a bare view of the county that few if any counties in england have in proportion to their whole extent so much uncultivated land as this has the many enclosures which have taken place during the last hundred years have lessened in some degree the waste land of the whole kingdom but no enclosures of much consequence have taken place in westmoreland instead of onethird i am disposed to conjecture that threefourth parts of westmoreland consist of uncultivated land i will state my reasons for this conjecture being as sensible as any person can be of the objections which may be made to it but in a matter where there are no data to proceed upon a conjectural argument may be allowed  it appears by the return made by the overseers of the poor to the house of commons that the sum raised by assessment in all the parishes and townships of the county at a medium of three years ending in      amounted to     l the town of kendall including kirkland is the only large town in the county it is found by an actual survey made this year to contain  0   inhabitants having experienced an increase of     inhabitants since the year      of the present number     or about one fiftysixth part of the whole are paupers living in the workhouse the poor rates of this town amounted according to the same return to     l a year this sum being subducted from the annual amount of all the poor rates in the county leaves     l for the sum raised from all the estates in the county exclusive of kendall from particular inquiries in various parishes i am of opinion that the poor rates do not in this county exceed a shilling in the pound in the actual rental of all the lands but a shilling in the pound supposing the sum annually raised to be     l will give a rental of      0l all the land in westmoreland which can either be ploughed or mown for hay is worth at least a rent of a pound a statute acre on an average and hence it may be inferred that  00000 acres of such land or less than onefourth part of the whole would yield a rental equal to if not exceeding the rental of the county the high enclosed rough pastures are let from one to five shillings an acre but whether the uncultivated land in westmoreland be equal to threefourths or one half of the whole it cannot be questioned that there is so much of it as to render its improvement a matter not only of individual concern but of national importance  improvement of waste lands the uncultivated lands in westmoreland are of various sorts with respect to soil and situation and capable of different sorts of improvement some of them consist of extensive commons in low situations and are of an excellent soil these might be improved by enclosures without any risk of loss by the undertaking others constitute extensive mountainous districts called by the natives fells and moors the soil of these is generally speaking an hazel mould in its natural state it produces little else than a coarse benty grass heath and fern or in the language of the country ling and brackens many of these fells are in their present state of so little value that the liberty of keeping ten sheep on them may be hired for sixpence a year supposing six acres to be sufficient for the maintenance of ten sheep the rent of such land is a penny an acre and the price of the fee simple of it at twentyfour years purchase two shillings whilst there is an acre of such waste improveable land in great britain it may be hoped that when the legislature shall turn its attention to the subject no inhabitant of the island will be driven by distress to seek a subsistence in africa or america  above forty years ago an experiment was tried in spain with respect to the cultivation of waste lands several thousands of poor and vagabond people were settled on them at the expense of the government if this experiment has succeeded which may be easily known so far as that the land has been made productive that the settlers have been increased and that the government has been reimbursed the whole or a principal part of its expense it may induce other governments to adopt the same or a similar plan the giving a cottage and a few acres of land under a small reserved rent and perhaps under other useful restrictions to a poor man is certainly a good way of improving the land when a man has lands of his own he and his family will exert in its cultivation a quantity of labor which would not otherwise be brought into existence the value of this otherwise nonexisting labor is in one respect nothing it ought not to be reckoned as a part of the expense attending the improvement of the land and on that account many thousands of acres of land might be brought into cultivation which would not in any other way pay the expense of improvement the manner of improving moorland by paring burning liming etc is well understood by some few individuals and the advantage resulting from it ascertained by what has been recently practiced in some parts of the county on private estates  there are many barren mountains in this county which do not admit improvement by paring and burning and which are incapable of being profitably converted either into arable or good pasture land yet the highest and most craggy parts two acres of which do not afford sustenance for six months in the year to one sheep might with a great prospect of success be planted with larches i say with a great prospect of success for i do not speak with certainty not knowing whether there are in great britain any plantations of larch made on such exposed and rocky situations as are here spoken of but on the other hand it is known that the larch grows in italy on higher mountains than any that we have in this island and not only that it grows in italy where the climate is less severe than in great britain but that it grows in the north of russia where it is much more severe for at archangel in the latitude of    ships are built of larch growing in that climate  it may be of use to state the probable profit which would attend planting the land in question with larch a thousand acres of this sort of land might be enclosed with a circular wall six feet in height where the stones can be easily gotten as they may in most parts after the rate of six shillings an acre or  00l for the whole five hundred larches two feet in height so as to enable them to resist the long grass might be planted on each acre for fourteen shillings hence a plantation of  00000 larches might be made for  000l now  000l improved at compound interest at the rate of  l per cent would in sixty years amount to the sum of  0    l this is the accumulated loss attending the enclosing and planting  000 acres of rocky land in sixty years the rent of  000 acres at one penny an acre is  l  s  d a year in eight years the larches would be out of all danger from sheep so that the loss of rent ought only to be estimated for eight years but  l  s  d a year though improved after the same rate of compound interest would not amount to  0l in eight years say however that it would amount to   l which is allowing more than two pence an acre for the annual rent of the land then would the whole expense attending the plantation in sixty years be  0 00l if the amount of   l for    years be taken into consideration the expense of the plantation in  0 years will be      l i have here supposed sheep to be shut out of the plantation for eight years if it should be found that sheep will not crop the larch and from more than one observation i have reason to believe that they will not they need not be shut out at all nor on districts where nothing but sheep are depastured need any fence be made i know the advocates for close planting instead of  00 would require  000 larches for each acre i am not convinced of the utility of such close planting except where it is intended to nurse up oaks or other kinds of wood but if that mode should be adopted the thinnings after twenty years growth would pay the expense of it at the expiration of sixty years suppose that only   0 larches remained on each acre or that one half had perished the probable value of them may be thus estimated from a great many experiments made by myself and collected from others i find the annual increase in circumference of the larch at six feet from the ground to be one inch and one half on an average of several years and this inference has been drawn from the actual admeasurement of larches in different parts of england and scotland and of different ages from ten years old to fifty on this supposition the larches would measure one with another ninety inches in circumference at six feet from the ground a larch which measures ninety inches at six feet from the ground would measure above seventy feet from the ground but supposing seventy inches to be the circumference at twenty feet and the length of the tree to be forty feet neglecting the remaining top then will its solid content be eightyfive cubic feet and the value of the tree at ninepence a foot above three guineas but as the trees are supposed to be planted in an high bleak barren situation their annual increase may not be so great as is here supposed instead of being worth at sixty years after planting three guineas a piece admit that they are worth only ten shillings each then would the whole plantation be worth    000l and deducting the whole expense  0 00l as before estimated there would remain a profit of     00l the present value of     00l to be received sixty years hence is above  0000l interest of money at  l per cent ten thousand pounds at  l per cent purchases an income of  00l a year by planting then a barren estate of a thousand acres is improved from  l  s  d to  00l a year reckoning the value of a reversion as a present certainty sixty years is a great part of the life of a man but it ought to be considered as nothing in the existence of a nation or even of a family which is a little nation the waste lands in this and other counties are a public treasure in the hands of private persons all of them ought to be converted into arable meadow or pasture land which are capable of admitting with profit that kind of improvement and such of them as will not pay for that mode of improvement ought to be covered with wood the high parts and especially the sheltered dells in the high parts with larch and the lower with oak ash etc when a spirit of agricultural improvement is fully excited the individuals to whom such uncultivated lands belong will be prompted by an attention to their own interest to forward every judicious plan which may be proposed for rendering them more useful to the proprietors and to the community their present application to the summermaintenance of a few miserable sheep ought not to be persevered in if any other use can be made of them  coppices in some parts of westmoreland considerable portions of land are covered with coppices consisting principally of oak ash alder birch and hazel these underwoods are usually cut down every sixteenth year the uses to which they are applied are chiefly two  hoops and charcoal the hoops are sold in the wood at  l a thousand they are generally manufactured in the country and sent by sea to liverpool the charcoal is sent to the iron furnaces in the neighborhood the value of a statute acre of coppicewood of sixteen years growth is variable from  0l to   l and if it consists altogether of oak its price may amount to twenty guineas  l for the charcoal and   l for the bark it being the custom here to peel the bolls and all the branches of the oak which are equal to the thickness of a mans thumb  it is an extraordinary thing to see any trees left to stand for timber in these underwoods the high price of bark being a temptation to cut the whole down fine saplings from nine to twelve inches in circumference at five feet from the ground and with bark as splendid as polished silver are felled by the unfeeling proprietor with as little regret as if they were thorns or briars of late indeed some few owners of underwoods have left standards and if they consult their interest the practice will become general as this is a point denied by many proprietors of coppices it may be of use to explain the principles on which the observation is founded  suppose a statute acre of underwood to be in the spring of      sixteen years old and that the whole is then cut down and sold for   l this sum will in sixtyfour years reckoning compound interest at   per cent amount to    l in    0 another fall of underwood of the same value will be made the   l then arising improved for fortyeight years in the same way will produce   l in      another   l will arise from another fall of the underwood this sum improved for thirtytwo years will amount to   l in      another fall will produce   l which in sixteen years will become   l and lastly in      or in sixtyfour years from      another fall will produce   l the amount of the value of the five falls thus estimated and improved will be    l let us now calculate the profit which would result in the same time from the same acre of underwood if it was managed in a different way instead of cutting the whole down in      let us suppose that   0 of the best young oaks are left to stand for timber the then value of these at  d a tree is   s this being subducted from   l the value of the whole coppice leaves   l   s this sum improved as before will amount in sixtyfour years to    l shillings and pence in these calculations being neglected the next fall in    0 ought not to be valued at more than  0l as   0 trees then of thirty two years growth will do some injury to the underwood  0l in fortyeight years will amount to   l the next fall in      may be valued at  l and at that time seventy five trees should be taken down these trees will then be fortyeight years old and worth   s a tree or   l in the whole this added to  l the value of the then underwood makes   l which in thirtytwo years will produce    l without estimating the underwood in      and in      at any thing or the value of the pasturage for thirtytwo years at any thing let us suppose the seventyfive remaining trees to be cut down in      being then eighty years old and that they would one with another be worth  l apiece or  00l in the whole the sum of the profits thus arising is    l or more than double the other amount  it is a general opinion in this and i believe in other countries that it is more profitable to fell oak wood at fifty or sixty years growth than to let it stand for navytimber to eighty or one hundred according to the price which is now paid for that commodity either by the navyboard or the east india company i believe the opinion to be founded in truth the following observations contain the reason for this belief  if profit is considered every tree of every kind ought to be cut down and sold when the annual increase in value of the tree by its growth is less than the annual interest of the money it would sell for  this being admitted we have only to inquire into the annual increase in the value of oaks of different ages  in the philosophical transactions for      there are some useful tables respecting the growth of trees by mr marsham from these tables the two following inferences may be drawn    that it is highly profitable to let young thriving oaks which are not worth above  0s a tree continue standing   that it is not profitable to let oaks of  0 or  00 years growth continue standing   three oaks marked in the tables no          in april      before they began to shoot contained eleven and one half feet of wood and were altogether worth at eighteen pence a foot bark included   s  d the same trees sixteen years afterward contained thirtyfour and one half feet and were worth  l   s  d now if   s and  d had been improved at the rate of   per cent at compound interest for sixteen years it would not have amounted to  l   s  d and of consequence the proprietor by letting such oaks stand improves his property in as high a degree as if he put out his money to interest at near seven and a half per cent  three oaks no         in      contained  00 feet of timber and were worth  l  0s  d the same trees sixteen years afterward contained     feet and were worth  l   s  d now  l  0s  d the value of the trees in      improved at the low rate of interest of  l per cent would in sixteen years amount to a sum exceeding  l   s  d the proprietor then by letting such trees stand does not improve his property at the rate of  l per cent  the oak no   in the third table was worth  l  s  d in      it gained in one year one foot or  s  d in value if it had been worth  0s and had gained one foot there would have been no prosit in letting it stand as the interest of  0s at   per cent would have produced  s  d in the year and it is for this reason that i have fixed upon  0s as the value of trees which should be cut down if they are cut sooner or later the proprietor will be a loser it must not be supposed however that great precision can attend this observation since particular soils or the greater or less thriving condition of the wood may render it useful to cut down trees before they are worth  0s or to let them stand a while longer it ought to be remarked also that large trees sell for more per foot than small ones do yet the usual increase of price is not a compensation to the proprietor for letting his timber stand to a great age this may be made out from the following experiment  on the   th october      i measured at six feet from the ground the circumference of a very fine oak of eightytwo years growth from the time of its being planted and found it to be  0  inches on the same day of the month in      it measured  0  inches  there is not one oak in fifty at the age of this which gains an inch in circumference in one year the length of the boll of this tree was about eighteen feet it contained about eightyfour feet of timber and was worth at  s a foot   l   s it gained in one year very little more than a foot and one half of timber or  s  d in value but the interest of   l   s at  l per cent amounts in one year to above twice the value of the increase even of this tree which is a singularly thriving one  i have been the more particular on this subject from a public consideration many men are alarmed lest our posterity should experience a scarcity of oak timber for the use of the navy and various means of increasing its quantity have been recommended with great judgment in addition to these means the making a much greater than the ordinary increase of price on timber of a large scantling might be not improperly submitted to the consideration of those who are concerned in the business if the navyboard would give  l or  l a load for timber trees containing  00 cubic feet or upwards instead of  l or  l every man in the kingdom would have a reasonable motive for letting his timber stand till it became of a size sit for the use of the navy whereas according to the present price it is every mans interest to cut it down sooner  in the neighborhood of ambleside there is found a stratum of gray limestone which though it contains a little clay might be as serviceable as the purest sort for agricultural purposes but unfortunately for the improvement of this part of the county coal is so dear that very little of this limestone is burned the lime which is used in the culture of the lands being either fetched from kendall or brought up windermere lake at a great expense as there is great plenty of coppice wood in the district here spoken of it may be useful for the farmers and landowners to consider whether the burning of lime with fagots in a flamekiln as is practiced in suffex may not be a more beneficial application of the underwoods than the converting them into charcoal even the spraywood here called chats which is too small to be made into charcoal and which is now sold for sixpence a cart or more generally left on the ground might be made into fagots and mixed with wood of a larger size so that no part of the coppice would be lost in suffex they use  00 fagots cut in the winter and weighing when dry in the spring thirtysix pounds each for the burning of   0 winchester bushels of lime  may i be permitted to hazard another conjecture respecting the use to which coppices might be applied without injuring either the quantity or the quality of the charcoal obtained from them pit coal yields by distillation about a twentyfourth part of its weight of a thick tenacious oil resembling tar all sorts of wood yield a similar oil by the same process i do not know whether the oil from wood be of an inferior or of a superior quality to that from pit coal but i suspect it to be fitter for cordage etc in the ordinary way of making charcoal the whole of this oil is dispersed in the form of smoke may it not deserve to be inquired whether this oil might not be saved with profit the process which is used in america for extracting tar from the pine tree is little different from that by which charcoal is made in england whether the quantity of oil which might be obtained from a pit of wood when converted into charcoal would exceed in value the expense of procuring it can only be decided by experiment the reader may form some guess at the quantity from the following statement the black part of guiacum wood yields a tenth the sappy part a thirteenth part of its weight of thick black oil sassafras wood oak ash alder birch etc give by distillation and making charcoal is a species of distillation from a twentyfourth to a twelfth part of their respective weights of this oil the difference in quantity arises from a diversity in the texture age and dryness of the woods i suppose that a cord of coppice wood would weigh a ton and that four cords would make one dozen of sacks of charcoal and that wood of this sort would yield a twentieth part of its weight of oil on these suppositions there is dissipated in making one dozen of charcoal     lbs of oil or one ton in every five dozen  chapter i geographical state and circumstances sect    situation and extent westmoreland is situated between        0 and        0 n lat and between    0 and      long w from london it is an inland county bounded on the n by the bishopric of durham and cumberland on the w by cumberland and lancashire on the s by lancashire and yorkshire and by yorkshire and durham on the e and contains according to the bishop of landaffs preliminary observations about     square miles or   0  0 statute acres three fourth parts of which he conjectures to consist of uncultivated land  sect    divisions westmoreland is divided into east ward west ward kendall and lonsdale wards and consists of    parishes  sect    climate the climate of this county as may be expected from its vicinity to the western ocean over which the southwest winds blow for eight months of the year and bring the exhalations to descend in rain on the mountains is remarkably moist the quantity of rain that falls in the west part in a year has been ascertained by raingages kept at kendall and on the banks of windermere in the wet year      it amounted to eightythree es in ordinary years it amounts to fortyfive or fifty inches the lowest of which is twenty inches above the medium quantity that falls in europe the air however is pure and healthful the winters rather long and severe in the winter        thirtysix pounds were paid for cutting only a horse track through the snow upon less than ten miles of the road from shap to kendall  sect    soil and surface the county in general is so mountainous and hilly that a great proportion of it must for ever remain undisturbed by the plough between these mountains there are several very pleasant and fertile valleys that want only trees and hedgerows to be truly beautiful the most prevailing soil in westmoreland is a dry gravelly mould sand and hazel mould appear in various parts but chiefly in the e and n clay is found on a few farms toward the eden and eastern mountains and a heavy moist soil on others in the n parts of the county peat moss makes its appearance in small patches in many of the vales and abounds on the tops of several high mountains which however are in general covered with a dry soil upon a hard blue rock provincially called rag the soil that lies upon a limestone bottom is uniformly esteemed the best  sect    minerals notwithstanding its mountainous surface no valuable mines have yet been discovered in westmoreland some trifling veins of leadore have been found in the eastern mountains coal is wrought only in the s e extremity of the county and in the neighborhood of shap where a bastard or crow coal is got  limestone in almost inexhaustible abundance is to be found in most parts of the county except among the western hills which afford an excellent kind of blue slates well known over almost all england  gypsum is got at acronbank near kirkbythore and a few other places it is used for laying floors but not at all as a manure  freestone is found in the eastern parts of the county and at huttonroofe about  0 miles from kendall  on the river kent about   miles below kendall a vein of beautiful marble was discovered about four years ago in the lands of daniel wilson esquire of dallamtower by some workmen who were building a barn and the main quarry has been opened on the estate of that gentleman it has lately been found on the opposite side of the river in the property of  strickland esquire of syzergh  sect    water rivers  of the numerous streams that rush from the mountains and water the valleys beneath there are only three that preserve their names to the ocean the eden which springs in mallerstang and having received in its course the eamont and the lowther and many little rivulets enters cumberland and running the whole length of that county empties itself into the solway firth below carlisle the kent rises in kentmere washes the vale of kendall and loses itself in the estuary near milthrope the only seaport in the county the third is the lon or lune which has its source in ravenstonedale and flows through the vale to which it gives its name till it enters the county of lancaster below kirkbylonsdale  betwixt the mountains several extensive lakes are formed the beautiful verdure of whose banks with their shady groves limpid waters and pebbly bottom are particularly described in the guides to the lakes offered to every traveller who visits this part of the kingdom  the rivers and lakes abound with many different kinds of fish great part of which is now carried to lancaster and liverpool  chapter ii state of property sect    estates and their management a large proportion of the county of westmoreland is possessed by a yeomanry who occupy small estates of their own from  0l to  0l a year the remainder consists of larger estates belonging to noblemen and gentlemen several of whom are resident in the county and take the management into their own hands others entrust the care of their affairs in a great measure to stewards  sect    tenures the larger estates in westmoreland are commonly freehold and the small tenements mentioned in the last section are generally held under the lord of the manor by customary tenure which differs but little from that by copyhold or copy of court roll in some manors the tenant pays only a heriot and fine certain on death of the lord or tenant in others the fine is arbitrary on death or purchase on customary estates the wood is generally claimed by the lord of the manor  chapter iii buildings sect    houses of proprietors from the short residence the author of this report made in westmoreland he cannot pretend even to enumerate the various seats of the great proprietors throughout the county and the neat snug boxes belonging to gentlemen of moderate fortune that adorn the banks of its beautiful lakes  sect    farm houses offices and repairs the lands of the statesmen and farmers in this county lie so intermixed that their habitations and offices which are often built together in little straggling villages must of necessity be very inconvenient for farming purposes but convenience has been little studied even on those farms whose fields lie unmixed the principal structure is a barn which at the same time that it has a stable and cowhouse underneath is frequently large enough to contain the whole crop of both corn and hay so that it is rare to see a stack of either these barns are often twenty yards in length five in width and five yards in height in the side walls the expense of bringing all the materials from a moderate distance and of building a barn of such dimensions with a slated roof may be about seventy guineas the houses are generally covered with slates which are found in several parts of the county the slates are not nailed on boards but hung with oak pegs on laths and plaistered in the inside of the roof a few houses are still thatched with wheat straw which is sold from  s  d to  s  d a threave of twentyfour sheaves  the expenses of repairs are for the most part defrayed by the landlord  sect    cottages there are very few mere cottages in the county the labourer and mechanic generally reside in a small farmhouse and occupy more or less land  chapter iv mode of occupation sect    size of farms  character of farmers farms in general are so small that it is rare to meet with one of  00l a year of rent though there are some of even  00l or   0l a year  it might be useful to know what proportion of the lands in the county is possessed by that numerous and respectable yeomanry already mentioned as occupying small estates of their own from  0l or  0l to  0l a year these men in contradistinction to farmers or those who hire the land they occupy are usually denominated statesmen they live poorly and labor hard and some of them particularly in the vicinity of kendall in the intervals of labor from agricultural avocations busy themselves in weaving stuffs for the manufacturers of that town the consciousness of their independence renders them impatient of oppression or insult but they are gentle and obliging when treated by their superiors with kindness and respect this class of men is daily decreasing the turnpike roads have brought the manners of the capital to this extremity of the kingdom the simplicity of ancient times is gone finer clothes better dwellings and more expensive viands are now sought after by all this change of manners combined with other circumstances which have taken place within the last forty years has compelled many a statesman to sell his property and reduced him to the necessity of working as a labourer in those fields which perhap he and his ancestors had for many generations cultivated as their own it is difficult to contemplate this change without regret but considering the matter on the scale of national utility it may be questioned whether the agriculture of the county will not be improved as the landed property of it becomes less divided  it is painful to one who has in his composition the smallest spark of knight errantry to behold the beautiful servant maids of this county toiling in the severe labors of the field they drive the harrows or the ploughs when they are drawn by three or four horses nay it is not uncommon to see sweating at the dungcart a girl whose elegant features and delicate nicelyproportioned limbs seemingly but ill accord with such rough employment  a judgment of the refinement and civilization of a people has been often formed from their treatment of the fair sex and in this respect france was formerly held up to the world as a model unfortunately the manners of nations are too often painted by those who have been conversant only with persons in what may be called high life but were it allowable to apply this rule even to france and to look for specimens into the lower orders of society and it is there surely that the most faithful representatives of national character or manners are to be met with it would be found that the women even in the boasted days of her monarchy were doomed to the severest labor to load the dungcart to saw the wood and to thresh the corn  the common people of both sexes wear especially in the winter season instead of shoes cloggs which differ from shoes in this that the bottom part is made of wood the wood is generally either birch alder or sycamore it is about an inch in thickness and a rim of iron is nailed round the bottom of it a pair of cloggs costs  s  d they keep the feet warm and dry and with good care will last a twelvemonth  sect    rent the rent of the land varies with its situation and fertility in all situations and of all qualities it has increased greatly in its value within these few years this may be owing partly to the advance in the price of its productions and partly to improvements in the art of farming at shap ambleside and in troutbeck the best haymeadows are let at about  0s the customary acre near towns the rent of the best fields to be mowed may be at a medium rather above  l per acre at kirkbystephen and appleby they are not quite so valuable near kendall burton and milthrope some fields are let at  l and at kirkbylondsdale there are a few which fetch above  l lands of inferior kinds may be hired for pasture at all varieties of price in ravenstondale where no tithes are paid and where the land derives no part of its value from its situation there are between  000 and  000 acres enclosed four fifths of these are let from  s to   s the statuteacre and the remaining fifth from  0s to  0s  in the bottom of westmoreland a farm of an hundred acres of enclosed land may be hired upon lease for   0l a farm containing much coarse pastureland may be had for  0s or   s per acre it is not always known whether these coarse pastures have been measured they being sometimes estimated by the number of cattle they can maintain  besides the rent the farmer is subjected to the payment of tithes poor rates and road money  sect    tithes in some parts of westmoreland tithes are taken in kind in some each farmer has an opportunity of taking his own tithes in others the land is tithe free or pays a small prescription in lieu of tithes  sect    poor rates from the best information he has been able to collect the bishop of landaff in the preliminary observations has stated the average of poor rates not to exceed a shilling in the pound in the rental of all the lands in the county  sect    leases the mode of farming is nearly the same throughout the county and the course of crops is often pointed out to the farmer in his lease which is generally for seven or nine years sometimes only for five or three years at others for fourteen and in a few instances for twentyone years some principal landowners grant no leases  sect    expense and profit a long and intimate acquaintance with the management of farmers would be necessary to state any thing with precision upon this part of the subject it has been said that the general economy of a farm of  00 acres at a rent of as many pounds does not differ widely from the following statement    acres under crops of barley and oats    acres in hay and the remaining  0 acres in pasture that  0 dairy cows kept on the best of this pasture might probably yield  0 firkins of butter and that the profit would be  0l or   l per cent upon   0l the capital employed  chapter v implements it has long been known what angle the sail ought to form with the keel to make the ship move in the water with the greatest velocity but to the present day was reserved the discovery of the angles which the component parts of the plough ought to form with one another and with the line of draught in order that that instrument might meet with the least possible resistance in the performance of its operation agriculture cannot  but advance with hasty strides when the principles of philosophy and the powers of mechanism are directed to its improvement  ploughs  the ploughs of westmoreland are light and although not neatly constructed they are perhaps not ill suited to the soil they are destined to cultivate some of them have a wheel at the extremity of the beam which it is imagined serves to keep the furrow of an equal depth they are drawn most commonly by two but sometimes by three horses the turnwrist plough has been introduced into the county by the bishop of landaff and may be of great service in ploughing the sides of the hills which are very numerous and steep in the arable lands  carts  the carts are of various descriptions and sizes those most commonly used may be fiftytwo inches in length thirtysix in breadth and fourteen and one half inches in depth containing less than sixteen cubic feet they are mounted in some places upon clogwheels and have twothirds of their length before the axle which is of wood there is scarcely a farming wagon to be met with in the county it being a general opinion that four horses in four separate carts will draw a greater weight than if they were yoked together in a wagon  the winnowing machines which are here very common and the harrows are both of the ordinary kinds the drill husbandry being yet in its infancy there are few instruments for hoeing or drilling  chapter vi enclosing fences  gates except a very few open fields on the east side of the river eden the whole cultivated land in the county is divided by hedges or stone walls into enclosures many of which do not contain half an acre there are a few of   or  0 acres and in general they may contain from   to   acres  the gates are of the most ordinary kind being often made by the farmer himself of such wood as happens to be upon the estate  chapter vii arable land sect    tillage fallowing rotation of crops and crops commonly cultivated course of crops  when a field of grass is overgrown with moss which commonly happens in seven or ten years it is broken up with the plough in the beginning of march and sown about the first of april with oats at the rate of seven and onehalf winchester bushels upon the customary acre of    0 square yards the crop is reaped about the middle of september and sixty bushels are reckoned a tolerably good return  second crop  the land is ploughed for the second crop as soon after candlemas as the weather will permit and eighty or a hundred cartloads of stableyard dung are laid upon the acre it is ploughed again in april and sown with four bushels of barley or bigg the harvest is earlier than that of the oats and fiftyfour bushels are reckoned a good crop some farmers plough three times for barley but it is the general practice that is here described  third crop  after the barley the land is ploughed in april and eight bushels of oats per acre are immediately sown upon it the harvest is commonly in september and the crop is usually as good as the first was  this is the most ordinary succession of crops though it is sometimes broken through by taking two crops of oats before the barley which in that case is followed by another of oats the land is then left to itself and the first year it produces a light crop of hay of bad quality in the third year the crop is at the best with regard to both quantity and quality in seven or in ten years it is again mossed over and is again ploughed up to undergo a similar treatment  exceptions   st to this general mode of management there are several exceptions which perhaps it would be improper to omit from kirkbysteven to brough and appleby and from that town to templesowerby the soil is a deep sand which by cultivation becomes more compact and more retentive of moisture the fields of grass moss over sooner or later according to the quality of the soil some where the soil is thinnest and the subjacent stratum the poorest it is judged necessary to break up after an interval of only four or six years in this part of the county there are particular farms where after the second crop which is oats generally inferior to the first the land is summer fallowed planted with potatoes or sown with turnips which last are given to the wintering stock of cattle and sheep dung is always laid upon the fields designed for turnips and potatoes and the remainder upon the fallow which is likewise invariably and always successfully limed at the rate of seventyfive winchester bushels per acre what is so fallowed is sown in the middle of september with two and onehalf bushels of rye per acre the crop is reaped before a year goes round and thirty bushels are reckoned a good return in the month of may grassseeds are sown amongst the rye but are never covered either by the harrow or the roller those fields which were turnips and potatoes are sown with barley or oats and grassseeds in the following quantities to an acre eight pounds narrowleafed red clover seed which is preferred to the common broadleafed clover because it remains longer in the ground four pounds white clover four pounds hop clover four pounds of ribgrass and from five to ten bushels of hay seeds shaken from the crop of the former year these consist chiefly of bent grass which seems to be a species of ryegrass of the great poa or oat grass and dark grass or flanders hayseeds the first year whether it be hayed or pastured the crop is far more valuable than that of any natural grass in the neighborhood upon soil of an equal quality and the cattle especially the horses uniformly prefer these artificial grasses to those which the land produces of its own accord  exception  d  in the immediate neighborhood of kendall where the soil is gravelly or sandy it is not unusual to take potatoes for the second crop and barley for the third the land is then sometimes left to itself but for the most part the barley is followed by a crop of oats a great many potatoes are grown and consumed in the county the price at the time of taking them up is commonly  s  d per winchester bushel in the winter and spring it often rises to  s the produce is variable from   0 to   0 winchester bushels per statute acre they are cultivated in various ways but chiefly by the plough the inhabitants think that potatoes from fresh ground are of the best quality but the product is usually the greatest from an oat stubble sometimes the farmer grows the potatoes at his own risk at others he manures the land with  00 cartloads of dung per customary acre ploughs it once and lets it in this state at  s the perch to the manufacturers and laborers of kendall who furnish the plants and the rest of the labor the price they pay is high but reckoning little for the work they bestow upon it which is conducive to their health they are often well satisfied with their crop which is sometimes very great the land being well adapted for the cultivation of this root  exception  d  from millthrope to burton and from burton by farlton to kirkby lonsdale both the farms and enclosures appear to be somewhat larger than in most other parts of the county and it is not quite so rare to see a few acres of wheat the land designed for this crop is summerfallowed after the first or second year from the ley and is well manured with dung or lime or with both it is sown in september with wheat soaked in brine or washed with chamberlye and dried with lime at the rate of four bushels per customary acre fortyfive bushels are reckoned a good crop and the harvest may be ten days earlier than it is in the northern parts of the county if the land is again manured it is sown with barley after the wheat if not manured it is sown with oats  sect    crops not commonly cultivated it is painful to be obliged in this section to mention pease beans turnips clover and ryegrass but it is hoped the time is not far distant when they will be cultivated on every farm cabbages have been tried in the fields near kendall and rape has lately been sown in small quantities in different parts of the county with great success  flax and hemp are now rarely seen growing here though  0 years ago a little hemp was sown by almost every cottager and statesman  chapter viii grass sect    natural meadows and pasture every occupier of land whether statesman or farmer having it in his power to keep any number of cattle through the months of summer upon joisted fields where they may be kept at a cheap rate or upon commons where they may be kept almost for nothing it is a principal object with him to provide for them plenty of winter food hence his attention is chiefly directed to his crop of hay it has been already stated that the quantity of land at present under culture does not exceed onefourth part of the whole county or    000 acres had all the arable land in the county been cropped with corn three years out of twelve there would have been precisely onefourth part of the whole in tillage but there are many pastures of an inferior sort which are very seldom ploughed and in the high parts there is a much smaller proportion of the land in corn than there is in the low parts in the very extensive manor of ravenstondale although there are between  000 and  000 acres enclosed there are not sixty acres of corn and it is probable that there are not in the county more than  0000 acres under crops of corn in one year the remaining    000 acres are cut for hay or depastured with fattening beasts and rising stock or with cows applied to the purposes of the dairy from such an inspection of the county as was had with a view to the framing of this report the proportions used for these different purposes cannot be even guessed at but that for hay is perhaps the most considerable a prejudice against the artificial grasses prevails so generally over all the county that it may be almost literally said they are never sown when the land has produced a few crops of corn and it is judged that the moss is quite destroyed it is left to itself and such is the humidity of the climate and so strong is the vegetation of weeds and natural grasses that the very first crop has by actual experiment been found to produce   0 stones of hay per acre weighed from the field as every person who expects to have occasion for hay hires a field to supply him with that commodity it is not often that hay is sold in large quantities and it is still seldomer that the quantity raised upon an acre is exactly ascertained when sold it may bring from  d to  d a stone in winter and spring or from  s to  s a cubic yard a cubic yard in the lower part of a wellpressed mow may contain twelve stones of hay and has been known to sell as high as  s or  s in the southern and in the eastern parts of the county much attention is paid to the making of compost dunghills which with the dung that remains after manuring for the barley crop are always laid upon the hay grounds and are thought considerably to retard the progress of the moss at kendall and other places where dung can be purchased they are manured after the first crop and every third year while they continue in grass  sect    artificial grasses it was mentioned in the last section of the former chapter that crops of clover and ryegrass had not yet entered into the general course and therefore nothing can here be said upon this part of the subject except that they have been tried on several farms where they have fully answered the expectations of those who made the experiment some hints concerning the advantages of this practice may be seen in the conclusion to this little work  sect    hay harvest although this is the principal harvest in most parts of westmoreland nothing worthy of notice occurs upon the subject except perhaps the celerity with which the crop is got it being generally carried into the barn if the weather is good within three or four days after being mown  sect    feeding fattening cattle  the young cattle are kept on the lands of inferior quality in summer and have straw and a little hay given them in winter when three years old if barren they are either fattened in the pastures or sold to the graziers of yorkshire and lancashire from  l to  l a piece if with calf from  l  0s to  0l  ten thousand scotch cattle are annually sold at broughhill fair in the end of september though numbers of these are carried off by drovers to the south of england and many are brought by graziers from other counties great quantities remain in westmoreland they are wintered on the coarse pastures and in the straw yard in may following the young ones are sent to the commons and those of an age proper for feeding are put upon the best grounds and are ready for the shambles in october  heifers are joisted upon tolerably good pasture from  0th may to michaelmas at from  l  s to  l  s a head horses are grazed among fattening cattle for  s  d a week young horses are kept from michaelmas to  th march on the inferior kinds of land and have straw given them in bad weather for  s a week  fattening sheep  almost all the sheep in the county except the wedders after the first year are brought from the mountains on the approach of winter and kept in the enclosed grounds till the month of april some graziers stock part of their pastures with wedders or with ewes and lambs the mutton and lamb which remain after supplying the consumption at home are sent to lancaster and liverpool  chapter ix gardens and orchards almost every family in westmoreland has a small garden for supplying them with the common pot herbs  there are several orchards in the county which are said to be slourishing and profitable the common fruit trees succeed well in the low and warm vales but their culture is little attended to  chapter x woods and plantations at whinfield forest and at lowtherhall the seat of the right honorable the earl of lonsdale there are very extensive plantations where many of the trees have grown to an uncommon size several of the oaks at lowtherhall have been valued at fixty pounds a piece there are many smaller plantations and various clumps of trees throughout the county where the wood springs with a degree of vigor hardly to be expected in such bleak and exposed situations as many of them are planted in  on the division of kendall common part of a very high and rocky hill not being capable of any other improvement was planted with scotch fir larch oak ash etc etc all of which are very thriving  the banks of the lakes are likewise adorned with very beautiful coppices  the bishop of landaff has planted on some high ground near ambleside above an hundred acres with oak ash elm beech sycamore scotch fir and larch he is doubtful whether the climate be not too cold for any sort of wood except the fir and larch the other kinds after seven years growth are alive but stunted they shoot a little in the spring but that shoot perishes as to its greatest part in the winter some of them have been out down but the new shoots do not promise well the firs and larches but especially the larches thrive as well as he could wish  chapter xi wastes the wastes in this county are very extensive and valuable they are depastured chiefly with stocks of sheep which are managed in nearly the same way whether the ground be in common or in severalty  in winter all the sheep are brought down to the enclosed fields except the wedders which being thought able to endure the severity of any storm or fall of snow are left to shift for themselves upon the wastes where they remain till they are four years and a half old when they are sold from  s to   s a head having dropped their lambs the ewes in the end of april are sent back to the wastes where the whole flock pastures indiscriminately without an attendant the lambs are sometimes suffered to wean themselves at others the teats of the ewe are fastened up to her udder by a plaster of coarse paper and pitch the value of the wool and the expense of salving are the same with those mentioned sect    chap     scotch sheep  great numbers of scotch hogs and dinmonds are annually bought at stagshawbank fair in the month of june and grazed on the wastes of this county on some they are found to answer very badly on others they thrive well and are ready for the grazier a year earlier than those of the native breed there is here a strong prejudice in favor of these coarsewoolled sheep which there is every reason to believe is ill founded the sort now known under the name of the cheviot breed being equally hardy and much more profitable from the superior value of their fleece  black cattle  in addition to all these sheep numerous herds of black cattle are likewise to be seen upon the commons a few of these are of the breed of the county and the rest are scotch either bought at broughhill fair in the end of september and wintered on the low grounds and in the strawyard or purchased in the spring from drovers who fetch them from galloway and dumbarton in autumn they are either sold to the southcountry drovers or wintered and fattened in the county  ponies  a few ponies of the scotch breed are reared upon the commons but the practice not being general it need not be dilated upon  geese  great numbers of geese are bred upon the commons and sold to the yorkshire drovers at about  s  d a head  it is generally understood that no person shall send to graze on any common more stock than he can winter upon his estate or farm in right of which he has a title to pasturage on that common this regulation however is little attended to and the commons are almost always overstocked to such a degree that many persons do not think it worth while to avail themselves of their right of commonage  on stinted pastures it is very ordinary to hire out the right of keeping both cattle and sheep a summers grass for an ox or for ten sheep on forest hall and mosley common is let at  s on a part of troutbeck common where no sheep are allowed to feed an ox may be kept for  s  d and on another part of the same common an ox or ten sheep may remain all the year for sixpence  chapter xii improvements sect    draining the importance of having the land lie dry and of preventing the water which in wet weather breaks out upon the declivities of the hills from chilling the fields below is well known in westmoreland the method of draining is fast improving and the practice is daily gaining ground the drains are generally walled in the sides and covered with large stones out of the reach of the plough  sect    paring and burning the operation of paring and burning is much practiced in westmoreland both in improving moor lands and in reclaiming rough pastures that have been allowed to return almost to a state of nature it produces excellent crops at first but the effect is diminished every repetition and farmers are too apt to exhaust the land by repeated crops of oats without any manure  the expense is said to be from   s to  0s per statute acre  sect    manuring dung  to increase the quantity of his manure and to apply it to the greatest advantage are by no means the least important of the various branches of the farmers avocation in those parts of westmoreland where summerfallowing is not practiced the land designed for barley and potatoes always receives the stable yard dung at the rate of  0  0 or  00 singlehorse cartloads an acre and in autumn what remains is laid upon the haygrounds at a rate per acre considerably less  on some few farms in the neighborhood of appleby where summerfallow and crops of turnips may almost be said to enter into the general course the dung is carried in winter from the yard to the fields and laid down in a heap which is turned over two or three times with a view to accelerate putrefaction twenty cartloads per acre are laid upon the turnip land and the fallow and its operation is always assisted by the addition of seventyfive winchester bushels of lime dung is sold at kendall and at milthrope for  s a cart load  lime  in most parts of westmoreland limestone is sound in inexhaustible plenty but coals to burn it must be carried from such a distance that its application to the purposes of agriculture has not yet become general when by the projected canal to kendall coals shall be brought into the heart of the county its use must soon become universal  it is sometimes laid upon the land when it is in tillage but for the most part it is spread upon the surface of grass fields and it has been found to sweeten such as are coarse and benty amazingly  in whatever way it is applied and in whatever quantity varying from    to   0 winchester bushels an acre it is always attended with wonderful effect the price at the kilns is  d or  d a bushel  composts  much attention is paid to the making of compost dung hills in many parts of westmoreland they are most commonly spread upon grass and experience has shown that they at once improve its quality and check for years the progress of the moss one hundred cartloads of earth rakings of the roads mud or rotten leaves and fifty of dung carefully mixed with  00 winchester bushels of lime are laid upon three acres with great advantage  marl  this valuable manure was scarcely known in westmoreland till about three years ago when a species of rock marl was discovered on bolton common it is easily come at and has been applied with advantage upon a small scale at the rate of  0 single horse cartloads to an acre it is more than probable that if properly sought for shell marl might be got in many of the low grounds and marshes with which westmoreland abounds  sect    weeding the weeding of turnips and potatoes is practiced in westmoreland but the hoeing of turnips is in general so ill executed that a gentleman of fortune in the county has recommended to the board of agriculture to send some turniphoers from those districts where this simple operation is better understood  the larger weeds are taken out from amongst the growing corn but it is very seldom that docks ragweeds etc etc are destroyed on the meadows and pastures  sect    watering the fertility attending the overflowing of the nile and other muddy rivers has been long known and well explained from their depositing the earthy oleaginous saline putrescent ingredients with which in their course from the mountains they become impregnated but it is a late discovery in philosophy which teaches us that pure water is itself compounded of two principles and that one of its component parts is by the process of vegetation converted into the substance of vegetables this discovery enables us to account for the utility of irrigating land even with the clearest water which long experience has shown to be a most efficacious mode of improvement  those who have opportunities of applying water and are not conversant in the practice would do well to imitate the example of the bishop of landaff who is making great improvements by watering at calgarth park it is practiced on a small scale in many other parts of westmoreland and always with great success  chapter xiii live stock sect    cattle the attention that was formerly paid to the breed of black cattle has rather diminished of late years they are longhorned very much resemble the lancashire breed and when kept to a proper age grow to a great size as a heifer of three years old can be sold for as much as an ox would fetch at four it is rare to see a oullock of the country breed but to judge from those of all ages in the pastures at lowtherhall they are excellent feeders and possess in an eminent degree the very desirable property of laying the fat upon their backs and other valuable parts the heisers and barren cows if well chosen are confessedly good thrivers and are in great request among the graziers of yorkshire and lancashire not many years ago there was killed at lowtherhall a bullock of the country breed whose carcass weighed one hundred and thirtytwo stones  dairy  there are few counties in england in which there is no great manufacturing town where more milch cows are kept in proportion to its size and where the produce of the dairy forms a greater part of the profits of the farmer it may be naturally supposed that he is particular in the choice of his cows and that they are remarkable for giving a great quantity of milk neither supposition however is founded in truth the farmer keeps just such cows as he has bred and they by no means yield so much milk as would be expected from those of the dutch or even the scotch breed the ayrshire breed is reckoned the best for milch cows in scotland particularly in the neighborhood of dunlop the comparative value of all the different breeds in regard to quantity of milk etc the board of agriculture proposes to ascertain upon a pasture of the same quality farmers in the country generally estimate the expense of keeping a milch cow at five pounds a year and the produce at eight pounds cows in the country are kept for the sake of making butter of which great quantitles of an excellent quality are sent yearly to the london market in firkins of    lbs net at from  0s to   s each in the immediate neighborhood of kendall the dairy turns out to better account by selling the new milk which is contracted for all the year at  d a quart being the same price which the london cowkeepers receive the skimmed milk is sold at one third part of that rate the ordinary price of a good milch cow may be about ten pounds  sect    sheep the breed of sheep kept on the mountains and commons of westmoreland is either native or a cross with scotch rams no attempt has yet been made to improve either the carcass or the fleece they are horned dark or gray faced thick pelted with coarse strong hairy wool the whole stock upon a farm is herded together which is different from the practice in those counties where sheep farming is thought to be the best understood  wintering  those storemasters who have not upon their own farms pastures sufficient for the wintering of their young sheep send them to the low grounds from the  st november to  th april and pay  s ahead for those that return they are so subject to the black water sickness or middlingill that at an average ten out of an hundred die before christmas after that being very hardy they seldom die and never of that disease  price  the wedders are sold in october when four years and a half old from  s to   s each the barren ewes at lammas from  s to  0s and the old ewes about  s to be wintered in the enclosed grounds and fattened with their lambs the ensuing summer  salving  in october or the beginning of november the whole flock is salved so heavily that a gallon of tar and    lbs of butter are expended upon thirtyfive sheep a man may be hired for this work at  s  d a day in which time he will not salve above ten or a dozen or he will undertake to salve them at  d ahead the whole expense is about sixpence apiece it has been repeatedly tried to substitute tobaccoliquor for the butter and tar but it is generally imagined that the wool is better for the sheep having been salved near kirkbysteven this operation is performed with oil and tallow at an expense of  d a head  wool  the wool is worth on an average of years in time of peace  d a pound part of it is sold to the manufacturers of kendall and part of it to those at bradford and other places in yorkshire the ewes are said to bear the best wool and on an average of a flock fix fleeces weigh a stone  silverdale breed  silverdale a small district in the neighborhood of millthrope gives its name to the breed of sheep in this part of the county the soil is good and on a limestone stratum and a branch of the sea is nearly contiguous to it they are horned white faced and close woolled they are said to be native and are much superior to the common sort in regard both to fleece and carcass at the sale of a farmers stock in october      the lambs of this breed brought  0s  d apiece the dinmonds   s  d and the ewes at the age of three years and a half   s  d or   s  d in the townships of burton and holme where this breed is kept five sheep at an average yield a stone of wool which is worth  d a pound at a medium of the whole parish of burton for eight years from      to      inclusive it required six fleeces to weigh a stone  it is not unusual for the proprietor to be owner of the sheep upon the farm in this case the farmer is to be considered as little better than a shepherd the flock is valued at the time of his entry and again at his removal and the difference between these valuations is settled in money  experiments   st twenty lincolnshire mugg ewes that had been tupped by a ram of mr bakewells breed were brought into westmoreland in the month of december      and lambed in february    0 these mugg ewes were tupped in    0 by a common westmoreland ram and the dinmonds produced by this cross have turned out the best sheep in the county and weigh from    lbs to  0 lbs a quarter and are thought to be superior to those of the first breed   d six of the lambs produced from the tup of mr bakewells breed and the mugg ewes were rams four of these rams were put to ewes of the common breed in the county and the lambs sprung from this cross are much of the same size as the ordinary breed but they are broader on the back and finer in the wool as the experiment has not yet been long tried it must be left to time to show what the result will be   d the lambs produced by the lincolnshire ewes and their own lambs of february    0 are not so strong as these lambs of    0 which the shepherd is disposed to attribute to a scarcity of food in the spring rather than to any defect in the breed   th thirty of this breed were left unsalved in      they were in good condition and had no scab these same were again left unsalved in      and broke out in scab early in      it must be remarked that the sheep at the time of salving in      were not in such condition as in      so that it does not appear from this experiment that there is any necessity for salving sheep in good condition   th the lincolnshire ewes do not carry so much wool nor is it of such a good quality as when they were brought into the county  sect    horses as there is but a small portion of the county under crop the horses are not numerous nor has any considerable attempt been made to improve the breed of these useful animals they are small not exceeding fourteen hands and a half in height are said to be hardy but they are neither strong nor handsome sixteen or seventeen pounds are reckoned a good price for a horse at five years old most commonly two though sometimes three and in the western part of the county even four are yoked together in a plough they are often turned upon the commons in the intervals of labor which as the farmer very probably has neither turnips nor fallow are very frequent in the summer months  there being only one person in westmoreland who uses ox teams it may be justly inferred that the general opinion of farmers in the county is in favor of horses the writer of this report has not such information upon the subject as to be able to draw the desired comparison between these useful animals  sect    hogs the swine of westmoreland though not large are good in their kind farmers butchers and others who kill swine often dispose of the hams to persons who make a trade of curing them for sale perhaps there may not be any thing peculiar in the mode of making hams in this county but it is believed that a detail of the process may be entered here without impropriety  the hams are first rubbed very hard generally with bay salt by some they are covered close up by others they are left on a stone bench to allow the brine to run off at the end of five days they are again rubbed as hard as they were at first with salt of the same sort mixed with rather more than an ounce of saltpetre to a ham having lain about a week either on a stonebench or in hogsheads amongst the brine they are hung up by some in the chimney amidst the smoke whether of peats or coals by others in places where no smoke ever reaches them if not sold sooner they are suffered to remain there till the weather becomes warm they are packed in hogsheads with straw or oatmeal seeds and sent to london lancaster and liverpool in such quantities as to form one of the principal branches of export from the county  in      neat hams of    or    lbs weight were sold as high as  d per pound when green when cured in      they were sold at  d apound it has been found by experiment that hams lose twenty per cent of their weight in the curing  sect    rabbits a few rabbits are kept in the neighborhood of brough and orton and there is a small warren in ravenstonedale but it is rare to see them in any other part of westmoreland  sect    poultry considerable quantities of geese ducks and common dunghill fowls are reared in westmoreland the two last are generally disposed of in the market towns in the county or carried to lancaster but great numbers of the first are sold to drovers from yorkshire  turkeys are seldom reared here except in the farmyards of men of fortune  sect    pigeons the few pigeons that are to be seen in westmoreland belong generally to men of fortune when sold they often bring  d apiece  sect    bees bees are common in westmoreland but there is nothing worthy of remark in the way in which they are managed  chapter xiv rural economy sect    labor servants laborers hours of labor labor is dearer in westmoreland than it is in almost any of the counties either to the north or south of it this probably is owing to the great number of small landholders or statesmen abovementioned who doing the work upon their own estates with their own hands and those of their families are perhaps disinclined to labor for other people  servants by the year  a hind may be hired by the year at twenty pounds a house a garden and a patch of ground to grow potatoes and an unmarried man at from ten to twelve guineas a year and board and washing  by the day  the wages of an ordinary labourer are from  s  d to  s  d a day he begins to work between six and seven rests an hour at dinner and leaves it off between six and seven in the evening  the laborers on the highway from shap to kendall receive  s  d a day for nine months in the year and  s  d a day for the other three months  by the month  on the large farms in the seasons of hay and harvest it is not unusual to hire laborers by the month of four weeks at the rate of  l   s  d and victuals they breakfast on milkpottage and bread and cheese receive a pint of good beer in the forenoon and another in the afternoon they dine on meat boiled baked or roasted and potatoes or pudding sup on cold meat and have plenty of common beer to drink through the day they begin in the morning as soon as the corn is dry rest none but while at meals and continue as late as they can see to work four men may cut tie and stook a customary acre in a day leaving a stubble from nine to fourteen inches in length  cutting of corn per acre  when done by the piece the cutting of an acre by the sickle the scythe not being used in the reaping of any sort of grain may cost  s and if the crop be very heavy  0s or even  0s  d  cutting of hay per acre  the price of mowing a customary acre of grass varies from  s  d to  s  d and a man usually mows an acre in a day  per day  when hired by the day a mowers wages may vary from  s  d to  s  0d and victuals  masons wages  masons in summer have from  s  d to  s  d a day or  s  d or  s  d and victuals and in winter  d or  d less at millthrope a few are hired all the year at  s  0d a day wet or dry when they do their work by the piece and furnish every thing they are paid  s or  s  d a square yard for a wall of two feet in thickness built with lime if materials are furnished to their hand they are paid  d or  0d ayard seven yards and a half in length of a dry stone wall five feet and a half in height cost  s  d or  s  d in building  carpenters wages  the wages of a carpenter or common country wright differ very little from those of a mason  thresher  a farmers own servants generally thresh out the corn when persons are hired for this purpose they receive about  s for threshing a load of seven and a half bushels of oats and  s  d for that of barley and from  d to  d a boll of rye consisting of two winchester bushels  miller  farmers commonly have their meal made from oats of their own growing the miller receives  d aload for drying the oats if they are good in quality a load of seven and a half bushels will yield     pounds of meal besides paying the miller his toll for grinding which is guessed to be about four per cent wheat is made into flour for  d abushel numberless streams rendering the precarious assistance of windmills unnecessary there is but one in the county and it is employed in grinding bark for the tanners at kendall  thatcher  a thatcher receives about  s  d a day and victuals or  s  d without victuals  slater  slating is measured by the rood of fortytwo and onefourth square yards and costs in the workmanship   s or   s a rood in the vicinity of the state quarries the slater will find all materials and labor for   s or  0s arood  tailor  a tailor gets in some places  0d in others  s a day and board  mole catcher  the molehills are carefully spread in most parts of the county and the fields are cleared of moles at the rate of  d an acre where they have not been catched before  d an acre are paid the second year and a penny or three halfpence yearly thereafter  maidservants by the year  in some farmers families where they are hard worked maidservants receive  l a year their ordinary wages in other families maybe about  l  0s or perhaps  l when they do not change their service if strangers in the parish care is taken to vary their wages every six months to prevent them from acquiring a settlement to which they would be entitled were they hired for a year or were their wages to continue the same for that period  by the month  in haytime and harvest when hired for a month they get from   s to   s and board  by the day  when hired by the day in harvest and haytime they receive  d or  0d and victuals or  s  d or  s  d without victuals at other season they are paid with  d  0d or  s a day their times of entry and of leaving off work their hours of labor and of rest are very various  sect    provisions it is not unusual to hear people exclaim against the increase of luxury and the alteration that has taken place in the mode of living in their time the labourer lives as well now as the farmer did forty or fifty years ago the farmer as well as the man of small landed property and so on and is this in any respect to be regretted or is it not much better for them all but persons generally cry out most loudly against the rank immediately beneath them without recollecting that their own mode has been changed in nearly the same proportion as the one which they are so ready to condemn spencers travels   fifty years ago the price of butchermeat at martinmas was from  d to  d a pound in burton market and eighty beasts were sometimes slaughtered in a day and bought to be salted for winter provisions from that time except a few at christmas and at easter no cattle were killed there till they were fattened upon the pastures in summer farmers in those days seldom eat any butchermeat they lived on bread and butter and what other little matters the farm afforded now laborers generally breakfast on that very ancient food pottage with the help of a little cheese and bread they dine on butchermeat and potatoes or pudding and sup on potatoes or pottage or bread and cheese  the bread generally eaten in the county is made from oatmeal water and oatmeal are kneaded together into a paste without any leaven this paste is rolled into a circular cake of about twenty inches in diameter and is placed upon a thin flat plate of iron called a girdle under which a fire is put and the cake thus baked goes by the name of clapbread and is to be seen at almost every table in the county this very particular description of baking cakes may appear too minute or altogether unnecessary and it owes its place here to the request of some persons of rank who wished to see it recorded somewhere the meal is mostly ground to such a degree of fineness that a measure of sixteen quarts will weigh sixteen pounds farmers laborers and manufacturers usually have fifteen cakes made from sixteen pounds of meal and as many baked in a day as will serve their families for a month such of the gentry as eat this sort of bread most of them now eating bread made from wheat have it baked much more frequently and also much thinner a laboring man will eat sixteen pounds of meal made into bread in a fortnight the price of sixteen pounds of meal is variable from  s  d to  s  d the medium is  s which gives  s aweek for each labourer for bread his cottage and his fuel cost at least as much more his wages for threequarters of a year are  s aweek and   s aweek for the other quarter but making allowance for broken days  s aweek may be considered as the full amount of the price of his labor and indeed a good labourer may be hired by the year at that rate hence there will remain   s aweek for the labor of the man for the remainder of his own sustenance the sustenance of his family and the clothing of them all  the difference in the price of provisions in a county so small as westmoreland cannot be very great they are however somewhat cheaper in the north and cast parts than they are in the south parts which are more within the reach of the markets of lancaster and liverpool beef in kendall market in the month of october      was sold at  d or  d apound and a choice cut at  d in spring it often rises to  d apound mutton which in spring often rises to  d apound was sold at  d  d or  d pork was sold at  d or  d as all the bull calves are carried to market veal is for the most part cheaper than the other kinds of butcher meat and yet in spring it is sometimes sold as high as  d apound potatoes brought  s  d a bushel or  s  d or  s aload in spring they are often sold at nearly the double of these prices oatmeal is bought in some places by a measure of sixteen quarts at a price which fluctuates from   s  d to   s  d in others by a peck of  0 quarts which in summer      was worth  s butter was sold from  d to  d apound in winter the price seldom rises above   d a stone of    lbs of  0 ounces costs   s  d and a firkin of    lbs neat from  0s to   s cheese in the country costs  d a pound and new milk  d aquart which in kendall is contracted for all the year at   d  a turkey costs  s   d or  s according to its size a goose  s  d or  s or when sold by weight  d apound a hen from  d to  0d and a chicken from  d to  d eggs fluctuate in their price from  d to  d or even to  d adozen ducks are sold from  s   d to  s apair teal at  d apiece woodcocks at   s or  s abrace and pigeons from  s to  s adozen  salmon catched in the lune is sold from  d to   d apound that which is brought from carlisle from  d to  s  d char are sold at about  s adozen trouts at  d apound mussels at  d or  d aquart flounders from  d to  d a piece eels at  d apound and rabbits without the skins at  s the pair honey in the comb costs  s apound  sect    fuel the eastern parts of the county are supplied with coal from stainmore blackburton and ingleton in yorkshire but in other parts the most common fuel is peat  it is a question deserving the consideration of the legislature whether the duty of coal carried coastwise might not in certain districts be taken off with great advantage to the state the value of the improvements in agriculture and manufactures which would attend such a measure in counties ill supplied with fuel cannot be estimated but it is presumed that it would very far exceed the loss sustained by the removal  chapter xv political economy as connected with or affecting agriculture sect    roads the great roads leading through the county are kept in excellent repair by the sums collected at the turnpike gates and when these prove insufficient by a portion of the labor of the parish or of the poundrate which may be levied in its aid  the parochial roads are made and kept in repair by six days labor of the parish and by a rate not exceeding sixpence in the pound which the surveyors may levy with the consent of the quarter sessions some of these are tolerably good and others are annually improving many of them scarcely exceed the smallest legal breadth allowed by statute which is eight feet  sect    canals there is not at present any canal in the county but one of great magnitude has been projected from wigan to kendall it is now executing and when finished by introducing the coal of lancashire into the heart of westmoreland will be of the greatest service to its manufactures and agriculture if the coal can be afforded by the proprietors of the canal at a cheap rate the town of kendall may then emulate in the cloth manufacture leeds itself another canal from the bottom of windermere water to the sea a distance of about   miles is wanted if this should ever be cut the town of ambleside would rise to considerable importance it would then be as well or better situated for trade than kendall is now  sect    fairs there is a great fair for cattle horses etc at broughhill on the  0th september  there is a fair at ambleside on the wednesday after whitsunday and on the   th of october  at appleby on whitsun eve whitsun monday  d wednesday of june and    august  at kendall april    and november   and    at kirkby lonsdale on holy thursday and    december  at kirkbystephen on the monday before the  0th march october  d   th and   th  at millthrope on   th may  at shap on the  th may  at orton on the  d may the friday before whitsunday and second friday after michaelmas  and at old town on the  th and  th october  sect    weekly markets there are weekly markets at eight different towns in westmoreland but the only one of any note is held at kendall the next in point of consequence is held at appleby the county town  sect    commerce the commerce of westmoreland is not yet so extensive as to have any sensible effect upon its agriculture its exports are coarse woollen cloth manufactured at kendall stockings slates tanned hides gunpowder hoops charcoal hams wool sheep and cattle its imports are chiefly merchant goods wheat oats with a little barley cattle and sheep  millthrope is a very trifling port and the only one in the county  sect    manufactures the manufactures of westmoreland are not of much greater importance than its commerce they consist chiefly of coarse woollen cloth called kendall cottons properly it is said coatings gunpowder stockings silk and worsted waistcoat pieces flannels and tanned leather  most beautiful stockings and carpets of strength and luster little inferior to those of persia are manufactured at lowther for behoof of the earl of lonsdale a few of these have been sold from   l to  0 l but as they are wrought solely for his own use or to be given in presents to his friends perhaps they do not enter with propriety into an enumeration of the manufactures of the county what is now the manufactory was originally a college but being only in its probationary state was discontinued by the late lord viscount lonsdale the earl of selkirk and the late duke of athol were educated here and an ashtree planted by his lordship is still pointed out  sect    poor westmoreland not being a manufacturing county and landed property being there in general minutely divided the number of poor who apply for parochial aid is comparatively small the poor rates in the parish of kendall are  s  d in the pound of the actual rent which is very near four times the average of the rate throughout the county were it not unfair to draw a general conclusion from one example it might be inferred that the poor are most numerous in manufacturing counties and towns  sect    population the inhabitants of kendall were found by an actual enumeration in      to amount to  0   and the whole population of the county has been estimated at    or    thousand as the number of births considerably exceeds the number of burials many of the inhabitants must migrate to other counties  chapter xvi obstacles to improvement the most material of these are customary tenures where the fines are arbitrary or according to the improved value of the estate where the wood is the property of the lord and where a lease for longer than three years is not valid without his consent want of leases or very short leases and the collection of the tithes in kind  chapter xvii miscellaneous observations sect    weights and measures great diversity of weights and measures prevails in westmoreland as is the case in almost every county in great britain the pound consists of          or    ounces and the stone of       or  0 pounds there is a winchester bushel a customary bushel equal to three of these a bushel of two bushels for the sale of potatoes near appleby and one of two and a half for that of barley rye is sold by the boll of two bushels and potatoes by the load of four bushels and a half heaped or more generally a bag which holds seven and one half bushels is filled and sold for a load of potatoes  there is the statute acre of    0 square yards the customary acre of    0 raised from the perch of six and one half yards and a third acre on the borders of lancashire raised from the perch of seven yards containing    0 being the same as the irish plantation acre  sect    supply of london london is not much indebted to this county for its articles of consumption the little it receives from hence consists chiefly of butter bacon hams and excellent blue slates which form a cover for some of the best houses in the capital it is probable that after being fattened in the southern counties some of its cattle and sheep reach smithfield market  conclusion means of improvement and the measures calculated for that purpose sect    arable lands clover in many counties of england the land is sown with grass seeds and left to lie for some years with a view to refresh and enable it to bear crops of corn but in westmoreland it is ploughed and sown with corn in order to prepare it for grass when it has been cropped for three years and it is judged that the soil is sufficiently reduced and that the moss is quite destroyed the land is left to itself to grass over the first crop of hay is never either weighty or good in quality the second is generally very superior in both these respects to the first and so favorable are the climate and the soil to the growth of grass that the third crop is often so abundant as to be let for two or three pounds per acre and of a quality so excellent that in several places cattle are fattened upon it in winter for the markets of lancaster and liverpool but even these best crops are far inferior in point of value to those that would be produced by the same fields were their natural aptitude to grow grass directed to the production of clover and ryegrass the prejudice that prevails almost universally in westmoreland against these artificial plants is a great obstacle to the improvement of the husbandry of the county and must be overcome before the arable lands can be brought to that degree of cultivation of which they are susceptible  it is said that hay made of clover and ryegrass is much coarser than that which is made of the natural grasses and that these artificial plants giving place to the natural ones perish at the end of two or three years and therefore ought never to be sown at all  the opinion is conceived to be ill founded which holds that hay made of sown grasses is bad in quality long experience and continued practice having shown that horses are very fond of such hay and that when even fed upon it alone they are able to do a great deal of hard work it can hardly be seriously asserted that hay made of the trash produced spontaneously by the land the two first years after it has been cropped with corn is better than hay made of clover and ryegrass the artificial grasses seldom or never perish at once at the end of either the second or third year they disappear gradually making room for the natural herbage to occupy their place which it is imagined it would be found upon trial to do with much more profit to the farmer than would have accrued to him by managing his lands in the ordinary way for the superior value of the hay the first two years would far more than reimburse him for the expense of the grass seeds and he might still have his favorite natural hay after these had died entirely out  this is stated upon the supposition that the field was to be allowed to lie eight or ten years in grass as is the custom at present if it were to be broken up at the end of the first or second year it would be sound in good condition for bearing a crop of corn the roots of clover it is well known being a great improver of the soil but this way of cropping the lands will enter with more propriety into that part where an alteration of the present course will be suggested  in the year      mr smith at henridding in the parish of burton sowed a close containing exactly two acres and a half lancashire measure with    lbs of red clover seed amongst a crop of barley for which the land had been slightly manured after fallow wheat this field is in lancashire but being situated within an hundred yards of the county of westmoreland it may be mentioned here without impropriety and it is selected merely because the particulars respecting it are better known to the writer of this report than those in regard to any field of clover in the county that was the object of his survey it was mown in the month of july      and it then yielded a crop of twentytwo singlehorse cartloads of hay it was mown a second time in september and produced eighteen of the same cartloads it was depastured with nine sheep from the time the last crop was carried off till the beginning of november and the foggage was then tolerably good let the most strenuous advocates for natural grass say whether they ever had a crop so valuable  where the land is intended to be depastured the argument will apply with treble force and the decided preference given by cattle of all kinds to the green herbage of the artificial over that of the natural grass ought to remove every doubt from the minds even of those who are the most strongly prepossessed in favor of the present practice  in front of carus wilson esquires new house near kirkby lonsdale there lies a field of sixteen acres which was sown with grass seeds amongst a crop of barley in the year      it was depastured in      and maintained three times more stock than he would have expected it to maintain had it been left to itself in the ordinary way farmers the most prejudiced against sown grasses saw and confessed the force of the experiment and it is not to be doubted will follow an example which tends so materially to promote their interest  the cultivation of clover is perhaps the greatest improvement in the art of farming which has been discovered in modern times and it is equally matter of regret and of surprise that what is at once so easy and so profitable is not yet become universal and it furnishes a strong instance of the difficulty with which old habits and prejudices are rooted out even when selfinterest is concerned in their extirpation  turnips  the climate and soil of the valleys of westmoreland are well suited to the cultivation of turnips which must be carried on to a considerable extent before the agriculture of the county can be improved in any material degree experience has shown that this crop and the mode of husbandry usually connected with it are able not only to fertilise particular farms but even to improve whole counties the most profitable and the least troublesome way of disposing of this crop is to fatten sheep with it a customary acre of turnips if the crop is good will feed twentyfive sheep weighing sixteen pounds a quarter from  st november to  st april even supposing the sheep made no advance in these five months the very increase of the price of the mutton from  d to  d or  d a pound would bring a profit to the farmer as considerable as it is easily calculated when to this there is added the value of what they would gain in point of weight the profit it is hoped will appear to be so great as to make the desire to grow turnips irresistible and quickly to increase the quantity an hundredfold beyond what it is at present  where the land is very dry the sheep may be penned upon a small part of the field of turnips and shifted to another as those in the first part are eaten up but if there is a field of grass near at hand the superior improvement of the sheep will pay for the labor of carrying the turnips to be eaten on that field where they will lie dry and clean and where the turnips will be less trampled on and abused  rotation of crops  it is the general opinion of farmers in westmoreland that their lands are better suited for grass than for bearing crops of corn and they are ploughed for three or four years not with an expectation that the corn will be more profitable than the grass but in order to renovate them for grass and to destroy the moss which in a few years overruns all their ley grounds but there are some who are persuaded that the neat profits of the three or four years the lands are under crop usually exceed the profits of any other three or four years while the same lands lie in grass and they think that their fertility for the production of either grass or corn would be injured by ploughing for a longer term or after shorter intervals of rest  whether the lands under the present system are most profitable to the farmer when they are in corn or in grass it is not necessary now to enquire because with all due deference to the general practice and opinion of a whole county it is presumed that a mode of husbandry and a succession of crops may be pointed out which upon trial would be found far more profitable than those at present followed  the uniting what may be called the clover and the turnip husbandry is the best method hitherto discovered of keeping dry lands in a state of continual fertility and for this the light and friable soil of the valleys of westmoreland is well calculated instead of the common rotation of oats barley and oats again and then leaving the land to grass over of itself the following course of crops might be introduced with advantage both to the public and the individual when an old close of good land is broken up it should be sown with oats as is done at present after the oats it should be manured and sown with turnips in drills thirty inches asunder so as to admit of being horsehoed next with barley or oats and always with grass seeds at the rate of about sixteen pounds of clover and a winchester bushel of ryegrass to the statute acre if it is intended to pasture the field the grass seeds can hardly be sown too thick if it is to be made into hay the quantity of seeds abovementioned will be found amply sufficient the first years crop of grass may be mown twice or after the first cutting it may be eaten by fattening cattle or it may be eaten by sheep till the beginning of june saved after that and mown in august and it will still produce a valuable crop of foggage or aftermath it should be depastured with cattle or sheep the second year and the third year likewise if it shall be thought proper to keep the field so long in grass  this course would preserve the land in a state of perpetual health and vigor did it not taking pleasure in variety dislike a too frequent repetition of the same crops after some rounds it will be proper to increase the quantity of clover seed and at last to bring it seldomer into succession for if too often sown it will be rejected entirely when this is apprehended the course may be varied or lengthened by the introduction of a crop of pease or of drilled beans where the land is deep and moist and wheat after either of these or after a clean summerfallow or by leaving the land some years longer in grass than usual  when it shall be proved and known that potatoes are a cheap and nourishing food for horses the demand for that valuable root will become nearly as unbounded as that for turnips is and even although they exhaust the land they may then be introduced into the course with much advantage to the farmer  it is not pretended that the rotation of crops here recommended would suit all the arable lands of westmoreland but it is believed that on a very large proportion of them it might be followed with a certainty of success the cold wet stiff soils should be summerfallowed instead of being cropped with turnips wheat should be sown after the fallow and clover or oats and then clover after the wheat but it is impossible and were it possible it would be improper in a work of this general nature to mention how all the varieties of soil should be treated and to descend to the minutiae of ploughing and sowing and ten thousand little matters that continually demand the farmers attention and that are always varying with the weather in these his own ingenuity must assist him and there all his ingenuity will be necessary for his art though apparently easy is attended with a thousand difficulties  sect    waftes there is room for great improvement in the management of sheep as well upon private estates as upon the commons but while these last continue in their present deplorable state it would be in vain to attempt any alteration upon their stocks the case however is different with store farms properly so called where the breed or treatment of the sheep differs very little from that of those upon commons although there can be no reasonable doubt of their being well adapted to the keeping a far more profitable sort than is to be found there at present there is no weight whatever in the argument which has been often used against the introduction of such a breed from the scarcity of food and the coldness of the climate the british wool society having proved that the finest breeds of spain or of england will thrive on the wildest of the cheviot hills and that very finewoolled breeds may be propagated on the most mountainous districts of scotland there are numbers of sheep at the feroe islands which lie in latitude    and even in iceland part of which is beyond the arctic circle they are to be found in great abundance on every farm and there nature sports in a great superfluity of horns as if the scanty pittance of food which the animal can pick up in that bleak and frozen climate were more than sufficient for the support of the carcass and the fleece  the extensive and valuable commons of westmoreland loudly demand the interposition of the legislature in a country that boasts of attention to its interest some immediate alteration in their state whether by division or by sale cannot be too eagerly pursued nor too strongly inculcated nor can it be too generally made known that there are many wealthy people living near some of the best commons in the county which is a point of great importance who do not think it worth while to avail themselves of their right of pasturage  every person sees the necessity of some material change with regard to the commons and now that thinking men are turning their attention to this important subject there is no doubt that some plan will be fallen upon by which both the public and the individual may reap the full benefit of these at present dreary wastes which are a reproach and disgrace to the nation but it cannot be expected that any measure however wise or any proposal however advantageous can meet with universal approbation it will probably be reprobated by some whose prejudices it will alarm and with whose little interests it may be supposed to clash till something of greater consequence be accomplished the reduction of the stint where such is already established or the establishment of a moderate stint upon commons that are perfectly free ought not to be delayed one hour for at present they are of little if of any use either to those having a right of commonage or to the nation at large  a general inclosurebill for the whole kingdom would save the expense of separate applications to parliament for the division of particular commons but there are many barren and rocky commons that would not be in any wise benefited by enclosure and although the interests of a few individuals ought to give way to those of the community there are numerous instances where both would be injured by the operation of such a bill for it would at once be ruinous to many proprietors to be obliged to enclose each his share often at an expense greater not only than the value of that share but in some instances greater than the value of the feesimple of that farm or estate in right of which he claims and prejudicial to the public by interrupting the sheepwalks upon the mountainous districts which ought to be as free and open as possible  the principal part of the stock kept upon the commons consists of sheep either of the breed of the county or brought from scotland the ewes are wintered in the enclosures and sent back to the commons in april the wedder hoggrels are always wintered the first year on the low grounds at the expense of  s a head are sent back to the commons about the same time with the ewes and remain there till they are sold to the grazier they may fetch at an average   s a piece add to this the value of the wool and   s may be about the sum received for every wedder sheep that arrives at the age of four years and a half  scotch hogs are bought at about  s  d a piece and are kept two years upon the commons when they may be worth  0s  d or   s add to this the price of three fleeces of wool and the whole sum received for every sheep delivered may be about   s from this subtract the original price two years interest of the money expense of herding for the first two months of thrice washing and clipping of twice salving the value of the risk of bad payment from the drover or grazier the loss by straying and what is often much more considerable by death and say what profit remains  it has been computed that one third of all the sheep in westmoreland died in      great calamities are often exaggerated though no doubt the loss must have been prodigious when it was estimated so high  twenty shillings are reckoned an ordinary profit for keeping a scotch beast a year subtract from this the price of wintering on the low grounds and in the strawyard interest of the cost value of the risk of drovers loss by death from fatigue estimated at   per cent by disease and now and then by one tumbling into a peatmoss and say what advantage arises from this adventure  seven shillings and sixpence are thought an ordinary profit for keeping a little scotch beast on a common from may to october make the same deductions as in the former article with the exception of the value of the winters keeping and see how little remains for the rent of the land  it is not possible to place this matter in a more striking point of view than by repeating that on several commons the liberty of keeping an ox or ten sheep for a whole year may be hired for sixpence  improvement of wastes by liming  great portions of many of these might be improved at a small expense by the application of lime which is found in most parts of the county and might be cultivated with the certainty of great advantage when ploughed great care ought to be taken to adopt a proper succession of crops and to lay the lands down with grass seeds in a very few years because when exhausted by overcropping they are reduced to a worse state than they were in before and there is no way yet discovered of preparing lands for a repetition of a hearty dose of lime  by paring and burning  many of the level moory parts might be converted into arable lands by paring and burning which are well understood by several persons in the county and have been practiced with more or less success on some private estates  by planting  there are many thousands of acres utterly incapable of cultivation by the plough and in the paper prefixed the bishop of landaff has shown in a manner equally ingenious and novel with what advantage these might be covered with wood it is well known that trees flourish with the greatest vigor on soils far more barren and in climates much colder than that of westmoreland there are stately oaks at niagara which though not in a high latitude experience a degree of cold in winter far beyond what is ever felt in this country on the western coast of america in latitude    the very summits of the hills are covered with wood and there is plenty of trees at nortons sound in latitude       and timber for the use of ships in the british navy has been cut even at kamtschatka the very end of the earth where the soil is barren in the extreme and covered with summer snow and where the winters are rigorous beyond the conception of an inhabitant of europe  that westmoreland has been a wooded county is evident from trees found in mosses on the highest hills and statutes and regulations made long after the conquest since which time the climate has not been changed for the worse are full of the mention of forests and chaces and parks and mastage and pannage and vert and venison and greenhue and regarders and foresters and verderors and an hundred other names and titles respecting the preservation of the woods and the game  the valuable plantations at lowtherhall the seat of the earl of lonsdale show how well calculated the soil and climate of westmoreland still are for the growth of timber which it cannot be questioned would thrive over all the county as well now as it did five hundred years ago the profits of planting are so distant and so few persons looking eighty or an hundred years beyond the present day are willing to sacrifice a paltry interest for the sake of a remote posterity that perhaps it may be necessary for government to encourage by premiums what in the end would turn out so greatly to the advantage of the community these might be distributed with much propriety by the board of agriculture whose income seems to be far too moderate for the support of so important an establishment the objects of whose superintendence are innumerable and the field of whose operations is extensive as the island itself  to the north of shap lies a very extensive common called the scars where between two and three thousand acres of level white land in a state of nature offend the eye of every traveller and cry aloud for improvement the means of which it contains in immense quantities of limestone upon its very surface it is more than twenty years since an act of parliament was obtained for a division of this common and that it has not been carried into execution is the more to be regretted as in the opinion of very judicious persons in the neighborhood a large portion of it might be easily made as valuable as the little closes of shap which are let from  0s to  0s an acre  on the south of shap lies another common called the fells which is in general incapable of cultivation by the plough but it is not ill suited to the maintenance of sheep and the remains of the celebrated shapthorn near the road to orton show that plantations would succeed even on those places of it which are most exposed  near the mouth of the river kent there is a marsh of considerable extent common to haversham and millthrope and like all the other commons in westmoreland greatly overstocked it would not be difficult to bank off the sea from this marsh and to convert it into corn fields but if this were thought not advisable its value might be instantly more than doubled by the establishment of a moderate stint or still farther increased by a division  part of crosby common might be easily converted into arable and good pasture land and two clumps of trees of a considerable size prove that its worst parts might be planted with success  from crosby and meaburn a dry level common extends to within three miles of appleby it is covered with heath and is capable of various modes of improvement  the commons of knock newbigging kirkbythore and marton lie contiguous and form a tract of several thousands of acres dry soft and improveable a great part of these is covered with strong brackens and is superior in quality to the soil of many farms in the neighborhood and well suited to the cultivation of turnips and clover  this specimen of the commons in westmoreland will it is hoped be deemed sufficient for it would be tedious and painful to enumerate them all it is difficult to behold the desolate state in which they lie without surprise at the nation having so long delayed taking measures for their improvement the wastes and commons in this county and throughout england in general have been elegantly called a public treasure in the hands of private persons it is to be hoped that the time is not very distant when this important treasure shall be opened and its contents shall prove equally beneficial to the individual and to the public at large  it is impossible to look forward without emotion to that day when these neglected wastes shall have received that degree of improvement of which they are susceptible when they shall wave with valuable crops of corn bleat with profitable flocks or be clothed with stately timber when every little rill shall be turned out of its natural course to fertilise the neighboring plain and when there may be seen in every corner the industrious husbandman at once enriching himself and advantaging the community in a manner the most substantial  contemplating the matter in this view who but must exclaim what a noble field for exertion what a source of national wealth yet in store more certain than the profits of commerce more permanent than those of manufactures  such are the reflections and observations that occurred in a survey of the state of the stock and husbandry in the county of westmoreland made in the months of october and november      at the request of the newly established board of agriculture what success has attended the attempt to place this important matter in a just light others will judge but it will be doing no more than justice to admit that no pains have been spared in the execution of this task which others might have performed with more ability but not with greater alacrity or zeal  it is impossible to conclude this report without mentioning to the board the very flattering manner in which the person commissioned by them to make this survey was received by all ranks and descriptions of persons in the county of westmoreland every possible aid was given by the two respectable members of the board resident in the county the other individuals who assisted him are too numerous to be discriminated but the writer of this paper will ever remember their very polite attention with gratitude and his short residence in that part of the kingdom with peculiar feelings of pleasure and respect  what gratitude is due to him who first called the attention of the nation to its most important interests and whose unremitted efforts are directed to promote the good of his country how well does he deserve and what a sure road has he chosen to immortal fame that will survive the ravages of time and smile at the fleeting celebrity of martial achievements  addenda to the note page    the reader is desired to add  the result of this experiment was that in the harvest of      such parts of the wheat the seed of which was pickled and limed as well as that which was pickled and not limed was nearly free from smut but that which was neither pickled nor limed had smutted ears in abundance at least a hundred times more than the other it may be proper to observe the seed was purposely taken with a few balls of smut in it  this experiment is decisively in favor of steeping in chamberlye  the following addition is also desired to be made at the bottom of page    to the paragraph on drilling ending on moist soils  we have lately found it most convenient to yoke two horses to the drill one going in each furrow and to drill seven rows upon a ridge of  0 to    inches wide when the intervals are  0 or    inches and  0 inches wide when the intervals are    inches  with the horses yoked in this manner in a fiverow drill ten rows may be sown upon ridges  0 feet wide leaving a space on the top of the ridge about    inches wide for one of the horses to travel on this is supposing the intervals    inches wide but if the intervals be  0 inches then the ridges may be   feet wide  a light harrow is fixed to the drill to cover in the seed
