an essay at removing national prejudices against a union with england part iii by the author of the two first  printed in the year mdccvi  an essay at removing national prejudices etc having wrote two essays in england upon the subject of the union and particularly to remove national and party prejudices against the treaty then on foot i calculated those essays principally for the english part where i always expected the difficulty would lie and where i met with certain radicated tho ill grounded prejudices against the scots as a nation as well as against the union which i thought a general happiness  but i confess my self surpised when coming to edinburgh on some private affairs of my own i found my two essays reprinted here and forwardly handed about as arguments against that very subject they were written to promote i mean the union and that only upon this weak supposition that because i had only insisted upon the advantages to england in union that therefore i did not pretend scotland should any way be bettered by it  to this my answer is very short that i had always too great a respect for the scots to write a satyr upon the nation and that thinking it impossible any scotsman could be to seek in the real numerous and so visible advantages scotland shall reap by the treaty i thought it would seem to reflect too much upon the gentlemen concerned to presume to tell them what it was much better manners for me to presume they all knew already and what by the nature of the thing became so visible that to me it seemed none but the wilfully blind whom i do not pretend to cure could be at a loss about  but since it is my misfortune to be thus mistaken and that some people charge me with that ignorance which my respect for their understanding would not permit me to charge them with i find my self obliged contrary to my fixed resolution of not meddling on either side to make this short essay on the respective advantages of scotland in the depending treaty of union and this i shall do as concisely as i can and carefully avoiding needless digressions come immediately to the matter in hand  only before i begin the attempt give me leave in duty to the government and in defference to her majesty to note that the expressions of advantages accruing to scotland by the union are so plain in her majestys royal letter and so asserted in the respective speeches of his grace the lord commissioner and the lord chancellor at the opening the present session of parliament that one would think no man could read that letter and those speeches and ask afterward what the advantages to scotland shall be by the union  when her majesty tells her subjects of scotland she is fully persuaded it will prove the greatest happiness of her people that it will be the solid foundation of lasting peace it will secure your religion liberty and property remove the animosities amongst your selves and the jealousies and differences betwixt our two kingdoms it must increase your strength riches and trade and by this union the whole island being joined in affection and free from all apprehension of different interests will be enabled to resist all its enemies support the protestant interest every where and maintain the liberties of europe  that to bring this union to pass is the only effectual way to secure your present and future happiness and disappoint the designs of your and her majestys enemies  when his grace her majestys high commissioner has inculcated these things and reminds you that the queen esteems it as the greatest glory of her reign not her glorious successes abroad excepted to have this mighty affair concluded  when my lord chancellor tells you you have now the opportunity of establishing for your selves and posterity by this union all that concerns your religion and liberties and the most valuable privileges of trade  after all this has been said is it not hard gentlemen you should ask a poor stranger here what scotland shall get by this union and why i did not go upon that in my former essays  really gentlemen when i wrote those essays i conceived them of use to scotland to convince some unbelieving englishmen that your great advantages should be no injury to them it was a loud and continued cry there ay ay we know the scots will gain by this union but what shall we we in england be the better for it and i was challenged often to make out what the english should gain by it  upon this i undertook that subject and really there lies some unhappiness in the alternative of this matter and an impartial writer as i hope i may pretend to be has a great difficulty before him in urging the advantages of either nation since the arguments to prove the advantages of one seem to argue the disadvantages of the other  my remedy for this is what i have undertaken in another place viz to convince both parties that their advantages are mutual reciprocal and so equal that it is hard to determine which side shall be the greater gainer  and this happy conjunction of good events i must confess comes to pass from a thing many people have not without plenty of ignorance opposed i mean the unions being centeral and as to all the essential parts of constitution universal so that we are at liberty to give that word its full extent union and here i think it can not be improper to explain how extensive i think the word union to be in this case and how even by the treaty it ought to be understood it is a word comprehensive of every thing good to both exclusive of all manner of preference or disparity of parts abhorring all things injurious or diminishing to either a full coallition a general incorporation of nations of interests of power and of safety  a sameness of circumstances and of sympathies becoming one and the same body with one and the same head life soul nutriment point and period  some gentlemen who talk much of this union and having known the heads of it yet pretend not to understand it would do very well to turn to their books and putting together all the etymologies received significations customary acceptations and common readings of the words union and incorporation tell us what they understand by them and how the true meaning of the words and the new suggestions of separate existence in the government can consist  but if this be too nice and the thought too much sublimated for them let me recommend to them a course simily  i liken this union to a body receiving food as flesh fish fruit liquids etc all which being incorporated and digested concoct together unite their very substance and dissolve themselves into one and the same nutriment to the health life vigor and growth of the whole body proportionedly and universally  if wrong digestion distemper of the body or defect of the food produces corruption contagion or improper fermentation the most remote member and the nearest or more immediate equally feel their proportioned want of nourishment decay of strength distemper and disorder the deficiency cannot be felt in the head and not in the foot but weakness succeeds to all the parts  if our union be partial federal periodical or indeed notional as most of those schemes have been then the defects may be so also one part may thrive and another decay and scotland would be but too sensible of that in those sorts of union  but if the union be an incorporation a union according to the extent of the letter it must then be a union of the very soul of the nation all its constitution customs trade and manners must be blended together digested and concocted for the mutual united undistinguisht good growth and health of the one whole united body and this i understand by union and no wonder they who consider the nations in a less or more contracted capacity of union are at a loss to find the advantages of it  now gentlemen as thus united would you know your advantages they consist of four sorts    trade   religion   civil government   liberty and sovereignty   in trade the united riches stocks settlements factories and dependencies of england are concerned to promote yours not as their sister scotland but as their own riches stocks in trade etc not in a separate but an immediate capacity their ports are yours and you are immediately naturalized to and legitimated in their customehouses ports and commerce your manfuactures are carried to them and what you want imported from them without taxes tolls distinction or interruption  if the indies lies at your door and you want stock to grasp that sea of wealth the fishery your fish and their stocks will unite to fall into that useful affair by which your people will be employed your seamen kept at home your provision consumed your lands improved your nation enriched they shareing with you in every one of these and you with them in every other advantage  twill be endless to essay on the freedom of your linen manufacture into england and it is prodigous increass by the taking off the exorbitant duty now laid upon it the freedom of an immediate trade to all our colonies denied even to the english subjects inhabiting ireland the flush stocks of english men falling into trade with you and the currency and flux of english bullion and coin into all parts of your kingdom  twould be worth your considering the advantages of introduceing english improvements on your estates and perhaps english farmers and stocks on your lands the exportation of your corn and coals to english mercats and whether it will not be your own fault if these things do not in a few years double the fee simple and raise the value of your estates two for one  these are a few of the advantages in trade which would bear a higher enlargement if it needed that i should first prove this would keep your people at home and then examine the infinite alterations and consequences both to landtrade and ready money which doubling or trebbling the number of your people would produce  it is a slander upon your country to say  it is a barren land nature was commanded not to let man have his bread out of her but by the sweat of his brows and with that sweat she never denis him  it is want of trade to whet industry profit to whet trade vent of goods and stock to produce profit these are the barrennesses your country complains of and declines for want of  your lands enclosed manured and cultivated would be as rich your cattle as large your sheep as fat and your wool as fine as in england your barren muirs would yield corn the hills feed flocks of sheep and your better lands which you now wholly employ with the plough would feed strong and valuable cattle from hence would proceed darys milk butter cheese etc which being plentiful and cheap would feed your poor in a better manner and deliver them from the misery and hardship which now makes your people fly from their native country and makes you the nurses of europe that you have the trouble and expense of your children till they are grown up and then other nations reap the profit of their labor  but i can but touch these things here perhaps i may more largely discourse of both the evil and its remedy on another occasion but to bring it to the present purpose the immediate remedy for them is an union and as it is the only remedy so it must be a remedy you must partake of the general improvement both in land living and trade and i need say no more  the english powers must be your defense the whole english wealth must be engaged to you the english navys must be your convos and in all parts of the world your ships have the immediate protection of their fleet ports forts and forces and this by the natural consequences of the union not as you are their friends neighbors and confederates but as you are themselves their own it is become a debt to you their subjects must pay it or be traitors to their sovereign and to their native country which is yours and theirs indefinitely and undistinguisht  i know some gentlemen will allow all this much rather than be convinced of equal advantages in another yet more valuable case viz religion which is the second head of discourse  and here i must own i am astonished that any one can help seeing the safety settlement and perpetuity of the established church of scotland entirely wrapped up in the union and indeed only to be secured by it  htherto you have been jealous of england putting upon you episcopacy tyrany etc and i cannot say it is without cause and in case of ruptures war diferent sovereigns and a thousand casualties and uncertainties to which the church as now established is subject both from england without as distinctly and disunitedly considered which after the queen no body can answer for and from a numerous and doubly disaffected party at home who i say in case of those things shall answer for what may or may not befall the present established church i dare say no man that has a true zeal for it can say he is easy in the present condition of the church abstracted from this union  upon an union all these fears vanish it is for ever rendered impossible to overthrow the settlement of the presbyterian church of scotland but by subverting the constitution by absolute arbitrary government and the openest barefaced tyranny the church and the constitution the spiritual and temporal liberty have the same sanction subsist and depend upon the same security are defended by the same power demanded by the same right twisted and connected together cannot fall but by the same disaster nor stand but by the support of one another  it is true tyrannies may happen and so they may and are much more likly to do under your present unsettled posture as to succession than otherwise and therefore you will still be more safe than you are now and with this addition that then all britain will be concerned for your liberty and you will demand it as your undoubted indisputable right which right the other can never consent to abrogate or make null without making it lawful by the same majority to lose their own and so should one day come to suffer by the same experiment  and indeed this is the only way to reconcile that strange absurdity of which i have taken notice else where now growing up in both nations viz the danger of the church that england should say her church will be in danger and scotland say her church will be in danger if both these can be true i confess it has something very odd in it but what is yet more absurd is that this should be from a union bless us union work this how can this be it is the nature of union to preserve not distroy to secure not endanger to confirm not undermine no gentlemen if either of your churches are in danger it will be for want of the union so and no other way the absurdity may be reconciled and both churches be in danger  in union love peace charity and mutual assistance are natural consequences and can those pull down any church whenever either party attempts upon the other the union is broke it is no more the thing and can no longer bear the name when the union is broke the constitution is overthrown for one link of this chain being broken the whole chain is rendered useless the force of the one depending upon the continuity of the rest the fundamental is distroyd the government dissolves and the whole island becomes a mob one universal rabble just as in the case of a tyrant dispensing with the laws and setting up arbitrary power property ceases authority dissolves constitution suffocates and the national capacity dies  it is true human wisdom can make nothing indissolvible this union may be broke so may magna carta so may the constitution but gentlemen you have the same security for your church settlement that you have for your lives liberties and estates and the same on one side that you have on another  but says one filled with jealousies of remote possibilities even the legislature may be byast and a parliament may come that shall rescind the settlement of the church of scotland etc  put this into english a parliament may come that may dissolve the constitution that may rescind the union that may sacrifice the whole kingdom it is absurd in it is nature the union in it is being is the very constitution the life and soul of great britain as to government and to say a parliament may come that can break the constitution is to say a parliament may be mad possessed and felo de se as a parliament they can not do so they cease from that moment to be a parliament and become a house of tyrants and a den of robbers nay and of the worst sort of robbers stripping those they come to protect  if they would do this therefore they can not without dissolving their own being annihilating their own body and committing all imaginable absurdities  they may dissolve themselves but original natural right must remain if they dissolve the form whether shall it return  to its primitive state it cannot because that is dissolved to confusion it must not because right must be preserved whenever therefore a parliament destroys the constitution by which a nation is formed that parliament ceases and power reverts to its original source to form a new one  thus the nature of the thing is its own security and there needs no addition of other force if there does the mouths of those gentlemen must be stopped in his grace the high commissioners speech viz that his grace is empowered to consent to what may be farther necessary  what can be made more firm are there any ligaments in the law qualified to bind the church and the constitution together so as that one cannot be hurt without the other they are offered you take them and tie it as fast as laws or oaths can bind or the sacra imperii of any nation be made  after this what shall we say is there any thing in the scruples of some in either of the established churches which goes beyond the real security of the church  i wish those gentlemen would examine whether it be any more than a scruple and whether all the obligation they think themselves under is not limited by possibilities whether it can be understood they should be bound to do that which they cannot really wish the public good and present circumstances considered were in their power to do  let such gentlemen consider how far their sincerity as well as judgment will be called in question in this case  whether really securing the church which they embrace as truly and only orthodox be not the most effectual step they can take to pull down all false churches and consequently a full discharge of the sacred obligation they think themselves under  it is certain as things are the church of scotland is far from safe and i should be excusable if i should say nothing but miracle or a union can make her so he then that effectually establishes the true church of christ in the world effectually suppresses and pulls down all other churches in the language of his capacity as he assists to place that church in a posture of victory over all her enemies by a liberty of using all her spiritual weapons viz the superior doctrine and sanctity of her ministry and i wish there were no other contention between the two churches  if the church of scotland is now in a precarious unsafe and unsettled condition and may be secured by the union then the members of this church can no more ask me what they gain by the union nor answer it to their consciences or their posterity that they should oppose her settlement in this the day of her establishment  but say the gentlemen that in behalf of the church argue against the union as now proposed we in scotland are not safe by the union for we are deprived of our parliament and delivered over to the parliament of england and we do not know but such a time may come when the parliament of england whose constitution is wholly episcopal may vote our church down and erect the episcopal church of england as the establishment of great britain putting us off in scotland with a toleration which also they may by an occasional bill reduce again to any thing they please  this i take to be the sum and state of the question for really what the other party objects in my opinion carries with it no weight  to argue what an english or british parliament may do and what they may not do seems to me to be so conjectural that it leaves no room to call it an argument and let opinion go which way it will or probability bias which way it will this will follow it is as possible and i must ask pardon for thinking that it is more probable a scots parliament may be obtained to ruin presbytery than an english  and i shall turn the very same arguments which are used against this matter upon the gentlemen that use them thus  the strong reasons given why an english parliament may do this are such as these  the great interest of the church of england and her influence in the parliament her having prevailed to continue the testact impose it on the irish dissenters and attempt it on the colonies her power to influence elections in both kingdoms the nearness to carrying the occasional bill her strong struggles for it the easiness to bribe or take off the    members etc  the reasons why there is no danger from a scots parliament are such as these  that the act making it treason to impugn any article of the claim of right makes it dangerous to attempt it in the parliament of scotland  that the nobility and gentry of scotland are too sensible of the calamities formerly brought upon the nation have suffered too much by them to offer at embroiling the nation again upon that account  that the example of the parliament chosen after king williams death is an argument for this in which an author says there were more highchurchmen elected than in any parliament since the restoration  who were so far from restoring episcopacy that they would not allow the episcopal clergy the toleration they petitioned for  this as the sum of the projected disparity is what is now offered upon this head which in short i abridge thus  it is a comparison of probabilities  that it is probable from both circumstances and examples that the english parliament may undo the church settlement of scotland but it is not probable the parliament of scotland can do it  this i desire to speak briefly to and if i should chance to turn the scale of probabilities against them then i leave it to it is consequences whether the world will not give it against these gentlemen who with their imperfect union are for leaving us just where they found us or worse  that the parliament of england is composed of church men is true and that the parsons tho not near  0000 as is said vote and the church may influence elections very much is all true and yet under all this and under such reigns as in which the dissenters in england have been most hated they could never obtain any effectual law to suppress them and at last the poweer of truth and the reason and nature of things so prevailed that the dissenters are not only secured but the whole nation is come over to them in the doctrines of government right and liberty  the dissenters are not gone back an inch but the church ashamed of their persecutions and oppressions which like excentrick motions always revolve of course to regularities and more natural rules returned again by length of time to her self and owned her error declared persecution against her principles and freely fall in with tolleration and liberty  they see the dissenters and the church have but one civil interest and that liberty is the safety of both they are convinced not conquered reduced not by power or party but by the nature of things they come to their senses again  after this upon another sally under a highchurchministry the test was foisted upon the dissenters in ireland and some extravagancies acted in england but mark how soon did these attempts in the authors blow up the ministry and mere nature bring all things to rights again  to instance in the attempt on the colonies which is the story of carolina me thinks is very odd since to read the misfortune of my lord gr  lle on that head with what contempt he has been treated and how mortified for offering such a thing but on a poor handful of planters me thinks i say it should strangely weaken the arguments of those who seem to suggest these things  these people seem to me a little infatuated and to argue against themselves for in order to prove that such a certain thing as attempting the supression of presbytry may come to pass they bring upon the stage all the instances of these attempts in which the people attempting have miscarried and can tell but one in which they succeeded viz the putting the test upon ireland which by the way had never past neither had not the dissenters in mere self denial for the public good rested under the hardship rather than venture to lose the bill against the growth of popery a thing these gentlemen i suppose knew nothing of and a generosity the other party are but very little acquainted with  it is hard now gentlemen that because the highflyingchurchmen have always attempted the dissenters in england and miscarried to argue from thence that therefore they shall insult the scots settlement and succeed i think it had been a much stronger way of arguing to say that being unable with their united strength ever to gain upon the dissenters in england who by their own calculation are not above one to twelve they shall certainly be the less able to prevail when in conjunction with the scots interest and members  as to the occasional bill and the nearness of its being passed it is plain it was a surprise the snare was not seen at first but with what indignation the reserves and secret designs against the dissenters were treated when discovered i leave to the reader to find in the journals of both houses  from hence we come to the probabilities on the other hand viz that there is no danger of the scots parliament being seduced the same author grants the new    and    may be bought by the english court but the whole parliament cannot be so  and yet i believe most people will join in this that let the court at any time be sure to buy    and    in either parliament they shall generally speaking carry any thing they desire so that this is absurd and by no means a just way of arguing  another contradiction takes off very much of the credit of this kind of arguing viz that the act making it treason to impugn any article of the claim of right makes it dangerous to attempt this in the parliament of scotland  i cannot but be surpised to find any man can say this is not an argument just the other way that it is not as lawful a security to the church of scotland in the english parliament or in the parliament of britain as in that of scotland  is not this act to remain in force after the union and may it not be made a part of the treaty and can the parliament of britain vote what is declared by the treaty to be high treason to attempt it is certainly as great a security to the church of scotland as can be desired that it is declared high treason to impugn her settlement  shall it be objected that the parliament of britain may repeal this i answer and so may the parliament of scotland whenever they please as it now stands but if made a capitulation of the treaty according to my notion of the treaty it can never be altered but by mere tyranny perjury violence and usurpation  this is the present security of the presbyterian church of scotland she is established by parliament the sovereign is sworn not to alter it and it is high treason in the subject to attempt it and all this made a stipulation previous to the treaty which cannot be broken if this be not security sufficient i should be glad to see something better offered to the high commissioner that according to his graces speech it may be past into such a law as may make them fully easy  it is unhappy that the gentlemen who argue on this head will allow the church of england or the court or both may have an influence over the whole parliament of britain but cannot have an influence over the so much smaller parliament of scotland  i have heard it suggested by the enemies of the nation of the scots that they are poor and mercenary and may be all bought by the court with  00000 l if this slander be true it is first a sign that the present government in england does not bribe them now secondly it is plain that they are not to be bribed into the union for that the money has not produced the effect yet and the court of england or highchurch have not on all occasions bought such bills as they have had occasion for  on the other hand these gentlemen put so little stress on the    votes in the house of commons in britain that they think they may be always out voted and the scots may have bad luck to have no friends in the house of commons but their own     now this is the very pretense on the other part of the question in england where the gentlemen put us in mind how fatal    scots members may be to the church in conjunction with the whigs there and i am in some seeming straight in pushing either part of the argument both sides taking hold of it if i say in england they are too few to hurt us then say the scots they are to few to secure us if i say in scotland they are enough to secure you then say they in england they are enough to hurt us  this is a very unhappy case and the artifices of our writers on this head seem very mean here they are forced to run counter against one another and make such shifts turns and doubles to bring things to bear as i can not but wonder at  the english court say they may bribe the    members and    lords in the parliament of britain and they may join with their counties enemies to betray scotland  but in the scots parliament they pretend they are safe and the church will be secured by them for they cannot be bribed bought or byasst  again the court may get all episcopal men to represent the kingdom of scotland at the parliament of britain  but they can get none that will so much as agree to a toleration of episcopacy while they belong to the parliament in scotland so that to day they may be bribed to morrow they can not to day they may be all episcopal men to morrow they will be a security against episcopacy  now take the highchurchmen in england and their absurdities are not fewer than these to day they tell us    scots men will bring presbytery into england and pull down the church to morrow the dissenters in england are not one to twelve and we must force the scots to restore the church thus one way a thing is great and another way small one way secure and another way in danger  now let us place these people one against another in each kingdom in england    scots commoners and    lords will certainly bring in presbytery and pull down the church of england in scotland they will join to bring in episcopacy being bribed and bought to pull down the church of scotland  to day they are so many they will endanger the english church to morrow so few they cannot defend their own  to day they will be so true to presbytery they will never leave caballing to pull down episcopacy to morrow so false they will sell their country join in voting episcopacy up in scotland and reduce the present church to a toleration  these things are very counfounding and no man can be prepared to debate with men that will thus go upon all manner of possibilities  i confess in my weak observation i think they come all from the same fountain and are agitated by the same spirit i mean from england where a vigorous party struggles against the union of the kingdoms as the only mischief can befall their highchurch cause and effectually deprive them of the opportunities of embroiling both nations  i wish this kingdom a little better informed of the practices of those people and entirely delivered from their influence i observe all or most part of the pamphlets against the union are formed in england and sent from thence in which the authors suggest things falfe in fact presuming upon the distance of the place and that they shall be taken upon their words  they represent the union as a thing which depends wholly upon the parliament in this kingdom and  the english entirely acquiescing in the matter nay some have represented it as a thing the english are courting and wheedling this kingdom to in order to bring them under and that there is nothing to do but to get the scots to comply with it  in order to this every englishman here whether by his curiosity private affairs or by whatever other occasion brought here is rendered suspected as if sent from england as an emissary to officiate here in preparing the scots to their purpose  i do believe that in england there is a general happy disposition to this union especially in the wisest best and gteatest part of that kingdom and that this temper is exceedingly promoted and increased by her majestys steady adherence to it as the only means to secure the peace and happiness of both nations and as much as possible crushing checking and discouraging the party that are against it and i do acknowledge to believe that this happy disposition is such at this time that if the parliament of scotland closes with it and no unreasonable difficulties are raised from hence it will be completed there  but i entreat the gentlemen on this side to bear with me in telling them this happy temper in england has not been so easy a thing to procure abundance of visible providence have been remarkably concurring to bring this conjuncture to such a crisis great havoc has been made by their own follies in the interest of a party under an administration that would never have made the attempt  victories of various sorts have contributed to the work and a connection of wonders have brought it to pass a conquest at home superior to blenheim or ramellies has been made over the dividing spirits of the high party peace and union has made large strides and rid over the bellies of her vanquished enemies envy malice jealousy and party strife  the queen nay the very bishops too have been called a thousand presbyterians deserters of the church and all that is scandalous every moderate church man has been a confessor in this cause and gone through scandal reproach and all sorts of opposition for espousing it  what tacking what projecting what caballing have the party attempted as the struggles of their wicked cause and with what difficulty has this juncture been brought to pass  nor are the party yet in dispare but with all imaginable vigor and artifice they carry on their dying cause and dpute inch by inch every step  the last game they have to play is the union if they can not destroy that they own the union will destroy them and i am very sorry to see the subtilty of their proceeding extends hither  they leave no stone unturnd they play whiggs against whiggs and church against church presbyterians against presbyterians they amuse with jealousies on one hand raise scruples on the other in england they rail gibe and banter in scotland they plead those very things for arguments which they own their aversion to  now i would humbly recommend to these gentlemen here in scotland who really are for secureing their church how comes church of england men high church hot episcoparian disputants to talk of your security does the fox preach guard les poules have a care of the geese  why is it they talk so much of the security of the church and fill your heads with fear of the church whence must this fear come it must come from the english pray gentlemen how comes it to pass that in england all your friends are against you and all your enemies are for you by you i mean you objectors  all the high church men all the enemies of your improvement the enemies of your trade and the enemies of your church are enemies of the union they throng you with their pamphlets and cant of securities those very men who wish your church and perhaps nation too at the d  l are turned about and talk of the security of the church the very jure divino men talk of liberty the very instruments of former tyrannys in england talk of preserving your laws parliaments and judicatorys  this is really so mysterious that i think it is worth your observation and no doubt but you will find good reason from it to quicken your application to the union  i shall close this essay with two things for i cannot have room to enter upon the civil advantages  his grace the hihg commissioner has acquainted you that he is empowered to pass laws for the further securing this matter in order as i suppose to make you easy and remove the scruples and fears of those really concerned for the church  now in laying hold of her majestys offer by his grace the high commissioner here and the like in england there seems to me to be one ready step to make both sides easy and to remove the jealousies on either hand as to the danger of the church whether presbyterian or episcopal and the matter is very short viz that an act of parliament be past in the respective kingdoms containing a claim of church rights a declaration of the state of either church its constitution and government with a formal capitulation or clause of establishment for either church and proper provisions articles and limitations between them declareing their powers and extent which acts being first past in either kingdom be afterward incorporated into and made part of the treaty as an essential condition of the said union and this no doubt will be granted  to say this may be cassd annulled or afterward made void seems invidious and is to my apprehension talking nothing at all for no subsequent parliament can make null any article of the treaty  it would be no treaty if this could be the treaty is the foundation and constituent head of the parliament of britain and gives it a being and therefore is so far superior in it is power as not to be destroyed by its own substitute and as i have said elsewhere to break the treaty is to dissolve the constitution and very being of the parliament and overthrow the union and to think england will contribute to breaking the treaty is too hard a suggestion and what i care not to enter upon the description of here  how preposterous is it to judge that a parliament should hereafter annull and abolish in prejudice of a whole kingdom what before the very being of that parliament was declared to be their right and assented to granted and capitulated for on both sides  it is true it is possible to be done it is possible that after this england may raise an army and come and destroy scotland but it must be contrary to faith justice honor right law and liberty and this must in its nature dissolve the constitution and return the whole island to its divided state  but still says an objector we can not help our selves to take up arms will be treason and rebellion etc and we shall be treated as perjured rebels  i answer it will be treason and rebellion in the letter of the thing but not in the meaning of the law so the taking up arms to join the prince of orange was treason and had king james defeated that prince and frustrated the revolution the gentlemen at notingham would soon have found themselves treated as rebels and the consequences would have been bloody enough  but here would be no other ground for it than was there and should ever such an infraction of the treaty happen i make no scruple to say the whole constitution would be dissolved authority dye and things would as before revolve either to their divided state or into all kinds of confusions  it is unkind i confess to offer such things of a body of gentlemen chosen out of the whole island and t would be endless to give them answers it is impossible there can be men enough found in a parliament to close with so open a breach of the very constitution upon which they themselves stood nor is scotland so inconsiderable a nation that england should offer so foully to break with them and with so little reason since in the case proposed there can be no pretense to use you so hardly but what must be merely tyrannical and an original violence in which they could expect no aid from heaven or honest men it is a prospect so horrid that i cannot look into it without concern no partyheats can run to such a length not the parliament in king charles the  ds time though loaded with pensions and places could be brought to part with any branch of the english constitution neither can they here for it will be all one whole settlement and a dissolution on one side dissolves the other of course  i think scotland can have no security like this treaty it is backed with the constitution it is fortified with capitulated reason and when ever the flood of parties attacks it twill runback and drown its contrivers  if any man talks of proposing more than can be had it gives good ground to suggest he shall be best pleased with the denial  i would censure no body in their proposing higher demands than are reasonable and such as in their nature must embarrass the treaty alarm england and destroy the hopes of an union but this i must say it is just what they are for who wish the treaty broke off and it is strange friends and enemies should both hit on the same thing and both propose for such vastly different reasons the same conditions it is to me a too visible discovery of the weakness on one hand and the policy on the other and that is all i shall say to it  i hope the gentlemen concerned here will be too wary to offer any thing too hard for an english parliament to grant and this is the thing with which i shall end this discourse to impose something on the english which it is known will not pass or which circumstances considered can not this would be to come to the union but not with the spirit of union  i frankly own i see no disposition in the scots nation to do so and hope i shall not be construed to suggest it in this case i have too much respect for the scots nation to imagine such a thing  but i must own i believe that very thing is the top of the partypoliticks now on foot in england against the scots nation and against the union in general to bring scotland if possible to insist upon something which they know england cannot grant and for this reason we have all their books against the union crowded with queries about guarantees securities separate parliaments partial and imperfect unions and the like  i acknowledge my self convinced that the union is the general safety of britain that it is the particular advantage of either nation and if i was to be asked whether nation have greater advantages from it i profess my self nncapable of giving a direct answer on this head it is that i discourse i am persuaded mutual security mutual improvement and mutual prosperity attends it on both sides  but there must be also mutual confidences and mutual affections or it is impossible to unite jealousies feuds and suspicions will rob the nations of the fruit even of the union it self there cannot be a flux of profitable trade an easy free and uninterrupted conjunction in circumstances and families a coallition of stocks undertakings and improvements is national prejudices are not removed  if a new seal be made or a new armorial ensign for britain directed i wish the motto might be we are brethren and the text will add the rest genesis      let there be no strife between us  let firm articles complete establishments and full caluses form the union and the faster the better but let us not treat with embarrassing suspicions politic jealousies and uncharitable cenforious apprehensions of one another especially where the very nature of things helps to make them safe and where both nations seem to mean nothing but what is sincere  i confess when i consider this i wonder to see some libels and pamphlets appear here in which they grant a nearer union of the kingdoms necessary for their mutual service and yet endeavor all along to foment jealousies between the nations particularly that england shall oppress scotland after the league is concluded and that she will not perform the conditions  nay one gentleman forgets himself so far as to tell you very positively if you agree for an equivalent state of the controversy p    the english will not pay you the money and the reason he gives for it is this  it is incident to the nature of man not to perform bargains or pay their debts unless they are compelled to it and if not private men far less societys  in english this is saying all men are born knaves and cheats and when in societys they grow worse than they were before and that the english are rogues and not to be trusted with the money  this is very unkind gentlemen and very severe language and were not the government in england much more moderate than your humble servant once found them i wonder that gentleman is not yet taught better manners if this book be as public there as it is here  but the principle on which these gentlemen go is not to be wondered at since they so plainly discover their aim to be that you should trust any body rather than england  and least what i mean should be hard to guess at the same gentleman explains it for me when having first told you england is not to be trusted nor can give you any security he proceeds to tell you who can p    speaking of england not making the scots suitable returns and their seeking some where else he adds  this they can easily do either by public treaties or private bargains with their neighbors   how sir private bargains with neighbors how can this be  it is incident to the nature of man that neither private men far less societies will perform their bargains state of the contro p     is not this a partiallity intolerable and can i be censured for saying the plain meaning of this is the english are knaves and will keep no bargain with you but the french are honest fellows and you may make a bargain with them  to carry on this rudeness farther upon england he explains himself  if any man does believe that     men who have no power to answer to will compel themselves to pay a great sum of money  he has more faith than experience or judgment  this is not only scurrilous and indecent but so contrary to truth and experience that i could fill this tract with precedents in the very parliament of england which are the people he reproaches how they have retrivd and supported the public faith and established the credit of parliaments in paying great sums of money which they were under no parliamentary obligation to pay and which they went no farther for than to examine the justice of the demand in general not their own particular engagement and let any man examine the payment and debentures to the army in ireland to the transport service the deficiencies of tallies on former funds and above all the payment of  00000 l to the dutch for so much advanced on the expedition of the prince of orange which no parliament was ever engaged for  these are the men that by this book are born knaves will keep no bargains pay no debts and consequently are not fit to be trusted  i leave all honest men to judge whether there is not reason to persuade men to come with a spirit of union and confidence to a treaty of this nature and whether these sort of writers do not while they pretend to object against the particulars of the union really drive at having no union at all  i shall descend but to one more head of this learned authors discourse having not room for it here and that is a most wonderful new invented system of politics set down in his  th p the last paragraph viz  by the constitution of parliaments the laws are to have their rise from the will and humor of the people signified by the lords and commons   this is a suggestion deserves some mirth were not the subject too serious and i should be glad to see that gentleman or some body for him show me by what part of the constitution he will prove such a suggestion  then he says this humor of the people is signified by the lords and commons by which he gives the lords and commons a great deal of honor that their business is only to signify the will and humor of the people  i hope their lordships know their parliamentary dignity and the commons their office better than this gentleman and so i take no notice of that but i hint it upon this score for it is in it self too ridiculous to deserve any note that the humors of the people tho not the rise of laws ought not to be raised by any indiscretions against the laws and that to possess their minds with greater dangers and greater apprehensions than are justly before them cannot consist with the care of their quiet any more than with the public good  the third and fourth heads viz civil government and sovereignty remain which i cannot enter upon here this tract having run further on than i expected if it may be to the public service to treat further on the subject they may be spoken to by themselves when the objections of these popular authors against the possibility and security of a civil coallition may meet with some reply and perhaps there may not appear such weight in them as some people imagine  these things i humbly recomend to the scots nation to consider of i acknowledge as a stranger it may be objected why i engage in this matter but as i have always professed a more than common regard to this nation and am not come hither without some thought of settling amongst them on the foot of trade and improvement especially if the union follow this treaty so i have presumed with all the calmness and respect i can to recommend impartially not the imaginary but the real advantages and securities of this union and i should be very sorry if any person should mistake me  nor am i afraid of being suspected here the treatment i have met with from parties and power in my native country i think will secure me from the scandal of being an emissary to a party i have no interest to pursue no gain to make no party to serve i seek no advantages from the union other than in common with my native country i contemn the suggestion as i scorn the employment of an emissary a spy or a mercenary my bussiness is known here which tending to trade settlement and general improvement i never purposed to meddle in this affair and i hope i have done it so as can give no offense to any  and as i take this occasion to speak of my own design of settling in this kingdom i desire to speak one word to the citizens of edinburgh i know it is suggested that this union shall prejudice this city as it shall prevent the concourse of your nobility and gentry and consequently the trade of the city  i have observed that in all the books railling pamphlets and voluminous arguments against the union not one has ever yet spoke a word about your trade but all allow you shall be prodigious gainers there  shall you then lose something of the concourse of your gentry here tho i do not grant that neither be not concerned you will gain it ten fold in the concourse of strangers not this authors family only but hundreds of familys in england have their eyes this way to engage in your commerce embark their stocks in your trade manufactures and fishing increase your shipping and improve your lands  it is impossible but your city must increase the commodiousness of your harbor for shipping qualify this city only to be the metropolis of this kingdom in trade as well as the capital for resort and who ever lives  0 years here will see you increase in wealth and people and in spite of an unhappy situation increase in buildings too  trade will and must bring inhabitants and edinburgh and leith will certainly be one city in a few years  trades men must be sensible of this and it is plain to the meanest capacity a fleet of ships in your road and constant import and export will bring another sort of concourse to the city than ten parliaments and it is too plain to need examination  you will then fall to importing naval stores building of ships exporting your own growth and importing foreign goods and how many familys will immediately follow such employments  the citizens and common people of edinburgh have therefore the greatest cause in the world to wish for this union as the only way to redeem them from the poverty and misery the present want of trade has reduced them to  finis
