pamela or virtue rewarded in a series of familiar letters from a beautiful young damsel to her parents and afterward in her exalted condition between her and persons of figure and quality upon the most important and entertaining subjects in genteel life  the third and fourth volumes  published in order to cultivate the principles of virtue and religion in the minds of the youth of both sexes  by the editor of the two first  vol iii  london printed for s richardson and sold by c rivington in st pauls churchyard and j osborn in paternoster row  mdccxlii  preface the two former volumes of pamela or virtue rewarded met with a success greatly exceeding the most sanguine expectations and the editor hopes that the letters which compose these will be found equally written to nature avoiding all romantic flights improbable surprises and irrational machinery and that the passions are touched where requisite and rules equally new and practicable inculcated throughout the whole for the general conduct of life and therefore he flatters himself that they may expect the good fortune which few continuations have met with to be judged not unworthy the first nor disproportioned to the more exalted condition in which pamela was destined to shine as an affectionate wife a faithful friend a polite and kind neighbor an indulgent mother and a beneficent mistress after having in the two former volumes supported the character of a dutiful child a spotless virgin and a modest and amiable bride  the reader will easily see that in so great a choice of materials as must arise from a multitude of important subjects in a married life to such geniuss and friendships as those of mr and mrs b the editors greatest difficulty was how to bring them within the compass which he was determined not to exceed and it having been left to his own choice in what manner to digest and publish the letters and where to close the work he had intended at first in regard to his other avocations end some designs of another nature in which he was engaged to have carried the piece no farther than the two former volumes as may be gathed from the conclusion of the firstfive editions  it may be expected therefore that he should enter into an explanation of the reasons whereby he was provoked into a necessity of altering his intention but he is willing to decline saying anything upon so wellknown a subject lest his interest might appear more concerned than the satisfaction of the public  the editor has been much pressed with importunities and conjectures in relation to the person and family of the incomparable lady who is the subject of these volumes all that he thinks himself at liberty to say or is necessary to be said is only to repeat what has been already hinted that the story has its foundation in truth that the most material incidents as will be collected from several passages in the letters happened between the years      and    0 and that there was a necessity for obvious reasons to vary and disguise some facts and circumstances as also the names of persons places etc  errata vol iii p   l    dele it p  0 l    dele not  pamela or virtue rewarded in a series of familiar letters vol iii letter i my dear father and mother we arrived here last night highly pleased with our journey and the occasion of it may god bless you both with long life and health to enjoy your sweet farm and pretty dwelling which is just what i wished it to be and dont make your grateful hearts too uneasy in the possession of it by your modest diffidence of your own worthiness for at the same time that it is what will do honor to the best of gentlemen it is not so very extraordinary considering his condition as that it will give any one cause to censure it as the effect of a too partial and injudicious kindness for the parents of one whom he delights to honor  my dear master why should i not still call him so bound to reverence him as i am in every light that he can shine in to the most obliged and sensible heart holds his kind purpose of fitting up the large parlour and three apartments in the commodious dwelling he calls yours for his entertainment and mine when he shall permit me to pay my duty to you both for a few happy days together and he has actually given orders for that purpose and that the three apartments be so fitted up as to be rather suitable to your condition than his own for he says the plain simple elegance which he will have to be observed in the rooms as well as the furniture will be a variety in his retirement to this place that will make him return to his own with the greater pleasure and at the same time when we are not there will be of use for the reception of any of your friends and so he shall not as he kindly says rob the good couple of any of their accommodations  the old bowwindows he will have preserved but will not have them sashd nor the woodbinds jessamines and vines that run up against them destroyed only he will have larger panes of glass and convenienter casements to let in more of the sweet air and light to make amends for that obstructed by the shades of those fragrant climbers for he has mentioned three or four times how gratefully they dispensed their intermingled odours to us when the last evening we stood at the window in our bedchamber to hear the responsive songs of two warbling nightingales one at a distance the other near which took up our delighted attention for above two hours and charmed us the more as we thought their season had been over and when they had done he made me sing him one and called me for it the sweetest of all nightingales saying how greatly do the innocent pleasures i now hourly taste exceed the guilty tumults that used formerly to agitate my unequal mind never talk my pamela as you frequently do of obligation to me one such hour as i now enjoy is an ample reward for all the benefits i can confer on you and yours in my whole life  the parlour indeed will be more elegant though that is to be rather plain than rich as well in its wainscot as furniture and to be new floord the dear gentleman has already given orders about it and you will soon have workmen with you to put them in execution the parlour doors are to have brass hinges and locks and to shut as close he tells them as a watchcase for who knows said he my dear but we shall have still added blessings in two or three charming boys and girls to place there in their infancy before they can be of age to be benefited by your lessons and example and besides i make no doubt but i shall entertain there some of my chosen friends in their excursions for a day or so  how am i every hour of my life overwhelmed with instances of god almightys goodness and his  o spare blessed father of mercies the precious life of this excellent gentleman and increase my thankfulness and my worthiness and then  but what shall i say  only that then i may continue to be what i am for more blessed and more happy in my own mind surely i cannot be  the beds he will have of cloth because he thinks the situation a little cold especially when the wind is easterly and because he purposes to be down in the early spring season nowandthen as well as in the latter autumn and the window curtains of the same in one room red in the other green but plain lest you should be afraid to use them occasionally the carpets for them will come down with the other furniture for he will nor alter the old oaken floors of the bedchamber nor yet of the little room he intends for my use to withdraw to when i choose not to join in such company as may happen to fall in which my dear says he shall be as little as is possible only particular friends who may be disposed once in a year or two to see when i am there how i live with my pamela and her parents and how i pass my time in my retirement as i shall call this for otherwise perhaps they will be apt to think i am ashamed of company i shall always be pleased with  nor are you my dear continued he to take this as a compliment to yourself but a piece of requisite policy in me for who will offer to reproach me for marrying as the world thinks below me when they shall see that such a reproach as they would intend it is so far from being so to me that every day of my life i not only pride myself in my pamela but take pleasure in owning her relations as mine and visiting them and receiving visits from them and yet offer not to set them up in such a glaring light as if i would have the world forget who in that case would always take the more pleasure in remembering what they were and how will it anticipate low reflection when they shall see i can bend my mind to partake with them the pleasures of their humble but decent life  ay continued he and be rewarded for it too with better health better spirits and a better mind so that my dear added he i shall reap more benefit by what i propose to do than i shall confer  in this generous manner does this best of gentlemen endeavor to disclaim though i must be very ungrateful if with me it did not inhance the proper merit of a beneficence that is natural to him and which indeed as i tell him may be in one respect depreciated inasmuch as so excellent is his nature he cannot help it if he would  o that it was in my power to recompense him for it but i am poor as i have often said in every thing but will  and that is wholly his  and what a happiness is it to me a happiness i could not so early have hoped for that i can say so without reserve since the dear gentleman requires nothing of me but what is consistent with my duty to the supreme benefactor the first mover and cause of all his own happiness of my happiness and of that of my dear my ever dear parents  but whither does the enchanting subject lead me i am running on to my usual length though i have not the same excuse for it for heretofore i had nothing to do but to write yet i am sure if i do exceed a little you will be pleased with it and you have moreover a right to rejoice with me in the days of my felicity after your indulgent hearts had been so much pained by a long succession of my fears and my dangers which only ought to be remembered now as subjects of thankful exultation by  your dutiful and happy daughter  letter ii my dearest daughter i need not repeat to you the sense your good mother and i have of our happiness and of our obligations to your honored spouse you both were pleased witnesses of it every hour of the happy fortnight you passed with us but still my dear we hardly know how to address ourselves even to you much less to the squire with the freedom he so often invited us to take for i dont know how it is but though you are our daughter and are so far from being lifted up by your high condition that we see no difference in your behavior to us your poor parents yet when we look upon you as the lady of so fine a gentleman we cannot forbear having a kind of respect and  i dont know what to call it  that lays a little restraint upon us and yet we would not methinks let our minds be run away with the admiration of worldly grandeur so as to set too much by it  but your merit and your prudence my dear daughter is so much above all we could ever have any notion of it  and to have gentry come only to behold you and admire you not so much for your genteelness and amiableness neither as for your behavior and your affability to poor as well as rich and to hear every one calling you an angel and saying you deserve to be what you are makes us hardly know how to look upon you but as an angel indeed i am sure you have been a good angel to us  since for your sake god almighty has put it into your honored husbands heart to make us the happiest couple in the world but little less indeed we should have been had we only in some far distant land heard of our dear childs happiness and never partaken of the benefits of it ourselves but thus to be provided for  thus kindly to be owned and called father and mother by such a brave gentleman and thus to be placed that we have nothing to do but to bless god and bless him and bless you and hourly pray for you both is such a providence my dear child as is too mighty to be borne by us with equalness of temper and we kneel together every morning noon and night and weep and rejoice and rejoice and weep to think how our unworthiness is distinguished and how god has provided for us in our latter days when all we had to fear was that as we grew older and more infirm and worn out by hard labor we should be troublesome where not our pride but our industrious wills would have made us wish not to be so  but to be entitled to a happier lot for this would have grieved us the more for the sake of you my dear child and your unhappy brothers children for it is well known that though we pretend not to boast of our family and indeed had no reason yet none of us were ever sunk so low as i was  to be sure partly by my own fault for had it been for your poor aged mothers sake only i ought not to have done what i did for john and william for so unhappy were they poor lads that what i could do was but as a drop of water to a bucket  but yet the issue has shown that if i may presume to say so what i did was not displeasing to god inasmuch as i have the comfort to see that my reliance on him while i was doing what though some thought imprudent things yet not wrong things is so abundantly rewarded beyond expectation and desert blessed be his holy name for it  you command me  let me as writing to mr bs lady say command though as to my dear daughter i will only say desire and indeed i will not as you wished me not to do let the one condition which was accidental put the other which was natural out of my thought you spoke it in better words but this was the sense  but you have the gift of utterance and education is a fine thing where it meets with such talents to improve upon as god has given you  but let me not forget what i was going to say  you command  or if you please  you desire me to write long letters and often  and how can i help it if i would for when here in this happy dwelling and this wellstockd farm in these rich meadows and wellcropt acres we look around us and which way soever we turn our heads see blessings upon blessings and plenty upon plenty see barns wellstord poultry increasing the kine lowing and crouding about us and all fruitful and are bid to call all these our own  and then think that all is the reward of our childs virtue  o my dear daughter who can bear these things  excuse me  i must break off a little for my eyes are as full as my heart and i will retire to bless god and your honored husband  so  my dear child  i now again take up my pen  but reading what i had written in order to carry on the thread i can hardly forbear again being in like sort affected  but do you think i will call all these things my own  do you think i will live rentfree  do you think i would can the honored squire believe that having such a generous example before me if i had no gratitude in my temper before i could help being touched by such an one as he sets me  if his goodness makes him know no mean in giving shall i be so greedy as to know none in receiving  come come my dear child your poor father is not so sordid a wretch neither he will show the world that all these benefits are not thrown away upon one who will disgrace you as much by his temper as by his condition what though i cannot be as worthy of all these favors as i wish i will be as worthy as i can and let me tell you my dear child if the king and his royal family god bless em be not ashamed to receive taxes and duties from his subjects if dukes and earls and all the top gentry cannot support their bravery without having their rents paid i hope i shall not affront the squire to pay to his steward what any other person would pay for this noble stock and improving farm and i will do it an it please god to bless me with life and health  i should not be worthy to crawl on the earth if i did not and what did i say to mr longman the faithful mr longman sure no gentleman had ever a more worthy steward than he it was as we were walking over the grounds together  and observing in what good order every thing was he was praising some little contrivances of my own for the improvement of the farm and saying how comfortably he hoped we might live upon it ay mr longman said i comfortably indeed but do you think i could be properly said to live if i was not to pay as much rent for it as another  i can tell you said he the squire will not receive any thing from you goodman andrews  why man he has no occasion for it he is worth a power of money besides a noble and clear estate in land  adsheartlikins you must not affront him i can tell you that for he is as generous as a prince where he takes but he is hasty and will have his own way  why for that reason mr longman said i i was thinking to make you my friend  make me your friend you have not a better in the world to my power i can tell you that nor your dame neither for i love such honest hearts i wish my own brother would let me love him as well but let that pass  what i can do for you i will and here is my hand upon it  well then said i it is this let me account to you at the rent farmer dickins offered and let me know what the stock cost and what the crops are valued at and pay the one as i can and the other quarterly and not let the squire know it till you cannot choose and i shall be as happy as a prince for i doubt not by gods blessing to make a comfortable livelihood of it besides  why do believe goodman andrews said he i would do such a thing  would not his honor think if i hid one thing from him i might not hide another  go to go to honest heart i love thee dearly but can the squire do too much for his lady think thou come come and he jeered me so i could not tell what to say to him i wish at bottom there is not some pride in this  what i warrant you would not be too much beholden to his honor would you  no good mr longman said i  it is not that i am sure if i have any pride it is only in my dear child  to whom under god all this is owing  but some how or other it shall be so  and so my dear daughter i resolve it shall and it will be over and above one of the greatest pleasures to me to do the good squire service as well as to be so much benefited and obliged by him  our eldest grandson thomas is very desirous to come and live with us the boy is honest and they tell me industrious and cousin buroughs wants me to employ his son roger who understands the business of a farm very well it is no wonder that all ones relations should wish to partake of our happy lot and if they can and will do their business as well as others i see not why relationship should be an objection but yet i think one would not beleaguer as one may say your honored husband with ones relations you my best child will give me always your advice as to my carriage in this my new lot for i would not for the world be thought an incroacher and i am sure you have so much prudence that there is nobodys advice fitter to be followed than yours  our blessings i am sure you have blessed us attend you my dearest child and may you be as happy as you have made us i cannot wish you to be happier because i have no notion how it can be in this life conclude us  your ever loving father and mother john and eliz andrews may we not hope to be favored nowandthen with a letter from you my dear child like some of your former to let us know how you go on it would be a great joy to us indeed it would  but we know you will have enough to do without obliging us in this way so must acquiesce    letter iii my dear father and mother i have showed your letter to my bestbeloved  dont be uneasy that i have  for you need not be ashamed of it since it is my pride to have such honest and grateful parents and i will tell you what he said to it as the best argument i can use why you should not be uneasy but enjoy without pain or anxiety all the benefits of your happy lot  dear good souls said he how does every thing they say and every thing they write manifest the worthiness of their hearts no wonder pamela you love and revere such honest minds for that you would do were they not your parents and tell them that i am so far from having them believe that what i have done for them is only the effect of my affection for their daughter that let em find out another couple as worthy as themselves and i will do as much for them indeed i would not place them continued the dear obliger in the same county because i would wish two counties to be blessed for their sakes tell them my dear that they have a right to what they enjoy on the foot of their own proper merit and bid them enjoy it as their patrimony and if there can any thing arise that is more than they themselves can wish for in the way of life they choose to live let them look round among their own relations where it may be acceptable and communicate to them the like solid reasons for rejoicing in the situation they are pleased with and do you my dear continued he still further enable them as you shall judge proper to gratify their enlarged hearts for fear they should deny any comfort to themselves in order to do good to others  i could only fly to his generous bosom for this is a subject which most affects me and with my eyes swimming in tears of grateful joy and which overflowed as soon as my bold lips touched his dear face bless god and him with my whole heart for speak i could not  but almost choked with my joy sobbd to him my grateful acknowledgment  he clasped me in his arms and said how my dearest do you overpay me for the little i have done for your parents if it be thus to be blessed for conferring benefits so insignificant to a man of my fortune what joys is it not in the power of rich men to give themselves whenever they please  foretastes indeed of those we are bid to hope for which can surely only exceed these as then we shall be all intellect and better fitted to receive them  it is too much  too much said i in broken accents  how am i oppressed with the pleasure you give me  oh sir  bless me more gradually and more cautiously  for i cannot bear it and indeed my heart went flutter flutter flutter at his dear breast as if it wanted to break its too narrow prison to mingle still more intimately with his own  surely surely my dear my beloved parents nobodys happiness is so great as mine  if it proceeds thus from degree to degree and is to be augmented by the hope the charming hope that the dear second author of your blessings and mine be the uniformly good as well as the partially kind man to us what a felicity will this be and if our prayers shall be heard and we shall have the pleasure to think that his advances in piety are owing not a little to them and to the example god shall give us grace to set then indeed may we take the pride to think we have repaid his goodness to us and that we have satisfied the debt which nothing less can discharge  thus then do i set before you imperfectly as i am forced to do the delight your grateful your honest hearts give us i say imperfectly and well i may for i might as easily paint sound as describe the noble the sublime pleasures that wind up my affections to even a painful height of rapture on such occasions as this and i desire as he often bids me that you will take to yourselves the merit of thus delighting us both and then think with less uneasiness of the obligation you are under to the best of friends  and indeed it is but doing justice to his beneficent temper to think that we have given him an opportunity of exercising it in a way so agreeable to it and i can tell by the ardour of his speech by the additional luster that it lights up in his eyes naturally so lively and by the virtuous endearments refined on these occasions above what sense can know that he has a pleasure a joy a transport in doing what he does of this sort that is its own reward as every virtuous and noble action must be to a mind that can be delighted with virtue for its own sake and can find itself enlarged by the power of doing good to worthy objects even i my dear parents know this by experience when i can be an humble means to make an honest creature happy though not related to myself and yet i am but a thirdhand dispenser as i have see vol ii p     elsewhere said of these comforts and all the light i can communicate as i once before observed see vol ii p      like that of the moon is but borrowed from his sunny radiance  forgive me my dear my worthy parents if my style on this subject be raised above that natural simplicity which is more suited to my humble talents but how can i help it for when the mind is elevated ought not the sense we have of our happiness to make our expressions soar equally can the affections be so highly raised as mine are on these occasions and the thoughts creep grovelling like ones ordinary self no indeed  call not this therefore the gift of utterance if it should appear to you in a better light than it deserves it is the gift of gratitude a gift which makes you and me too speak and write as i hope it will make us act above ourselves  and thus will our gratitude be the inspirer of joy to our common benefactor and his joy will heighten our gratitude and so we shall proceed as cause and effect to each others happiness to bless the dear gentleman that blesses us  and will it be right then to say you are so uneasy under such at least as to your wills returned and discharged obligations god almighty requires only a thankful heart for all the mercies he heaps upon the children of men my dear mr b who in these particulars imitates divinity desires no more  you have this thankful heart  yes you have and that to such a high degree of gratitude that nobody can exceed you  but yet my dear parents when your worthy minds would be too much affected with your gratitude so as to lay you under the restraints you mention to the dear gentleman and for his sake to your dependent daughter then let me humbly advise you that you will at such times with more particular more abstracted aspirations than at others raise your thoughts upwards and consider who it is that gives him the opportunity and pray for him and for me for him that all his future actions may be of a piece with this noble disposition of mind for me that i may continue humble and consider myself blessed for your sakes and in order that i may be in some sort a rewarder in the hands of providence of this its dear excellent agent and then we shall look forward all of us with pleasure indeed to that state where there is no distinction of degree and where the humble cottager shall be upon a par with the proudest monarch  o my dear dear parents how can you as in your postscript say  may we not be favored nowandthen with a letter call me your daughter your pamela  i am no lady to you  i have more pleasure to be called your comfort and to be thought to act worthy of the sentiments with which your examples cautions and instructions have inspired me than in any one thing in this life my determined duty to our common benefactor the best of gentlemen and husbands excepted and i am sure god has blessed me for your sakes and has thus answered for me all your prayers nay more than answered all you or i could have wished or hoped for we only prayed only hoped that god would preserve you honest and me virtuous and see o see my excellent parents how we are crowned with blessings upon blessings till we are the talk of all that know us  you for your honesty i for my humility and virtue  that virtue which gods grace inspired and your examples and lessons with those of my dear good lady cultivated and which now have left me nothing to do but to reap all the rewards which this life can afford and if i walk humbly and improve my blessed opportunities will heighten and perfect all in a still more joyful futurity   hence my dear parents i mean from the delight i have in writing to you a delight which transports me so much above my own sphere you will see that i must write to you and cannot help it if i would and will it be a great joy to you  and is there any thing that can add to your joy think you that is in the power of your pamela that she would not do  o that the lives and healths of my dearest mr b and my dearest parents may be continued to me and who then can be so blessed as your pamela  i will write depend upon it i will  on every occasion  and you augment my joys to think it is in my power to add to your comforts nor can you conceive the pleasure i have in hoping that this your new happy lot may by relieving you from corroding care and the too wearing effects of hard labor add in these your advanced years to both your days  for so happy am i i can have no grief no pain in looking forward but from such thoughts as remind me that one day either you from me or i from you must be separated  but it is fit that we so comport ourselves as that we should not imbitter our present happiness with prospects too gloomy  but bring our minds to be cheerfully thankful for the present wisely to enjoy that present as we go along  and at last when all is to be wound up lie down and say not mine but thy will be done  but i have written a great deal yet have much still to say relating to other parts of your kind your acceptable letter and so will soon write again for i must think every opportunity happy whereby i can assure you how much i am and will ever be without any addition to my name if that will make you easier  your dutiful pamela  letter iv my dearest father and mother i now write again as i told you i should in my last  but i am half afraid to look back on the copy of it for your worthy hearts so visible in your letter and my best beloveds kind deportment upon showing it to him raised me into a frame of mind that was bordering on ecstasy yet am i sure i wrote my heart but you must not my dear father write to your poor pamela so affectingly your steadier mind could hardly bear your own moving strain and you was forced to lay down your pen and retire how then could i who love you so dearly if you had not if i may so say increased that love by fresh and stronger instances of your worthiness forbear being affected and raised above myself  but i will not again touch upon this subject  you must know then that my dearest spouse commands me with his kind respects to tell you that he has thought of a method to make your worthy hearts easy those were his words  and this is said he by putting that whose estate with the new purchase under your fathers care as i at first intended see vol ii p      and he shall receive and pay and order every thing as he pleases and longman who grows in years shall be eased of that burden your father writes said he a very legible hand and he shall take what assistants he pleases and do you pamela see to that that this new task may be made as easy and pleasant to him as possible he shall make up his accounts only to you my dear and there will be several pleasures arise to me upon it continued he first that it will be a relief to honest longman who has business enough on his hands besides next it will make the good couple easy that they have an opportunity of enjoying that as their due which now their too grateful hearts give them so many causeless scruples about thirdly it will employ your fathers time more suitably to your liking and mine because with more ease to himself for you see his industrious will cannot be satisfied without doing something in the fourth place the management of this estate will gain him more respect and reverence among the tenants and his neighbors and yet be all in his own way  for my dear added he you will see that it is always one point in view with me to endeavor to convince every one that i esteem and value them for their own intrinsic merit and want not any body to distinguish them in any other light than that in which they have been accustomed to appear  so my dear father the instrument will be drawn and brought you by honest mr longman who will be with you in a few days to put the last hand to the new purchase and to give you possession of your new commission if you please to accept it as i hope you will and the rather for my dear mr bs third reason and because i know that this trust will be discharged as worthily and as sufficiently after you are used to it as if mr longman himself was in it  and better it cannot be mr longman is very fond of this relief and longs to be down to settle every thing with you as to the proper powers the method etc  and he says in his usual way of phrasing that he will make it as easy to you as a glove  if you do accept it my best beloved will leave every thing to you as to rent where not already fixed and likewise as to acts of kindness and favor to be done where you think proper and he is pleased to say that with all his bad qualities he was ever deemed a kind landlord and this i can confirm in fifty instances to his honor so that the old gentleman said he need not be afraid of being put upon severe or harsh methods of proceeding where things will do without and he will always have it in his power to befriend an honest man so that the province will be entirely such a one as suits with his inclination if any thing difficult or perplexing arises continued he or where a little knowledge in lawmatters is necessary longman shall do all that and your father will see that he will not have in those points a coadjutor that will be too hardhearted for his wish for it was a rule my father set me and i have strictly followed that though i have a lawyer for my steward it was rather to know how to do right things than oppressive ones and longman has so well answered this intention that he was always more noted for composing differences than promoting lawsuits  i dare say my dear father this will be an acceptable employment to you on the several accounts my dearest mr b was pleased to mention and what a charming contrivance is here  god forever bless his considerate heart for it  to make you useful to him and easy to yourself as well as respected by and even a benefactor to all around you what can one say to all these things  but what signifies exulting in ones gratitude for one benefit  every hour the dear gentleman heaps new ones upon us and we have hardly time to thank him for one but a second and a third and so on to countless degrees confound one and throw back ones words upon ones heart before they are well formed and oblige one to sit down under all with profound silence and admiration  as to what you mention of the desire of cousin thomas and roger to come to live with you i endeavored to sound what our dear benefactors opinion was he was pleased to say i have nothing to choose in this case my dear your father is his own master he may employ whom he pleases and if they are not wanting in respect to him and your mother i think as he rightly observes relationship should rather have the preference and as he can remedy inconveniences if he finds any by all means let every branch of your family have reason to rejoice with him  but i have thought of this matter a good deal since i had the favor of your letter and i hope since you condescend to ask my advice you will excuse me if i give it freely yet entirely submitting all to your own liking  in the first place then i think it would be better to have any body than relations and that for these reasons  one is apt to expect more regard from relations and they more indulgence than strangers can have reason for  that where there is such a difference in the expectations of both it is hardly possible but uneasiness must arise  that this will subject you to bear it or to resent it and to part with them if you bear it you will know no end of impositions if you dismiss them it will cccasion ill will they will call you unkind and you them ungrateful and as it may be your prosperous lot will raise you enviers such will be apt to believe them rather than you  then the world will be inclined to think that we are crouding upon a generous gentleman a numerous family of indigent people and though they may be ever so deserving yet it will be said the girl is filling every place with her relations and beleaguering as you significantly express it a worthy gentleman and this will be said perhaps should ones kindred behave ever so worthily and so  in the next place one would not for their sakes that this should be done who may live with less reproach and equal benefit anywhere else for i would not wish any one of them to be lifted out of his station and made independent at mr bs expense if their industry will not do it although i would never scruple to do any thing reasonable to promote or assist that industry in the way of their callings  then it will possibly put others of our relations upon the same expectations of living with you and this may occasion ill will among them if some be preferred to others in your favor  then my dear father i apprehend that our beloved and honored benefactor would be under some difficulty from his natural politeness and regard for you and me  you see how kindly on all occasions he treats you both not only as the father and mother of his pamela but as if you were his own father and mother and if you had any body as your servants there who called you cousin or grandfather or uncle he would not care when he came down to treat them on the foot of common servants though they might nevertheless think themselves honored as they would be and as i am sure i shall always think myself with his commands and would it not if they are modest and worthy be as great a difficulty upon them to be thus distinguished as it would be to him and to me for his sake for otherwise believe me i hope you will my dear father and mother i could sit down and rejoice with the meanest and remotest relation i have but in the worlds eye to every body but my best of parents i must if i have ever so much reluctance to it appear in a light that may not give discredit to his choice  then again as i hinted you will have it in your power without the least injury to our common benefactor to do kinder things by any of our relations when not with you than you can do if they live with you  you may lend them a little money to put them in a way if any thing offers that you think will be to their advantage you can fit out my shecousins to good reputable places  the younger you can put to school or when fit to trades according to their talents and so they will be of course in a way to get an honest and creditable livelihood  but above all things one would as much discourage as one could such a proud and ambitious spirit in any of them as should want to raze itself by favor instead of merit and this the rather for that undoubtedly there are many more happy persons in low than in high life take number for number all the world over  i am sure although four or five years of different life had passed with me i had so much pride and pleasure in the thought of working for my living with you my dear parents if i could but get honest to you that it made my confinement the more grievous to me and even if possible aggravated the apprehensions attending it  but i must beg of you not to harbor a thought that these my reasons proceed from the bad motives of a heart tainted with pride on its high condition indeed there can be no reason for it to one who thinks after this manner  the greatest families on earth have some among them who are unhappy and low in life and shall such an one reproach me with having twenty low relations because they have peradventure not above five or with ten because they have but one or two or three  or should i on the other hand be ashamed of relations who had done nothing blameworthy and whose poverty a very necessary state in the scale of beings was all their crime when there is hardly any great family but has produced instances of persons guilty of bad actions really bad which have reduced them to a distress we never knew let the person who would reproach me with low birth which is no disgrace and what i cannot help give me no cause to retort upon him low actions which are a disgrace to any station the more so the higher it is and which he can help or else i shall smile with contempt at his empty reproach and could i be half so proud with cause as he is without glory in my advantage over him  let us then my dear father and mother endeavor to judge of one another as god at the last day will judge of us all and then the honest peasant will stand fairer in our esteem than the guilty peer  in short this shall be my own rule  every one who acts justly and honestly i will look upon as my relation whether he be so or not and the more he want my assistance the more entitled to it he shall be as well as to my esteem while those who deserve it not must expect nothing but compassion from me and my prayers were they my brothers or sisters it is true had i not been poor and lowly i might not have thought thus but if it be a right way of thinking it is a blessing that i was so and that shall never be matter of reproach to me which one day will be matter of justification  upon the whole then i should think it advisable my dear father and mother to make such kind excuses to the offered services of my cousins as your better reason shall suggest to you and to do any thing else for them of more value as their circumstances may require or occasions offer to serve them  but if the employing them and having them about you will add any one comfort to your lives i give up entirely my own opinion and doubt not every thing will be thought well of that you shall think fit to do  and so i conclude with assuring you that i am my everdear parents  your dutiful and happy daughter the copy of this letter i will keep to myself till i have your answer to it that you may be under no difficulty how to act in either of the cases mentioned in it    letter v my dearest daughter how shall i do to answer as they deserve your two last letters surely no happy couple ever had such a child as we have but it is in vain to aim at words like your words and equally in vain for us to offer to set forth the thankfulness of our hearts on the kind office your honored husband has given us for no reason but to favor us still more and to quiet our minds in the notion of being useful to him god grant i may be able to be so  happy shall i be if i can but i see the generous drift of his proposal it is only to make me more easy from the nature of my employment and in my mind too overloaden as i may say with benefits and at the same time to make me more respected in my new neighborhood  i can only say i most gratefully accept of the kind offer and since it will ease the worthy mr longman shall with still greater pleasure do all i can in it but i doubt i shall be wanting in ability i doubt i shall but i will be just and honest however that by gods grace will be within my own capacity and that i hope i may answer for  it is kind indeed to put it in my power to do good to those who shall deserve it and i will take double pains to find out the true merit of such as i shall recommend to favor and that their circumstances be really such as i shall represent them  but one thing my dear daughter let me desire that i may make up my accounts to mr longman or to his honor himself when he shall make us so happy as to be here with us i dont know how  but it will make me uneasy if i am to make up my accounts to you for so well known is your love to us that though you would no more do an unjust thing than by gods grace we should desire you yet this same illwilling world might think it was like making up accounts to ones self  do my dearest child get me off of this difficulty and i can have no other for already i am in hopes i have hit upon a contrivance to improve the estate and to better the condition of the tenants at the same time at least not to worst them and which i hope will please every body but i will acquaint mr longman with this and take his advice for i will not be too troublesome either to you my dear child or to your spouse  if i could act so for his interest as not to be a burden what happy creatures should we both be in our own minds we find ourselves more and more respected by every one and so far as shall be consistent with our new trust we will endeavor to deserve it that we may interest as many as know us in our own good wishes and prayers for both your happiness  but let me say how much convinced i am by the reasons you give for not taking to us any of our relations every one of those reasons has its force with us how happy are we to have so prudent a daughter to advise with and i think myself obliged to promise this that whatever i do for any of them above the amount of forty shillings at one time i will take your direction in it that your wise hints of making every one continue their industry and not to rely upon favor instead of merit may be followed i am sure this is the way to make them happier as well as better men and women for as i have often thought if one were to have a hundred pounds a year in good comingsin it would not do without industry and with it one may do with a quarter of it and less  in short my dear child your reasons are so good that i wonder they came not into my head before and then i needed not to have troubled you about the matter but yet it ran in my own thought that i could not like to be an incroacher  for i hate a dirty thing and in the midst of my distresses never could be guilty of one thank god for it  you rejoice our hearts beyond expression at the hope you give us of receiving letters from you nowandthen to be sure it will be the chief comfort of our lives next to seeing you as we are put in hope we sometimes shall but yet my dear child dont let us put you to inconvenience neither pray dont you will have enough upon your hands without  to be sure you will  the workmen have made a good progress and wish for mr longman to come down as we also do  you need not be afraid we should think you proud or lifted up with your condition you have weathered the first dangers and but for your fine clothes and jewels we should not see any difference indeed we should not between our dear pamela and the muchrespected mrs b  but god has given you too much sense to be proud or lifted up i remember in your former writings a saying of the squires speaking of you my dear child that it was for persons who were not used to praise and did not deserve it to be proud of it see vol ii p     in like sort one may say it is for persons of little sense to be proud but you my dear child every one sees are above it and that methinks is a proud word is it not if one was not  i dont know how  halfstupid i believe  one would be raised by your high style of writing but i should be more than halfstupid i am sure to aim at it  every day brings us instances of the good name his honor and you my dear child have left behind you in this country here comes one and here comes another and a third and a fourth and goodman andrew cries one and goody andrews cries another  and some call us mr and mrs but we like the other full as well when heard you from his honor how does his lady do  what a charming couple are they and how lovingly they live  what an example do they give to all about them  then one cries god bless em both and another cries amen and so says a third and a fourth and all say but when do you expect them down again and suchaone longs to see em and and suchaone will ride a days journey to have but a sight of em at church and and then they say how this gentleman praises them and that lady admires them and o my dear child what a happiness is this how do your poor mother and i stand fixed to the earth to hear both your praises our tears trickling down our cheeks and our hearts heaving as if they would burst with joy till we are forced to take leave in half words and handinhand go in together to bless god and bless you both  o my daughter what a happy couple have god and you made us  your poor mother is very anxious about her dear child i will not touch upon a matter so very irksome to you to hear of but though the time may be some months off she every hour prays for your safety and happiness and for all the increase of felicity that his honors generous heart can wish for this is all we will say at present only that we are with continued prayers and blessings my dearest child  your loving father and mother j and e andrews yet one word more and and that is and our duty to your honored husband we must say so now though he forbad us so often before you cannot my dear child imagine how i was ashamed to have my poor letter shown to him i hardly remember what i wrote but it was from my heart i am sure so i needed not to keep a copy for an honest mind must always be the same in cases that cannot admit of change such as those of my thankfulness to god and to him but dont show him all i write for i shall be afraid of what i say if i think any body but our daughter sees it who knows how to allow for her poor parents defects    letter vi from lady davers to mrs b my dear pamela i had intended to have been with you before this but my lord has been a little indisposed with the gout and jackey too has had an intermittent fever but they are pretty well recovered and it shall not be long before i see you now i understand you are returned from your kentish expedition  we have been exceedingly diverted with your papers you have given us by their means many a delightful hour that otherwise would have hung heavy upon us and we are all charmed with you lady betty as well as her noble mamma has always been of our party whenever we have read your accounts she is a dear generous lady and has shed many a tear over them as indeed we all have and my lord has not been unmoved nor jackey neither at some of your distresses and reflections indeed pamela you are a charming creature and an ornament to our sex we wanted to have had you among us an hundred times as we read that we might have loved and kissed and thanked you  but after all my brother generous and noble as he was when your trials were over was a strange wicked young fellow and happy it was for you both that he was so cleverly caught in the trap he had laid for your virtue  i can assure you my lord longs to see you and will accompany me for he says he has but a faint idea of your person i tell him and tell them all that you are the finest girl and the most improved in person and mind i ever beheld and i am nor afraid although they should imagine all they can in your favor from my account of you that they will be disappointed when they see you and converse with you but one thing more you must do for us and then we will love you still more and that is you must send us the rest of your papers down to your marriage at least and further if you have written further for we all long to see the rest as you relate it though we know in general what has passed  you leave off see vol ii p    and     with an account of an angry letter i wrote to my brother to persuade him to give you your liberty and a sum of money not doubting but his designs would end in your ruin and i own it not wishing he would marry you for little did i know of your merit and excellence nor could i but for your letters so lately sent me have had any notion of either  i dont question but if you have recited my passionate behavior to you when i was at the hall i shall make a ridiculous figure enough but i will forgive all that for the sake of the pleasure you have given me and will still further give me if you comply with my request  lady betty says it is the best story she has heard and the most instructive and she longs to have the conclusion of it in your own words she says nowandthen what a hopeful brother you have lady davers  o these intriguing gentlemen  what rogueries do they not commit i should have had a fine husband of him had i received your proposal the dear pamela would have run in his head and had i been the first lady in the kingdom i should have stood but a poor chance in his esteem for you see his designs upon her began see vol i p    l  0 early  she says you had a good heart to go back again to him when the violent wretch had driven you from him on such a slight occasion but yet she thinks the reasons you give see vol ii p    in your relation and your love for him which then you began to discover was your case as well as the event showed you did right  but well tell you all our judgments when we have read the rest of your accounts so pray send them as soon as you can to i will not write myself sister till then  your affectionate etc davers  letter vii my dear good lady you have done me great honor in the letter your ladyship has been pleased to send me and it is a high pleasure to me now all is so happily over that my poor papers were in the least diverting to you and to such honorable and worthy persons as your ladyship is pleased to mention i could wish my dear lady i might be favored with such remarks on my conduct so nakedly set forth without any imagination that they would ever appear in such an assembly as may be of use to me in my future life and make me by that means more worthy than it is otherwise possible i can be of the honor to which i am raised do dearest lady favor me so far i am prepared to receive blame and to benefit by it and cannot expect praise so much from my actions as from my intentions for indeed these were always just and honorable but why even for these do i talk of praise since being prompted by impulses i could not resist it can be no merit in me to have been governed by them  as to the papers following those in your ladyships hands when i say that they must needs appear impertinent to such judges after what you know i dare say your ladyship will not insist upon them yet i will not scruple briefly to mention what they contain  all my dangers and trials were happily at an end so that they only contain the conversations that passed between your ladyships generous brother and me his kind assurances of honorable love to me my acknowledgments of unworthiness to him mrs jewkess respectful change of behavior toward me mr bs reconciliation to mr williams his introducing me to the good families in the neighborhood and avowing before them his honorable intentions a visit from my honest father who not knowing what to conclude from the letter i wrote to him before i returned to your honored brother desiring my papers from him came in great anxiety of heart to know the worst doubting i had at last been caught by a stratagem that had ended in my ruin his joyful surprise to find how happy i was likely to be all the hopes given me answered by the private celebration of our nuptials  an honor so much above all that my utmost ambition could make me aspire to and which i never can deserve your ladyships arrival and anger not knowing i was actually married but supposing me a vile wicked creature in which case i should have deserved the worst of usage mr bs angry lessons to me for daring to interfere though i thought in the tenderest and most dutiful manner between your ladyship and himself the most acceptable goodness and favor of your ladyship afterward to me of which as becomes me i shall ever retain the most grateful sense my return to this sweet mansion in a manner so different from my quitting it where i had been so happy for four years in paying my duty to the best of mistresses your ladyships excellent mother to whose goodness in taking me from my poor honest parents and giving me what education i have i owe under god my happiness the joy of good mrs jervis mr longman and all the servants on this occasion mr bs acquainting me with miss godfreys affair and presenting to me the pretty miss goodwin at the dairyhouse our appearance at church the favor of the gentry in the neighborhood who knowing your ladyship had not disdained to look upon me and to be favorable to me came the more readily into a neighbourly intimacy with me and still so much the more readily as the continued kindness of my dear benefactor and his condesending deportment to me before them as if i had been worthy of the honor done me did credit to his own generous act  these my lady down to my good parents setting out to this place in order to be settled by my honored benefectors bounty in the kentish farm are the most material contents of my remaining papers and though they might be the most agreeable to those for whom only they were written yet as they were principally matters of course after what your ladyship has with you as the joy of my fond heart can be better judged of by your ladyship than described by me and as your ladyship is acquainted with all the particulars the can be worthy of any other persons notice but my dear parents i am sure your ladyship will dispense with your commands and i make it my humble request that you will  for madam you must needs think that when my doubts were dispelled when i was confident all my trials were over when i had a prospect before me of being so abundantly rewarded for what i had suffered when every hour rose upon me with new delight and fraught with fresh instances of generous kindness from such a dear gentleman my master my benefactor the son of my honored lady your ladyship must needs think i say that i must be too much affected my heart must be too much opened and especially as it then relieved from its past anxieties and fears which had kept down and damped the latent flame first discovered to me impressions of which before i hardly thought it susceptible  so that it is scarce possible that my joy and my prudence if i were to be tried by such judges of delicacy and decorum as lord and lady davers the honored countess and lady betty could be so intimately so laudably coupled as were to be wished although indeed the continued sense of my unworthiness and the disgrace the dear gentleman would bring upon himself by his generous goodness to me always went handinhand with that my joy and my prudence and what these considerations took from the former being added to the latter kept me steadier and more equal to myself than otherwise it was possible such a young creature as i could have been  wherefore my dear good lady i hope i stand excused and shall not bring upon myself the censure of being disobedient to your commands  besides madam as you inform me that my good lord davers will attend your ladyship hither i should never dare to look his lordship in the face if all the emotions of my heart on such affecting occasions stood confessed to his lordship and indeed if i am ashamed they should to your ladyship and to the countess and lady betty whose goodness might induce you all three to think favorably in such circumstances of one who is of your own sex how would it concern me that the same should appear before such gentlemen as my lord and his nephew  indeed i could not look up to either of them in the sense of this  and give me leave to hope that some of the scenes in the letters your ladyship had were not read to gentlemen your ladyship must needs know which i mean and will think of my two grand trials of all  for though i was the innocent subject of wicked attempts and so cannot i hope suffer in any ones opinion for what i could not help yet for your dear brothers sake as well as for the decency of the matter one would not when one shall have the honor to appear before my lord and his nephew be looked upon methinks with that levity of eye and thought which perhaps hardhearted gentlemen may pass upon one by reason of those very scenes which would move pity and concern in a good ladys breast for a poor creature so attempted  so my dear lady be pleased to let me know if the gentlemen have heard all  i hope they have not  and be pleased also to point out to me such parts of my conduct as deserve blame indeed i will try to make a good use of your censure and am sure i shall be thankful for it  for it will make me hope to be more and more worthy of the honor i have of being exalted into such a distinguished family and the right the best of gentlemen has given me to style myself  your ladyship most humble and most obliged servant p b  letter viii from lady davers in reply my dear pamela you have given us all a great disappointment in declining to oblige me with the sequel of your papers i was a little out of humor with you at first  i must own i was  for i cannot bear denial when my heart is set upon any thing but lady betty became your advocate and said she thought you very excusable since no doubt there might be many tender things circumstanced as you was which might be well enough for your parents to see but for nobody else and relations of our side least of all whose future intimacy and frequent visits might give occasions for raillery and remarks that might not be always agreeable i regarded her apology for you the more because i knew it was a great balk to her that you did not comply with my request but now child when you know me more you will find that if i am obliged to give up one point i always insist upon another as near it as i can in order to see if it be only one thing i am to be refused or every thing in which last case i know how to take my measures and resent  now then this is what i insist on that you correspond with me in the same manner you did with your parents and acquaint me with every passage that is of concern to you beginning with your accounts how you spent your time both of you when you were in kent for you must know we are all taken with your duty to your parents and the discretion of the good couple and think you have given a very edifying example of filial piety to all who shall hear your story for if so much duty is owing to parents where nothing can be done for one how much more is it to be expected where there is a power to add to the natural obligation all the comforts and conveniences of life we people in upper life you must know love to hear how gratitude and unexpected benefits operate upon honest minds who have little more than plain artless nature for their guide and we flatter ourselves with the hopes of many a delightful hour by your means in this our solitary situation as it will be if we are obliged to pass the next winter in it as my lord and the earl threaten me and the countess and lady betty that we shall then let us hear of every thing that gives you joy and trouble and if my brother carries you to town for the winter while he attends parliament the advices you will be able to give us of what passes in london and of the public entertainments and diversions he will take you to as you will relate them from your own artless and natural observations will be as diverting to us as if we were at them ourselves for a young creature of your good understanding to whom all these things will be quite new will give us perhaps a better taste of them their beauties and defects than we might have before for we people of quality go to those places dressed out and adorned in such manner outvying one another as if we considered ourselves as so many parts of the public entertainment and are too much pleased with ourselves to be able so to attend to what we see as to form a right judgment of it and indeed we some of us behave with so much indifference to the entertainment as if we thought ourselves above being diverted by what we come to see and as if our view was rather to trifle away our time than to improve ourselves by attending to the story or the action  see pamela i shall not make an unworthy correspondent altogether for i can get into thy grave way and moralize a little nowandthen and if you will promise to oblige me by your constant correspondence in this way and divest yourself of all restraint as if you was writing to your parents and i can tell you you will write to one who will be as candid and as favorable to you as they can be then i am sure we shall have truth and nature from you and these are things which we are generally so much lifted above by our conditions that we hardly know what they are  but i have written enough for one letter and yet having more to say i will after this send another without waiting for your answer which you may give to both together and am mean time  yours etc davers  letter ix dear pamela i am very glad thy honest man has let thee into the affair of sally godfrey but prythee pamela give us an account of the manner in which he did it and of thy thoughts upon it for that is a critical case and according as he has represented it so shall i know what to say of it before you and him for i would not make mischief between you for the world  this let me tell you will be a trying part of your conduct for he loves the child and will judge of you by your conduct toward it he dearly loved her mother and notwithstanding her fault she well deserved it for she was a sensible ay and a modest lady and of an ancient and genteel family but he was heir to a noble estate was of a bold and enterprising spirit fond of intrigue  dont let this concern you  you will have the greater happiness and merit too if you can hold him  and it is my opinion if any body can you will  then he did not like the young ladys mother who sought artfully to entrap him so that the poor girl divided between her inclination for him and her duty to her designing mother gave into the plot upon him and he thought himself vile wretch as he was for all that  at liberty to set up plot against plot and the poor ladys honor was the sacrifice  i hope you spoke well of her to him i hope you received the child kindly  i hope you had presence of mind to do this  for it was a nice part to act and all his observations were up i dare say on the occasion  do let me hear how it was there is my good pamela do and write i charge you freely and without restraint for although i am not your mother yet am i his elder sister you know  and as such  come i will say so in hopes you will oblige me  your sister and so entitled to expect a compliance with my request for is there not a duty in degree to elder sisters from younger  as to our remarks upon your behavior they have been very much to your credit i can tell you that but nevertheless i will to encourage you to enter into this requested correspondence with me consult lady betty and will go over your papers again and try to find fault with your conduct and if we can see any thing censurable will freely let you know our minds  but beforehand i can tell you we shall be agreed in one opinion and that is that we know not who would have acted as you have done upon the whole  so pamela you see i put myself upon the same foot of correspondence with you  not that i will promise to answer every letter no you must not expect that  your part will be a kind of narrative purposely designed to entertain us here and i hope to receive six seven eight or ten letters as it may happen before i return one but such a part i will bear in it as shall let you know our opinion of your proceedings and relations of things  and as you wish to be found fault with as you say you shall freely have it though not in a splenetic or illnatured way as often as you give occasion now you must know pamela i have two views in this one is to see how a man of my brothers spirit who has not denied himself any genteel liberties for it must be owned he never was a common town rake and had always dignity in his roguery will behave himself to you and in wedlock which used to be very freely sneered by him the next that i may love you more and more which it will be enough to make me do i dare say as by your letters i shall be more and more acquainted with you as well as by conversation so that you cannot be off if you would  i know however you will have one objection to this and that is that your family affairs will require your attention and not give you the time you used to have for this employment but consider child the station you are raised to does not require you to be quite a domestic animal you are lifted up to the rank of a lady and you must act up to it and not think of setting such an example as will derive upon you the ill will and censure of other ladies  for will any of our sex visit one who is continually employing herself in such works as either must be a reproach to herself or to them  you will have nothing to do but to give orders you will consider yourself as the taskmistress and the common herd of female servants as so many negroes directing themselves by your nod or yourself as the masterwheel in some beautiful piece of mechanism whose dignified grave motion is to set agoing all the underwheels with a velocity suitable to their respective parts  let your servants under your direction do all that relates to household economy they cannot write to entertain and instruct as you can so what will you have to do  i will answer my own question in the first place endeavor to please your sovereign lord and master and let me tell you any other woman in england be her quality ever so high would have found enough to do to succeed in that secondly to receive and pay visits in order for his credit as well as your own to make your fashionable neighbors fond of you then thirdly you will have time upon your hands as your monarch himself rises early and is tolerably regular for such a brazenface as he has been to write to me in the manner i have mentioned and expect and i see plainly by your style that nothing can be easier for you than to do this  and thus and with reading may your time be filled up with reputation to yourself and delight to others till a fourth employment puts itself upon you and that is shall i tell you in one word without mincing the matter a succession of brave boys to perpetuate a family that has for many hundred years been esteemed worthy and eminent and which being now reduced in the direct line to him and me expects it from you or else let me tell you nor will i balk it my brother by descending to the wholesome cot  excuse me pamela  will want one apology for his conduct be as excellent as you may  i say this child not to reflect upon you since the thing is done for i love you dearly and will love you more and more  but to let you know what is expected from you and to encourage you in the prospect that is already opening to you both and to me who have the welfare of the family i sprung from so much at heart although i know this will be attended with some anxieties to a mind so thoughtful and apprehensive as yours seems to be  o but this puts me in mind of your solicitude for fear the gentlemen should have seen every thing contained in your letters  but this i will particularly speak to in a third letter having filled my paper on all sides and am  yours etc davers you see and i hope will take it as a favor that i break the ice and begin first in the indispensably expected correspondence between us    letter x from the same and so pamela you are very solicitous to know if the gentlemen have seen every part of your papers i cannot say but they have nor except in regard to the reputation of your saucy man do i see why the parts you hint at might not be read by those to whom the rest might be shown  i can tell you lady betty who is a very nice and delicate lady had no objections to any part though read before men only now and then crying out  o the vile man  see lord davers what wretches you men are  and commiserating you ah the poor pamela  and expressing her impatience to hear on how you escaped at this time and at that and rejoicing in your escape  and nowandthen o lady davers what a vile brother you have  i hate him perfectly  the poor girl cannot be made amends for all this though he has married her who that knows these things of him would wish him to be hers with all his advantages of person mind and fortune  and suchlike expressions in your praise and condemning him and his wicked attempts  but i can tell you this that except one had heard every tittle of your danger how near you were to ruin and how little he stood upon taking any measures to effect his vile purposes even daring to attempt you in the presence of a good woman which was a wickedness that every wicked man could not be guilty of  i say except one had known these things one should not have been able to judge of the merit of your resistance and how shocking those attempts were to your virtue insomuch that life itself was endangered by them nor let me tell you could i in particular have so well justified him for marrying you i mean with respect to his own proud and haughty temper of mind if there had been room to think he could have had you upon easier terms  it was necessary child on twenty accounts that we your and his wellwishers and relations should know that he had tried every stratagem and made use of every contrivance to subdue you to his purpose before he married you and how would it have answered to his intrepid character and pride of heart had we not been particularly let into the nature of those attempts which you so nobly resisted as to convince us all that you have deserved the good fortune you have met with as well as all the kind and respectful treatment he can possibly show you  nor ought you to be concerned who sees any the most tender parts of your story except as i said for his sake for it must be a very unvirtuous mind that can form any other ideas from what you relate than those of terror and pity for you your expressions are too delicate to give the nicest ear offense except at him  you paint no scenes but such as make his wickedness odious and that gentleman much more lady must have a very corrupt heart who could from such circumstances of distress make any reflections but what should be to your honor and in abhorrence of such actions indeed child i am so convinced of this that by this rule i would judge of any mans heart in the world better than by a thousand declarations and protestations i do assure you rakish as jackey is and freely as i doubt not that lord davers has formerly lived for he has been a man of pleasure they gave me by their behavior on these tenderer occasions reason to think they had more virtue than not to be very apprehensive for your safety and my lord several times exclaimed that he could not have thought his brother such a libertine neither  besides child were not these things written in confidence to your mother and bad as his actions were to you if you had not recited all you could recite would there not have been room for any one who should have seen what you writ to imagine they had been still worse  and how could the terror be supposed to have had such effects upon you as to endanger your life without imagining you had undergone the worst that a vile man could offer unless you had told us what that was which he did offer and so put a bound as it were to ones apprehensive imaginations of what you suffered which otherwise must have been injurious to your purity though you could not help it  moreover pamela it was but doing justice to the libertine himself to tell your mother the whole truth that she might know he was not so very abandoned but that he could stop short of the execution of his wicked purposes which he apprehended if pursued would destroy the life that of all lives he would choose to preserve and you owed also thus much to your parents peace of mind that after all their distracting fears for you they might see they had reason to rejoice in an uncontaminated daughter and one cannot but reflect now all is over and he has made you his wife that it must be a satisfaction to the wicked man as well as to yourself that he was not more guilty than he was and that he took no more liberties than he did  for my own part i must say that i could not have accounted for your fits by any description short of those you give and had you been less particular in the circumstances i should have judged he had been still worse and your person though not your mind less pure than his pride would expect from the woman he should marry for this is the case of all rakes that though they indulge in all manner of libertinism themselves there is no class of men who exact greater delicacy than they from the persons they marry though they care not how bad they make the wives the sisters and daughters of others  i have run into length again so will only add and send all my three letters together that we all blame you in some degree for bearing the wicked jewkes in your sight after the most impudent assistance she gave to his lewd attempt much less we think ought you to have left her in her place and rewarded her for her vileness which could hardly be equalled by the worst actions of the most abandoned procuress  i know the difficulties you lay under in his arbitrary will and in his intercession for her but lady betty rightly observes that he knew what a vile woman she was when he put you into her power and no doubt employed her because he was sure she would answer all his purposes and that therefore she should have had very little opinion of the sincerity of his reformation while he was so solicitous in keeping her there and in having her put on a foot in the present on your nuptials with honest jervis  she would she says had she been in your case have had one struggle for her dismission let it have been taken as it would and he that was so well pleased with your virtue must have thought this a natural consequence of it if he was in earnest to reclaim  i know not whether you show him all i write or not but i have written this last part in the cover as well for want of room as that you may keep it from him if you please though if you think it will serve any good end i am not against showing to him all i write for i must ever speak my mind though i were to smart for it and that nobody can or has the heart to make me do but my bold brother so pamela for this time  adieu  letter xi my good lady i am honored with your ladyships three letters the contents of which are highly obliging to me and i should be inexcusable if i did not comply with your injunctions and be very proud and thankful for your ladyships condescension in accepting of my poor scribble and promising me such a rich and invaluable return of which you have given me already such ample and such delightful instances i will not plead my defects to excuse my obedience i only fear that the awe which will be always upon me when i write to your ladyship will lay me under so great a restraint that i shall fall short even of the merit my papers have already made for me through your kind indulgence but nevertheless sheltering myself under your goodness i will cheerfully comply with every thing your ladyship expects from me that is in my power to do  you will give me leave madam to put into some little method the particulars of what you desire of me that i may speak to them all for since you are so good as to excuse me from sending the rest of my papers which indeed would not bear in many places i will omit nothing that shall tend to convince you of my readiness to obey you in every thing else  first then your ladyship would have the particulars of the happy fortnight we passed in kent on one of the most agreeable occasions that could befall me  secondly an account of the manner in which your dear brother acquainted me with the affecting story of miss godfrey and my behavior upon it  and thirdly i presume your ladyship and lady betty expect that i should say something upon your welcome remarks on my conduct toward mrs jewkes  the other particulars contained in your ladyships kind letters will naturally fall under one or other of these three heads  but expect not my lady though i begin in method thus that i shall keep up to it if your ladyship will not allow for me and keep in view the poor pamela andrews in all i write but will have mrs b in your eye what will become of me  but indeed i promise myself so much improvement from this correspondence that i enter upon it with a greater delight than i can express notwithstanding the mingled awe and diffidence that will accompany me in every part of the agreeable task  to begin with the first article  your dear brother and my honest parents  i know your ladyship will expect from me that on all occasions i should speak of them with the duty that becomes a good child  i say then your dear brother and they and myself set out on the monday morning for kent passing through st albans to london at both which places we stopped a night for our dear benefactor would make us take easy journeys and on wednesday evening we arrived at the sweet place allotted for the good couple we were attended only by abraham and john on horseback for mr colbrand having spraind his foot was in the travellingcoach with the cook and housemaid and polly barlow a genteel new servant whom mrs brooks recommended to wait on me  mr longman had been down there for a fortnight employed in settling the terms of an additional purchase to this pretty wellwooded and wellwatered estate and the account he gave of his proceedings was very satisfactory to his honored principal he told us he had much ado to dissuade the tenants from pursuing a formed resolution of meeting their landlord on horseback at some miles distance for he had informed them when he expected us but knowing how desirous mr b was of being retired while he staid here this time he had ventured to assure them that when every thing was settled and the new purchase actually entered upon they would have his presence among them nowandthen and that he would introduce them all at different times to their worthy landlord before we left the country  the house my good lady is large and very commodious and we found every thing about it and in it exceeding neat and convenient which was owing to the worthy mr longmans care and direction the ground is wellstockd the barns and outhouses in excellent repair and my poor father and mother have only to wish that they and i may be deserving of half the goodness we experience from the bountiful mind of your good brother  but indeed my lady i have the pleasure of discovering every day more and more that there is not a better disposed and more generous gentleman in the world than himself insomuch that i verily think he has not been so careful to conceal his bad actions as his good ones his heart is naturally beneficent and his beneficence is the gift of god to him as i have been so free as to tell him to serve for excellent purposes even for a foundation to the noblest superstructure whenever the rubbish of sense shall be cleared from it and the divine workmen be properly employed to build a temple for the deity to reside in  pardon me my dear lady i wish i may not be impertinently grave but i find a great many instances of his considerate charity which hardly any body knew of and which since i have been his almoner could not avoid coming to my knowledge  but this possibly is no news to your ladyship every body knows the generous goodness of your own heart every one that wanted relief tasted the bounty of your excellent mother my late honored lady so that it is a family grace and i have no need to speak of it to you madam  this cannot my dear lady i hope be construed as if i would hereby suppose ourselves less obliged indeed i know nothing so godlike in human nature as this disposition to do good to our fellow creatures for is it not following immediately the example of that gracious providence which every minute is conferring blessings on us all and by giving power to the rich makes them but the dispensers of its benefits to those that want them but yet as there are but too many objects of compassion and as the most beneficent mind in the world cannot like omnipotence do good to all how much are they obliged who are distinguished from others and this kept in mind will always contribute to make the benefited receive as they ought the favors of the obliger  i know not if i write to be understood in all i mean but my grateful heart is so overfilld when it is employed on this subject that methinks i want to say a great deal more at the same time that i am apprehensive i say too much  yet perhaps the copies of the letters i here enclose to your ladyship that marked i written by me to my father and mother on our return hither from kent that marked ii from my dear father in answer to it and that marked iii mine in reply to his see letters       of this volume  will at the same time that they may convince your ladyship that i will conceal nothing from you in the course of this correspondence that may in the least amuse and divert you or that may better explain our grateful sentiments in a great measure answer what your ladyship expects from me as to the happy fortnight we passed in kent  and here i will conclude this letter choosing to suspend the correspondence till i know from your ladyship whether it will not be too low too idle for your attention whether you will not dispense with your own commands for my writing to you when you see it is so little likely to answer what you may possibly expect from me or whether if you insist upon my scribbling you would have me write in any other way be less tedious less serious  in short less or more any thing for all that is in my power your ladyship may command from  madam your obliged and faithful servant p b your dearest brother from whose knowledge i would not keep any thing that shall take up any considerable portion of my time gives me leave to proceed in this correspondence if you command it and is pleased to say he will content himself to see such parts of it and only such parts as i shall show him or read to him  is not this very good madam  o my lady you dont know how happy i am    letter xii my dear pamela you very much oblige me by your cheerful compliance with my request i leave it entirely to you to write in what manner you please and as you shall be in the humor to write when you take up your pen for then i shall have you write with less restraint for you must know that what we admire in you are truth and nature and not studied or elaborate sentiments we can hear at church or we can read in our closets fifty good things that we expect not from you but we cannot receive from any body else the pleasure of sentiments flowing with that artless ease which so much affects us when we read your letters then my sweet girl your gratitude your prudence your integrity of heart your humility shine so much in all your letters and sentiments that no wonder my brother loves you as he does but i shall make you proud i doubt and so by praise ruin those graces which we admire and but for that cannot praise too much  in my conscience if thou can hold as thou have begun i believe thou will have him all to thyself and that was once more than i thought ever any woman on this side the seventieth year of his age would ever be able to say the letters to and from your parents we are charmed with and the communicating of them to me i take to be as great an instance of your confidence in me as it is of your judgment and prudence for you cannot but think that we his relations are a little watchful over your conduct and have our eyes upon you to observe what use you are likely to make of the power you have over your man with respect to your own relations  hitherto all is unexampled prudence and you take the right method to reconcile even the proudest of us to your marriage and make us not only love you but respect your parents because their honesty will i perceive be their distinguishing character and they will not forget themselves nor their former condition  i can tell you you are exactly right for if you were to be an incroacher as the good old man calls it my brother would be one of the first to see it and he would gradually think less and less of you till possibly he might come to despise you and to repent of his choice for the least shadow of an imposition or low cunning or mean selfishness he cannot bear  in short youre a charming girl and lady betty says so too and moreover adds that if he makes you not the best and faithfullest of husbands he cannot deserve you for all his fortune and birth  and in my heart i begin to think so too  but will not you oblige me with the sequel of your letter to your father for you promise my dear charming scribbler in that you sent to me to write again to his letter and i long to see how you answer the latter part of it about your relations desiring already to come and live with him i know what i expect from you but let it be what it will send it to me exactly as you wrote it and i shall see whether i have reason to praise or to reprove you for surely pamela you must leave one room to blame you for something indeed i can hardly bear the thought that you should so much excel as you do and have more prudence by intuition as it were than the best of us have in a series of the genteelest education and with fifty advantages at least in conversation that you could not have by reason of my mothers retired life while you were with her and your close attendance on her person  but i will tell you what has been a great improvement to you it is your own writings this itch of scribbling has been a charming help to you for here having a natural fund of good sense and a prudence above your years you have with the observations those advantages have enabled you to make been flint and steel too as i may say to yourself so that you have struck fire when you pleased wanting nothing but a few dried leaves like the first pair in old du bartas to serve as tinder to catch your animating sparks so that reading constantly and thus using yourself to write which impressed you more than reading could and enjoying besides the benefit of a good memory every thing you heard or read became your own and not only so but improved by passing through more salubrious ducts and vehicles like some fine fruit grafted upon a common freestock whose more exuberant juices serve to bring to quicker and greater perfection the downy peach or the smooth nectarine with its crimson blush  really pamela i believe i too shall improve by writing to you  why you dear saucyface at this rate you will make every one that converses with you better and wiser and wittier too as far as i know than they ever before thought there was room for em to be  as to my own part i begin to like what i have written myself i think and your correspondence will possibly make me resume the poetical ideas that used to be strong upon me before i entered into the drowsy married life for my good lord daverss turn happens not to be to books and so by degrees my imagination was in a manner quenched and i as a dutiful wife should endeavored to form my taste by that of the man i chose  but after all pamela you are not to be a little proud i can tell you that of my correspondence and i could not have thought it ever would have come to this but you will have the penetration to observe that i am the more free and unreserved to encourage you to write without restraint for already you have made us a family of writers and readers so that lord davers himself is become enamored of your letters and desires of all things he may hear read every one that passes between us nay jackey for that matter who was the most thoughtless whistling sauntering fellow you ever knew and whose delight in a book ran no higher than a song or a catch now comes in with an inquiring face and vows he will set pen to paper and turn letterwriter himself and intends if my brother will not take it amiss he says to begin to you provided he could be sure of an answer  i have twenty things still to say for you have unlocked all our bosoms and yet i intended not to write above ten or a dozen lines when i began only to tell you that i would have you take your own way in your subjects and in your style  and if you will but give me hope that you are in the way i so much wish to have you in i will then call myself your affectionate sister but till then it shall only barely be  your correspondent davers you will proceed with the account of your kentish affair i doubt not    letter xiii my dear good lady what kind what generous things are you pleased to say of your happy correspondent and what reason have i to value myself on such an advantage as is now before me if i am capable of improving it as i ought from a correspondence with so noble and so admired a lady i wish i be not now proud indeed  to be praised by such a genius and by the noble sister of my honored benefactor whose favor next to his own it was always my chief ambition to obtain is what would be enough to fill with vanity a steadier and a more equal mind than mine  i have heard from my late honored lady what a fine pen her beloved daughter was mistress of when she pleased to take it up but i never could have had the presumption but from your ladyships own motion to hope to be in any manner the subject of it much less to be called your correspondent  indeed madam i am proud very proud of this honor and consider it as such a heightening to my pleasures as only that could give and i will set about obeying your ladyship without reserve  but permit me in the first place to disclaim any merit from my own poor writings to that improvement which your goodness imputes to me what i have to boast of that sort is owing principally if it deserves commendation to my late excellent lady it is hardly to be imagined what pains her ladyship took with her poor servant besides making me keep a book of her charities dispensed by my hands she caused me always to set down in my way the cases of the distressed their griefs from their misfortunes and their joys in her bountiful relief and so i was entered early into the various turns that affected worthy hearts and was taught the better to regulate my own especially by the help of the fine observations which my good lady used to make to me when i read to her what i wrote for many a time has her worthy heart run over with pleasure at my remarks and with praises and i was her good girl her dear pamela her hopeful maiden and she would sometimes snatch my hand with transport and draw me to her and vouchsafe to kiss me and always was saying what she would do for me if god spared her and i continued to be deserving  o my dear lady you cannot think what an encouragement this condescending behavior and goodness was to me indeed madam you cannot think it  i used to throw myself at her feet and embrace her knees and my eyes streaming with tears of joy would often cry o continue to me my dearest lady the blessing of your favor and kind instructions and it is all your happy happy pamela can wish for  but i will proceed to obey your ladyship and write with as much freedom as i possibly can for you must not expect that i can be entirely divested of that awe which will lay me under more restraint than if i was writing to my father and mother whose partiality for their daughter made me in a manner secure of their good opinions  and now that i may shorten the work before me in the account i am to give of the sweet fortnight that we passed in kent i enclose not only the copy of the letter your ladyship desired me to send you but my fathers answer to it which with those you have already will set before your ladyship all you want to see in relation to the desire some of my kindred had to live with my father and my own advice on the occasion and i am humbly confident you will join in sentiment with me for persons are less doubtful of approbation when their minds are incapable of dark reserves or such views as they would be afraid should be detected by the most watchful observer of their conduct and your ladyship gives me double pleasure that you are pleased to have an eye upon mine first because i hope it will be such as will generally bear the strictest scrutiny and next because when my actions fall short of my intentions i presume to hope your ladyship will be as kind a monitor to me as you are a correspondent and then i shall have an opportunity to correct myself and be as near as my slender talents will permit what your ladyship would have me to be  as the letters i sent before and those i now send will let your ladyship into several particulars such as a brief description of the house and farm and your honored brothers intentions of retiring thither nowandthen of the happiness and gratitude of my dear parents and their wishes to be able to deserve the comforts his goodness has heaped upon them and that in stronger lights than i am able to set them i will only in a summary manner mention the rest and particularly  that the behavior of my dear benefactor to me to my parents to mr longman and to the tenants was one continued series of benignity and condescension he endeavored in every kind and generous way to encourage the good couple to be free and cheerful with him and seeing them unable to get over that awe and respect which they owe him above all mankind and which they sought to pay him on all occasions he would take their hands and move than once called them by the nearest and dearest names of relationship as if they were his own parents and i believe would have distinguished them oftener in this manner but that he saw them too much affected with his goodness to bear the honor as my dear father says in his first letter with equalness of temper and he seemed always to delight in being particularly kind to them before strangers and before the tenants and before mr sorby and mr bennet and mr shepherd three of the principal gentlemen in the neighborhood who with their ladies came to visit us and whose visits we all returned for your dear brother would not permit my father and mother to decline the invitation of those worthy families  judge you my dear lady with what a joy these kind distinctions and this sweet behavior must fill their honest hearts judge of my grateful sentiments and acknowlegements on these hourly instances of his goodness and judge of the respect and esteem with which this must inspire every one to the good couple and when once mrs bennet had like to have said something of their former condition which she would have recalled in some confusion and when she could not apologized for it the dear gentleman said  all is well mrs bennet no apologies are necessary and to show you they are not i will tell you myself what you cannot have heard so particularly from others and which were i to endeavor to conceal would be a piece of pride as stupid as despicable so in a concise manner he gave them an account of my story so much to my advantage and so little to his own in the ingenuous relation of his attempts upon me that you cannot imagine madam how much the gentry were affected by it and how much in particular they applauded him for the generosity of his actions to me and to my dear parents and your ladyship will permit me to observe that since the matter is circumstanced as it is policy as well as nobleness of mind obliged from the dear gentleman this frankness and acknowlegement for having said worse of himself and as mean of our fortunes as they could think what remained for the hearers but to applaud when he had left them no room to reproach not so much as in thought  every day we rode out or walked a little about the grounds and while we were there he employed hands to cut a vista through a coppice as they call it but rather a little wood to a rising ground which fronting an oldfashioned balcony in the middle of the house he ordered it to be planted like a grove and a little building to be erected on its summit in the fashion of an ancient greek temple of which he has sent them a draught drawn by his own hand from one he had seen abroad and this and a few other alterations mentioned in my letter to my father are to be finished against we go down next  the dear gentleman was every hour pressing me while there to take one diversion or other frequently upbraiding me that i seemed not to choose any thing urging me to propose sometimes what i could wish he should oblige me in and not always to leave it to him to choose for me saying he was halfafraid that my constant compliance with every thing he proposed laid me sometimes under a restraint and he would have me have a will of my own since it was impossible that it could be such as he should not take a delight in conforming to it  but when as i told him his favor for me made him rather study what was obliging to me than himself and that he prevented all my wishes by his goodness how was it possible for me not to receive with pleasure and gratitude every intimation from him in such a manner as that though it might seem to be the effect of an implicit obedience to his will yet was it nor could it be otherwise entirely my own  i will not trouble your ladyship with any further particulars relating to this happy fortnight which was made up all of white and unclouded days to the very last and your ladyship will judge better than i can describe what a parting there was between my dear parents and their honored benefactor and me  we set out attended with the good wishes of crowds of persons of all degrees for your dear brother left behind him noble instances of his bounty it being the first time as he bid mr longman say that he had been down among them since that estate had been in his hands  but permit me madam to observe that i could not forbear often very often in this happy period thanking god in private for the blessed terms upon which i was there to what i should have been had i gracelesly accepted of those which once were tendered to me for your ladyship will remember that the kentish estate was to be part of the purchase of my infamy see vol i p       we returned through london again by the like easy journeys but tarried not to see any thing of that vast metropolis any more than we did in going through it before your beloved brother only stopping at his bankers and desiring him to look out for a handsome house which he purposes to take for his winter residence he chooses it to be about sohosquare or the new buildings called hanoversquare and he left mr longman there to see one which his banker believed would be fit for him  and thus my dear good lady i have answered your first commands by the help of the letters which passed between my dear parents and me and conclude this with the assurance that i am with high respect  your ladyships most obliged and faithful servant p b  letter xiv my dearest lady i now set myself to obey your ladyships second command which is to give an account in what manner your dear brother broke to me the affair of the unfortunate miss godfrey with my behavior upon it and this i cannot do better than by transcribing the relation i gave at the time in those letters to my dear parents which your ladyship has not seen in these very words  see vol ii p     beginning my dear mr b down to p     line  0    thus far my dear lady the relation i gave to my parents at the time of my being first acquainted with this melancholy affair  it is a great pleasure to me that i can already flatter myself from the hints you kindly give me that i behaved as you wished i should behave indeed madam i could not help it for i pitied most sincerely the unhappy lady and though i could not but rejoice that i had had the grace to escape the dangerous attempts of the dear intriguer yet never did the story of any unfortunate lady make such an impression upon me as hers did she loved him and believed no doubt he loved her too well to take ungenerous advantages of her soft passion for him and so by degrees put herself in his power and too seldom alas have the noblestminded of the seduceing sex the mercy or the goodness to spare the poor creatures that do  and then this love to be sure is a sad thing when once it is suffered to reign  a perfect tyrant  requiring an unconditional obedience to its arbitrary dictates and deeming every instance of discretion and prudence and virtue itself too often but as so many acts of rebellion to its usurped authority  and then how do even blemishes become perfections in those we love crimes themselves too often to inconsiderate minds appear but as human failings and human failings are a common cause and always pardonable by human frailty  then it is another misfortune of people in love they always think highly of the beloved object and lowly of themselves such a dismal mortifier is love  i say not this madam to excuse the poor ladys fall nothing can do that because virtue is and ought to be preferable to all considerations and to life itself but methinks i love this dear lady so well for the sake of her edifying penitence that i would fain extenuate her crime if i could and the rather as in all probability it was a first love on both sides and so he could not appear to her as a practiced deceiver  your ladyship will see by what i have transcribed how i behaved myself to the dear miss goodwin and i am so fond of the little charmer as well for the sake of her unhappy mother though personally unknown to me as for the relation she bears to the dear gentleman whom i am bound to love and honor that i must beg your ladyships interest to procure her to be given up to my care when it shall be thought proper i am sure i shall act by her as tenderly as if i was her own mother and glad i am that the poor unfaulty baby is so justly beloved by mr b but i will here conclude this letter with assuring your ladyship that i am  your obliged and humble servant p b  letter xv my good lady i now come to your ladyships remarks on my conduct to mrs jewkes which you are pleased to think too kind and forgiving considering the poor womans baseness  your ladyship says that i ought not to have borne her in my sight after the impudent assistance she gave to his lewd attempts much less to have left her in her place and rewarded her for her vileness alas my dear lady what could i do a poor prisoner as i was made for weeks together in breach of all the laws of civil society not a soul who durst be my friend and every day expecting to be ruined and undone by one of the haughtiest and most determined spirits in england  and when it pleased god to turn his heart and incline him to abandon his wicked attempts and to profess honorable love to me his poor servant can it be thought i was to insist upon conditions with such a gentleman who had me in his power and who if i had provoked him might have resumed all his wicked purposes against me  indeed i was too much overjoyed after all my dangers past which were so great that i could not go to rest nor rise but with such apprehensions that i wished for death rather than life to think of refusing any terms that i could yield to and keep my honor  and though such noble ladies as your ladyship and lady betty who are born to independency and are hereditarily as i may say on a foot with the highestdescended gentleman in the land might have exerted spirit and would have had a right to pick and choose your own servants and distribute rewards and punishments to the deserving and undeserving at your own good pleasure yet what had i a poor girl who owed my title even to common notice to the bounty of my late good lady and a kind of imputed sightliness of person which had made me only the subject of vile attempts who from a situation of terror and apprehension was lifted up to a hope beyond my highest ambition and was bid to pardon the bad woman as an instance that i could forgive his own hard usage of me who had experienced so often the violence and impetuosity of his temper which even his beloved mother never resisted till it subsided and then indeed he was all goodness and acknowlegement of which i could give your ladyship more than one instance what i say had i to do to take upon me ladyairs and resent  but my dear ladies let me in this instance bespeak both your ladyships attention i should be inexcusable if i did not tell you all the truth and that is that i not only forgave the poor wretch in regard to his commands but from my own inclination  if i am wrong in saying this i must submit it to your ladyships and as i pretend not to perfection am ready to take the blame i shall be found to deserve in your ladyships judgment but indeed were it to do again i verily think i could not help forgiving her and were i not able to say this i should be thought to have made a mean court to my masters passions and to have done a wrong thing with my eyes open which i humbly conceive no one should do  when this poor creature was put into my power seemingly at least though it might possibly have been resumed and i might have been recommitted to hers had i given him reason to think i made an arrogant use of it you cannot imagine what a triumph i had in my mind on the mortified guilt which from the highest degree of insolence and imperiousness that before hardened her masculine features appeared in her countenance when she found the tables likely to be soon turned upon her  this change of behavior which at first operated in sullen awe and afterward in a kind of silent respect showed me what an influence power had over her and that when she could treat her late prisoner when taken into favor so obsequiously it was the less wonder the bad woman could think it her duty to obey commands so unjust when her obedience to them was required from her master  to be sure if a look could have killed her after some of her bad treatment she had been slain over and over as i may say but to me who always was taught to distinguish between the person and the action i could not hold my resentment against the poor passive machine of mischief one day together though her actions were so odious to me  i should indeed except that time of my grand trial when she appeared so much a wretch to me that i saw her not even after see vol i p     two days that she was kept from my sight without great flutter and emotion of heart and i had represented to your brother before how hard a condition it was for me to forgive so much unwomanly wickedness ibid p       but my dear ladies when i considered the matter in one particular light i could the more easily forgive her and having forgiven her bear her in my sight and act by her as a consequence of that forgiveness as if she had not so horridly offended  else how would it have been forgiveness especially as she was ashamed of her crime and there was no fear of a repetition of it  thus then i thought on the occasion poor wretched agent for purposes little less than infernal i will forgive thee since thy master and my master will have it so and indeed thou art beneath the resentment even of such a poor girl as i i will pity thee base and abject as thou art and she who is the object of my pity is surely beneath my anger my eye that used to quiver and tremble at thy haughty eye shall now with conscious worthiness take a superior steadiness and look down thy scouling guilty one into selfcondemnation the state thou could never cast mine into nor from it wilt be able to raise thine own bear the reproach of thy own wicked heart low vile woman unworthy as thou art of the name and chosen as it should seem for a foil to the innocent and to make purity shine forth the brighter the only good use such wretches as thou can be of to others except for examples of penitence and mercy this will be punishment enough for thee without my exposing myself to the imputation of descending so near to a level with thee as to resent thy baseness when thou have no power to hurt me   such were then my thoughts my proud thoughts so far was i in my heart and i hoped in the very act that proceeded from that heart from intentional meanness in forgiving at mr bs interposition the poor low creeping abject selfmortifyd and mastermortifyd mrs jewkes   and do you think ladies when you revolve in your thoughts who i was and what i was and what i was designed to be when you revolve the amazing turn in my favor and the prospects before me prospect so much above my hope that i left them entirely to providence to direct for me as it pleased without daring to look forward to what those prospect seemed naturally to tend when i could see my haughty persecutor become my repentant protector the lofty spirit that used to make me tremble and to which i never could look up without awe except in those animating cases where his guilt and my innocence gave me a courage more than natural to my otherwise dastardly heart when this impetuous spirit could stoop to request one whom he had sunk beneath even her usual low character of his servant and was his prisoner under sentence of a ruin worse than death as he had intended it and had seized her for that very purpose could stoop to acknowledge the vileness of those purposes could say at one time that my forgiveness of mrs jewkes should stand me in greater stead than i was aware of could tell her before me that she must for the future show me all the respect that was due to one he must love see vol i p      at another acknowledge before her that he had been stark naught and that i was very forgiving vol ii p     again ibid p     to mrs jewkes putting himself on a level with her as to guilt we are both in generous hands and indeed if pamela did not pardon you i should think she but half forgave me because you acted by my instructions another time to the same ibid p      we have been both sinners and must be both included in one act of grace  when i say i was thus lifted up to the state of a sovereign forgiver and my lordly master became a petitioner for himself and for the guilty creature whom he put under my feet what a triumph was here for the poor pamela and could i have been guilty of so mean a pride as to trample upon the poor abject creature when i found her thus lowly thus mortified and so much in my power for so she actually was while i seemed to think so and would it have been good manners with regard to my master or policy with respect to mayself to doubt it after he had so declared   then my dear ladies while i was enjoying the soulcharming fruits of that innocence which the divine grace had enabled me to preserve in spite of so many plots and contrivances on my masters side and such wicked instigations and assistances on hers and all my prospects were improving upon me beyond my wishes when all was sunshine unclouded sunshine and i possessed my mind in peace and had nothing to do but to be thankful to providence which had been so gracious to my unworthiness when i saw as i said above my persecutor become my protector my active enemy no longer my enemy but creeping with flow doubtful feet and speaking to me with awful hesitating doubt of my acceptance a stamp of an insolent foot turned into courtfying halfbent knees threatening hands into supplicating folds and the eye unpitying to innocence running over with the sense of her own guilt a faltering accent on her late menacing tongue and uplifted handkerchief  i see she will be my lady and then i know how it will go with me see vol i p       was not this my ladies a triumph of triumphs to the late miserable now exalted pamela  could i do less than pardon her and having declared that i did so was i not to show the sincerity of my declaration  indeed indeed my dear good ladies i found such a subject for exultation in this providential change of my condition that i had much ado to subdue my rising pride and thought there was more danger of being lifted up every moment to see such improving contrition on the poor creatures part than to be supposed guilty of a meanness of heart in stooping yes madam that was then the proudly proper word in the elevation wherein i found myself to forgive her  and what should i not forgive a creature for that very baseness which happily withstood had so largely contributed to exalt me indeed my dear good ladies permit me to repeat i could not choose but to forgive her  how could i  and would it not have been out of character in me and against all expectation of my highsould though sometimes as in my case for a great while together meanlyacting master if i had not   would it not have shown him that the lowborn pamela was incapable of a generous action had she refused the only request her humble condition had given her the opportunity of granting at that time with innocence would he not have thought the humble cottager as capable of insolence and vengeance too in her turn as the betterborn and that she wanted but the power to show that unrelenting temper by which she had so grievously suffered  and might not this have given him room to think me and to have resumed and prosecuted his purposes accordingly fitter for an arrogant kept mistress than an humble and obliged wife   i see might he not have said the girl has strong passions and resentments and she that has will be acted and sometimes governed by them  i will improve upon the hint she herself has now given me by her inexorable temper  i will gratify her revenge till i turn it upon herself i will indulge her pride till i make it administer to her fall for a wife i cannot think of in the lowborn cottager especially when she has lurking in her all the pride and arrogance you know my ladies his haughty way of speaking of our sex of the betterdescended  and by a little perseverance and watching her unguarded hours and applying temptations to her passions i shall first discover them and then make my advantage of them   might not this have been the language and this the resolution of such a dear wicked intriguer  for my lady you can hardly conceive the struggles he apparently had to bring down his high spirit to so humble a level and though i hope all would have been even in this worst case ineffectual through divine grace yet how do i know what lurking vileness might have appeared by degrees in this frail heart to have encouraged his designs and to have augmented my trials and my dangers and perhaps downright violence might have been used if he could not on one hand have subdued his passion nor on the other have overcome his pride a pride that every one reflecting upon the disparity of birth and condition between us would have dignified with the name of decency a pride that was become such an essential part of the dear gentlemans character in this instance of a wife that although he knew he could not keep it up if he made me happy yet it was no small motive in his choosing me in one respect because he expected from me more humility more submission than he thought he had reason to flatter himself would be paid him by a lady equally born and educated and of this i will send your ladyship an instance in a transcription from that part of see vol ii p     and seq beginning at line    my journal you have not seen of his lessons to me on the occasion your ladyship so well remembers of my incurring his displeasure by interposing between yourself and him ibid p      in your misunderstanding at the hall for madam i intend to send at times any thing i think worthy of your ladyships attention out of those papers you were so kind as to excuse me from sending you in the lump and many of which must needs have appeared very impertinent to such judges  thus could your ladyship have thought it  have i ventured upon a strange paradox that even this strongest instance of his debasing himself is not the weakest instance of his pride and he ventured once at sir simon darnfords to say in your ladyships hearing as you may remember that in his conscience he thought he should hardly have made a tolerable husband to any body but pamela see vol ii p   0 vol iii  and why for the reasons you will see in the enclosed papers which give an account of the noblest and earliest curtainlecture that ever girl had one of which is that he expects to be borne with  complied with he meant even when in the wrong another that a wife should never so much as expostulate with him though he was in the wrong till by complying with all he insisted upon she should have shown him she designed rather to convince him for his own sake than for contradictions sake and then another time perhaps he might take better resolutions ibid p       i hope from what i have said it will appear to your ladyship and to lady betty too that i am justified or at least excusable in pardoning mrs jewkes and i have yet another reason behind for doing so had she been as absolutely in my power as the wish of the most resenting person in the world could have made her and that is the hope i had that the poor creature by being continued in a family where the gentleman gave hopes of so desirable a reformation and where the example of the person he was about to honor in so eminent a degree beyond all that could have been hoped for by her a few days before might possibly contribute to make her change her manner of thinking as well as acting  i looked upon the poor wretch in all her deportment to me in my days of trial as one devoted to perdition by her own act and deed as one who had no regard to a future state and who while she could live in ease and plenty for a wretched poor term of years the remainder of an illspent life cared not what she did and was ready to undertake any thing which persons of power and riches would put her upon that even were she to be turned off disgracefully at my desire besides showing myself to be of an implacable spirit which some people would have imputed to right some to wrong motives as they favored me or not she might be entertained by some prostigate persons to whose baseness such a woman might be useful and that then her power to do mischief might be augmented and she might go on more successfully to do the devil work and several innocent creatures might be entangled like so many thoughtless flies in the insnaring web of this venomoushearted spider which i had so happily escaped is it not better then thought i if i can impress conviction upon the poor wretch whom its hopeful forerunner shame had already taken hold of and add the delightful hope of mischiefs prevented to that of a soul reclaimed and may not i who have been so hardly used by her for that very reason have more influence upon her than any other person even the best of divines could have  when i talk to her in a virtuous way will she not see that i talk from example pardon my presumption madam in saying so as well as precept will she not see that those principles must proceed from a right direction a direction worthy of being followed which could make a sufferer by her forgive as readily as she could err and in hopes of reclaiming her to the paths of virtue forget that she was either her enemy or her superior though the one she had reason to apprehend and the other she saw i was become  nay would not this behavior of mine very probably operate on a much higher and nobler subject her dear naughty master and let him see the force and amiableness of a virtuous habit that there must be something in those laws that could make so young a creature pursue them in an instance so difficult to some minds and especially to the passionate and highborn that of forgiving injuries when in ones power to resent and of returning good for evil  and then when no sullen behavior to the poor wretch on my side took place no distant airs were affected no angry brow put on nor sharpness of speech to one who might expect all these from me would it not show him that i was sincere in my forgiveness that i was not able to bear malice was a stranger to revenge had truly that softness of nature and placableness of disposition which he would wish for in a person he thought to honor which he holds to be the greatest merit in our sex and which i dare say your ladyship will join with me in opinion is indispensably necessary for a happy life in the person who is his wife  then i have no notion of that slight distinction i have so often heard between forgive and forget when persons have a mind to split hairs and to distinguish away their christian duties by a word and say i must forgive such an action but i will never forget it when i would rather say i will remember such an action in order for my future guard but i will forgive it as often as i remember it or else i will try to forget it for ever if it will occasion a breach in my christian charity  after what i have said i will not name lesser considerations such as that of my being forced to accompany with the poor woman and my being destitute of the company of my own sex but of such as were too inferior and stupid for me to take notice of in the prospect before me  but one thing i may mention further might it not ladies be right that by keeping her i should make the world think that mr b had not gone such very wicked lengths as would have been imagined if she had not been supportable to me in the same house which moreover those persons who might not know those reasons which it was not to your dear brothers credit to give might have imputed to me as arrogance or revenge and so brought still greater disgrace upon the choice he had made of me as if i would take as much upon me as though i were to be the obliger instead of the obliged and who knows besides what she might have reported of both had she been dismissed  how then dearest ladies if these considerations have any weight could i act otherwise than i did either with respect to your honored brother myself or the poor woman and when i tell your ladyship that i have all the reason in the world to be pleased with this manner of acting in the confidence it has given me with mr b and his good opinion of the sincerity of my charity and in what i was very desirous of its effects upon the poor woman i dare say both your ladyships opinions will be in my favor on this head  but your dear brother has just sent me word that supper waits for me and the post moreover being going off i defer till the next opportunity what i have to say as to these good effects and am mean time  your ladyships most obliged and faithful servant p b  letter xvi my dear lady i will now acquaint you with the good effect my behavior to mrs jewkes has had upon her as a further justification of my conduct toward the poor woman  that she began to be affected as i wished appeared to me before i left the hall not only in the conversations i had with her after my happiness was completed but it still appears in her general demeanor to the servants to the neighbors and in her devout behavior at church but still more particularly in a letter i have received from miss darnford i dare say your ladyship will be pleased with the perusal of the whole letter although a part of it would answer my present design and in confidence that you will excuse for the sake of its other beauties the high and undeserved praises which misss goodness makes her so lavishly to bestow upon me i will transcribe it all  from miss darnford to mrs b my dear neighbor that was i must depend upon your known goodness to excuse me for not writing before now in answer to your letter of compliment to us for the civilities and favors as you call them which you received from us in lincolnshire where we were infinitely more obliged to you than you to us  the truth is my papa has been much disordered with a kind of rambling rheumatism to which the physicians learnedly speaking give the name of arthritica vaga or the flying gout and when he ails ever so little it signifies nothing concealing his infirmities where they are so well known and when he cares not who knows them he is so peevish and wants so much attendance that my mamma and her two girls one of which is as waspish as her papa you may be sure i dont mean myself have much ado to make his worship keep the peace and i being his favorite when he is indisposed because i have most patience if i may give myself a good word he calls upon me continually to read to him when he is grave which is not often indeed and to tell him sories and sing to him when he is merry and so i have been employed as a principal person about him till i have frequently become sad to make him cheerful and happy when i could do it at any rate for once in a pet he flung a book at my head because i had not attended him for two hours and he could not bear to be slighted by little bastards that was his word that were fathered upon him for his vexation  ah  thought i but i durst not say it  if thy lady had been half as lively as thou have been in thy day my worthy varner thou might have had some reasons for the epithet  forgive me dear friend you know i am a bold girl but i love him dearly for all that and honor him too and he knows i do  and what is strange if he did not love me again would not have flung his book at my head  o these men fathers or husbands much alike the one tyrannical the other insolent so that between one and the other a poor girl has nothing for it but a few weeks courship and perhaps a first months briry if that and then she is as much a slave to a husband as she was a vassal to her father  i mean if the father be a sir simon darnford and the spouse a mr b  but i will be a little more grave for a graver occasion calls for it and yet an occasion that will give you real pleasure it is the very great change that the example you have left behind you has had upon your housekeeper  you desired her to keep up as much regularity as she could among the servants there and she is next to exemplary in it so that she has every ones good word she speaks of her lady not only with respect but reverence and calls it a blessed day for all the family and particularly for herself that you came into lincolnshire she reads prayers or makes one of the servants read them every sunday night and never misses being at church morning and afternoon and is preparing herself by mr peterss advice and direction for receiving the sacrament which she earnestly longs to receive and says it will be the seal of her reformation  mr peters gives us this account of her and says she is full of contrition for her past misspent life and is often asking him if such and such sins can be forgiven and among them names her vile behavior to her angellady as she calls you  it seems she has written a letter to you which passed mr peterss revisal before she had the courage to send it and prides herself that you have favored her with an answer to it which she says when she is dead will be found in a cover of black silk next her heart for any thing from your hand she is sure will be efficacious to her to make her keep her good purposes and for that reason she places it there and when she has any bad thoughts or is guilty of any faulty word or passionate expression she recollects her ladys letter and that recovers her to a calm and puts her again into a better frame  as she has written to you it is possible i might have spared you the trouble of reading this account of her but yet you will not be displeased that so free a liver and speaker should have some testimonial besides her own assurances to vouch for the sincerity of her reformation  what a happy lady are you that persuasion dwells upon your tongue and reformation follows your example we all hear continually of your excellencies every body is proud of speaking of you and of having something to say of what they observe in you this makes us long more and more to see you here again my papa the other day said he wished you would undertake him  this is not the least of what is admirable in you that professed rakes and libertines who take upon themselves to ridicule seriousness in every body else speak of you with reverence and while they attribute pharisaical pride or affectation or hypocrisy to other good persons they say you are a credit to religion and that adorns you and you that  happy thrice happy mrs b may you long live the ornament of your sex and a credit to all your acquaintance such examples as you set how are they wanted in an age so depraved i fear not making you proud since praise but puts the worthy upon enlarging their deservings for who as i heard you once say can sit down easy under imputed attributes they do not deserve  if they will not disclaim praise they have not merited when applied to their conduct they give an earnest by receiving it that they will endeavor to do it and ought never to rest till they have made themselves a title to it  happy mr b  but why say i so since with more propriety i may say happy everyone who sees who knows who converses with mrs b not more the glory of the humble cot than she is capable of adorning the princely palace  if you knew how i love you you would favor me with your presence and conversation if it was in your own power to do so and then i would rank myself among the happies and call myself   the happy polly darnford   your ladyship will as i said forgive me what may appear like vanity in this communication miss darnford is a charming young lady i always admired her but her letters are the sweetest kindest  but i am too much the subject of their encomiums and so will say no more but add here the copy of the poor womans letter to me and your ladyship will see what an ample correspondence you have opened to yourself if you go on to countenance it   honored madam i have been long laboring under two difficulties the desire i had to write to you and the fear of being thought presumptuous if i did but i will depend on your goodness so often tried and put pen to paper in that very closet and on that very desk which once were so much used by your dear self when i was acting a part that now cuts me to the heart to think of but you forgave me madam and showed me you had too much goodness to revoke your forgiveness and could i have silenced the reproaches of my own heart i should have had no cause to think i had ever offended  but oh madam how has your goodness to me which once filled me with so much gladness now on reflection made me sorrowful and at times miserable  to think i should act so barbarously as i did by so much sweetness and so much forgivingness every place that i remember to have used you hardly in how does it now fill me with sadness and makes me often smite my breast and sit down with tears and groans bemoaning my vile actions and my hard heart how many places are there in this melancholy fine house that call one thing or other to my remembrance that gives me remorse but the pond and the woodhouse whence i dragged you so mercilesly after i had driven you to despair almost what thoughts do they bring to my remembrance  then my wicked instigations  what an odious wretch was i  had his honor been as abandoned as myself what a virtue had been destroyed between his orders and my too rigorous execution of them nay stretching them to show my wicked zeal to serve a master that though i honored i should not as you more than once hinted to me but with no effect at all so impenetrably wicked was my heart have so well obeyed in his unlawful purposes  his honor has made you amends has done justice to your merits and so atoned his fault but as for me it is out of my power ever to make reparation all that is left me is to let your ladyship fee that your pious example has made such an impression upon me that i am miserable now in the reflection upon my past guilt    you have forgiven me and god will i hope for the creature cannot be more merciful than the creator that is all my hope  yet sometimes i dread that i am forgiven here at least not punished in order to be punished the more hereafter  what will then become of the unhappy wretch that has thus lived in a state of sin and had so qualified herself by a course of wickedness as to be thought a proper instrument for the worst purposes that any one could be employed in  good your ladyship let not my honored master see this letter he will think i have the boldness to reflect upon him when god knows my heart i only write to condemn myself and my unwomanly actions as you were pleased often most justly to call them  but i might go on thus for ever accusing myself not considering who i am writing to and whose precious time i am taking up  but what i chiefly write for i am not come to yet that is to beg your ladyships prayers for me for oh madam i fear i shall else be for ever miserable we every week hear of the good you do and the charity you extend to the bodies of the miserable extend i beseech you good madam to the unhappy jewkes the mercy of your prayers and tell me if you think i have not sinned beyond hope of pardon for there is a woe denounced against the presumptuous sinner  your ladyship assured me at your departure on the confession of my remorse for my misdoings and my promise of amendment that you would take it for a proof of my being in earnest if i would endeavor to keep up a regularity among the servants here if i would subdue them with kindness as i had owned myself subdued and if i would endeavor to make every one think that the best security they could give of their doing their duty to their master in his absence was by doing it to god almighty whose omniscience made him always present this i remember your ladyship told me was the best test of fidelity and duty that any servants could show since it was impossible without religion but that worldly convenience or selfinterest must be the main tie and when that failed the worst actions might succeed if servants thought they should find their sordid advantage in sacrificing their duty  so well am i convinced of this truth that i hope i have begun the example to good effect and as no one in the family was so wicked as i and so they had less pains to take to be reformed you will take pleasure to know that you have now servants here whom you need not be ashamed to call yours  it is true i found it a little difficult at first to keep them within sight of their duty after your ladyship departed but when they saw i was in earnest and used them courteously as you advised and as your usage of me convinced me was the rightest usage when they were told i had your commands to acquaint you how they conformed to your injunctions the task became easy and i hope we shall all be still more and more worthy of the favor of so good a lady and so bountiful a master  i dare not presume upon the honor of a line to your unworthy servant yet it would pride me much if i could have it but i shall ever pray for your ladyships and his honors felicity as becomes  your undeserving servant k jewkes   i have already with these transcribed letters of miss darnford and mrs jewkes written a great deal but nevertheless as there yet remains one passage in your ladyships letter relating to mrs jewkes that seems to require an answer i will take notice of it if i shall not quite tire your patience  that passage is this lady betty rightly observes says your ladyship that he knew what a vile woman she mrs jewkes was when he put you into her power and no doubt employed her because he was sure she would answer all his purposes and that therefore she should have had very little opinion of the sincerity of his reformation while he was so solicitous in keeping her there  i make no doubt madam that mrs jewkes was placed there as one who would be subservient to every bad design and that this was the reason of mr bs causing me to be carried off to that house but then this was a proof too of my hopeless condition and of my want of power to make his reformation any part of my terms  alas madam i was to take him as i found him as i have already hinted glad of my own safety and had only to hope that god and he only could do it for neither law nor justice had stood in the naughty gentlemans way would perfect the good work already begun in him and having first made him refrain from what he had absolutely determined upon would next let him see his error and at last give him grace to reform  but lady betty adds that had she been in my case she would have had one struggle for mrs jewkess dismission let it have been taken as it would and he that was so well pleased with my virtue must have thought this a natural consequence of it if he was in earnest to reclaim  but alas madam he was not so well pleased with my virtue for sakes sake as lady betty thinks he was he would have been glad at that very time to have found me less resolved on that score he did not so much as pretend to be in earnest to reclaim no not he  he had entertained as it proved a strong passion for me this passion had been heightened by my resisting of it his pride and the advantages he had both of person and fortune would not let him brook control and when he could not have me upon his own terms god turned his evil purposes to good ones and he resolved to submit to my own or rather to such as he found i would not yield to him without for all this time i had no terms to propose neither my low fortunes my unjust captivity nor my sex nor unexperienced youth not a soul near me whom i could call my friend or whose advice i could ask permitted me to offer at making terms with him had i been disposed to have disputed his will or his intercession for the woman which as i have said i was not i had but one steady purpose to adhere to and having grace given me to adhere to that he resolved since he could not conquer his passion for me to make me his with honor but still i doubt as i said this was not for the love of virtue at that time that came afterward and i hope will be always his governing motive in his future actions and then i shall be happy indeed  but lady betty thinks i was to blame to put mrs jewkes upon a foot in the present i made on my nuptials with mrs jervis but the case was rather this that i put mrs jervis on a foot with mrs jewkes for the dear gentleman had named the sum he would have me give mrs jewkes see vol ii p      and i would not give mrs jervis less because i loved her better nor more could i give her on that occasion without making such a difference between two persons equal in station on a solemnity too where one was present and assisting the other not as would have shown such a partiality as might have induced their master to conclude i was not so sincere in my forgiveness as he hoped from me and as i really was  but a stronger reason still was behind that i could in a much more agreeable manner both to mrs jervis and myself show my love and my gratitude to the dear good woman and this i have taken care to do in the manner i will submit to your ladyship at the tribunal of whose judgment i am willing all my actions respecting your dear brother shall be tried and i hope your ladyship will not think me a too profuse or lavish creature i hope you will not have reason for it yet if you think you have pray my dear lady dont spare me for if you shall judge me profuse in one article i will endeavor to save it in another  but i will make what i have to say on this head the subject of a letter by itself and am mean time  your ladyships most obliged and obedient servant p b  letter xvii my dear lady it is needful in order to let you more intelligibly into the subject where i left off in my last that your ladyship should know that your generous brother has made me his almoner as i was my late dear ladys and has ordered mr longman to pay me  0 l see vol ii p     quarterly for purposes of which he requires no account though i have one always ibid p     ready to produce and he has given me other sums to enable me to do all the good i can to distressed objects at my first setting out thus enabled your ladyship knows not how many honest hearts i have made glad already and how many i hope to rejoice before a year is at an end and yet come within my limits  now madam as i knew mrs jervis was far from being easy in her circumstances thinking herself obliged to pay old vol i p    debts for two extravagant children who are both dead and maintaining in schooling and clothes three of their children which always keeps her bare i took upon me one day as she and i sat together at our needles to say to her as we are always running over old stories when we are alone my good mrs jervis will you allow me to ask you after your own private affairs and if you are tolerably easy in them  you are very good madam said she to concern yourself about my poor matters so much as you have to employ your thoughts about and so much as every moment of your time is taken up from the hour you rise to the time of your rest but i can with great pleasure attribute it to your bounty and that of my honored master that i am easier and easier every day  but tell me my dear mrs jervis said i how your matters particularly stand i love to mingle concerns with my friends and as i hide nothing from you i hope you will treat me with equal freedom for i always loved you and always will and nothing but death shall divide our friendship  she had tears of gratitude in her eyes and taking off her spectacles i cannot bear said she so much goodness  oh my lady   oh my pamela say replied i  how often must i chide you for calling me any thing but your pamela when we are alone together   my heart said she will burst with your goodness  i cannot bear it   but you must bear it and bear still worse exercises to your grateful heart i can tell you that a pretty thing truly here i a poor helpless girl raised from poverty and distress by the generosity of the best of gentlemen only because i was young and sightly shall put on ladyairs to a gentlewoman born the wisdom of whose years and her faithful services and good management make her a much greater merit in this family than i can pretend to have  and return shall i in the day of my power insult and haughiness for the kindness and benevolence i received from her in that of my indigence  indeed i will not forgive you my dear mrs jervis if i think you capable of looking upon me in any other light than as your daughter for you have been a mother to me when the absence of my own could not afford me the comfort and good counsel i received every day from you   then moving my chair nearer her and taking her hand and wiping with my handkerchief in my other her reverend cheek come come my dear second mother said i call me your daughter your pamela i have passed many sweet hours with you under that name and as i have but too seldom such an opportunity as this open to me your worthy heart and let me know if i cannot make my second mother as easy and happy as our dear master has made my first   she hung her head on her shoulder and i waited till the discharge of her tears gave time for utterance to her words provoking only her speech by saying you used to have three grandchildren to provide for in clothes and schooling they are all living i hope  yes madam they are living and your last bounty twenty guineas was a great sum and all at once made me very easy and very happy   how easy and how happy mrs jervis  why my dear lady i paid five to one old creditor of my unhappy sons five to a second and twoandanhalf to two others in proportion to their respective demands and with the other five i paid off all arrears of the poor childrens schooling and maintenance and every one is satisfied and easy and all declare they will never do harsh things by me if they are paid no more  but tell me mrs jervis what you owe in the world put all together and you and i will contrive with justice to our best friend to do all we can to make you quite easy for at your time of life i cannot bear that you shall have any thing to disturb you which i can remove and so my dear mrs jervis let me know all  come i know your debts dear just good woman as you are like davids sins are ever before you so come putting my hand in her pocket let me be a friendly pickpocket let me take out your memorandumbook and we will see how all matters stand and what can be done come i see you are too much moved your worthy heart is too much affected pulling out her book which she always has about her i will go to my closet and return presently  so i left her to recover her spirits and retired with the good womans book to my closet  your dear brother stepping into the parlour just after i had gone out where is your lady mrs jervis said he and being told came up to me what ails the good woman below my dear said he i hope you and she have had no words  no indeed sir answered i  if we had i am sure it would have been my fault but i have picked her pocket of her memorandumbook in order to look into her private affairs to see if i cannot with justice to our common benefactor make her as easy as you sir have made my other dear parents  a blessing said the dear gentleman upon my charmers benevolent heart  i will leave every thing to your discretion my dear  do all the good you prudently can to your mrs jervis  i clasped my bold arms about him the starting tear testifying my gratitude dearest dear sir said i you affect me as much as i did mrs jervis and if any one but you had a right to ask what ails your pamela as you do what ails mrs jervis i must say i am hourly so much oppressed by your goodness that there is hardly any bearing ones own joy  he saluted me and said i was a dear obliging creature but said he i came to tell you that after we have dined well take a turn if you please to lady arthurs she has a family of london friends for her guests and begs i will prevail upon you to give her your company and attend you myself only to drink tea with her for i have told her we are to have friends to sup with us  i will attend you sir replied i most willingly although i doubt i am to be made a show of  something like it said he  for she has promised them this favor  i need not dress otherwise than i am  no he was pleased to say i was always what he wished me to be  so he left me to my good works those were his kind words and i ran over mrs jerviss accounts and found a balance drawn of all her matters in one leaf in a very clear manner and a thankful acknowlegement to god for her masters last bounty which had enabled her to give satisfaction to others and do herself great pleasure as she had written underneath  the balance of all was    l    s and odd pence and i went to my escritoire and took out  0 l and down i hasted to my good mrs jervis and i said to her here my dear good friend is your pocketbook but are    or    l all you owe or are bound for in the world  it is madam said she and enough too it is a great sum but it is in four hands and they are all in pretty good circumstances and so convinced of my honesty that they will never trouble me for it for i have reduced the debt every year something since i have been in my masters service  nor shall it ever be in any bodys power said i to trouble you i will tell you how well order it  so i sat down and made her sit down by me here my dear mrs jervis is  0 l it is not so much to me now as the sea vol i p    two guineas were to you that you would have given me if i would have accepted of them at my going away from this house to my fathers as i thought but i will not give it you neither at least at present as you shall hear indeed i will not make you so uneasy as that comes to but here take this and pay the thirtyfive pounds odd money to the utmost farthing and the remaining four pounds odd will be a little fund in advance toward the childrens schooling and thus you shall repay it i always designed as our dear master added five guineas per annum to your salary in acknowlegement of the pleasure he took in your services when i was pamela andrews to add five pounds per annum to it from the time i became mrs b but from that time for so many years to come you shall receive no more than you did till the whole forty pounds be repaid and so my dear mrs jervis you will not have any obligation to me you know but for the advance and that is a poor matter not to be spoken of and i will have leave for it for fear i should die  had your ladyship seen the good dear womans behavior on this occasion you would never have forgot it she could not speak tears ran down her cheeks in plentiful currents her modest hand put gently from her my offering hand and her bosom heaved and she sobbd with the painful tumult that seemed to struggle within her and which for some few moments made her incapable of speaking  at last i rising and putting my arm round her neck and wiping her eyes and kissing her cheek she cried my dear my excellent lady it is too much too much i cannot bear all this  and then she threw herself at my feet for i was not strong enough to hinder it and with uplifted hands may god almighty said she  i kneeled by her and clasping her hands in mine both uplifted together  may god almighty said i drowning her voice with my louder voice bless us both together for many happy years and may he bless and reward the dear gentleman who has thus enabled me to make the widows heart to sing for joy  dear good woman said i rising and raising her do you think you shall outdo me in prayers and praises to the fountain of all our mercies  do you think you shall  and while i am empowered to do good to so many worthy objects abroad shall i forget to make my dear mrs jervis happy at home  and thus my lady did i force upon the good womans acceptance the forty pounds  permit me madam to close this letter here and to resume the subject in my next till when i have the honor to be  your ladyships most obliged and faithful servant p b  letter xviii my dear lady i now resume my last subject where i left off that your ladyship may have the whole before you at one view  i went after dinner with my dear benefactor to lady arthurs and met with fresh calls upon me for humility having the too natural effects of the praises and prosessed admiration of that ladys guests as well as my dear mr bs and those of mr and mrs arthur to guard myself against and your good brother was pleased to entertain me in the chariot going and coming with an account of the orders he had given in relation to the london house which is actually taken and the furniture he should direct for it so that i had no opportunity to tell him what i had done in relation to mrs jervis  but after supper retiring from company to my closet when his friends were gone he came up to me about our usual bedtime he inquired kindly after my employment which was trying to read in the french telemachus for my lady i am learning french i will assure you and who do you think is my master  why the best i could have in the world your dearest brother who is pleased to say i am no dunce how inexcusable should i be if i was with such a master who teaches me on his knee and rewards me with a kiss whenever i do well and says i have already nearly mastered the accent and pronunciation which he tells me is a great difficulty got over  i requested him to render for me into english two or three places that were beyond my reach and when he had done it he asked me in french what i had done for mrs jervis  i said permit me sir for i am not proficient enough to answer you in my new tongue in english to say i have made the good woman quite happy and if i have your approbation i shall be as much so myself in this instance as i am in all others  i dare answer for your prudence my dear he was pleased to say but this is your favorite let me know when you have so bountiful a heart to strangers what you do for your favorites  i then said permit my bold eye sir to watch yours as i obey you and you know you must turn from me then or else how shall i look you in the face how see as i proceed whether you are displeased for you will not chide me in words so partial have you the goodness to be to all my foibles  he put his arm round my waist and looked down nowandthen as i desired for o madam he is all condescension and goodness to his unworthy yet grateful pamela and i told him all i have written to your ladyship about the forty pounds  and now dear sir said i half hiding my face on his bosom you have heard what i have done chide or beat your pamela if you please it shall be all kind from you and matter of future direction and caution  he raised my head and kissed me two or three times saying thus then i chide i beat my angel  and yet i have one fault to find with you and let mrs jervis if not in bed come up to us and hear what it is for i will expose you as you deserve before her my polly being in hearing attending to know if i wanted her assistance to undress i bad her call mrs jervis and though i thought from his kind looks and kind words as well as tender behavior that i had not much to fear yet i was impatient to know what my fault was for which i was so to be exposed  the good woman came and as she entered with all that modesty which is so graceful in her he moved his chair further from me and with a set aspect but not unpleasant said  step in mrs jervis your lady for so madam he will always call me to mrs jervis and the servants has incurred my censure and i would not tell her in what till i had you face to face  she looked surprised  now on me now on her dear master and i not knowing what he would say looked a little attentive  i am sorry  i am very sorry for it sir said she courtsying low  but should be more sorry if i were the unhappy occasion  why mrs jervis i cannot say but it is on your account that i must blame her  this gave us both confusion but especially the good woman for still i hoped much from his kind behavior to me just before  and she said indeed sir i could never deserve   he interrupted her my charge against you pamela said he is that of niggardliness and no other for i will put you both out of your pain you ought not to have found out the method of repayment  the dear creature said he to mrs jervis seldom does any thing that can be mended but i think when your good conduct deserved an annual acknowlegement from me in addition to your salary the lady should have showed herself no less pleased with your service than the gentleman  had it been for old acquaintancesake for sexsake she should not have given me cause to upbraid her on this head  but i will tell you that you must look upon the forty pounds you have as the effect of a just distinction on many accounts and your salary from last quarterday shall be advanced as the dear niggard intended it some years hence and let me only add that when my pamela first begins to show a coldness to her mrs jervis i shall then suspect she is beginning to decline in that humble virtue which is now peculiar to herself and makes her the delight of all who converse with her  this was what he was pleased to say thus with the most graceful generosity and a nobleness of mind truly peculiar to himself was he pleased to act and what does your ladyship think could mrs jervis or i say to him  why indeed nothing at all  we could only look upon one another with our eyes full and our hearts full of a gratitude that would not permit either of us to speak but which expressed itself at last in a manner he was pleased to call more elegant than words and that was with uplifted folded hands and tears of joy  oh my dear lady how many opportunities have the beneficent rich to make themselves as well as their fellow creatures happy all that i could think or say or act was but my duty before what a sense of obligation then must i lie under to this most generous of men  but here let me put an end to this tedious subject the principal part of which can have no excuse if it may not serve as a proof of my cheerful compliance with your ladyships commands that i recite every thing that is of concern to me and with the same freedom as i was wont to do to my dear parents  i have done it and at the same time have offered what i had to plead in behalf of my conduct to the two housekeepers which you expected from me and i shall therefore close this my humble defense if i may so call it with the assurance that i am  my dearest lady your obliged and faithful servant p b  letter xix from lady davers to mrs b in answer to the six last letters  where she had it i cannot tell but i think i never met with the fellow of her in my life at any age are as i remember my brothers words speaking of his pamela in the vol i p  0 early part of your papers in truth you are a surprising creature and every letter we have from you we have new subjects to admire you for  do you think lady betty said i when i had read to the end of the subject about mrs jervis i will not soon set out to hit this charming girl a box of the ear or two  for what lady davers said she  for what replied i  why dont you see how many slaps of the face the bold slut hits me  i will ladyairs her i will  i will teach her to reproach me and so many of her betters with her cottage excellencies and improvements that shame our education  why you dear charming pamela did you only exceed me in words i could forgive you for there may be a knack and a volubility as to words that a natural talent may supply but to be thus outdone in thought and in deed who can bear it and in so young an insulter too  well pamela look to it when i see you you shall feel the weight of my hand or  the pressure of my lip one or the other depend on it very quickly for here instead of my stooping as i had thought it would be to call you sister i shall be forced to think in a little while that you ought not to own me as yours till i am nearer your standard  but to come to business i will summarily take notice of the following particulars in all your obliging letters in order to convince you of my friendship by the freedom of my observations on the subjects you touch upon  first then i am highly pleased with what you write of the advantages you received from the favor of my dear mother and as you know many things of her by your attendance upon her in the last three or four years of her life i must desire you will give me as opportunity shall offer all you can recollect in relation to the honored lady and of her behavior and kindness to you and with a retrospect to your own early beginnings the dawnings of this your bright day of excellence and this not only i but the countess and lady betty her sister lady jenny too with whom i am going over your papers again request of you    i am much pleased with your kentish account though we wished you had been more particular in some parts of it for we are greatly taken with your descriptions and your conversation pieces yet i own your honest fathers letters and yours a good deal supply that defect as our pleasure in reading your relations makes us call it your parents are honest discreet folks i see that i have a value for them and youre the prudentest creature i ever knew in all your ways particularly in the advice you give them about your more distant relations and to aim at nothing beyond their natural sphere  every tittle is right and as it should be on these accounts it is that all the world will allow that you and your parents too merit the fortune you have met with    i am highly delighted with the account you give me of my brothers breaking to you the affair of sally godfrey and your conduct upon it it is a sweet story as he brought it on and as you relate it the wretch has been very just in his account of it but dont you think he was a sad young fellow well may you be thankful for your escape well may you  your behavior was what i admire and so we do all but none of us think we could have imitated it in all its parts we are in love with your charitable reflections in favor of the poor lady and the more as she certainly deserved them and a better mother too than she had and a faithfuller lover than she met with    you have exactly hit his temper in your declared love of miss i see child you know your man and never fear but you will hold him if you can go on thus to act and outdo your sex but i should think you might as well not insist upon having miss with you for the girl may be pert perhaps insolent you know who is her father you would not care to check her for several reasons and this may make you uneasy for if you did he might take it amiss let your motives be ever so good so i think you would better see her nowandthen at the dairyhouse or at school than have her with you  but this i leave to your own discretion and his good pleasure to determine upon for in the latter it must rest let you or me or any body say what we will    you have fully and to our satisfaction answered our objections to your behavior to mrs jewkes we had not considered your circumstances quite so thoroughly as we ought to have done you are a charming girl and all your motives are so just that we shall be a little more cautious for the future how we censure you we are particularly pleased with the triumphs of your innocence over his and her guilt and agree that they are the rightest and besttobedefended motives for pride that ever were set before us  in short i say with the countess this good girl is not without her pride but it is the pride that becomes and can only attend the innocent heart and i will warrant said her ladyship nobody will become her station so well as one who is capable of so worthy a pride as this  but what a curtainlecture had thou pamela a noble one do thou call it  why what a wretch have thou got to expect thou should never expostulate against his lordly will even when in the wrong till thou have obeyed it and of consequence joined in the evil he imposes he says indeed in small points but i suppose he is to judge which are and which are not small  thus i remember my brother himself took notice once of a proposal in the house of commons to grant the crown a very great sum to answer civillist deficiencies which being opposed by the minority the minister found out an expedient that they would give the money first and examine into the merits of the demand afterward so we read that in some countries an accused person is put to death and tried afterward and all he has to hope for while he lives is that his relations and his own family will be released from obloquy if an acquittal ensues  much good may do you with such an husband says lady betty  every body will admire you but no one will have reason to envy you upon those principles yet i dont know how it is but this is evident that at present there is not a happier couple in the world than you two are    i am pleased with your promise of sending me what you think i shall like to see out of those papers you choose not to show me collectedly this is very obliging youre a good girl and i love you dearly    we have all smiled at your paradox pamela that his marrying you was an instance of his pride the thought though is pretty enough and ingenious but whether it will hold or not i will not just now examine    your observation on the forget and forgive we are much pleased with and think you have distinguished well on that head    you are a very good girl for sending me a copy of miss darnfords letter she is a charming young lady i always had a great opinion of her merit her letter abundantly confirms me in it i hope you will communicate to me every letter that passes between you and pray send me in your next a copy of your answer to her letter i must insist upon it i think   0 i am glad with all my heart to hear of poor jewkess reformation your example carries all before it but pray oblige me with your answer to her letter dont think me unreasonable it is all for your sake you must needs know that or you know nothing for i think you deserve all miss darnford says of you and that is a great deal too  pray  have you shown jewkess letter to your good friend  lady betty wans to know if you have what he could say to it for she says it cuts him to the quick and i think so too if he takes it as he ought but as you say he is above loving virtue for virtues sake i warrant him he likes it in a wife because it is a husbands security against the lex talionis there is a great deal in that i can tell you i once heard the wretch hold an argument that women had no souls i asked him if he was to marry whether he would have his wife act as if she believed this doctrine to be good that was another thing he said he was for having his wife think she had he must own such a belief could do her no harm ah pamela theory and practice never was such a rake for one not quite a town debauchee     your manner of acting by mrs jervis with so handsome a regard to my brothers interest her behavior upon it and your relation of the whole and of his generous spirit in approving reproving and improving your prudent generosity make no inconsiderable figure in your papers and lady betty says hang him he has some excellent qualities too  it is impossible not to think well of him and his good actions go a great way toward atoneing for his bad but you pamela have the glory of all we desire particularly that you will never omit any of those moving scenes which you so well describe be the occasion what it will for they are nature and that is your excellence keep to that for one more learned i verily think could not write as you do nor instruct and delight and move all at once so very ingagingly     i am glad you are learning french thou art a happy girl in thy teacher and he is a happy man in his scholar we are pleased with the pretty account you give us of his method of instructing and rewarding twould be strange if you did not learn any language quickly under such methods and with such encouragements from the man you love were your genius less apt than it is but we wished you had enlarged on that subject for such fondness of men to their wives who have been any time married is so rare and so unexpected from my brother that we thought you should have written a side upon that subject at least  what a bewitching girl art thou what an exemplar to wives now as well as thou wast before to maidens thou can tame lions i dare say if thou would try  reclaim a rake in the meridian of his libertinism and make such an one as my brother not only marry thee but love thee better at several months end than he did the first day if possible wonderful girl yet usest thou no arts but honest ones such as prudence directs nature points out and such as make duty delightful even commanding most when thou seem most to submit  it must be owned indeed that thou have no brutal mind to deal with bad as he is it must be said that thou have a sensible and a generous heart to work upon one who takes no glory in the blind submission of a slave but like a true british monarch delights to reign in a free rather than in an abject mind yet is he jealous as a tyrant of his prerogative but you have found the way to lay that watchful dragon asleep and so possess the golden fruits of content and true pleasure the due reward of your matchless conduct  now my dear pamela i think i have taken notice of the most material articles in your letters and have no more to say to you but write on and oblige us and mind to send me the copy of your letter to miss darnford of that you wrote to poor penitent jewkes and every article i have written about and all that comes into your head or that passes and you will oblige  yours etc b davers  letter xx my dear lady i read with pleasure your commands in your last kind and obliging letter and you may be sure of a ready obedience in every one of them that is in my power  that which i can most easily do i will first do and that is to transcribe the answer i sent to miss darnford and that to mrs jewkes the former of which and a long one it is is as follows see miss darnfords letter p    of this volume   dear miss i begin now to be afraid i shall not have the pleasure and benefit i promised myself of passing a fortnight or three weeks at the hall in your sweet conversation and that of your worthy family as well as those others in your agreeable neighborhood whom i must always remember with equal honor and delight  the occasion will be principally that we expect very soon a visit from lord and lady davers who propose to tarry here a fortnight at least and after that the advanced season will carry us to london where mr b has taken a house for his winter residence and in order to attend parliament a service he says which he has been more deficient in hitherto than he can either answer to his constituents or to his own conscience for though he says he is but one yet if any good motion should be lost by one every absent member who is independent has it to reproach himself with the consequences that may follow on the loss of that good which might otherwise redound to the commonwealth and besides he says such excuses as he could make every one might plead and then public affairs might as well be left to the administration and no parliament be chosen  he observed further on this subject that every absent member in such cases indirectly abets the minister be he who he will in all his designs be they what they will and has even less excuse to his country than the man who for a transitory benefit to his private family takes a pension or reward for his vote since the difference is only that the one passively ruins his country by neglect and indolence which can do nobody good and the other more actively by corruption which though ruinous in the end to the whole public in which his own private is included yet serves to answer some present turn or benefit to himself or family  see you my dear miss from the humble cottager what a public person your favored friend is grown and behold how easy it is for a bold mind to look forward and perhaps forgetting what she was now she imagines she has a stake in the country takes upon herself to be as important as significant as if like my dear miss darnford she had been born to it but if nevertheless i am censured for troubling my head with politics let me answer that i am at liberty i hope to tell you mr bs sentiments of these high matters and that is all i have done  well but my dearest miss may i not presume to ask whether if the mountain cannot come to mahomet mahomet will not come to the mountain since lady daverss visit is so uncertain as to its beginning and duration and so great a favor as i am to look upon it and really shall it being her first visit to me  and since we must go and take possession of our london residence why cannot sir simon spare to us the dear lady whom he could use so hardly and whose attendance though he is indeed entitled to all her duty he did not just in that instance quite so much deserve   well but after all sir simon would i say if i had been in presence at his peevish hour you are a fine gentleman are you not to show your good daughter that because she did not come soon enough to you she came too soon and did ever papa before you put a good book for such i doubt not it was because you were in affliction though so little affected by its precepts to such a bad use as parents examples are so prevalent suppose miss had taken this very book and flung it at her sister miss nanny at her waitingmaid and so it had gone through the family would it not have been an excuse for every one to say that the father and head of the family had set the example  but again sir simon suppose you had hurt the sweet dovelike eyes of my dear miss darnford  suppose you had bruised or broken the fine skin of any part of that fine face which gives at first sight so bright a promise of her still finer mind what let me ask you sir could you have said for yourself how would the dear misss appearance with one sweet eye perhaps muffled up with a plastered forehead or a veiled check hiding herself from every body else but you and her grieved mamma and pitying sister reproached you for so rash an act  nay reproached you the more by her unreproaching obligingness and cheerful duty than if were she capable of it she could have spoken in sharp complaints and expostulatory wailings   you almost wish my dear miss tells me that i would undertake you  this is very good of you sir simon might i would his indulgent patience suffer me to run on thus have added  but i hope since you are so sensible that you want to be undertaken and since this peevish rashness convinces me that you do that you will undertake yourself that you will not when your indisposition makes the attendance and duty of my dear lady and misses necessary make it more uncomfortable to them by adding a difficulty of being pleased and an impatience of spirit to the concern their duty and affection make them have for you and at least resolve never to take a book into your hand again if you cannot make a better use of it than you did then  pray my dear miss tell your papa that i beg the favor of him to present me this book and i will put a mark upon it and it shall never more either give or receive such disgrace i warrant it be it what it will i will present him with as good a one  i will write in it memorandum this book reversing the authors good intention had like to have done mischief next to unpardonable  or this book instead of subduing the readers passions i take it for granted you see miss it was senecas morals or some such good book had like to have been the cause of a violent and peevish evil  henceforth be thou condemned unavailing teacher to stand by thyself on a lone shelf in my closet a shelf most out of mine or any other persons reach for pretending to prescribe rules for subduing the passions in so inefficacious a manner and consigned to dust and cobwebs not once presume in hope to hide thy conscious guilt to squeeze thyself into rank with better or at least with more convincing teachers  but do you think my dear miss sir simon would be angry if opportunity had offered and i had been thus bold if you think so dont let him see i had such thoughts in my head but after all if he were to have been thus freely treated by me and if he should have blushed with anger at my freedom it is but what he ought to bear from me for more than once has he made me blush for shame at much greater on his part nay and that too in presence of his virtuous daughters so that i have but half my revenge upon him yet  and will you bear malice will he say mrs b  yes sir simon i will and nothing but your amending the evil can make me forgive a gentleman that is really a gentleman who can so sadly forego his character and before any company not scruple to expose a modest virgin to the forward leer and loud laugh of younger gentlemen who durst not take such liberties of speech as they would saucily chuckle at from those taken by one of sir simons authenticating but better promising time of life  but sir simon will say i have already undertaken him were he to see this yet my lady darnford once begged i would give him a hint or two on this subject which she was pleased to say would be better received from me than from any body and if it be a little too severe it is but a just reprisal from one whose ears if he had not cruelly wounded more than once or twice or three times besides what he calls his innocent double entendres  she must have been believed by him to be neither more nor less than an hypocrite  there is for you sir simon and so here ends all my malice for now i have spoken my mind  yet i hope your dear papa will not be so angry with me neither as to deny me for this my freedom the request i make to him to your honored mamma and to your dear self for your beloved company for a month or two in bedfordshire and at london and if you might be permitted to winter with us at the latter how happy should i be it will be half done the moment you desire it sir simon loves you too well to refuse you if you are earnest in it your honored mamma is always indulgent to your requests and mr b as well in kindness to me as for the great respect he bears you joins with me to beg this favor of you and of sir simon and my lady  if it can be obtained what pleasure and improvement may i not propose to myself with so polite a companion when we are carried by mr b to the play to the opera and other of the town diversions we will work together visit together read together sing together and improve one another you me in every word you shall speak in every thing you shall do i you by my questions and desire of information which will make you open all your breast to me and so unlocking that dear storehouse of virtuous knowledge improve your own ideas the more for communicating them o my dear miss darnford how happy is it in your power to make me  i am much affected with the account you give me of mrs jewkess reformation i could have wished had i not other and stronger inducements in the pleasure of so agreeable a neighborhood and so sweet a companion that on her account i could have been down at the hall in hope to have confirmed the poor woman in her newlyassumd penitence god give her grace to persevere in it  to be an humble means of saving a soul from perdition o my dear miss darnford let me enjoy the heartravishing hope  to pluck such a brand as this out of the fire and to assist to quench its flaming susceptibility for mischief and make it useful to edifying purposes what a pleasure does this afford one how does it encourage one to proceed in the way one has been guided to pursue how does it make me hope that i am raised to my present condition in order to be an humble instrument in the hand of providence to communicate great good to others and so extend to many those benefits i have received which were they to go no further than myself what a vile what an ungrateful creature should i be  i see my dearest miss darnford how useful in every condition of life a virtuous and a serious turn of mind may be  how have i seen some ladies in upper life behave as if they thought good actions and a pious turn of thought would be so unfashionable as to make them the subjects of ridicule to the lighterdisposd world and so they are shamed out of their duty but let me make it my boast that here is such a poor girl as i raised from the cottage to the palace as i may say persevering in the good purposes which had been instilled into her by worthy though poor parents and the best of ladies her mistress and resolving to be obstinate in goodness having stood the tests of libertinism has brought the world to expect good actions from her to respect her for doing them and has even found her example efficacious through divine grace to bring over to penitence and imitation a poor creature who used to ridicule her for nothing so much as her innocence and virtue which word and thing were the constant subjects of her scorn as well as the cause of her persecution  but let me not too much dwell upon the dear thought lest i fall into the snare that of all others persons meaning well have reason to dread that of spiritual pride the most dangerous of all pride  in hopes of seeing you with us i will not enlarge on several agreeable subjects that i could touch upon with pleasure besides what i gave you in my former of my reception here and of the kindness of our genteel neighbors such particularly as the arrival here of my dear father and mother and the kind the generous entertainment they met with from my best friend his condescension in not only permitting me to attend them to kent but accompanying us thither and settling them in a most happy manner beyond their wishes and my own but yet so much in character as i may say that every one must approve his judicious benevolence the favors of my good lady davers to me who pleased with my letters has vouchsafed to become my correspondent and a thousand thousand things that i want personally to communicate to my dear miss darnford  be pleased to present my humble respects to lady darnford and to miss nanny to good madam jones and to your kind friends at stamford to mr and mrs peters likewise and their kinswoman and beg of that good gentleman from me to encourage his new proselyte all he can and i doubt not she will do credit poor woman to the pains he shall take with her in hopes of your kind compliance with my wishes for your company i remain  dearest miss your faithful and obliged friend and servant p b   this my good lady davers is the long letter i sent to miss darnford who at parting engaged me to keep up a correspondence with her and put me in hopes of passing a month or two with us at the hall if we came down and she could persuade sir simon and her mamma to spare her to my wishes your ladyship will excuse me for so faintly mentioning the honors you confer upon me but i would not either add or diminish in the communications i make to you  the following is the copy of what i wrote to mrs jewkes  you give me mrs jewkes very great pleasure to find that at length god almighty has touched your heart and let you see while health and strength lasted the error of your ways  many an unhappy one has not been so graciously touched till they have smarted under some heavy afflictions or till they have been confined to the bed of sickness when perhaps they have made vows and resolutions that have held them no longer than the discipline lasted but you give me much better hopes of the sincerity of your conversion as you are so well convinced before some sore evil has overtaken you and it ought to be an earnest to you of the divine favor and should keep you from despondency  as for me it became me to forgive you as i most cordially did since your usage of me as it proved was but a necessary means in the hand of providence to exalt me to that state of happiness in which i have every day more and more cause given me to rejoice by the kindest and most generous of gentlemen  as i have often prayed for you even when you used me the most unkindly i now praise god for having heard my prayers and with high delight look upon you as a reclaimed soul given to my supplications may the divine goodness enable you to persevere in the course you have entered upon and when you can taste the allsurpassing pleasure that fills the worthy breast at the being placed in such a station where your example may be of advantage to the souls of others as well as to your own soul a pleasure that every good mind glories in and none else can worthily taste then may you be assured that nothing but your perseverance and the consequential improvement resulting from it is wanted to convince you that you are in a right way and that the woe that is pronounced against the presumptuous sinner belongs not to you  but dear mrs jewkes for now indeed you are dear to me let me caution you against two things the one that you return not to your former ways and wilfully err after this repentance for in this case the divine goodness will look upon itself as mocked by you and will withdraw itself from you and more fearful will your state then be than if you had never repented the other that you dont despair of the divine mercy which has so evidently manifested itself in your favor and has awakened you out of your deplorable lethargy without those sharp medicines and operations that others and perhaps not more faulty persons have suffered but go on cheerfully in the happy path which you have begun to tread depend upon it you are now in the right way and turn not either to the right hand or to the left for the reward is before you in reputation and a good fame in this life and everlasting felicity beyond it  your letter is that of a sensible woman as i always thought you and of a truly contrite one as i hope you will approve yourself to be and i the rather hope it because i shall be always desirous then of taking every opportunity that offers to me of doing you real service as well with regard to your present as future life and pleased shall i be to contribute to the one and happy to advance the other for i am good mrs jewkes as i now hope i may call you  your loving friend to serve you p b whatever good books the worthy mr peters will be so kind to recommend to you and for those under your direction send for them either to lincoln or stamford or grantham as you can get them and place them to my account and may they be the efficacious means of confirming you and them in the worthy way you are in i have done as much for all here before and i hope to no bad effect for i shall now tell them by mrs jervis if there be occasion that i hope they will not let me be outdone in bedfordshire by mrs jewkes in lincolnshire but that the servants of both houses may do credit to the best of masters adieu good woman as once more i take pleasure to style you     thus my good lady have i obeyed you in transcribing these two letters i will now proceed to your ladyships twelve articles as to the    i will oblige your ladyship as i have opportunity in my future letters with such accounts of my dear ladys favor and goodness to me as i think will be acceptable to you and the noble ladies you mention    i am extremely delighted that your ladyship thinks so well of my dear honest parents indeed they are good people and ever had minds that set them above low and sordid actions and god and your good brother has rewarded them most amply in this world which is more than they ever expected after a series of unprosperousness in all they undertook  your ladyship is pleased to say that people in upper life love to see how plain nature operates in honest minds who have hardly any thing else for their guide and if i might not be thought to descend too low for your ladyships attention for as to myself i shall i hope always look back with pleasure to what i was in order to increase my thankfulness for what i am i would give you a scene of resignation and contented poverty of which otherwise your ladyship can hardly have a notion i will give it because it will be a scene of nature however low which your ladyship loves and it shall not tire you by its length  it was upon occasion of a great loss and disappointment which happened to my dear parents for though they were never high in life yet were they not always so low as my honored lady found them when she took me my poor father came home and as the loss was of such a nature as that he could not keep it from my mother he took her hand i remember well and said after he had acquainted her with it come my dear let us take comfort that we did for the best we left the issue to providence as we ought and that has turned it as it pleased and we must be content though not favored as we wished all the business is our lot is not cast for this life let us resign ourselves to the divine will and continue to do our duty and this short life will soon be past our troubles will be quickly overblown and we shall be happy in a better i make no doubt  then my dear mother threw her kind arms about his neck and said with tears gods will be done my dear love  all cannot be rich and happy i am contented and had rather say i have a poor honest husband than a guilty rich one what signifies repining let the world go as it will we shall have our length and our breadth at last and providence i make no doubt will be a better friend to our good girl here because she is good than we could be if this had not happened  pointing to me who then about eleven years old for it was before my lady took me sat weeping in the chimney corner over a few dying embers of a fire at their moving expressions  i arose and kissing both their hands and blessing them said and this length and breadth my dear parents will be one day all the rich and the great can possess and it may be their ungracious heirs will trample upon their ashes and rejoice they are gone while such a poor girl as i am honoring the memories of mine who in their good names and good lessons will have left me the best of portions  and then they both hugged their prating girl to their fond bosoms by turns and all three were so filled with comfort in one another that after joining in a grateful hymn we went to bed what though supperless perhaps with such true joy that very few of the rich and great can have any idea of it i to my loft and they to their rushfloord cleanly bedroom and we have had sweet sleep and dreams so pleasant that we have reaped greater pleasures in repeating them to one another at our next leisurehour than possibly we should have received had we enjoyed the comforts we wanted  and truly my lady i must needs say that while the virtuous poor can be blessed with such sweet enjoyments as these in contented minds all day and in dreams and visions at night i dont know whether they have not more even of this worlds pleasures than the abounding rich and while the hours of night bear so near a proportion to those of the day may not such be said even at the worst to pass at least half their lives with more comfort than many times the distempered great can pretend to know  for a further instance that honest poverty is not such a deplorable state let me ask what pleasure can those overhappy people taste who never knew that of hunger or thirst like the eastern monarch i have read of who marching at the head of a vast army through a desert place where was no water nor any thing to quench his craving thirst at last one of his soldiers bringing him in his nasty helmet a little dirty water he greedily swallowed it and cried out that he never in all his life had tasted so sweet a draught having always before eaten before he was hungry and drank before he was thirsty  but when i talk or write of my dear worthy parents how i run on  excuse me my good lady and dont think me in this respect too much like the cat in the sea the new aesops fables sold by j osborn in paternoster row fable turned into a fine lady for methinks though i would never forget what i was yet i would be thought to know how gratefully to enjoy my present happiness as well with regard to my obligations to god as to your dear brother but let me proceed to your ladyships third particular    and you cannot imagine madam how much you have set my heart at rest when you tell me that my dear mr b gave me a just narrative of hi affair with miss godfrey for when your ladyship desired to know how he had recounted that story lest you should make a misunderstanding between us unawares i did not know what to think i was afraid some blood had been shed on the occasion by the dear gentleman for miss was ruined and as to her nothing could have happened worse and the regard i have for his future happiness which costs me in my constant supplications for him in private many a tear gave me great apprehensions and not a little uneasiness but as your ladyship tells me that he gave me a just account i am very happy again  what makes one my dear lady in our most prosperous condition be always intermingling ones fears and ones anxieties of what may be and by that means rob ones self of the prime of ones best worldly enjoyments  is this apprehensiveness does your ladyship think implanted in our natures for i know i am not vapourish nor the only person who is thus constituted for wise and good ends that we may not think ourselves so happy here as to make us forget that there is a better and more perfectly happy state which we ought to aspire after i believe it is and if so what an useful monitor do we carry about us that shall make us consider and reflect when in prosperity and in adversity teach us to bear up to hopes of a happier lot thus is it prettily said by a translator of one of horaces odes be life and spirit when fortune proves unkind and summon up the vigor of thy mind but when you are driven by too officious gales be wise and gather in the swelling sails   i now come to your ladyships fourth particular  and highly delighted i am for having obtained your approbation of my conduct to the child as well as of my behavior to the dear gentleman on the unhappy ladys score your ladyships wise intimations about having the child with me make due impression upon me and i see in them with grateful pleasure your kind and unmerited consideration for me yet i dont know how it is but i have conceived a strange passion for this dear baby i cannot but look upon her poor mamma as my sister in point of trial and shall not the prosperous sister pity and love the poor dear sister that in so slippery a path has fallen while she had the happiness to keep her feet  no doubt miss godfrey loved virtue and preferred it to all considerations it is plain she did even after her fall  when as i have observed in the papers see vol ii p         i sent your ladyship she could leave country parents friends and the man of all others she loved best and seek a new fortune run the danger of the seas and perhaps the hazards of meeting with worse men rather than trust to her own strength where it had once so unhappily failed her  what a love of virtue for virtues sake is this i know not who could have acted up to this part of her character  the rest of your ladyships articles give me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction and if i can but continue myself in the favor of your dear brother and improve in that of his noble sister how happy shall i be i will do all i can to deserve both and i hope your ladyship will take as an instance that i would the cheerful obedience which i pay to your commands in writing to so fine a judge such crude and indigested stuff as otherwise i ought to be ashamed to lay before you  i am impatient for the honor which your ladyship makes me hope for of your presence here and yet i perplex myself with the fear of appearing so unworthy in your eyes when near you as to suffer in your opinion but i promise myself that however this may be the case on your first visit i shall be so much improved by the benefits i shall reap from your lessons and good example that whenever i shall be favored with a second you shall have less faults to find with me till as i shall be more and more favored i shall in time be just what your ladyship will wish me to be and of consequence more worthy than i am of the honor of styling myself  your ladyships most humble and obedient servant p b  letter xxi from miss darnford in answer to mrs bs p  0  my dear mrs b you are highly obliging to me in expressing so warmly your wishes to have me with you i know not any body in this world out of our own family in whose company i should be happier but my papa will not part with me i think though i had secured my mamma in my interest and i know nancy would be glad of my absence because the dear perversely envious thinks me more valued than she is and yet foolish girl she dont consider that if her envy be wellgrounded i should return with more than double advantages to what i now have improved by your charming example and conversation  my papa affects to be in a fearful pet at your lecturing of him so justly for my mamma would show it him and he says he will positively demand satisfaction of mr b for your treating him so freely and yet he shall hardly think him he says on a rank with him unless mr b will on occasion of the new commission take out his dedimus and then if he will bring you down to lincolnshire and join with him to commit you prisoner for a month at the hall all shall be well  it is very obliging in mr b to join in your kind invitation but  yet i am loath to say it to you  but the character of your worthy gentleman i doubt stands a little in the way with my papa for he will have it that he is just such a rake as is to be liked by a lady one that saves common appearances and that is all and is too handsome too witty and too enterprizing for any honest man that is si simons phrase to trust his daughter with  my mamma pleaded his being married  adsdines madam said he what of all that what married man when a pretty girls in the way minds his wife except she has made him stand in fear of her and that is far from the case here why i tell you added his peevish highness if our polly should happen to slip i thank him for his supposition he would make his lady nurse both her and the bastard another of his polite expressions if he had a mind to it and she durst not refuse him and would you trust such a spritely girl as polly in the house with such a fellow as that  these it seems were his words and reasonings i thank him for his opinion of his daughter it becomes not me to say by what rules my papa judges of mankind rules however that are not much to the credit of his sex  but it made me put on very grave airs when i came to supper for after this repulse and the reasons given for it i pretended indisposition not to dine with my papa being halfvexd and halfafraid of his raillery and he said why how now polly what in the sullens girl i said i should have hoped that i never gave my papa cause to suspect my conduct and that he would have had a better opinion of the force which the example and precepts of my good mamma had upon me  not your papas example then  very well saucebox i understand you  but sir said i i hope if i may not go to bedfordshire you will permit me to go to london when mrs b goes  no said he positively no  well sir i have done i could hope however you would enable me to give a better reason to good mrs b why i am not permitted to accept of her kind invitation than that which i understand you have been pleased to assign  he stuck his hands in his sides with his usual humourous positiveness why then tell her she is a very saucy lady for her last letter to you and that her lord and master is not to be trusted and it is my absolute will and pleasure that you ask me no more questions about it  i will very faithfully make this report sir do so  and so i have  and your poor polly darnford is disappointed of one of the greatest pleasures she could have had  i cannot help it  and if you truly pity me i can put you in a way to make me easier under the disappointment than otherwise i can possibly be and that is to favor me with an epistolary conversation since i am denied a personal one and this my mamma joins to request of you and particularly to let us know how lady daverss first visit passes which mrs peters and mrs jones who know my lady so well likewise long to hear and this will make us the best amends in your power for the loss of your good neighborhood which we had all promised to ourselves  this denial of my papa comes out since i wrote the above to be principally owing to a proposal made him of an humble servant to one of his daughters he will not say which he tells us in his usual humourous way lest we should fall out about it  i suppose i tell him the young gentleman is to pick and choose which of the two he likes best but be he a duke it is all one to polly if he is not something above our common lincolnshire class of foxhunters  i have shown mr and mrs peters your letter they admire you beyond expression and mr peters says he does not know that ever he did any thing in all his life that ever gave him so much inward reproach as his denying you the protection of his family which mr williams see vol i p     sought to move him to afford you when you were confined at the hall before mr b came down to you with his heart bent on mischief and all he comforts himself with is that that very denial as well as the other hardships you met with were necessary to bring about that work of providence which was to reward your unexampled virtue  yet he says he doubts he shall not be thought excusable by you who are so exact in your own duty as he had the unhappiness to lose such an opportunity to have done honor to his function had he had the fortitude to have done his and he begged of me some how or other and at some time or other to hint his concern to you on this head and to hope in his name that neither religion nor his cloth may suffer in your opinion for the fault of one of its professors who never was wanting in his duty so much before  he had it often upon his mind he says to write to you on this very subject but he had not the courage and besides did not know how mr b might take it if he should see that letter as the case had such delicate circumstances in it that in blaming himself as he should very freely have done he must by implication have cast still greater blame upon him  mr peters is certainly a very good man and my favorite for that reason and i hope you that could so easily forgive the late wicked but now penitent jewkes will overlook with kindness a fault in a good man that proceeded more from pusillanimity and constitution than from want of principle and once talking of it to my mamma and me he accused himself on this score to her with tears in his eyes she good lady would have given you this protection at mr williams desire but wanted the sea vol i p     power to do it  so you see my dear mrs b how your virtue has shamed every one into such a sense of what they ought to have done that good bad and indifferent are seeking to make excuses for past misbehaviour and to promise future amendment like penitent subjects returning to their duty to their conquering sovereign after some unworthy defection  happy happy lady may you be ever so may you always convert your enemies confirm the lukewarm and every day multiply your friends prays  your most affectionate polly darnford p s how i rejoice in the joy of your honest parents god bless em i am glad lady davers is so wise every one i have named desire their best respects let me hear from you oftener and omit not the minutest thing for every line of yours carries instruction with it    letter xxii from sir simon darnford to mr b sir little did i think i should ever have occasion to make a formal complaint against a person very dear to you and who i believe deserves to be so but dont let them be so proud and so vain of obliging and pleasing you as to make them not care how they affront every body else  the person is no other than the wife of your bosom who has taken such liberties with me as ought not to be taken and sought to turn my own child against me and make a dutiful girl a rebel  if people will set up for virtue and all that let em be uniformly virtuous or i would not give a farthing for their pretenses to it  here i have been plagued with gouts rheumatisms and nameless disorders ever since you left us which have made me call for a little more attendance than ordinary and i had reason to think myself slighted where an indulgent father can least bear to be slighted that is where he most loves and that by young upstarts who are growing up to the enjoyment of those pleasures which have run away from me fleeting rascals as they are before i was willing to part with them and i rung and rung and where is polly for i honor the slut with too much of my notice where is polly was all my cry to every one who came up to ask what i rung for and at last in burst the pert slut with an air of assurance as if she thought all must be well the moment she appeared with do you want me papa  do i want you confidence yes i do where have you been these two hours and never came near me when you knew twas my time to have my foot rubbed which gives me mortal pain for you must understand mr b that nobodys hands so soft as pollys  she gave me a saucy answer as i was disposed to think it because i had just then a twinge that i could scarce bear for pain is a plaguey thing to a man of my lively spirits why with a p  x to it cannot it go and rouse up some stupid lethargic rascal whose blood is ready to stagnate there it might do some good and not make an honest man miserable as it does me who want none of its pungent helps to feeling  she gave me i say a pert answer and turned upon her heel and not coming near me at my first word i flung a book i had in my hand at her head  this the saucy slut girls nowadays make nothing of exposing their indulgent parents has mentioned in a letter to your lady and she has abused me upon it in such a manner  well if you dont take some course with her i must with you that is positive and young as you are and a cripple as i am i will stump to an appoined place to procure to myself the satisfaction of a man of honor  your lady has written to polly what she would have said to me on this occasion she has reflected upon me for not reading a book of mortification when i was laboring under so great a sense of it and confined to my elbowchair in one room whom lately half a dozen counties could hardly contain she has put it into pollys head to fling this very book at her sisters head in imitation of my example and hopes nancy will fling it at somebodys else till it goes all round the house she reproaches me for making no better use of a good book as she calls rabelaiss pantagruel which i innocently was reading to make me the more cheerfully bear my misfortune and runs on a pack of stuff about my pollys eyes and skin and i dont know what on purpose to fill the girl with notions that dont belong to her in order to make her proud and saucy and then to inspire her with insolence to me runs on with suppositions of what harm i might have done her had the book bruised her face or eyes and so forth as if our daughters eyes were not our own eyes their brazen faces our brazen faces at least till we can find somebody to take them and all the rest of their trumpery off of our hands  saucy baggages who have neither souls nor senses but what they have borrowed from us and whose very bones and the skin that covers them so much their pride and their ornament are so many parts of our own undervalued skin and bones and ours only are more wrinkled by taking pains to make theirs smooth  nay this fine lady of yours this paragon of meekness and humility in so many words bids me or tells my own daughter to bid me which is worse never to take a book in my hands again if i will not make a better use of it  and yet what better use can an offended father make of the best books than to correct a rebellious child with them and oblige a saucy daughter to jump into her duty all at once  then pray sir do you allow your lady to beg presents from gentlemen  this is a tender point to touch upon but you shall know all i am resolved  for here she sends to desire me to make her a present of this very book and promises to send me another as good  come come sir these are no jesting matters for is it not a sad thing to think that ladies let them be young or old wellmarryd or illmarryd cannot live without intrigue and here if i were not a very honest man and your friend and resolved to be a virtuous man too in spite of temptation one does not know what might be the consequence of such a correspondence as is here begun or rather desired to be begun for i have too much honor to give into it for your sake and i hope you will think yourself much obliged to me  i know the time that i have improved a more mysterious hint than this into all that i had a mind to make of it and it may be very happy for you neighbor that i must and will be virtuous let the temptation be from whom it will for the finest lady in the world is nothing to me now  in this my reformed state  but this is not all mrs b goes on to reflect upon me for making her blush formerly and saying things before my daughters that truly i ought to be ashamed to say and then avows malice and revenge and all that why sir why neighbor are these things to be borne  do you allow your lady to set up for a general corrector of every bodys morals but your own do you allow her to condemn the only instances of wit that remain to this generation that dear polite double entendre which keeps alive the attention and quickens the apprehension of the best companies in the world and is the salt the sauce which gives a poignancy to all our genteeler entertainments  very fine truly that more than half the world shall be shut out of society shall be precluded their share of conversation among the gay and polite of both sexes were your lady to have her will let her first find people that can support a conversation with wit and good sense like her own and then something might be said but till then i positively say and will swear upon occasion that double entendre shall not be banished from our tables and where this will not raise a blush or create a laugh we will be at liberty if we please for all mrs b and her newfangled notions to force the one and the other by still plainer hints and let her help herself how she can  thus sir you find my complaints are of a high nature regarding the quiet of a family the duty of a child to a parent the advances of a married lady to a gentleman who is resolved to be virtuous and the freedom of conversation in all which points your lady has greatly offended and i insist upon satisfaction from you or such a correction of the fair transgressor as is in your power to inflict and which may prevent worse consequences from  your offended friend and servant simon darnford  letter xxiii from mr b in answer to the preceding dear sir simon you cannot but believe that i was much surprised at your letter complaining of the behavior of my wife i could no more have expected such a complaint from such a gentleman than i could that she would have deserved it and i am very sorry on both accounts i have talked to her in such a manner that i dare say she will never give you like cause to appeal to me  it happened that the criminal herself received your letter from her servant and brought it to me in my closet and making her honors for i cannot say but she is very obliging to me though she takes such saucy freedoms with my friends away she trippd and i inquiring for her when with surprise as you may believe i had read your charge found she was gone to visit a poor sick neighbor of which indeed she had before apprisd me because she took the chariot but i had forgot it in my wrath  twas well for her that she was not in the way perhaps i should have taken more severe methods with her in my first emotions and i longed for her return and there is another wellforher too in her case for one would be loath to spoil a son and heir you know sir simon before we see whether the little varlet may deserve ones consideration  i mention these things that you may observe it was not owing to any regard for the offender herself that i did not punish her as much as injured friendship required at my hands  at last in she came with that sweet composure in her face which results from a consciousness of doing generally just and generous things although in this instance she has so egregiously erred that it behooves me as well in justice to my friend as policy to myself for who knows whither first faults may lead if not checked in time to nip such boldness in the bud and indeed the moment i beheld the charmer of my heart for i do love her too well that is certain all my anger was disarmed and had the offense regarded myself i must have forgiven her in spite of all my meditated wrath but it behooved me in a friends case not to be soon subdued by a too partial fondness i resumed therefore that sternness and displeasure which her entrance had almost dissipated i took her hand her charming eye you know what an eye she has sir simon quivered at my overclouded aspect and her lips halfdrawn to a smile trembled with apprehension of a countenance so changed from what she left it  and then all stiff and stately as i could look did i accost her come along with me pamela to my closet i want to talk with you  dear sir good sir what is the matter what have i done  we entered i sat down still holding her unsteady hand and her pulse fluttering under my finger like a dying bird  it is well said i it is well your present condition pleads for you and i must not carry what i have to say too far for considerations less in your favor than for one unseen but i have great complaints against you  against me sir  what have i done let me know dear good sir looking round with her halfaffrighted eyes this way and that on the books and pictures and on me by turns  you shall know soon said i the crime you have been guilty of  pray let me sir  this closet i hoped would not be a second time witness to the flutter you put me in  there hangs a tale sir simon that i am not very fond of relating since it gave beginning to the triumphs of this see vol i p  0  little sorceress  i still held one hand and she stood before me as criminals ought to do before their judge but said i see sir sure i do or what will else become of me less severity in your eyes than you affect to put on in your countenance dear sir let me know my fault i will repent acknowledge and amend let me but know it  you must have great presence of mind pamela replied i such is the nature of your fault if you can look me in the face when i tell it you  then let me said the irresistible charmer hiding her face in my bosom and putting her other arm about my neck let me thus my mr b hide this guilty face while i hear my fault told and i will not seek to extenuate it but by my tears and my penitence  i could hardly hold out what infatuating creatures are these women when they can think it thus worth their while to sooth and calm the tumults of an angry heart when instead of scornful looks darted in return for angry ones words of defiance for words of peevishness persisting to defend one error by another and returning vehement wrath for slight indignation and all the hostile provocations of the marriage warfare they can thus hide their dear faces in our bosoms and wish but to know their faults to amend them  i could hardly i say resist the sweet girls behavior nay i believe i did unawares to myself and in defiance of my resolved displeasure press her forehead with my lips as the rest of her face was hid on my breast but considering it was the cause of my friend that i was to assert my injured friend wounded and insulted in so various a manner by the fair offender thus haughtily spoke i to the trembling mischief in a pomp of style theatrically tragic  i will not too inadvertent and undistinguishing pamela keep you long in suspense for the sake of a circumstance that on this occasion ought to give you as much joy as it has till now given me  since it becomes an advocate in your favor when otherwise you might expect a very severe treatment know then that the letter you gave me before you went out is a letter from a friend a neighbor a worthy neighbor complaining of your behavior to him  no other than sir simon darnford for i would not amuse her too much a gentleman i must always respect and whom as my friend i expected you should since by the value a wife expresses for one esteemed by her huband whether she thinks so well of him herself or not a man ought always to judge of the sincerity of her regards to himself  she raised her head at once on this thank heaven said she it is no worse  i was at my wits end almost in apprehension but i know how this must be  dear sir how could you frighten me so  i know how all this is  i can now look you in the face and hear all that sir simon can charge me with for i am sure i have not so affronted him as to make him angry indeed and truly ran she on secure of pardon as she seemed to think i should respect sir simon not only as your friend but on his own account if he was not so sad a rake at a time of life   then i interrupted her you must needs think sir simon for how could i bear to hear my worthy friend so freely treated  how now pamela said i and is it thus by repeating your fault that you atone for it do you think i can bear to hear my friend so freely treated  indeed said she i do respect sir simon very much as your friend permit me to repeat but cannot for his wilful failings would it not be in some measure to approve of faulty conversation if one can hear it and not discourage it when the occasion comes in so pat  and indeed i was glad of an opportunity continued she to give him a little rub i must needs own it but if it displeases you or has made him angry in earnest i am sorry for it and will be less bold for the future  read then said i the heavy charge and i will return instantly to hear your answer to it so i went from her for a few minutes  but would you believe it sir simon she seemed on my return very little concerned at your just complaints  what selfjustifying minds have the meekest of these women  instead of finding her in repentant tears as one might have expected she took your angry letter for a jocular one and i had great difficulty to convince her of the heinousness of her fault or the reality of your anger upon which being determined to have justice done to my friend and a due sense of her own great error impressed upon her i began thus  pamela pamela take heed that you do not suffer the purity of your own mind in breach of your charity to make you too rigorous a censurer of other peoples actions dont be so puffed up with your own perfections as to imagine that because other persons allow themselves liberties you cannot take therefore they must be wicked sir simon is a gentleman who indulges himself in a pleasant vein and i believe as well as you has been a great rake and libertine you will excuse me sir simon because i am taking your part but what then you see it is all over with him now you see he says himself that he must and therefore he will be virtuous and is a man for ever to hear of the faults of his youth when he himself is so willing to forget them  ah but sir sir said the bold slut can you say he is willing to forget them  does he not repine here in this very letter that he must forsake them and does he not plainly cherish the inclination when he owns  she hesitated  owns what  you know what i mean sir and i need not speak it and can there well be a more censurable character  then dear sir before his maiden daughters before his virtuous lady before anybody  what a sad thing is this at a time of life which should afford a better example  but dear sir continued the bold prattler taking advantage of a silence that was more owing to displeasure than approbation let me for i would not be censorious no not she in the very act of censoriousness to say this let me offer but one thing dont you think sir simon himself would be loath to be thought a reformed gentleman dont you see the delight he takes when he speaks of his former pranks as if he was sorry he could not play them over again see but how he simpers and injoys as one may say the relations of his own rakish actions when he tells a bad story  and have you not seen how often he has been forced to take his handkerchief to wipe the outside of his mouth though the inside wanted it most when he has wounded a ladys ears and turned as it were his own faulty heart inside out  indeed sir i am afraid so bad in this way is your worthy neighbor that he would account it a disgrace to him to be thought reformed and how then can i abuse the gentleman by representing him in a light in which he loves to be considered  but said i were this the case for i profess sir simon i was at a grievous loss to defend you for you to write all these free things against a father to his daughter is that right pamela  o sir the good gentleman himself has taken care that such a character as i presumed to draw to miss of her papa was no strange one to her you have seen yourself mr b whenever his arch leers and the humourous attitude in which he puts himself on those occasions have taught us to expect some shocking story how his lady and daughters used to him as they are have suffered in their apprehensions of what he would say before he spoke it how particularly dear miss darnford has looked at me with concern desirous as it were if possible to save her papa from the censure which his faulty expressions must naturally bring upon him and dear sir is it not a sad thing for a young lady who loves and honors her papa to observe that he is discrediting himself and wants the example he ought to give and pardon me sir for smiling on so serious an occasion continued she but is it not a fine sight do you think to see a gentleman as we have more than once seen sir simon when he has thought proper to read a passage or so in some bad book pulling off his spectacles to talk filthily methinks i see him now added the bold slut splitting his arch face with a broad laugh showing a mouth with hardly a tooth in it while he is making obscene remarks upon what he has read   and then the dear saucyface laughed out to bear me company for i could not for the soul of me avoid laughing heartily at the figure she brought to my mind which i have seen my old friend make on two or three occasions of this sort with his dismounted spectacles his arch mouth and gums of shining jet succeeding those of polished ivory of which he often boasts as one ornament of his youthful days  and i the rather in my heart sir simon gave you up because when i was a sad fellow it was always a maxim with me to endeavor to touch a ladys heart without wounding her ears and indeed i found my account sometimes in observing it  but resuming my gravity hussy said i do you think i will have my old friend thus made the subject of your ridicule  suppose a challenge should have ensued between us on your account  what might have been the issue of it to see an old gentleman stumping as he says on crutches to fight a duel in defense of his wounded honor a pretty sight this would have afforded would it not and what had any one met him on the way could he have said he was going to do dont you consider that a man is answerable for the faults of his wife and if my fondness for you would have made me deny doing justice to my friend and on the contrary to resolve in your behalf to give him a meeting and he had flung his crutch at my head as he did the book at his daughters what might have been the consequence think you  very bad sir said she to be sure i see that and am sorry for it for had you carried off sir simons crutch as a trophy the poor gentleman must have lain sighing and groaning like a wounded soldier in the field of battle till another had been brought him to have stumpd home with  but dear sir simon i have brought this matter to an issue that will i hope make all easy and that is this  miss polly and my pamela shall both be punished as they deserve if it be not your own fault i am told that the sins of your youth dont fit so heavily upon your limbs as they do in your imagination and i believe change of air and the gratification of your revenge a fine help to such lively spirits as yours will set you up you shall then take coach and bring your pretty criminal to mine and when we have them together they shall humble themselves before us and it shall be in your power to absolve or punish them as you shall see proper for i cannot bear to have my worthy friend insulted in so heinous a manner by a couple of saucy girls who if not taken down in time may proceed from fault to fault till there will be no living with them  if to be still more serious your lady and you will lend miss darnford to my pamelas wishes whose heart is set upon the hope of her wintering with us in town you will lay an obligation upon us both which will be acknowleged with great gratitude by dear sir  your affectionate and humble servant  letter xxiv from sir simon darnford in reply hark ye me squire b  a word in your ear  i like neither you nor your wife to be plain with you well enough to trust my polly with you what you are to show her in your ladys case all the game of a lyingin i suppose and at least set the girl a longing to make one in the dance before i have found out the proper man for her partner  but here is war declared against my poor gums it seems well i will never open my mouth before your lady as long as i live if i can help it i have for these ten years avoided to put on my cravat and for what reason do you think  why because i could not bear to see what ruins a few years have made in a visage that used to inspire love and terror as it pleased  and here your  whatshallicallher of a wife with all the insolence of youth and beauty on her side follows me with a glass and would make me look in it whether i will or not i am a plaguey goodhumored old fellow  if i am an old fellow  or i should not bear the insults contained in your letter between you and your lady you make a wretched figure of me that is certain  and yet it is taking my part with a p  x to you mr b i would have said but on your ladys account  you see i have as much more charity than her as she has purity than me or i should not have put in that saving clause in her behalf  dismounted spectacles arch mouth gums of shining jet and suchlike fine descriptions are these yours or your ladys i would be glad to know that mr b   well but what a d  l must a man do  i would be glad at any rate to stand in your ladys graces that i would nor would i be the last rake and libertine unreformd by her example which i suppose will make virtue the fashion if she goes on at the rate she does but here i have been used to cut a joke and toss the squib about and as far as i know it has helped to keep me alive in the midst of pains and aches and with two womengrown girls and the rest of the mortifications that will attend on advanced years for i will not hang me if i will give it up as absolute old age   i love i own it to make a pretty woman blush it is doubledamasking a fine rose as it were and till i saw your  do let me call her some free name or other i always loved to be free with pretty women till i saw your  methinks i like her arcadian name though i am so old a swain as not to merit any thing but rebuke at her hands  well then till i saw your  pamela  i thought all ladies in their hearts loved a little squib of that kind for why should they not when it adds so much grace to their features and improves their native charms  and often have i tossed the joke about as much in my intention to oblige them as myself  yet no one can say but that i always wrapped it up in clean linen as the saying is  only suiting myself to my company till i had made the dear rogues sensible and show they could apprehend  but now it seems i must leave all this off or i must be mortified with a lookingglass held before me and every wrinkle must be made as conspicuous as a cablerope  and what pray is to succeed to this reformation  i can neither fast nor pray i doubt  and besides if my stomach and my jest depart from me farewell sir simon darnford  but cannot i pass as one necessary character do you think as a foil as bythebye some of your own actions have been to your ladys virtue to set off some more edifying example where variety of characters make up a feast in conversation  i beseech you mr bs pamela stick me into some posy among your finer flowers  and if you will not put me in your bosom let me stand in some gay flowerpot in your chimney corner i may serve for show if not for smell or let me be the bass in your music or permit my humourous humdrum to serve as a pardonable kind of discord to set off your own harmony  i verily think i cannot be so good as you would have me to be so pray let your poor anacreon go off with what he loves it will be very cruel if you will not  well but after all i believe i might have trusted you with my daughter under your ladys eye rake as you have been yourself and fame says wrong if you have not been for your time a bolder sinner than ever i was with your maxim of touching ladies hearts without wounding their ears which made surer work with them that was all though it is to be hoped you are now reformed and if you are the whole country round you east west north and south owe great obligations to your fair reclaimer but here is a fine prim young fellow coming out of norfolk with one estate in one county another in another and jointures and settlements in his hands and more wit in his head as well as more money in his pocket than he can tell what to do with to visit our polly though i tell her i much question the former quality his wit if he is for marrying  and would you have her be attending your wifes nursery when she may possibly be put in a way to have a rareeshew of her own  here then is the reason i cannot comply with your kind mrs bs request but if this matter should go off if he should not like her or she him or if i should not like his terms or he mine  or still another or if he should like nancy better  why then perhaps if polly be a good girl i may trust to her virtue and to your honor and let her go for a month or two for the devils in you if you would attempt to abuse such a generous confidence  as to the superiority of beauty in your own lady i depend nothing on that with you young fellows to whom variety has generally greater charms  now when i have said this and when i say further that i can forgive your severe lady and yourself too who however are less to be excused in the airs you assume which looks like one chimneysweeper calling another sooty rascal i give a proof of my charity which i hope with mrs b will cover a multitude of faults and the rather since though i cannot be a follower of her virtue in the strictest sense i can be an admirer of it and that is some little merit and indeed all that can be at present pleaded by yourself i doubt any more than  your humble servant simon darnford  letter xxv my honored and dear parents i hope you will excuse my long silence which has been owing to several causes and having had nothing new to entertain you with and yet this last is but a poor excuse neither to you who think every trifling subject agreeable from your daughter  i daily expect here my lord and lady davers this gives me no small pleasure and yet it is mingled with some uneasiness at times lest i should not when viewed so intimately near behave myself answerably to her ladyships expectations but this i resolve upon i will not endeavor to move out of the sphere of my own capacity in order to emulate her ladyship she has and must have advantages by conversation as well as education which it would be arrogance in me to assume or to think of imitating  all that i will attempt to do therefore shall be to show such a respectful obligingness to my lady as shall be consistent with the condition to which i am raised that so her ladyship may not have reason to reproach me of pride in my exaltation nor her dear brother to rebuke me for meanness in condescending and as to my family management i am the less afraid of inspection because by the natural bias of my own mind i bless god i am above dark reserves and have not one selfish or sordid view that should make me wish to avoid the most scrutinizing eye  i have begun a correspondence with miss darnford a young lady of uncommon merit but you know her character from my former writings she is very solicitous to hear of every thing that concerns me and particularly how lady davers and i agree together i loved her from the moment i saw her first for she has the least pride and the most benevolence and solid thought i ever knew in a young lady and knows not what it is to envy any one i shall write to her often and as i shall have so many avocations besides to fill up my time i know you will excuse me if i procure from miss as i hope to do the return of my letters to her for your perusal and the entertainment of your leisure hours this will give you from time to time the accounts you desire of all that happens here but as to what relates to our own particulars i beg you will never spare writing as i shall not answering for it is one of my greatest delights that i have such dear such worthy parents as i hope in god i long shall to bless me and to correspond with me  the papers i send herewith will afford you some diversion particularly those relating to sir simon darnford and i must desire that when you have perused them as well as what i shall send for the future you will return them to me  mr longman gave me great pleasure on his last return from you in his account of your health and the satisfaction you take in your happy lot and i must recite to you a brief conversation on this occasion that i dare say will please you as much as it did me  after he had been adjusting some affairs with his dear principal which took them up two hours my best beloved sent for me  my dear said he taking my hand and seating me down by him and making the good old gentleman sit down for he will always rise at my approach mr longman and i have settled in two hours some accounts which would have taken up as many months with some persons but never was an exacter or more methodical accomptant than mr longman he gives me greatly to my satisfaction because i know it will delight you an account of the kentish concern and of the pleasure your father and mother take in it  now my charmer said he i see your sweet eyes begin to glisten  o how this subject raises your whole soul to the windows of it  never was so dutiful a daughter mr longman and never did parents better deserve a daughters duty  i endeavored before mr longman to rein in a gratitude that my throbbing heart confessed through my handkerchief as i could perceive but the good old gentleman could not hinder his from shewiug itself at his worthy eyes to see how much i was favored  oppressed i should say with the dearest gentlemans tender goodness to me and kind expressions  excuse me sir excuse me madam said he wiping his cheeks my delight to see such merit so justly rewarded will not be contained i think  and so he got up and walked to the window  well good mr longman said i as he returned toward us you give me the pleasure to know that my father and mother are well and happy then they must be in a goodness and bounty that i and many more rejoice in  well and happy madam  ay that they are indeed and a worthier couple never lived i assure you most nobly do they go on in the farm your honors one of the happiest gentlemen in the world all the good you do returns upon you in a trice it may well be said you cast your bread upon the waters for it presently comes to you again richer and heavier than when you threw it in all the kentish tenants madam are hugely delighted with their good steward every thing prospers under his management the gentry love both him and my dame and the poor people adore them indeed they do a power of good in visiting their poor neighbors and giving them cordials and suchlike insomuch that colicks agues and twenty distempers nippd in the bud fly before them so that i reckon the doctors will soon be the only enemies they have in the world for in a while there will be no occasion for one within ten miles of their habitation  in this manner ran on mr longman to my inexpressible delight you may believe and when he withdrew it is an honest soul said my dear mr b i love him for his respectful love to my angel and his value for the worthy pair very glad i am that every thing answers their wishes may they long live and be happy  the dear gentleman makes me spring to his arms whenever he touches this string for he speaks always thus generously and kindly of you and is glad to hear he says that you dont live only to yourselves and nowandthen adds that your prudence and mine do more credit to his choice than might have been done him by an alliance with the first quality since every mouth he is pleased to say is full of our merits how pleasing how transporting rather my dear parents must this goodness be to your happy daughter and how could i forbear repeating these kind things to you that you may see how well every thing is taken that you do  when the expected visit from lord and lady davers is over the approaching winter will carry us to london and as i shall then be nearer to you we may more frequently hear from one another which to be sure will be a great heightening to my pleasures  but i have such an account given me of the immoralities to which persons are exposed there along with the public diversions that it takes off a little from the satisfaction i should otherwise have in the thought of going thither for they say quarrels and duels and gallantries as they are called so often happen at london that those enormities are heard of without the least wonder or surprise  this makes me very thoughtful at times but god i hope will preserve our dearest benefactor and continue to me his affection and then i shall be always happy especially while your healths and felicity confirm and crown the delights of  your ever dutiful daughter p b  letter xxvi my dearest child it may not be improper to mention ourselves what the nature of the kindnesses is which we confer on our poor neighbors and the laboring people lest it should be surmised by any body that we are lavishing away wealth that is not our own not that we fear either your honored husband or you will suspect any such matter or that the worthy mr longman would insinuate as much for he saw what we did and was highly pleased with it and said he would make such a report of it as you write he did what we do is in small things though the good we hope from them is not small perhaps and if a very distressful case should happen among our poor neighbors that would require any thing considerable and the objects be deserving we would acquaint you with it and leave it to you to do as god shall direct you  but this indeed we have done and continue to do we have furnished ourselves with simple waters and cordials of several sorts and when in a hot sultry day i see poor laboring creatures ready to faint and drop down if they are only fatigued i order them a mouthful of bread or so and a cup of good ale or beer and this makes them go about their business with new spirits and when they bless me for it i tell them they must bless the good squire from whose bounty next to god it all proceeds if any are ill i give them a cordial and we have been the means of setting up several poor creatures who have labored under colicky and aguish disorders or have been taken with slight stomach ailments and nothing is lost by it my dear child for poor people have as grateful souls as any body and it would delight your dear heart to see how many drooping spirits we have raised and how in an hour or two some of them after a little cordial refreshment from languishing under an hedge or behind a haystack have skipped about as nimble as deer whistling and singing and pursuing with alacrity their several employments and instead of cursing and swearing as is the manner of some wicked wretches nothing but blessings and praises poured out of their glad hearts upon his honor and you calling me their father and friend and telling me they will live and die for me and my wife and that we shall never want an industrious servant to do his honors business or to cultivate the farm i am blessed in and in like sort we communicate to our sick or wanting neighbors even although they be not tenants to the estate  come my dear child you are happy very happy to be sure you are and if it can be may you be yet happier and happier but still i verily think you cannot be more happy than your father and mother except in this one thing that all our happiness under god proceeds from you and as other parents bless their children with plenty and benefits you have blessed your parents or your honored husband rather for your sake with all the good things this world can afford  the papers you send us are the joy of our leisure hours and you are kind beyond all expression in taking care to oblige us with them we know how your time is taken up and ought to be very well contented if but nowandthen you let us hear of your health and welfare but it is not enough with such a good daughter that you have made our lives comfortable but you will make them joyful too by communicating to us all that befalls you and then you write so piously and with such a sense of gods goodness to you and intermix such good reflections in your writings that whether it be our partial love or not i cannot tell but truly we think nobody comes up to you and you make our hearts and our eyes so often overflow as we read that we join hand in hand together and i say to her blessed be god and blessed be you my dear and she in the same breath blessed be god and you my love  for such a daughter says the one  for such a daughter says the other  and she has your own sweet temper cry i  and she has your own honest heart cries she and so we go on blessing god and blessing you and blessing your spouse and blessing ourselves  is any happiness like our happiness my dear daughter  really and indeed we are so inrapturd with your writings that when our spirits flag through the infirmity of years that have begun to take hold of us we have recourse to some of your papers come my dear cry i what say you to a banquet now  she knows what i mean with all my heart says she  so i read although it be on a sunday so good are your letters and you must know i have copies of a many of them and after a little while we are as much alive and brisk as if we had had no flagging at all and return to the duties of the day with double delight  consider then my dear child what joy your writings give us and yet we are afraid of oppressing you who have so much to do of other kinds and we are heartily glad you have found out a way to save trouble to yourself and rejoice us and oblige so worthy a young lady as miss darnford all at one time i never shall forget her dear goodness to me and the notice she took of me at the hall see vol ii p  0   kindly pressing my rough hands with her fine hands and looking in my face with so much kindness in her eyes  to be sure i never shall  what good people as well as bad there are in high stations  thank god there are else our poor child would have had a sad time of it too often when she was obliged to step out of herself as once i heard you phrase it into company you could not live with  well but how shall i end and yet what shall i say more  only with my prayers that god will continue to you the blessings and comforts you are in possession of  and pray now be not overthoughtful about what may happen at london for why should you let the dread of future evils lessen your present joys there is no absolute perfection in this life that is true but one would make ones self as easy as one could it is time enough to be troubled when troubles come  sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof  rejoice then my dear child as you have often said you would in your present blessings and leave the event of things to the supreme disposer of all events and what have you to do but rejoice you who cannot see a sun rise but it is to bless you and to raise up from their beds numbers to join in the blessing you who can bless your highborn friends and your lowborn parents and obscure relations who can bless the rich by your example and the poor by your bounty and bless besides so good and so brave a husband  o my dear child what let me repeat it have you to do but rejoice  for many daughters have done wisely but you have excelled them all  i will only add that every thing the squire ordered is just upon the point of being finished and when the good time comes that we shall be again favored with his presence and yours what a still greater joy will this afford to the already overflowing hearts of  your ever loving father and mother j and e andrews  letter xxvii my dear miss darnford the interest i take in every thing that concerns you makes me very importunate to know how you approve the gentleman whom some of his best friends and wellwishers have recommended to your favor i hope he will deserve your good opinion and then he must excel most of the unmarried gentlemen in england  your papa in his humourous manner mentions his large possessions and riches but indeed were he as rich as croesus he should not have my consent if he has no greater merit though that is what the generality of parents look out for first and indeed an easy fortune is so far from being disregardable that when attended with equal merit i think it ought to have a preference given to it supposing affections disingaged for it is certain that a gentleman or lady may stand as good a chance for happiness in marriage with a person of fortune as with one who has not that advantage and notwithstanding i had neither riches nor descent to boast of i must be of opinion with those who say that they never knew any body despise either that had them but to permit riches to be the principal inducement to the neglect of superior merit that is the fault which many a one smarts for whether the choice be their own or imposed upon them by those who have a title to their obedience  here is a saucy body might some who have not miss darnfords kind consideration for her friend be apt to say who being thus meanly descended nevertheless presumes to give her opinion in these high cases unasked but i have one thing my dear miss to say and that is that i think myself so entirely divested of partiality to my own case that as far as my judgment shall permit i will never have that in view when i am presuming to hint my opinion of general rules for most surely the honors i have received and the debasement to which my best friend has subjected himself have for their principal excuse that the gentleman was entirely independent had no questions to ask and had a fortune sufficient to make himself as well as the person he chose happy though she brought him nothing at all and that he had moreover such a character for good sense and knowledge of the world that nobody could impute to him any other inducement but that of a noble resolution to reward a virtue he had so frequently and i will say so wickedly tried and could not subdue  but why do i thus run on to miss darnford whose partial friendship attributes to me merits i cannot claim i will therefore quit this subject as a needless one to her and proceed to what was principally in my view when i began to write and that is to complain of your papa who has let me say it done his endeavor to set at variance a gentleman and his wife  i will not enter into the particulars because the appeal is to caesar and it would look like invading his prerogative to take it into my own hands but i can tell sir simon that he is the only gentleman i hope who when a young person of my sex asked him to make her a present of a book would put such a mischievous turn as he has done upon it to her husband  indeed from the beginning i had reason to call him a see vol i p     telltale  but no more of that  yet i must say i had rather he should have flung this book at my head too than to have made a so much worse use of it but i came off tolerably no thanks to sir simon however  and but tolerably neither for my dear mr b kept me in suspense a good while and put me in great flutters before he let me into the matter  but i was very much concerned my dear miss at first till you gave a reason i better liked afterward for sir simons denying your company to me after i had obtained the favor of your mammas consent and you were kindly inclined yourself to oblige me and that was that sir simon had a bad opinion of the honor of my dear mr b for as to that part of his doubt which reflected dishonor upon his dear daughter it was all but the effect of his strange free humor on purpose to vex you  that gentleman must be the most abandoned of men who would attempt any thing against the virtue of a lady entrusted to his protection and i am grieved methinks that the dear gentleman who is the better part of myself and has to his own debasement acted so honorably by me should be thought capable of so much vileness but forgive me miss it is only sir simon i dare say who could think so hardly of him and i am in great hope for the honor of the present age quite contrary to the aspersion that every age grows worse and worse that the last if it produced people capable of such attempts was wickeder than this  bad as my dear mr bs designs and attempts were upon me i can now i am set above fearing them and am enabled to reflect upon them with less terror and apprehension be earnest for his own dear sake to think him not even then the worst of men though bad enough in all conscience for have we not heard of those that have had no remorse or compunction at all and have actually executed all their vile purposes when a poor creature was in their power  yet indeed after sore trials that is true did not god turn his heart and although i was still helpless and without any friend in the world and in the hands of a poor vile woman who to be sure was worse than he provoking him to ruin me and so wholly in his power that i durst not disobey him whether he bid me come to him or be gone from him as he was pleased or displeased with me yet i say for all this did he not overcome his criminal passion and entertain an honorable one though to his poor servant girl and brave the world and the worlds censures and marry me  and does not this show that the seeds of honor were kept alive in his heart though choked or kept from sprouting forth for a time by the weeds of sensuality pride and youthful impetuosity and by cutting down the latter have not the former taken root have they not shot out and in their turn kept down at least the depressed weeds and who now lives more virtuously than mr b  let me tell you my dear miss that i have not heard of many instances of gentlemen who having designed vilely have stopped short and acted so honorably and who continue to act so nobly and i have great confidence that he will in time be as pious as he is now moral for though he has a few bad notions which he talks of nowandthen as polygamy and suchlike which indeed give me a little serious thought sometimes because a man is too apt to practice what he has persuaded himself to believe is no crime yet i hope they are owing more to the liveliness of his wit a wild quality which does not always confine itself to proper exercises than to his judgment and if i can but see the first three or four months residence over in that wicked london which they say is so seducing a place without adding to my apprehensions how happy shall i be  so much slightly have i thought proper to say in behalf of my dear mr b for a good wife cannot but hope for a sweeter and more elevated companionship if her presumptuous heart makes her look upward with hope herself than this transitory state can afford us and what a sad case is hers who being as exemplary as human frailty will permit her to be looks forward upon the partner of her adverse and of her prosperous estate the husband of her bosom the father of her children the head of her family as a poor unhappy soul destined to a separate and a miserable existence for ever  o my dear miss  how can such a thought be supportable  but what high consolation what transport rather at times must hers be who shall be blessed with the hope of being an humble instrument to reclaim such a dear dear thrice dear partner  and that heart in heart and hand in hand they shall one day issue forth from this encumbered state into a blessed eternity benefited by each others example  i will lay down my pen and enjoy the rich thought for a few moments  now my dear miss let me as a subject very pleasing to me touch upon your kind mention of the worthy mr peterss sentiments in relation to that part of his conduct to me which oppressed by the terrors and apprehensions to which i was subjected once indeed i censured and so much the readier as i had ever so great an honor for his cloth that i thought to be a clergyman and all that was compassionate good and virtuous was the same thing  but when i came to know mr peters i had a high opinion of his worthiness and as no one can be perfect in this life thus i thought to myself how hard was then my lot to be a cause of stumbling to so worthy a heart to be sure a gentleman who knows so well and practices so well his duty in every other instance and preaches it so efficaciously to others must have been one day sensible that it would not have misbecome his function and character to have afforded that protection to oppressed innocence which was requested of him and how would it have grieved his considerate mind had my ruin been completed that he did not  but as he had once a namesake as one may say that failed in a much greater instance let not my want of charity exceed his fault but let me look upon it as an infirmity to which the most perfect are liable i was a stranger to him a servant girl carried off by her master a young gentleman of violent and lawless passions who in this very instance showed how much in earnest he was set upon effecting all his vile purposes and whose heart although god might touch it was not probable any lesser influence could  then he was not sure that though he might assist my escape i might not afterward fall again into the hands of so determined a violator and that difficulty would not with such an one inhance his resolution to overcome all obstacles  moreover he might think that the person who was moving him to this worthy measure might possibly be seeking to gratify a view of his own and that while he was endeavoring to save to outwatd appearance a virtue in danger he was in reality only helping at the hazard of exposing himself to the vindictiveness of a violent temper and a rich neighbor who had power as well as will to resent another to a wife for such was his vol i p     l   apprehension groundless entirely groundless as it was though not improbable as it might seem to him  then again the sad examples set by too many european sovereigns in whom the royal and priestly offices are united for are not kings the lords anointed and the little scruple which many persons right reverend by their functions and characters too generally make to pay sordid court and visits far from bearing their testimony against such practices even to concubines who have interest to promote them that these arguments were pleaded by mr peters see vol i p     l    etc  are no small discouragements to a private clergyman to do his duty and to make himself enemies among his powerful neighbors for the cause of virtue and especially forgive me dear sir simon darnford if you should see this when an eminent magistrate one of the principal gentlemen of the county of an independent fortune who had fine young ladies to his daughters who had nothing but their superior conditions not their sex to exempt them from like attempts a justice of peace and of the quorum refused to be a see vol i p     l    justice though such a breach of the peace was made and such a violation of morals plainly intended this i say must add to the discouragement of a gentleman a little too diffident and timorous of himself and who having no one to second him had he afforded me his protection must have stood alone in the gap and made to himself in an active gentleman an enemy who had a thousand desirable qualities to make one wish him for a friend  for all these considerations i think my self obliged to pity rather than too rigorously to censure the worthy gentleman and i must and will always respect him and thank him a thousand times my dear miss in my name for his goodness in condescending to acknowledge by your dear hand his infirmity as such for this gives an excellent proof of the natural worthiness of his heart and that it is beneath him to seek to extenuate a fault when he thinks he has committed one  indeed my dear friend i have so much honor for the clergy of all degrees that i never forget in my prayers one article that god will make them burning and shining lights to the world since so much depends on their ministry and examples as well with respect to our public as private duties nor shall the faults of a few make impression upon me to the disadvantage of the order for i am afraid a very censorious temper in this respect is too generally the indication of an uncharitable and perhaps a profligate heart levelling characters in order to cover some inward pride or secret enormities which they are ashamed to avow and will not be instructed to amend  forgive my dear miss this tedious scribble i cannot for my life write short letters to those i love and let me hope that you will favor me with an account of your new affair and how you proceed in it and with such of your conversations as may give me some notion of a polite courtship for alas my dear miss your poor friend knows nothing of this all her courtship was sometimes a hasty snatch of the hand a black and blue gripe of the arm and whither now  come to me when i bid you  and saucyface and creature and suchlike on his part  with fear and trembling on mine and  i will i will  good sir have mercy at other times a scream and nobody to hear or mind me and with uplift hands bent knees and tearful eyes  for gods sake pity your poor servant  this my dear miss was the hard treatment that attended my courtship  pray then let me know how gentlemen court their equals in degree how they look when they address you with their knees bent sighing supplicating and all that as sir simon says with the words slave servant admirer continually at their tongues ends  but after all it will be found i believe that be the language and behavior ever so obsequious it is all designed to end alike  the english the plain english of the politest address is i am now dear madam your humble servant pray be so good as to let me be your master yes and thank you too says the ladys heart though not her lips if she likes him and so they go to church together and in conclusion it will be happy if these obsequious courtships end no worse than my frightful one  but i am convinced that with a man of sense a woman of tolerable prudence must be happy  that whenever you marry it may be to such a man who then must value you as you deserve and make you as happy as i now am notwithstanding all that is past wishes and prays  your obliged friend and servant p b n b although miss darnford could not receive the above letter so soon as to answer it before others were sent to her by her fair correspondent yet we think it not amiss to dispense with the order of time that the reader may have the letter and answer at one view and shall on other occasions take the like liberty    letter xxviii in answer to the preceding my dear mrs b you charm us all with your letters mr peters says he will never go to bed nor rise but he will pray for you and desires i will return his thankful acknowlegements for your favorable opinion of him and kind allowances if there be an angel on earth he says you are one my papa although he has seen your stinging reflection upon his refusal to protect you is delighted with you too and says when you come down to lincolnshire again he will be undertaken by you in good earnest for he thinks he was wrong to deny you his protection  we are pleased with your apology for mr b it is so much the part of a good wife to extenuate her husbands faults and make the best of his bad qualities in order to give the world a good opinion of him that together with the affecting instances of your humility in looking back with so much true greatness of mind to what you were make us all join to admire you and own that nobody can deserve what you deserve  yet i am sorry my dear friend to find notwithstanding your defense of mr b that you have any apprehensions about london it is pity any thing should give you concern as to mr bs talking in favor of polygamy you cannot expect that he can shake off all his bad notions at once and it must be a great comfort to you that his actions do not correspond and that his liberties have been reduced to notions only in time we hope that he will be every thing you wish him if not with such an example before him he will be the more culpable  we all smiled at the description of your own uncommon courtship and as they say the days of courtship are the happiest part of life if we had not known that your days of marriage are happier by far than any other bodys courtship we must needs have pitied you but as the one were days of trial and temptation the other are days of reward and happiness may the last always continue to be so and you will have no occasion to think any body happier than mrs b  i thank you heartily for your good wishes as to the man of sense mr murray has been here and continues his visits he is a lively gentleman well enough in his person has a tolerable character yet loves company and will take his bottle freely my papa likes him never the worse for that he talks a good deal dresses gay and even richly and seems to like his own person very well no great pleasure this for a lady to look forward to yet he falls far short of that genteel ease and graceful behavior which distinguish your mr b from any body i know  i wish mr murray would apply to my sister she is an illnatured girl but would make a good wife i hope and i fansy she would like him well enough i cannot say i do he laughs too much has something boisterous in his conversation his complaisance is not a pretty complaisance he is well versed in country sports and my papa loves him for that too and says he is a most accomplished gentleman yes cry i as gentlemen go  you must be saucy says sir simon and when a partrige is put on your plate snuff up your nose at it when were you kept a little hungry you would have leapt at a coarser bird  i know some gentlemens partriges sir cried i no better than rank wigeons and far short of a stubble goose he called me one of his free names  but i have broken my mind to my dear my indulgent mamma who tells me she will do me all the pleasure she can but would be loath the youngest daughter should go first as she calls it but if i could come and live with you a little nowandthen i did not care who married unless such an one offered as i never expect  i have great hope the gentleman will be easily persuaded to quit me for nancy for i see he has not delicacy enough to love with any great distinction he says as my mamma tells me by the bye that i am the handsomest and best humored and he has found out as he thinks that i have some wit and have ease and freedom and he tacks innocence to them in my address and conversation it is well for me he is of this opinion for if he thinks justly which i much question any body may think so still much more for i have been far from taking pains to engage his good word having been under more reserve to him than ever i was before to any body  indeed i cannot help it for the gentleman is forward without delicacy and pardon me sir simon my papa has not one bit of it neither but is for pushing matters on with his rough raillery that puts me out of countenance and has already adjusted the sordid part of the preliminaries as he tells me  yet i hope nancys  000 l fortune more than i am likely to have see vol ii p      will give her the wished for preference with mr murray and then as to a brotherinlaw in prospect i can put off all restraint and return to my usual freedom  this is all that occurs worthy of notice from us but from you we expect an account of lady daverss visit and of the conversations that offer among you and you have so delightful a way of making every thing momentous either by your subject or reflections or both that we long for every postday in hopes of the pleasure of a letter  and yours i will always carefully preserve as so many testimonies of the honor i receive in this correspondence which will be always esteemed as it deserves by my dear mrs b  your obliged and faithful polly darnford mrs peters mrs jones my papa mamma and sister present their due respects mr peters i mentioned before he continues to give a very good account of poor jewkes and is much pleased with her    letter xxix my dear miss darnford at your desire and to oblige your honored mamma and your good neighbors i will now acquaint you with the arrival of lady davers and will wrie what passes between us i will not say worthy of notice for were i to do so i should be more brief perhaps by much than you seem to expect but as my time is pretty much taken up and i find i shall be obliged to write a bit now and a bit then you must excuse me if i dispense with some forms which i ought to observe when i write to one i so dearly love and so i will give it journalwise as it were and have no regard when it would fetter or break in upon my freedom of narration to inscription or subscription but send it as i have opportunity and if you please to favor me so far as to lend it me after you have read the stuff for the perusal of my father and mother to whom my duty and promise require me to give an account of my proceedings it will save me transcription for which i shall have no time and then you will excuse blots and blurs and i will trouble myself no further for apologies on that score but this one for all  if you think it worth while when they have read it you shall have it again  wednesday morning six oclock for my dear friend permits me to rise an hour sooner than my wont that i may have time to scribble for he is always pleased to see me so employed or in reading often saying when i am at my needle as his sister once wrote see this vol p    your maids can do this pamela but they cannot write as you can and yet as he tells me when i choose to follow my needle as a diversion from too intense study as he is pleased to call it but alas i know not what study is as may be easily guessed by my hasty writing putting down every thing as it comes i shall then do as i please but you must understand i promised at setting out what a good wife i would endeavor to make see vol ii p     and every honest body should try to be as good as their word you know and such particulars as i then mentioned i think i ought to dispense with as little as possible especially as i promised no more than what was my duty to perform if i had not promised  but what a preamble is here  judge by it what impertinences you may expect as i proceed  yesterday about six in the evening arrived here my lord and lady davers their nephew and the countess of c mother of lady betty whom we did not expect but took it for the greater favor it seems her ladyship longed as she said to see me and this was her principal inducement the two ladies and their two women were in lord daverss coach and six and my lord and his nephew rode on horseback attended with a train of servants  we had expected them to dinner but they could not reach time enough for the countess being a little incommoded with her journey the coach traveled slowly my lady would not suffer her lord nor his nephew to come hither before her though on horseback because she would be present she said when his lordship first saw me he having quite forgot her mothers pamela that was her word  it rained when they came in so the coach drove directly to the door mr b receiving them there but i was in a little sort of flutter which mr b observing made me sit down in the parlour to compose myself where is pamela said my lady as soon as she alighted in the passage  i stepped out lest she should take it amiss and she took my hand and kissed me here my lady countess said she presenting me to her  here is the girl see if i said too much in praise of her person  the countess saluted me with a kind pleasure in her eye and said indeed lady davers you have not twould have been strange excuse me mrs b for i know your story if such a fine flower had not been transplanted from the field to the garden  i made no return but by a low courtsy to her ladyships compliment then lady davers taking my hand again presented me to her lord see here my lord my mothers pamela  and see here my lord said her generous brother taking my other hand most kindly see here your brothers pamela too  my lord saluted me i do said he to his lady i do said he to his brother and i see the first person in her that has exceeded my expectation when every mouth had prepared me to expect a wonder  mr h whom every one calls lord jackey after his aunts example when she is in good humor with him and who is a very young gentleman though about as old as my best friend came to me next and said lovelier and lovelier by my life  i never saw your peer madam  will you excuse me miss all this seeming vanity for the sake of repeating exactly what passed  well but said my lady taking my hand in her free quality way which quite dashed me and holding it at distance and turning me halfround her eye fixed to my waist let me observe you a little my sweetfacd girl  i hope i am right  i hope you will do credit to my brother as he has done you credit  why do you let her lace so tight mr b  i was unable to look up as you may believe miss my face all over scarlet was hid in my bosom and i looked so silly   ay said my naughty lady you may well look down my good girl for to talk to thee in thy own grave way thou have verified the scripture what is done in secret shall be known on the housetop  dear my lady said i  for still she kept looking at me and her dear brother seeing my confusion in pity to me pressed my blushing face a moment on his generous breast and said lady davers you should not be thus hard upon my dear girl the moment you see her and before so many witnesses but look up my best love take your revenge of my sister and tell her you wish her in the same way  it is so then said my lady i am glad of it with all my heart i will now love you still better but i almost doubted it seeing her still so slender but if my good child you lace too tight i will never forgive you and so she gave me a kiss of congratulation as she said  do you think miss i did not look very silly  my lord smiling and gazing at me from head to foot lord jackey grinning and laughing like an oaf as i then in my spite thought indeed the countess said incouragingly to me but severely on persons of birth  lady davers you are as much too teizing as mrs b is too bashful but youre a happy man mr b that your ladys modesty and bashfulness are the only marks by which we can judge she is not of quality lord jackey in the language of some character in a play cried out a palpable hit by jupiter and laughed egregiously running about from one to another repeating the same words  we talked only upon common topics till suppertime and i was all ear as i thought it became me for the countess had by her first compliment and by an aspect as noble as intelligent obliged me to silence in awe of a superiority so visible as had lady daverss free though pleasant raillery which she could not help carrying on nowandthen besides lady daverss letters had given me greater reason to revere her wit and judgment high as my respect for her before had carried my notions of her excellence that i had formed to myself when i reflected on her passionate temper and such parts of the conversation i had had with her ladyship in your neighborhood which however to be admired fell short of her letters  when we were to sit down at table i looked i suppose a little diffidently for i really then thought of my ladys anger at the hall when she would not have permitted me to sit at table with her see vol ii p   0  and mr b saying take your place my dear you keep our friends standing i sat down in my usual place and my lady said none of your reproaching eye pamela i know what you hint at and every letter i have received from you has helped to make me censure myself for my ladyairs as you call em you saucebox you i told you i would ladyairs you when i saw you and you shall have it all in good time  i am sure said i i shall have nothing from your ladyship but what will be very agreeable but indeed i never meant any thing particular by that or any other word that i wrote nor could i think of any thing but what was highly respectful to your ladyship  lord davers was pleased to say that it was impossible i should either write or speak any thing that could be taken amiss  lady davers after supper and the servants were withdrawn began a discourse on titles and said brother i think you should hold yourself obliged to my lord davers for he has spoken to lord s who made him a visit a few days ago to procure you a baronets patent your estate and the figure you make in the world are so considerable and your family besides is so ancient that methinks you should wish for some distinction of that sort  yes brother said my lord i did mention it to lord s and told him withal that it was without your knowledge or desire that i spoke about it and i was not very sure you would accept of it but it is a thing your sister has wished for a good while  what answer did my lord s make to it said mr b  he said we meaning the ministers i suppose should be glad to oblige a gentleman of mr bs figure in the world but you mention it so slightly that you can hardly expect courtiers will tender it to any gentleman that is so indifferent about it for lord davers we seldom grant honors without a view i tell you that said he smiling  my lord s might mention this as a jest returned mr b but he spoke the truth but your lordship said well that i was indifferent about it it is true it is an hereditary title but the rich citizens who used to be satisfied with the title of knights till they made it so common that it was brought into as great contempt as the this order was become so scandalously common in france that in order to suppress it the hangman was vested with the ensigns of it which effectually abolished it french knights of st michael and nobody else cared to accept of it now are ambitious of this and i take it it is hastening apace into like disrepute besides it is a novel honor and what our ancestors who lived at its institution would never accept of but were it a peerage they would give me which has some essential privileges and splendors attached to it that would make it desirable to some men i would not enter into conditions for it titles at best added he are but shadows and he that has the substance should be above valuing them for who that has the whole bird would pride himself upon a single feather  but said my lady although i acknowledge that the institution is of late date yet as abroad as well as at home it is regarded as a title of dignity and it is supposed that the best families among the gentry are of it i should be glad you would accept of it and as to citizens being of it they are not many and some of them or their immediate descendants however have bought themselves into the peerage itself of the one kingdom or the other  as to what it is looked upon abroad said mr b that is of no weight at all for when an englishman travels be he of what degree he will if he has an equipage and squanders his money away he is a lord of course with foreigners and therefore sir suchaone is rather a diminution to him as it fixes him down to a lower title than his vanity would perhaps make him aspire to be thought in the possession of then as to citizens in a trading nation like this i am not displeased in the main with seeing the overgrown ones creeping into nominal honors and we have so many of our first titled families who have allied themselves to trade whose inducements were money only that it ceases to be either a wonder as to the fact or a disgrace to the honor  well brother said my lady i will tell you further the thing may be had for asking for if you will but go to court and desire to kiss the kings hand that will be all the trouble you will have and pray now oblige me in it  if a title would make me either a better or a wiser man replied mr b i would embrace it with pleasure besides i am not so entirely satisfied with some of the measures now pursuing as to owe any obligation to the ministers accepting of a small title from them is but like putting on their badge or listing under their banners like a certain lord we all know who accepted of one degree more of title to show he was theirs and would not have a higher lest it should be thought a satisfaction tantamount to half the pension he demanded and could i be easy to have it supposed that i was an ungrateful man for voting as i pleased because they gave me the title of a baronet  the countess said the world always thought mr b was a gentleman of moderate principles and not attached to any party and it was her opinion that it was far from being inconsistent with any gentlemans honor and independency to accept of a title from a prince he acknowleged as his sovereign  it is very true madam replied mr b that i am attached to no party and never will and i have a mean opinion of many of the heads of both nay i will say further that i wish at my heart the gentlemen in the administration would pursue such measures that i could give them every vote as i always will every one that i can and i have no very high opinion of those who right or wrong would distress or imbarass a government for this is certain that our governors cannot be always in the wrong and he therefore who never gives them a vote must probably be as often out of the way as they and must moreover have some view he will not own but in a country like ours where each of the legislative powers is in a manner independent and where they are designed as mutual checks upon each other i have notwithstanding so great an opinion of the necessity of an opposition sometimes that i am convinced it is that which must preserve our constitution i will therefore be a country gentleman in the true sense of the word and will accept of no favor that shall make any one think i would not be of the opposition when i think it a necessary one as on the other hand i should scorn to make myself a round to any mans ladder of preferment or a caballer for the sake of my own  you say well brother returned lady davers but you may undoubtedly keep your own principles and independency and yet pay your duty to the king and accept of this title for your family and fortune will be a greater ornament to the title than the title to you  then what occasion have i for it if that be the case madam  why i cannot say but i should be glad you had it for your familys sake as it is an hereditary honor then it would mend the style of your spouse here for the good girl is at such a loss for an epithet when she writes that i see the constraint she lies under it is my dear gentleman my best friend my benefactor my dear mr b whereas sir william would turn off her periods more roundly and no other softer epithet would be wanting  to me replied he who always desire to be distinguished as my pamelas best friend and think it an honor to be called her dear mr b and her dear gentleman this reason weighs very little unless there were no other sir william in the kingdom than her sir william for i am very emulous of her favor i can tell you and think it no small distinction  i blushed at this too great honor before such company and was afraid my lady would be a little piqud at it but after a pause she said well then brother will you let pamela decide upon this point  rightly put said the countess pray let mrs b choose for you sir my lady has hit the thing  very good very good by my soul says lord jackey let my young aunt that was his word choose for you sir  well then pamela said the dear gentleman give us your opinion as to this point  but first said lady davers say you will be determined by it or else she will be laid under a difficulty  well then replied he be it so i will be determined by your opinion my dear give it me freely  lord jackey rubbed his hands together charming charming as i hope to live by jove this is just as i wished  well now pamela said my lady speak your true heart without disguise i charge you do  why then gentlemen and ladies said i if i must be so bold as to speak on a subject upon which on several accounts it would become me to be silent i should be against the title but perhaps my reason is of too private a nature to weigh any thing and if so it would not become me to have any choice at all  they all called upon me for my reason and i said looking down a little abashed it is this here my dear mr b has disparaged himself by distinguishing as he has done such a low body as i and the world will be apt to say he is seeking to repair one way the honor he has lost another and then perhaps it will be attributed to my pride and ambition here they will be apt to say the proud cottager will needs be a lady in hopes to conceal her descent whereas had i such a vain thought it would be but making it the more remembered against both my dear mr b and myself and indeed as to my own part added i i take too much pride in having been lifted up into this distinction for the causes to which i owe it your brothers bounty and generosity than to be ashamed of what i was only nowandthen i am concerned for his own sake lest he should be too much censured  but this would not be prevented by the title but rather would be aggravated by it  so i am humbly of opinion against the title  the dear gentleman had hardly patience to hear me out but came to me and folding his arms about me said just as i wished have you answered my beloved pamela i was never yet deceived in you no not once  my lady countess my lord davers my lady davers said the dear gentleman do we want any titles think you to make us happy but what we can confer upon ourselves and he pressed my hand to his lips as he always honors me most in company and went to his place highly pleased while his fine manner drew tears from my eyes and made his noble sisters and the countesss glisten too  my lady said well for my part thou art a strange girl where as my brother once said see vol i p  0  gottest thou all this then pleasantly humourous as if she was angry she changed her tone what signify thy meek words and humble speeches when by thy actions as well as sentiments thou reflectest upon us all  pamela said she have less merit or take care to conceal it better i shall otherwise have no more patience with thee than thy monarch has just now shown  the countess was pleased to say youre a happy couple indeed and i must needs repeat to you mr b four lines that sir william davenant made upon a lady who could not possibly deserve them so much as yours does she never saw courts but courts could have outdone with untaught looks and an unpracticed heart her nets the most prepared could never shun for nature spread them in the scorn of art   but my dear miss how lucky one sometimes is in having what one says well accepted ay that is all in all for the reason for the answer i gave was so obvious that one in my circumstances could not miss it yet what compliments had i upon it it is a sign they were prepared to think well of me and that is my great pleasure and happiness  such sort of entertainment as this you are to expect from your correspondent i cannot do better than i can and it may appear such a mixture of selfpraise vanity and impertinence that i expect you will tell me freely as soon as this comes to your hand whether it be tolerable to you yet i must write on for my dear father and mothers sake who require it of me and are prepared to approve of every thing that comes from me for no other reason but that and i think you ought to leave me to write to them only as i cannot hope it will be entertaining to any body else without expecting as much partiality and favor from others as i have from my dear parents mean time i conclude here my first conversationpiece and am and will be  always yours etc p b  letter xxx thursday morning six oclock our breakfast conversation yesterday at which only mrs worden my ladys woman and my polly attended was so whimsically particular though i doubt some of it at least will appear too trifling that i cannot help acquainting my dear miss darnford with it who is desirous of knowing all that relates to lady daverss conduct toward me  you must know then that i have the honor to stand very high in the graces of lord davers who on every occasion is pleased to call me his good sister his dear sister and sometimes his charming sister and he tells me he will not be out of my company for an hour together while he stays here if he can help it  my lady seems to relish this very well in the main though she cannot quite so readily yet frame her mouth to the sound of the word sister as my lord does of which this that follows is one instance  his lordship had called me by that tender name twice before and saying i will drink another dish i think my good sister my lady said your lordship has got a word by the end that you seem mighty fond of i have taken notice that you have called pamela sister sister sister no less than three times in a quarter of an hour  my lord looked a little serious i shall one day or other said he be allowed to choose my own words and phrases i hope your sister mr b added he often questions whether i am at age or not though the house of peers made no scruple of admitting me among them some years ago  mr b said severely but with a smiling air it is well she has such a gentleman as your lordship for a husband whose affectionate indulgence overlooks all her saucy sallies i am sure when you took her out of our family into your own we all thought ourselves bound to pray for you  i thought this a great trial of my ladys patience but it was from mr b and she said with a halfpleasant halfserious air how now confidence  none but my brother could have said this whose violent spirit was always much more intolerable than mine but i can tell you mr b i was always thought very goodhumored and obliging to every body till your impudence came from college and from your travels and then i own your provoking ways made me nowandthen a little out of the way  well well sister well have no more of this subject only let us see that my lord davers wants not his proper authority with you although you used to keep me in awe formerly  keep you in awe  that nobody could ever do yet boy or man  but my lord i beg your pardon for this brother will make mischief betwixt us if he can  i only took notice of the word sister so often used which looked more like affectation than affection  perhaps lady davers said my lord gravely i have two reasons for using the word so frequently  i would be glad to hear them said the dear taunting lady for i dont doubt they are mighty good ones what are they my lord  one is because i love and am fond of my new relation the other that you are so sparing of the epithet that i call her so for us both  your lordship says well rejoined my dear mr b smiling and lady davers can give two reasons why she does not  well said my lady now we are in for it let us hear your two reasons likewise i doubt not they are wise ones too  if they are yours lady davers they must be so one is that every condescension of a proud lady to speak in her own dialect comes as hard and as difficult as a favor from the house of austria to the petty princes of germany the second because of your sex excuse me my lady countess who having once made scruples think it inconsistent with themselves to be overhasty to alter their own conduct choosing rather to persist in an error than own it to be one  this proceeded from the dear gentlemans impatience to see me in the least slighted by my lady and i said to lord davers to soften matters never my lord were brother and sister so loving in earnest and yet so satirical upon each other in jest as my good lady and mr b but your lordship knows their way  my lady frowned at her brother but turned it off with an air i love the mistress of this house said she very well and am quite reconciled to her but methinks there is such a hissing sound in the word sister that i cannot abide it it is a true english word and a word i have not been used to having never had a sissster before as you know speaking the first syllable of the word with an emphatical hiss  mr b said observe you not lady davers that you used a word to avoid that which had twice the hissing in it that sister had  and that was missstress with two other hissing words to accompany it of thisss houssse but what childish follies does not pride make one stoop to excuse my lady to the countess such poor low conversation as we are dwindled into  o sir said her ladyship the conversation is very agreeable and i think lady davers youre fairly caught  well said my lady then help me good sister there is for you to a little sugar will that please you sir  i am always pleased replied her brother smiling when lady davers acts up to her own character and the good sense she is mistress of  ay ay returned she my good brother like other wise men takes it for granted that it is a mark of good sense to approve of whatever he does  and so for this one time i am a very sensible body with him  and i will leave off while i have his good word only one thing i must say to you my dear turning to me that though i call you pamela and pamela as i please i do assure you i love you as well as if i called you sister sister as lord davers does at every word  your ladyship gives me great pleasure said i in this kind assurance and i dont doubt but i shall have the honor of being called by that tender name if i can be so happy as to deserve it and i will lose no opportunity that shall be afforded me to show how sincerely i will endeavor to do so  she was pleased to rise from her seat give me a kiss my dear girl you deserve every thing and permit me to say pamela sometimes as the word occurs for i am not used to speak in print and i will call you sister when i think of it and love you as well as ever sister loved another  these proud and passionate folks said my dear mr b how good they can be when they reflect a little on what becomes their characters  so then said my lady i am to have no merit of my own i see do what i will this is not quite so generous in my brother  why you saucy sister said he excuse me lord davers what merit would you have can people merit by doing their duty and is it so great a praise that you think fit to own for a sister so deserving a girl as this whom i take pride in calling my wife  thou art what thou always wast returned my lady and were i in this my imputed pride to want an excuse i know not the creature living that ought so soon to make one for me as you  i do excuse you said he for that very reason if you please but it little becomes either your pride or mine to do any thing that wants excuse  mighty moral mighty grave truly pamela friend sister  there is for you thou art a happy girl to have made such a reformation in thy honest mans way of thinking as well as acting but now we are upon this topic and none but friends about us i am resolved to be even with thee brother jackey if you are not for another dish i wish you would withdraw polly barlow we dont want you beck you may stay mr h obeyed and polly went out for you must know miss that my lady davers will have none of the menfellows as she calls them to attend upon us at tea and i cannot say but i think her entirely in the right for several reasons that might be given  when they were withdrawn my lady repeated now we are upon this topic of reclaiming and reformation tell me thou bold wretch for you know i have seen all your rogueries in pamelas papers tell me if ever rake but thyself made such an attempt as thou did on this dear good girl in presence of a virtuous woman as mrs jervis always was noted to be as to the other vile creature jewkes it is less wonder although in that thou had the impudence of him who set thee to work but to make thy attempt before mrs jervis and in spite of her struggles and reproaches was the very stretch of shameless wickedness  the dear gentleman seemed a little disconcerted and said surely surely lady davers this is going too far look at pamelas blushing face and downcast eye and wonder at yourself for this question as much as you do at me for the actions you speak of  the countess said to me my dear mrs b i wonder not at this sweet confusion on so affecting a question but indeed since it has come in so naturally i must say mr b that we have all and my daughters too wondered at this more than any part of your attempts because sir we thought you one of the most civilized gentlemen in england and that you could not but wish to have saved appearances a little  though this said mr b is to you my pamela the renewal of griefs yet hold up your dear face  you may  the triumph was yours  the shame and the blushes ought to be mine  and i will humor my saucy sister in all she would have me say  nay said lady davers you know the question i cannot put it stronger  that is very true replied he  but what would you have me say do you expect i should give you a reason for an attempt that appears to you so very shocking  nay sir said the countess dont say appears to lady davers for excuse me it will appear so to every one who hears of it  i think my brother is too hardly used said lord davers he has made all the amends he could make and you my sister who were the person offended forgive him now i hope dont you  i could not answer for i was quite confounded and made a motion to withdraw but mr b said dont go my dear though i ought to be ashamed of an action set before me in so full a glare in presence of lord davers and the countess  yet i will not have you stir because i forget how you represented it and you must tell me  indeed sir i cannot said i pray my dear ladies pray my good lord and dear sir dont thus renew my griefs as you were pleased justly to phrase it  i have the representation of that scene in my pocket said my lady for i was resolved as i told lady betty to shame the wicked wretch with it the first opportunity i had and i will read it to you or rather you shall read it yourself boldface if you can  so she pulled those leaves out of her pocket wrapped up carefully in a paper  here i believe he who could act thus must read it and to spare pamelas confusion read it to yourself for we all know how it was  i think said he taking the papers i can say something that will abate the heinousness of this heavy charge or else i should not stand thus at the insolent bar of my sister answering her interrogatories  i send you my dear miss a transcript of the charge as follows  to be sure you will say he was a very wicked gentleman  see vol i p    and seq    mr b read this to himself and said this is a dark affair as it is here stated and i cannot say but pamela and mrs jervis too had a great deal of reason to apprehend the worst but surely readers of it who were less parties in the supposed attempt and who were not determined at all events to condemn me might have made a more favorable construction for me than you lady davers have done in the strong light in which you have set this heinous matter before us  however since my lady countess and lord davers seem to expect that i shall particularly answer to this black charge i will at a proper time if it will be agreeable give you a brief history of my passion for this dear girl how it commenced and increased and my own struggles with it and this will introduce with some little advantage to myself perhaps what i have to say as to this supposed attempt and at the same time enable you the better to account for some facts which you have read in my pretty accusers papers  this pleased every one and they begged him to begin then but he said it was time we should think of dressing the morning being far advanced and if no company came in he would give them in the afternoon the particulars they desired to hear  the three gentlemen rode out and returned just time enough to dress before dinner and my lady and the countess also took an airing in the chariot just as they returned compliments came from several of the neighboring ladies to our noble guests on their arrival in these parts and to as many as sent lady davers desired their companies for tomorrow in the afternoon to drink tea but mr b having fallen in with some of the gentlemen likewise he told me we should have most of our visiting neighbors at dinner and desired mrs jervis might prepare accordingly for them  after dinner mr h took a ride out attended with mr colbrand of whom he is very fond ever since he frightened lady daverss footmen at the hall threatening see vol ii p   0 to chine them if they offered to stop his lady for he says he loves a man of courage very probably knowing his own defects that way for my lady nowandthen calls him a chickenhearted fellow and then lord and lady davers and the countess revived the subject of the morning and mr b was pleased to begin in the manner i shall mention byandby for here i am obliged to break off  now my dear miss i will proceed  i need not said the dear gentleman observe to any body who knows what love is or rather that violent passion which we mad young fellows are apt to miscal love what mean things it puts us upon how it unmans and levels with the dust the proudest spirit in the sequel of my story you will observe several instances of this truth  i began very early to take notice of this lovely girl even when she was hardly thirteen years old for her charms increased every day not only in my eye but in the eyes of every one who beheld her my mother as you lady davers know took the greatest delight in her always calling her her pamela her good child and her waitingmaid and her cabinet of rarities were her boasts and equally shown to every visitor for besides the beauty of her figure and the genteel air of her person the dear girl had a surprising memory a solidity of judgment above her years and a docility so unequaled that she took all parts of learning which her lady as fond of instructing her as she of improving by instruction crowded upon her insomuch that she had masters to teach her to dance to sing and to play on the spinnet whom she every day surprised by the readiness wherewith she took every thing  i remember once my mother praising her girl before me and my aunt b who is since dead i could not but take notice to her of her fondness for her and said what do you design madam to do with or do for this pamela of yours the accomplishments you give her will do her more hurt than good for they will set her so much above her degree that what you intend as a kindness may prove her ruin  my aunt joined with me and spoke in a still stronger manner against giving her such an education  and added as i well remember surely sister you do wrong one would think if one knew not my nephews discreet pride that you design her for something more than your own waitingmaid  ah sister said the old lady there is no fear of what you hint at his family pride and stately temper will secure my son he has too much of his father in him  and as for pamela you know not the girl she has always in her thoughts and in her mouth too her fathers mean condition and i shall do nothing for them at least at present though they are honest folks and deserve well because i will keep the girl humble  but what can i do with the little baggage continued my mother she conquers every thing so fast and has such a thirst after knowledge and the more she knows i verily think the humbler she is that i cannot help letting go as my son when a little boy used to do to his kite as fast as she pulls and to what height she will soar i cannot tell  i intended proceeded the good lady at first only to make her mistress of some fine needleworks to qualify her as she has a delicacy in her person that makes it a pity she should ever be put to hard work for a genteel place but she masters that so fast that now as my daughter is married and gone from me i am desirous to qualify her to divert and entertain me in my thoughtful hours and were you sister to know what she is capable of and how diverting her innocent prattle is to me and her natural simplicity which i encourage her to preserve amidst all she learns you would not nor my son neither wonder at the pleasure i take in her  shall i call her in  i dont want said i to have the girl called in if you madam are diverted with her that is enough  to be sure pamela is a better companion for a lady than a monkey or a harlequin but i fear you will set her above herself and make her vain and pert and that at last in order to support her pride she may fall into temptations that may be fatal to herself and others too  im glad to hear this from my son said the good lady but the moment i see my favor puffs her up i shall take other measures  well thought i to myself i want only to conceal my views from your penetrating eye my good mother and i shall one day take as much delight in your girl and her accomplishments as you now do so go on and improve her as fast as you will i will only nowandthen talk against her to blind you and doubt not that all you bestow upon her will qualify her the better for my purpose  only thought i fly swiftly on two or three more tardy years and i will nip this bud by the time it begins to open and place it in my bosom for a year or two at least for so long if the girl behaves worthy of her education i doubt not she will be new to me excuse me ladies excuse me lord davers if i am not ingenuous i had better be silent  i will as little as possible my dear miss interrupt this affecting narration by mentioning my own alternate blushes confusions and exclamations as the naughty gentleman went on nor the censures and many outuponyous of me attentive ladies and fie brothers of lord davers nor yet with apologies for the praises on myself so frequently intermingled  contenting myself to give you as near as i can recollect the very sentences of the dear relator and as to our intermingled exclaimings and observations you may suppose what they were occasionally  so continued mr b i went on dropping hints against her nowandthen and whenever i met her in the passages about the house or in the garden avoiding to look at her or to speak to her as she passed me courtsying and putting on a thousand bewitching airs of obligingness and reverence while i who thought that the best way to demolish the influence of such an education would be to avoid alarming her fears on one hand or to familiarize myself to her on the other till i came to strike the blow looked haughty and reserved and passed by her with a stiff nod at most or if i spoke how does your lady this morning girl  i hope she rested well last night then covered with blushes and courtsying at every word as if she thought herself unworthy of answering my questions she would trip away in a kind of hurry and confusion as soon as she had spoken and once i heard her say to mrs jervis dear sirs my young master spoke to me and called me by my name saying how slept your lady last night pamela was not that very good mrs jervis was it not  ay thought i i am in the right way i find this will do in proper time go on my dear mother improving as fast as you will i will engage to pull down in three hours what you will be building up in as many years in spite of all the lessons you can teach her  it is enough for me that i am establishing with you ladies and with you my lord a higher reputation for my pamela i am but too sensible i can make none for myself in the relation i am now giving you every one but my mother who however had no high opinion of her sons virtue used to look upon me as a rake and i got the name not very much to my credit you will say as well abroad as in england of the sober rake  some would say the genteel rake nay for that matter some pretty hearts that have smarted for their good opinion have called me the handsome rake  but whatever other epithet i was distinguished by it all concluded in rake or libertine nor was i very much offended at the character for thought i if a lady knows this and will come into my company half the ceremony between us is over and if she calls me so i shall have an excellent excuse to punish her freedom by greater of my own  so i dressed grew more and more confident and became as insolent withal as if though i had not lady daverss wit and virtue i had all her spirit excuse me lady davers and having a pretty bold heart which rather put me upon courting than avoiding a danger or difficulty i had but too much my way with every body and many a menaced complaint have i looked down with a haughty air and a promptitude like that of colbrands to your footmen at the hall to clap my hand to my side which was of the greater service to my bold enterprises as two or three gentlemen had found i knew how to be in earnest  ha said my lady thou wast ever an impudent fellow and many a vile roguery have i kept from my poor mother  yet to my knowledge she thought you no saint  ay poor lady continued he she used nowandthen to catechize me and was sure i was not so good as i ought to be  for son she would cry these late hours these allnight works and to come home so sober cannot be right  i am not sure if i were to know all and yet i am afraid of inquiring after your ways whether i should not have reason to wish you were brought home in wine rather than to come home so sober and so late as you do  once i remember in the summertime i came home about six in the morning and met the good lady unexpectedly by the garden backdoor of which i had a key to let myself in at all hours i started and would have avoided her as soon as i saw her but she called me to her and then i approached her with an air what brings you madam into the garden at so early an hour said i turning my face from her for i had a few scratches on my forehead  with a thorn or so  that i feared she would be more inquisitive about than i cared for  and what makes you said she so early here billy  what a rakish figure do thou make  one time or other these courses will yield you but little comfort on reflection would to god thou wast but happily married  so madam said i the old wish  i am not so bad as you think me  i hope i have not merited so great a punishment  these hints i give not as matter of glory but shame yet i ought to tell you all the truth or nothing mean time thought i for i used as i mentioned in the morning to have some compunction for my vile practices when cool reflection brought on by satiety had taken hold of me i wish this sweet girl were grown to years of susceptibility that i might reform this wicked course of life and not prowl about disturbing honest folks peace and indangering myself and as i had by a certain very daring and wicked attempt in which however i did not succeed set a hornets nest about my ears which i began to apprehend would sting me to death having once escaped an ambush by dint of mere good luck i thought it was better to remove the seat of my warfare into another kingdom and to be a little more discreet for the future in my amors so i went to france a second time as you know sister and passed a twelvemonth there in the best of company and with some improvement both to my morals and understanding and had very few sallies considering my love of intrigue and the ample means i had to prosecute successfully all the desires of my heart  when i returned several matches were proposed to me and my good mother often requested me to make her so happy as she called it as to see me married before she died but i could not endure the thoughts of that state for i never saw a lady whose temper and education i liked or with whom i thought i could live tolerably see for his particular reasons against marrying vol ii p             etc  she used in vain therefore to plead family reasons to me like most young fellows i was too much a selflover to pay so great a regard to posterity and to say truth had very little solicitude at that time whether my name were continued or not in my own descendants however upon my return i looked upon my mothers pamela with no small pleasure and i found her so much improved as well in person as behavior that i had the less inducement either to renew my intriguing life or to think of a married state  yet as my mother had all her eyes about her as the phrase is i affected great shyness both before her and to the girl for i doubted not my very looks would be watched by them both and what the one discovered would not be a secret to the other and laying myself open to too early a suspicion i thought would but ice the girl over and make my mother more watchful  so i used to come into my mothers apartments and go out without taking the least notice of her but putting on stiff airs and as she always withdrew when i came in i never made any pretense to keep her there  once indeed my mother said on my looking after her when her back was turned my dear son i dont like your eye following my girl so intently only i know that sparkling luster natural to it or i should have some fear for my pamela as she grows older    i look after her said i  my eyes sparkle at such a girl as that no indeed  she may be your favorite as a waitingmaid but i see nothing but clumsy courtsies and awkward airs about her a little rustic affectation of innocence that to such as cannot see into her may pass well enough  nay my dear replied my mother dont say that of all things she has no affectation i am sure  yes she has in my eye madam and i will tell you how it comes about you have taught her to assume the airs of a gentlewoman to dance and to enter a room with a grace and yet bid her keep her low birth and family in view and between the one character which she wants to get into and the other she dares not get out of she trips up and down mincingly and knows not how to set her feet so it is the same in every gesture her arms she knows not whether to swim with or hold before her nor whether to hold her head up or down and so does neither but hangs it on one side a little awkward piece of oneandtother i think her  and indeed madam you would do the girl more kindness to put her into your dairy than to keep her about your person for she will be utterly spoiled i doubt for any useful purpose  ah son said she i fear by your description you have minded her too much in one sense though not enough in another it is not my intention to recommend her to your notice of all men  and i doubt not if it please god i live and she continues to be a good girl but she will make a man of some middling genteel business very happy   pamela came in just then with an air so natural and yet so humble and so much above herself that i was forced to turn my head from her lest my mother should watch my eye again and lest i should be inclined to do her that justice which my heart assented to but which my lips had just before denied her  all my difficulty in apprehension was my good mother the effect of whose lessons to her girl i was not however so much afraid of as her vigilance for thought i i see by the delicacy of her person the brilliancy of her eye and the sweet apprehensiveness that plays about every feature of her face that she must have tinder enough in her constitution to catch a wellstruck spark and i will warrant i shall know how to set her in a blaze in a few months more  yet i wanted as i passed to catch her attention too i expected her to turn after me and look so as to show a beginning liking toward me for you must know i had a great opinion of my person and air which had been fortunately distinguished by ladies whom of course my vanity made me allow to be very good judges of these outward advantages  ill give your ladyship an instance of this my vanity in a catch i made extempore to a lady whom i had been urging to give me some proofs of a love that i had the confidence to tell her i was sure she had in her heart for me she was a lively lady and laughing said whoever admired me it must be for my confidence and nothing else but urging her farther why said she brazen man for she would call names like lady davers what would you have me say i would love you if i could  but  here interrupting her and putting on a free air i half said and half sung youd love me you say if you could why thou make me a very odd creature i prythee survey me again what can thou object to my feature   this showed my vanity and i answered for the lady why nothing  very well  then i am sure you will admit that the choice i have made is a sign of my wit   but to my great disappointment pamela never by any favorable glance gave the least encouragement to my vanity well thought i this girl has certainly nothing ethereal in her mould all unanimated clay  but the dancing and singing airs my mother is teaching her will make her better qualified in time and another year will ripen her into my arms no doubt of it let me only go on in my present way and make her fear me that will inhance in her mind every favor i shall afterward vouchsafe to show her and never question old humdrum virtue thought i but the tempter without and the tempter within will be too many for the perversest nicety that ever the sex boasted  yet though i could not once attract her eye toward me she never failed to draw mine after her whenever she went by me or wherever i saw her except as i said in my mothers presence and particularly when she had passed me and could not see me look at her without turning her head as i expected so often from her in vain  you will wonder lord davers who i suppose was once in love or you would never have married such an hostile spirit as my sisters there   go on saucebox said she i will not interrupt you  you will wonder how i could behave so coolly as to escape all discovery so long from a lady so watchful as my mother and from the apprehensiveness of the girl for high or low every individual of the sex is quick as lightning to imaginations of this kind and besides well says the poet men without love have often so cunning grown that something like it they have shown but none who had it ever seemed to have none loves of a strangely open simple kind can no arts or disguises find but thinks none sees it cause itself is blind   but to say nothing of her tender years and that my love was not of this bashful sort i was not absolutely determined so great was my pride that i ought to think her worthy of being my mistress when i had not much reason as i thought to despair of prevailing upon persons of higher birth were i disposed to try to live with me upon my own terms my pride therefore kept my passion at bay as i may say so far was i from imagining i should ever be brought to what has since happened but to proceed  hitherto my mind was taken up with the beauties of her person only my eye had drawn my heart after it without giving myself any trouble about that sense and judgment which my mother was always praising in her pamela as exceeding her years and opportunities but an occasion happened slight in itself but which took the head into the party and made me think of her young as she was with a distinction that before i had not had for her the occasion was this  being with my mother in her closet who was talking to me on the old subject matrimony i saw pamelas commonplace book as i may call it in which by her ladys direction from time to time she had transcribed from the bible and other good books such passages as made most impression upon her as she read a method i take it my dear turning to me that was of great service to you as it initiated you into writing with that freedom and ease which shine in your saucy letters and journals and to which my present fetters are not a little owing just as pedlars catch monkeys in the baboon kingdoms provoking the attentive fools by their own example to put on shoes and stockens till the apes of imitation trying to do the like entangle their feet and so cannot escape upon the boughs of the tree of liberty on which before they were wont to hop and skip about and play a thousand puggish tricks  i observed the girl wrote a pretty hand and very swift and free and affixed her points or stops with so much judgment her years considered that i began to have an high opinion of her understanding some observations likewise upon several of the passages were so just and solid that i could not help being tacitly surprised at them  my mother watched my eye and was silent i seemed not to observe that she did and after a while laid down the book shutting it with great indifference and talking of another subject  upon this my mother said dont you think  pamela writes a pretty hand mr b  i did not mind it much said i with a careless air this is her writing is it taking the book and opening it again at a place of scripture the girl is mighty pious said i  i wish you were so child  i wish so too madam if it would please you  i wish so for your own sake child  so do i madam and down i laid the book again very carelessly  look once more in it said she and see if you cant open it upon some place that may strike you  i opened it at train up a child in the way it should go etc i fansy said i when i was at pamelas age i was pretty near as good as she  never never said my mother i am sure i took great pains with you but alas to very little purpose you had always a violent headstrong will  some allowances for boys and girls i hope madam but you see i am as good for a man as my sister for a woman  no indeed you are not i do assure you  i am sorry for that madam you give me a sad opinion of myself   brazen wretch said my lady but go on  turn to one of the girls observations on some text said my mother  i did and was pleased with it more than i would own the girls well enough said i for what she is but let us see what she will be a few years hence there will be the trial  shell be always good i doubt not  so much the better for her  but cannot we talk of any other subject than this foolish girl you complain how seldom i attend you madam and indeed when you are always talking of matrimony or of this lowborn raw girl it must needs lessen the pleasure of approaching you  but now as i hinted to you ladies and my lord i had a still higher opinion of pamela and esteemed her more worthy of my attempts for thought i the girl has good sense and it will be some pleasure to watch by what gradations she may be made to rise into love and into a higher life than that to which she was born and so i began to think she would be worthy in time of being my mistress which till now as i said before i had been a little scrupulous about  i took a little tour soon after this in company of a few friends with whom i had contracted an intimacy abroad into scotland and ireland they having a curiosity to see those countries and we spent six or eight months on this expedition and when i had landed them in france i returned home and found my good mother in a very indifferent state of health but her pamela arrived to a height of beauty and perfection that exceeded all my expectations i was so much taken with her charms the first time i saw her after my return which was in the garden with a book in her hand just come out of a little summer house that i then thought of obliging her to go back again in order to begin a parley with her but while i was resolving she tript away with her courtsies and reverences and was out of my sight before i could determine  i was resolved however not to be long without her and mrs jewkes having been recommended to me a little before by a brotherrake as a woman of tried fidelity i asked her if she would be faithful if i should have occasion to commit a pretty girl to her care  she hoped she said it would be with the ladys own consent and she should make no scruple of obeying me  so i thought i would waylay the girl and carry her first to a little village in northamptonshire to an acquaintance of mrs jewkess and when i had brought her to be easy and pacified a little i designed that jewkes should attend her to see vol i p   0 l   lincolnshire for i knew there was no coming at her here under my mothers wing by her own consent and that to offer terms to her would be to blow up my project all at once besides i was sensible that mrs jervis would stand in the way of my proceedings as well as my mother  the method i had contrived was quite easy as i imagined and such as could not have failed to answer my purpose as to carrying her off and i doubted not of making her well satisfied in her good fortune very quickly for having a notion of her affectionate duty to her parents i was not displeased that i could make the terms very easy and happy to them all  what most stood in my way was my mothers fondness for her but on the supposition that i had got her favorite into my hands which appeared to me as i said a task very easy to be conquered i had actually formed a letter for her to transcribe acknowleging a loveaffair and laying her withdrawing herself so privately to the implicit obedience she owed to her husbands commands to whom she was married that morning and who being a young gentleman of a genteel family and dependent on his friends was desirous of keeping it all a profound secret and begging on that account her lady not to divulge it so much as to mrs jervis  and to prepare for this and make her escape the more probable when matters were ripe for my plot i came in one night and examined all the servants and mrs jervis the latter in my mothers hearing about a genteel young man whom i pretended to find with a pillion on the horse he rode upon waiting about the back door of the garden for some body to come to him and who rode off when i came up to the door as fast as he could  nobody knew any thing of the matter and were much surprised at what i told them but i begged pamela might be watched and that no one would say any thing to her about it  my mother said she had two reasons not to speak of it to pamela one to oblige me the other and chief because it would break the poor innocent girls heart to be suspected poor dear child said she where can she go to be so happy as with me would it not be inevitable ruin to her to leave me there is nobody comes after her she receives no letters but nowandthen one from her father and mother and them she shows me  well replied i i hope she can have no design twould be strange if she had formed any to leave so good a mistress but you cannot be sure all the letters she receives are from her father and her showing to you madam those he writes looks like a cloak to others she may receive from another hand but it can be no harm said i to have an eye upon her you dont know madam what tricks there are in the world  not i indeed but only this i know that the girl shall be under no restraint if she is resolved to leave me well as i love her  mrs jervis said she would have an eye upon pamela in obedience to my command but she was sure there was no need nor would she so much wound the poor childs peace as to mention the matter to her  this i suffered to blow off and seemed to my mother to have so good an opinion of her pamela that i was sorry as i told her i had had such a surmise saying that though the fellow and the pillion were an odd circumstance yet i dared to say there could be nothing in it for i doubted not the girls duty and gratitude would hinder her from doing a foolish or rash thing  this my mother heard with pleasure although my motive for it was but to lay her pamela on the thicker to her when she was to be told she had escaped  she said she was glad i was not an enemy to the poor child pamela has no friend but me continued the good lady and if i dont provide for her i shall have done her more harm than good as you and your aunt b have often said in the accomplishments i have given her and yet the poor girl i see that added she would not be afraid to turn her hand to any thing for the sake of an honest livelihood were she put to it which if it please god to spare me and she continues good she never shall be  i wonder not pamela at your tears on this occasion your lady was an excellent woman and deserved this tribute to her memory all my pleasure now is that she knew not half my wicked pranks and that i did not vex her worthy heart in the prosecution of this scheme which would have given me a severe sting inasmuch as i might have apprehended with too much reason that i had shortened her days by the knowledge of the one and the other  i had thus in readiness every thing necessary for the execution of my project but my mothers ill state of health gave me too much concern to permit me to proceed and nowandthen as my frequent attendance on her in her illness gave me an opportunity of observing more and more of the girl and her affectionate duty and continual tears finding her frequently on her knees praying for her mistress i was moved to pity her and often did i while those scenes of my mothers illness and decline were before me resolve to conquer if possible my guilty passion as those scenes taught me while their impressions held upon me justly to call it and i was much concerned i found it a more difficult task than i imagined for till now i thought it principally owing to my usual enterprising temper and a love of intrigue and that i had nothing to do but to resolve against it and to subdue it  but i found i was greatly mistaken for i had insensibly brought myself to admire her in every thing she said or did and there was so much gracefulness humility and innocence in her whole behavior and i saw so many melting scenes between her lady and her that i found i could not master my esteem for her  my mothers illness increasing beyond hopes of recovery and having settled all her greater affairs she talked to me of her servants i asked her what she would have done for pamela and mrs jervis  make mrs jervis my dear son said she as happy as you can she is a gentlewoman born you know let her always be treated as such but for your own sake dont make her independent for then you will want a faithful manager yet if you marry and your lady should not value her as she deserves allow her a competency for the rest of her life and let her live as she pleases  as for my pamela i hope you will be her protector i hope you will  she is a good girl i love her next to you and your dear sister she is just arrived at a trying time of life i dont know what to say for her what i had designed was that if any man of a genteel calling should offer i would have given her a little pretty portion had god spared my life till then but if she should be made independent some idle fellow perhaps might snap her up for she is very pretty or if she should carry what you give her to her poor parents as her duty would lead her to do they are so unhappily involved that a little matter would be nothing to them and the poor girl might be to seek again perhaps lady davers will take her but i wish she was not so pretty she will be likely to be the bird for which some wicked fowler will spread his snares or it may be every lady will not choose to have such a waitingmaid you are a young gentleman and i am sorry to say it not better than i wish you to be  though i hope my pamela would not be in danger from her master who owes to all his servants protection as much as a king does to his subjects yet i dont know how to wish her to stay with you  for your own reputations sake my dear son  for the world will censure as it lists  would to god said she the dear girl had the small pox in a mortifying manner she would be lovely enough in the genteelness of her person and the beauty of her mind and more out of danger of suffering from the transient beauties of countenance yet i think added she she might be safe and happy under mrs jerviss care and if you marry and your lady parts with mrs jervis let em go together and live as they like  i think that will be the best for both  and you have a generous spirit enough i will not direct you in the quantum but my dear son remember that i am the less concerned that i have not done for the poor girl myself because i depend upon you the manner how fitly to provide for her has made me defer it till now that i have so much more important concerns on my hands life and strength ebbing so fast that i am hardly fit for any thing or to wish for any thing but to receive the last releasing stroke  here the dear gentleman stopped being under some concern himself and we in much more at last he resumed the subject  you will too naturally think my lord and you my good ladies that the mind must be truly diabolical that could break through the regards due to the solemn injunctions and recommendations of a dying parent they did hold me a good while indeed and as fast as i had any emotions of a contrary nature rise in my breast i endeavored for some time to suppress them and to think and act as i ought but the dear bewitching girl every day rose in her charms upon me and finding she still continued the use of her pen and ink i could not help entertaining a jealousy that she was writing to somebody who stood well in her opinion and my love for her and my own spirit of intrigue made it a sweetheart of course and i could not help watching her motions and seeing her once putting a letter she had just folded up into her bosom at my entrance into my mothers dressing room i made no doubt of detecting her and her correspondent and so i took the letter from her see vol i p   stays she trembling and courtsying with a sweet confusion and highly pleased i was to find it contained nothing but innocence and duty to the deceased mistress and the loving parents expressing her joy that in the midst of her grief for losing the one she was not obliged to return to be a burden to the other and i gave it her again with words of encouragement and went down much better satisfied than i had been with her correspondents  but when i reflected on the innocent simplicity of her style i was still more in love with her and formed a stratagem and succeeded in it to come at her other letters see vol i p  0      which i sent forward after i had read them all but three or four which i kept back when my plot began to ripen for execution although the little slut was most abominably free upon my character to her father and mother  you will censure me no doubt that my mothers injunctions made not a more lasting impression upon me but really i struggled hard with myself to give them their due force and the dear girl as i said every day grew lovelier and more accomplished her letters were but so many links to the chains she had bound me in and though once i had resolved to part with her see vol i p   to lady davers and you my lady had an intention to take her i could not for my life give her up and thinking at that time more honorably of the state of a mistress than i have done since i could not persuade myself since i intended to do as handsomely by her as ever man did to a lady in that circumstance but that i should do better for her than my mother had wished me to do and so more than answer all her injunctions as to the providing for her and i could not imagine i should have met with a resistance from her that i had seldom encountered from persons much her superiors as to descent and was amazed at it for it confounded me in all the notions i had of her sex which like a true libertine i supposed wanted nothing but importunity and opportunity a bold attempter and a mind not ungenerous  sometimes i admired her for her virtue at other times impetuous in my temper and unused to control i could have beat her she well i remember describes the tumults of my soul when she repeats what once passed between us in words like these  see vol i p    take the little witch from me mrs jervis  i can neither bear nor forbear her  but stay  you shall not go  yet begone  no come back again  she thought i was mad i remember she says in her papers indeed i was little less  she says i took her arm and gripped it black and blue to bring her back again and then sat down and looked at her as silly as such a poor girl as she  well did the dear slut describe the passion i struggled with and no one can conceive how much my pride made me despise myself at times for the little actions my love for her put me upon and yet to find that love increasing every day as her charms and her resistance increased  i have caught myself in a raging fit sometimes vowing i would have her and at others jealous that to secure herself from my attempts she would throw herself into the arms of some menial or inferior that otherwise she would not have thought of  sometimes i soothed her sometimes threatened her but never was such courage when she apprehended her virtue was in danger mixed with so much humility when her fears gave way to her hopes of a juster treatment  then i would think it impossible so slight an opinion had i of womans virtue that such a girl as this cottageborn who owed every thing to my family and had an absolute dependence on my pleasure myself not despicable in person or mind as i supposed she unprejudiced in any mans favor at an age susceptible of impressions and a frame and constitution not ice nor snow surely thought i all this frost must be owing to the want of fire in my attempts to thaw it i used to dare more and succeed better shall such a girl as this awe me by her rigid virtue no she shall not  then i would resolve to be more in earnest yet my love was a traitor to me that was more faithful to her than to me it had more honor in it at bottom than i had designed it should have awed by her unaffected innocence and a virtue i had never before encountered so uniform and immovable the moment i saw her i was half disarmed and i courted her consent to that which though i was not likely to obtain yet it went against me to think of extorting by violence yet marriage was never in my thoughts i scorned so much as to promise it  what numberless mean things did not this unmanly passion subject me to  i used to watch for her letters though mere prittleprattle and chitchat received them with burning impatience and read them with delight though myself was accused in them and stigmatized as i deserved  i would listen meanly at her chamber door try to overhear her little conversations in vain attempted to suborn mrs jervis to my purposes inconsistently talking of honor when no one step i took or action i attempted showed any thing like it lost my dignity among my servants made a party in her favor against me of every body but whom my money corrupted and that hardly sufficient to keep my partisans steady to my interest so greatly did the virtue of the servants triumph over the vice of the master when attracted by such an example  i have been very tedious ladies and my lord davers in my narration but i am come within view of the point for which i now am upon my trial at your dread tribunal  bowing to us all  after several endeavors of a smooth and a rough nature in which my devil constantly failed me and her good angel prevailed i had talked to mrs jervis to induce the girl to whom in hopes of frightening her i had given warning but which she rejoiced to take to my great disappointment to desire to stay see vol i p     and suspecting mrs jervis played me booty and rather confirmed her in her coyness and her desire of leaving me i was mean enough to conceal myself in the closet in mrs jerviss room in order to hear their private conversation but really not designing to make any other use of my concealment than to teize her a little if she should say any thing i did not like which would give me a pretense to treat her with greater freedoms than i had ever yet done and would be an introduction to take off from her unprecedented apprehensiveness another time and i had the less scruple as to mrs jerviss presence because she knew as bad of me as she could know from pamelas apprehensions as well as her own and would find me if i kept within any decent bounds better than either of them expected but i had no design of proceeding to extremities although i had little hope of impressing her by gentleness  so like a benighted traveller who had strayed out of his knowledge and despairing to find his way threw the reins upon his horses neck to be guided at its uncertain direction i resolved to take my chance for the issue which the adventure should produce  but the dear prattler not knowing i was there as she undressed herself began such a bewitching chitchat with mrs jervis who i found but ill kept my secret that i never was at such a loss in my life what to resolve upon one while i wished myself unknown to them out of the closet into which my inconsiderate passion had meanly led me another time i was incensed at the freedom with which i heard myself treated but then rightly considering that i had no business to hearken to their private conversation and that it was such as became them while i ought to have been ashamed to give occasion for it i excused them both and admired still more and more the dear prattler  in this suspense the undesigned rustling of my nightgown from changing my posture as i stood giving alarm to the watchful pamela she in a fright came toward the closet to see who was there so that i could be no longer concealed  what could i then do but bolt out upon the apprehensive charmer and having so done and she running to the bed screaming to mrs jervis would not any man have followed her thither detected as i was but yet i said if she forbore her screaming i would do her no harm but if not she should take the consequence  i found by their exclamations that this would pass with both for an attempt of the worst kind but really i had no such intentions as they feared  when indeed i found myself detected when the dear frightened girl ran to the bed when mrs jervis threw herself about her when they would not cease their hideous squallings when i was charged by mrs jervis with the worst designs it was enough to make me go farther than i designed and could i have prevailed upon mrs jervis to go up and quiet the maids who were rising as i heard by the noise they made overhead upon the others screamings i believe had pamela kept out of her fit i should have been a little freer with her than ever i had been but as it was i had no thought but of making as honorable a retreat as i could and to save myself from being exposed to my whole family and i was not guilty of any freedoms that her modesty unaffrighted could reproach itself with having suffered and the dear creatures fainting fits gave me almost as great apprehensions as i could give her  thus ladies and my lord have i tediously and little enough to my own reputation given you a character of myself and told you more against myself than any one person could accuse me of whatever redounds to the credit of my pamela redounds in part to my own and so i have the less regret to accuse myself since it exalts her but as to a formed intention to hide myself in the closet in order to attempt the girl by violence and in the presence of a good woman as mrs jervis is which you impute to me indeed bad as i was i was not so vile so abandoned as that  love as i said before subjects its inconsiderate votaries to innumerable meannesses and unlawful passion to many more i could not live without this dear girl i hated the thoughts of matrimony with any body and to be brought to the stake by my mothers waitingmaid forbid it pride thought i forbid it example forbid it all my past sneers and constant ridicule both on the estate and on those who descended to inequalities in it and lastly forbid it my family spirit so visible in lady davers as well as myself to whose insults and those of all the world i shall be obnoxious if i make such a step  all this tends to demonstrate the strength of my passion i could not conquer my love so i conquered a pride which every one thought unconquerable and since i could not make an innocent heart vicious i had the happiness to follow so good an example and i thank god a vicious heart is become virtuous as i hope at least morally so and i have the pleasure of rejoicing in the change and hope i shall still more and more rejoice in it for i really look back with contempt upon my past follies and it is now a greater wonder to me how i could act as i did than that i should detest those actions which made me a curse instead of a benefit to society indeed i am not yet so pious as my pamela but that is to come and it is one good sign that i can truly say i delight in every instance of her piety and virtue and now i will conclude my tedious narration with the poet our passions gone and reason in her throne amazed we see the mischiefs we have done after a tempest when the winds are laid the calm sea wonders at the wrecks it made   thus ended my dear mr b his affecting relation which in the course of it gave me a thousand different emotions and made me often pray for him as i constantly do that god will entirely convert a heart so generous and worthy as his is on most occasions and if i can but find him not deviate when we go to london i shall have great hopes that nothing will affect his morals again  i have just read over again the foregoing account of himself as near as i remember and my memory is the best faculty i have it is pretty exact only he was fuller of beautiful similitudes and spoke in a more flowery style as i may say yet dont you think miss if i have not done injustice to his spirit that the beginning of it especially is in the saucy air of a man too much alive to such notions for so the ladies observed in his narration  is it very like the style of a true penitent  but indeed he went on better and concluded best of all  but dont you observe what a dear good lady i had blessings a thousand blessings on her beloved memory were i to live to see my childrens children they should be all taught to lisp her praises before they could speak my gratitude should always be renewed in their mouths and god and my dear father and mother my lady and my master that was my best friend that is but principally as most due the first who inspired all the rest should have their morning their noontide and their evening praises as long as i lived   i will only observe further as to this my third conversation piece that my lord davers offered to extenuate some parts of his dear brotherinlaws conduct which he did not himself vindicate and mr b was pleased to observe that my lord was always very candid to him and kind in his allowances for the sallies of an ungovernable youth upon which my lady said a little tartly yes and for a very good reason i doubt not for who cares to condemn himself  nay said my lord pleasantly dont put us upon a foot neither for what sallies i made before i knew your ladyship were but like those of a fox who nowandthen runs away with a straggling pullet when nobody sees him whereas those of my brother were like the invasions of a lion breaking into every mans fold and driving the shepherds as well as the sheep before him  ay said my lady but i can look around me and have reason perhaps to think the invading lion has come off little as he deserved it better than the creeping fox who with all his cunning sometimes suffers for his pilfering theft  o miss these gentlemen are strange creatures  what can they think of themselves for they say there is not one virtuous man in five  but i hope for our sexs sake as well as for the worlds sake all is not true that evil fame reports for you know every mantrespasser must find or make a womantrespasser  and if so what a world is this  and how must the innocent suffer from the guilty  yet how much better is it to suffer ones self than to be the cause of anothers suffering  i long to hear of you and must shorten my future accounts or i shall do nothing but write and tire you into the bargain though i cannot my dear father and mother i am my dear miss  always yours p b  letter xxxi from miss darnford to mr b my dear mrs b every post you more and more oblige us to admire and love you and let me tell you i will gladly receive your letters upon your own terms see p      only when your worthy parents have perused them see that i have every line of them again  your account of the arrival of your noble guests and their behavior to you and yours to them your conversation and wise determination on the offered title of baronet the just applauses conferred on you by all particularly the good countess your breakfast conversation and the narrative of your saucy abominable master though amiable husband all delight us beyond expression  do go on dear excellent lady with your charming journals and let us know all that passes  as to the state of matters with us i have desired my papa to allow me to decline mr murrays addresses the good man loved me most violently nay he could not live without me life was no life unless i favored him but yet after a few more of these flights he is trying to sit down satisfied without my papas foolish perverse girl as sir simon calls me and to transpose his affections to a worthier object my sister nancy and it would make you smile to see how a little while before he directly applied to her she screwed up her mouth to my mamma and truly she would have none of pollys leavings no not she  but no sooner did he declare himself in form than the gaudy wretch as he was before with her became a welldressd gentleman  the chattering magpye for he talks and laughs much quite conversible  and has something agreeable to say on every subject once he would make a good master of the buckhounds but now really the more one is in his company the more polite one finds him  then on his part  indeed he happened to see miss polly first and truly he could have thought himself very happy in so agreeable a young lady yet there was always something of majesty what a stately name is that for ill nature in miss nanny something so aweful that while miss polly engaged the affections at first sight miss nanny struck a man with reverence insomuch that the one might be loved as a woman but the other revered as something more a goddess no doubt  i do but think that when he comes to be lifted up to her celestial sphere as her fellow constellation what a figure will nancy and her ursa major make together and how will they glitter and shine to the wonder of all beholders  then she must make a brighter appearance by far and a more pleasing one too for why she has  000 satellites or little stars in her train more than poor polly can pretend to will not there be fine twinkling and sparkling think you when the greater and lesser bearstars are joined together  but excuse me dear mrs b this saucy girl has vexed me just now by her illnatured tricks and i am even with her having thus vented my spite though she knows nothing of the matter  so fansy my dear friend you see polly darnford abandoned by her own fault her papa angry at her her mamma pitying her and calling her silly girl mr murray who is a rough lover growling over his mistress as a dog over a bone he fears to lose miss nancy putting on her prudish pleasantry and snarling out a kind word and breaking through her sullen gloom for a smile nowandthen in return and i laughing at both in my sleeve and thinking that in a while i shall get leave to attend you in town and that will be better than twenty humble servants of mr murrays cast or if i cannot that i shall have the pleasure of your correspondence here and enjoy unenvied the favor of my dear papa and mamma which this ill tempered girl is always begrudging me  forgive all this nonsense i was willing to wrie something though worse than nothing to show how desirous i would be to oblige you had i capacity or subject as you have but nobody can love you better or admire you more of this you may be assured however unequal in all other respects than  your polly darnford i send you up some of your papers for the good couple in kent pray my respects to them and beg they will let me have em again as soon as they can by your conveyance  our stamford friends desire their kindest respects they mention you with delight in every letter    letter xxxii the journal continued thursday friday evening my dearest miss darnford i am retired from a very busy day having had no less than fourteen of our neighbors gentlemen and ladies to dinner with us the occasion principally to welcome our noble guests into these parts mr b having as i mentioned in a former turned the intended visit into an entertainment after his usual generous manner  mr b and lord davers are gone part of the way with them home and mr h or lord jackey as we call the gentleman who will always be young mounted with his favorite colbrand as an escorte to the countess and lady davers who are gone to take an airing in the chariot they offered to take the coach if i would have gone but being fatigued i desired to be excused so i retired to my closet and miss darnford who is seldom out of my thoughts coming into my mind i had a new recruit of spirits which enabled me to resume my pen and thus i proceed with my journal  our company was for the characters of most of these gentlemen and ladies see vol i p       and vol ii p     to     and     to   0 the earl and countess of d who are so fashionable a married couple that the earl made it his boast and his countess bore it like one accustomed to such treatment that he had not been in his ladys company an hour abroad before for seven years you know his lordships character every body does and there is not a worse as report says in the peerage  sir thomas atkyns a single gentleman not a little finical and ceremonious and a mighty beau though of the tawdry sort and affecting foreign airs as if he was afraid it would not be judged by any other mark that he had traveled  mr arthur and his lady a moderately happy couple who seem always when together to behave as if they were upon a compromise that is that each would take it in turn to say free things of the other  though some of their freedoms are of so cutting a nature that it looks as if they intended to divert the company at their own expense the lady being of a noble family takes great pains to let every one know that she values herself not a little upon that advantage but otherwise has many good qualities  mr brooks and his lady a gentleman who is a free joker on serious subjects but a goodnatured man and says sprightly things with no ill grace but his lady is a little reserved and of a haughty turn though today she happened to be freer than usual as was observed at table by  lady towers who is a maiden lady of family noted for her wit and repartee and who says many good things with so little doubt and really so good a grace that one cannot help being pleased with her this lady is generally gallanted by  mr martin of the grove as he is called to distinguish him from a rich citizen of that name who is settled in these parts but being covetous and proud is seldom admitted among the gentry in their visits or parties of pleasure mr martin is a shrewd gentleman but has been a little too much of the libertine cast and has lived freely as to women and for that reason has not been received by mrs towers who hates free actions though she will use free words modestly free as she calls them that is to say the double entendre in which sir simon darnford a gentleman you are not unacquainted with takes great delight though by the way what that worthy gentleman calls innocent lady towers would blush at  mr dormer a gentleman of a very courteous demeanor a widower was another who always speaks well of his deceased lady and of all the sex for her sake  mr chapman and his lady a wellbehavd couple who are not ashamed to be very tender and observing to one another but without that censureable fondness which sits so ill upon some married folks in company  then there was the dean our good minister whom i name last because i would close with one of the worthiest and his daughter who came to supply her mammas place who was indisposed a wellbehavd prudent young lady and here were our fourteen guests  the countess of c lady davers lord davers mr h my dear mr b and your humble servant made up the rest of the company so we had a capacious and brilliant circle you may imagine and all the avenues to the house were crowded with their equipages  the subjects of discourse at dinner were various as you may well suppose and the circle was too large to fall upon any regular or very remarkable topics a good deal of sprightly wit however flew about between the earl of d mrs towers and mr martin in which that lord suffered as he deserved for he was by no means a match for the lady especially as the presence of the dean was a restraint as was very visible upon him and mr brooks too so much awe will the character of a good clergyman always impress upon even forward spirits where he is known to have had an inviolable regard to it himself  besides the good gentleman has a genteel and inoffensive vein of raillery himself and so was too hard for them at their own weapons  but after dinner was over and the servants were withdrawn mr martin began to single me out as he loves to do for a subject of encomium and made some high compliments to my dear mr b on his choice and wished as he often does he could find just such another person for himself  lady towers told him that it was a thing as unaccountable as it was unreasonable that every rake who loved to destroy virtue should expect to be rewarded with it and if his brother b had come off so well she thought no one else ought to expect it  lady davers said it was a very just observation and she thought twas pity there was not a law that every man who made a harlot of an honest woman should be obliged to marry one of anothers making  that would be too severe mr b said it would be punishment enough if he was to marry his own and especially if he had not seduced her under promise of marriage  then you would have a man be obliged replied lady davers to stand to his promise i suppose mr b  yes madam  but said she the proof would be difficult perhaps and the most unguilty heart of our sex might be least able to make it out but what say you my lord d continued lady davers will you and my lord davers join to bring in a bill into the house of peers for the purposes i mentioned i fansy my brother would give it all the assistance he could in the lower house  your ladyship said mr martin is highly unreasonable i think to propose that it would be enough surely that a man should be obliged as mr b says to marry the woman he himself seduced  the earl said that he thought neither the one nor the other should be imposed upon any man for that when womens virtue was their glory and they were brought up with that notion and to avoid the snares of men he thought if they yielded they ought to pay the forfeit and take the disgrace of it to themselves  may i ask your lordship said i how it comes to pass that a womans virtue is her glory and that a mans shall not be his  or in other words why you think virtue in a man is not as requisite as in a woman  custom madam replied the earl has made it very different and those things which are scandalous in a lady are not so in a gentleman  will your lordship argue that it should be so because it is so does not the gentleman call himself the head of his family is it not incumbent upon him then to set a good example and will he plead it as a fashion that he may do by the dearest relatives of another mans family what if any one should attempt to do by his he would mortally resent  very well observed madam said the dean there is not a freeliver in the world i believe that can answer that argument  mr b said the earl pray speak to your lady she is too close upon us and where sentiments have been so well supported by a conduct so uniform and exemplary i choose not to enter the lists with such an antagonist  well well said mr b since your lordship will speak in the plural number u s let me say we must not pretend to hold an argument on this subject  but however i think my lord you should not call upon a man to defend it who bad as he has been never committed a fault of this nature that he was not sorry for though the sorrow generally lasted too little a while  mr b said lady towers has some merit with me for that answer and he has still a greater on another account and that is that he has seen his error so early and has left his vices before they have left him  she looked as every one did on the earl who appeared a little disconcerted as one conscious that he deserved the reflection and the dean said lady towers observes very well for although i presume not to make personal applications yet i must say that the gentleman who sees his error in the prime of life before he is overtaken by some awakening misfortune may be called one of the happiest of those who have erred  ay mr dean said lady towers i can tell you one thing that such another buttress as you know who taken away from libertinism and such another example as a certain lady every day gives would go near in a few years to ruin the devils kingdom in bedfordshire  the gentlemen looked round upon one another upon this home push and the lady would not let them recover it see said she how the gentlemen look upon one another as who should say each to his companion i am not so bad as you  ay said lady davers i see my lord davers and the earl of d and mr martin look most concerned  faith ladies said mr martin this is too severely personal a man who contends with a lady has a fine time of it for we are under restraint while you say any thing you please but let me tell you there is not a man of us all it is my opinion that could have attempted what a certain renegado has attempted though he is so readily acquitted  not so hasty my good friend said mr b you dont consider well what you say nor of whom for did i take upon myself to censure you but though i may challenge you to say the worst you can because i always dealt upon my own stock while other people i could name entered into a society and clubbed for mischief yet i see you deal with a brother rake when he reforms as highwaymen with one of their gang who would fain withdraw and be honest but is kept among them by fear of an impeachment  but is not this ladies said mrs arthur a sad thing that so many fine gentlemen as think themselves concerned in this charge should have no way to clear themselves but by recrimination  egad said sir thomas atkyns i know not what youre about gentlemen you make but sorry figures by my faith  i have heard of many queer pranks among my bedfordshire neighbors but i bless my stars i was in france and italy all the time  said mr martin mrs arthur spoke the words fine gentlemen and sir thomas thought himself obliged to enter upon his own defense  ay said the earl and the best of it is sir thomas pleads not his virtue neither that he did not join his bedfordshire neighbors but his absence  gad take me returned he putting a pinch of snuff to his nose with an air youre plaguey sharp gentlemen i believe in my conscience youre in a confederacy as mr b says and would swear an honest man into the plot that would not care for such company what say you mr h which side are you of  the gallows replied he in his usual blunt way are of the ladies side and i was always of the side of the gallows  that shows returned lady towers that mr h is more afraid of the punishment than of deserving it  it is well said mr b that any consideration deters a gentleman at mr hs time of life what may be fear now may improve to virtue byandby  ay said lady davers jackey is one of his uncles foxes he would be glad to snap up a straggling pullet if he was not well looked after perhaps  pray my dear said lord davers forbear you ought not to introduce two different conversations in different companies  i think truly said mr b you should take the deans hint my good friends else you will be less polite than personal  well but gentlemen said lady arthur since you seem to have been so hard put to it as single gentlemen what is to be done with the married man who ruins an innocent body what punishment mrs towers shall we find out for such and what reparation to the injured this it seems was said with a particular view to the earl on a late scandalous occasion but i knew it not till afterward  as to the punishment of the gentleman replied mrs towers where the law has not provided for it it must be left i believe to his conscience it will then one day be heavy enough but as to the reparation to the woman so far as it can be made it will be determinable as the unhappy person may or may not know that her seducer is a married man if she knows he is i think she neither deserves redress nor pity though it alleviates not his guilt but if the case be otherwise and she had no means of informing herself that he was married and he promised to make her his wife to be sure though she cannot be acquitted he deserves the severest punishment that can be inflicted what say you mrs b  if i must speak my mind replied i i think that since custom as the earl said just now exacts so little regard to virtue from men and so much from women and since the designs of the former upon the latter are so flagrantly avowed and known the poor creature who suffers herself to be seduced either by a single or married man with promises or without has nothing to do but to sequester herself from the world and dedicate the remainder of her days to penitence and obscurity as to the gentleman added i he must be left i doubt to his conscience as you say mrs towers which will sooner than he wishes find him out  every young lady has not your angelick perfection madam said mr dormer and there are cases in which the fair sex deserve compassion ours execration love may insensibly steal upon a soft heart when once admitted the oaths vows and protestations of the favored object who perhaps on all occasions declaims against the deceivers of his sex confirm her good opinion of him till having lulled asleep her vigilance in an unguarded hour he takes advantage of her unsuspecting innocence is not such a poor creature to be pitied and what punishment does not such a seducer deserve  you have put sir said i a moving case and in a generous manner what indeed does not such a deceiver deserve  and the more said mrs chapman as the most innocent heart is generally the most credulous  very true said my countess for such an one as would do no harm to others seldom suspects any from others and her lot is very unequally cast admired for that very innocence which tempts some brutal ravager to ruin it  yet what is that virtue said the dean which cannot stand the test  but said mrs towers very satirically whither ladies are we got we are upon the subject of virtue and honor let us talk of something in which the gentlemen can join with us this is such an one you see that none but the dean and mr dormer can discourse upon  let us then said mr martin to be even with one lady at least find a subject that will be new to her and that is charity  does what i said concern mr martin more than any other gentleman retorted mrs towers that he is disposed to take offense at it  i think said mr b pardon me mrs towers a lady should never make a motion to wave such subjects as those of virtue and honor and less still in company where there is so much occasion as she seems to think for enforcing them  nay said she i desire not to wave the subject i will assure you and if you think sir it may do good we will continue it for the sakes of all you gentlemen looking round her archly who are of opinion you may be benefited by it  we are going into personals again gentlemen and ladies said the earl  and that will not bear my lord you seem to think retorted lady davers  a toast to the king and royal family brought on public affairs and politics and the ladies withdrawing to coffee and tea i have no more to say as to this conversation having repeated all that i remember was said to any purpose for such large companies you know miss dont always produce the most agreeable and edifying subjects but this i was the willinger to recite because i thought the characters of some of our neighbors would be thereby made more familiar to you if ever i should have the happiness to see you in these parts  i will only add that miss l the deans daughter is a very modest and agreeable young lady and a perfect mistress of music in which the dean takes great delight also and is a fine judge of it the gentlemen coming in to partake of our coffee and conversation as they said obtained of miss to play several tunes on the spinnet and would have me do so too but really miss l so very much surpassed me that had i regarded my reputation for playing above the desire i had as i said and truly said to oblige the good company i ought not to have pretended to touch a key after such a mistress of it miss has no voice which is great pity and at her request and the deans and the company i sung to her play twice or thrice as did mrs towers whose voice exceeds her ear but here miss will i end my fourth conversationpiece  saturday morning the countess being a little indisposed lady davers and i took an airing this morning in the chariot and had a great deal of discourse together her ladyship was pleased to express great favor and tenderness for me gave me a great deal of good advice as to the care she would have me take of myself and told me that her hopes as well as her brothers all centred in my welfare and that the way i was in made her love me better and better  she was pleased to tell me how much she approved of the domestic management and to say that she never saw such regularity and method in any family in her life where was the like number of servants every one she said knew their duty and did it without speaking to in such silence and with so much apparent cheerfulness and delight without the least hurry or confusion that it was her surprise and admiration but kindly would have it that i took too much upon me yet said she i dont see but you are always fresh and lively and never seem tired or fatigued and are always dressed and easy so that no company find you unprepared or unfit to receive them come when they will whether it be to breakfast or dinner  i told her ladyship i owed all this and most of the conduct for which she was pleased to praise me to her dear brother who at the beginning of my happiness gave me several cautions see vol ii p  0  and instructions for my behavior which had always been the rule of my conduct ever since and i hoped ever would be to say nothing added i which would be very unjust of the help i receive from worthy mrs jervis who is an excellent manager  good creature sweet pamela and charming girl were her common words and she was pleased to attribute to me such a graceful and unaffected ease and would have it that i have a natural dignity in my person and behavior which command love and reverence at the same time insomuch that my dear miss i am in danger of being as proud as any thing for you must believe that her ladyships approbation gives me great pleasure and the more as i was afraid before she came i should not have come off near so well in her opinion  as the chariot passed along she took great notice of the respects paid me by people of different ranks and of the blessings bestowed upon me by several as we proceeded and said she should fare well and be rich in good wishes for being in my company  the good people who know us will do so madam said i but i had rather have their silent prayers than their audible ones and i have caused some of them to be told so but they say they cannot help it and one honest man said that everybodys hearts sprang to their lips as soon as i appeared and they could not keep their words in  what i apprehend madam continued i is that you will be more uneasy tomorrow when at church you will see a good many people in the same way indeed added i my story and your dear brothers tenderness to me are so much talked of that many strangers are brought thither to see us it is the only thing said i and so it is miss that makes me desirous to go to london for by the time we return the novelty i hope will cease  then i mentioned some verses of mr cowley which had been laid under the cushions in our seat at church two sundays ago by some unknown hand and how uneasy they have made me i will transcribe them miss and give you the particulars of our conversation on that occasion the verses are these thou robbst my days of business and delights of sleep thou robbst my nights ah lovely thief what will thou do what rob me of heaven too thou even my prayers do steal from me and i with wild idolatry begin to god and end them all to thee no to what purpose should i speak no wretched heart swell till you break she cannot love me if she would and to say truth twere pity that she should no to the grave thy sorrows bear as silent as they will be there since that loved hand this mortal wound does give so handsomely the thing contrive that she may guiltless of it live so perish that her killing thee may a chancemedley and no murder be   i had them in my pocket and read them to my lady who asked me if her brother had seen them i told her it was he that found them under the cushion i used to sit upon but did not show them to me till i came home and that i was so vexed at them that i could not go to church in the afternoon  what should you be vexed at my dear said she how could you help it  my brother was not disturbed at them was he  no indeed said i he chid me for being so and was pleased to make me a fine compliment upon it that he did not wonder that every body who saw me loved me  but i said this was all wicked wit was good for to inspire such boldness in bad hearts which might otherwise not dare to set pen to paper to affront any one  but pray madam added i dont own i have told you of them lest there should be a possibility for a shadow of a thought that i was prompted by some vile secret vanity in being admired to tell your ladyship of them when i am sure they have vexed me more than enough for is it not a sad thing that the church should be profaned by such actions and such thoughts as ought not to be brought into it  then madam to have any wicked man dare to think of one with impure notions it gives me the less opinion of myself that i should be so much as thought of as the object of any wicked bodys wishes i have called myself to account upon it whether any levity in my looks my dress my appearance could imbolden such an affrontive insolence and i have thought upon this occasion better of julius caesars delicacy than i did when i read of it who upon an attempt made on his wife to which however it does not appear she gave the least encouragement said to those who pleaded for her against the divorce he was resolved upon that the wife of caesar ought not to be suspected  indeed madam continued i it would extremely shock me but to know that any wicked heart had conceived a design upon me upon me give me leave to repeat whose only glory and merit is that i have had the grace to withstand the greatest of trials and temptations from a gentleman more worthy to be beloved both for person and mind than any man in england  your observation my dear is truly delicate and such as becomes your mind and character and i really think if any lady in the world is secure from vile attempts it must be you not only from your story so well known and the love you bear to your man and his merit to you but from the prudence and natural dignity i will say of your behavior which though all graceful ease and cheerfulness is what would strike dead the hope of any presumptuous libertine the moment he sees you  how can i enough returned i and kissed her hand acknowledge your ladyships polite goodness in this compliment but my lady you see by the very instance i have mentioned that a liberty is taken which i cannot think of without pain  it is such a liberty replied my lady as shows more despair than hope and is a confirmation of my sentiments on the prudence and dignity which not only i but every body attributes to you  kind kind lady davers said i again pressing her hand with my lips but i will turn my quarrel since i know not and hope i never shall the vile transcriber upon the author of the verses i think for had they not been written i should not have been thus insulted perhaps  but replied my lady cowley is my favorite poet he has a beautiful imagination a vast deal of brilliant wit and a chastity too in his works that hardly any of the tribe can boast  i once liked him better too said i than i have done since this for he was one of the poets that my lady would permit me to read sometimes and his pieces in praise of the country life and those charming lines against ambition used to delight me much if ever ambition should my fancy cheat with any wish so mean as to be great continue heaven still from me to remove the humble blessings of the life i love   i have taken notice of these lines often said my lady and been pleased with them but i think you have no reason to be out of conceit with cowley for the ill use made of his verses he but too naturally describes the influence of love which frequently interferes with our better duties and there is something very natural and easy and witty in the first lines  and shows that the poet laments the too engaging impressions which love made upon his mind even on the most solemn occasions  what rob me of heaven too  a bad heart pamela could not have so lamented or so written  ah but madam said i i have seen in your dear brothers collection of manuscripts a poem in which this very point nice as it is is touched with much greater propriety  can you repeat it my dear  the lines i mean i can your ladyship must know it was upon a quarrel between a beloved couple where the gentleman had been wild and the ladys illnatured uncle who wanted to break the match though it was designed by her deceased parents had fomented it so that she would not look upon her lover nor see him nor receive a letter of excuse from him though they were betrothed and she loved him dearly this obliged him to throw himself in her way at church and thus he writes but o forgive me heaven if often my fair robs thee of my devoir disturbs my prayer confounds my best resolves and makes me prove that she is too much a rival in thy love   these now madam continued i are the lines i admire but better thoughts my happier hopes suggest when once this stormy doubts expelled my breast when once this agitated flame shall turn to steadier heat and more intensely burn my dear maria then thought i will join and we one heart one soul shall all be thine   ay pamela these are very pretty lines you must procure me a sight of the whole they must needs let me into an entertaining history of a love quarrel  mean time you must not think ill of my favorite cowley for i say with a gentleman whose judgment and good heart have hardly any equal that though cowley was going out of fashion with some yet he should always suspect the head or the heart of him or her who could not taste and delight in his beauties  the words she cannot love me if she would and to say truth twere pity that she should show the goodness of the poets heart and even that the transcriber be he who he will had not the worst that he could single out these when if he would be shining with borrowed rays he might have chosen a much worse poet to follow  oh madam replied i say not one word in behalf of the wicked transcriber for a wretch to entertain the shadow of a wish for a married person is a degree of impurity that ought not to be excused but to commit such thoughts to writing to put that writing under the seat of the married person at church when her heart should be engaged wholly in her first duties where too it might be more likely to be seen by the pewkeepers than her and so spread over the whole parish to the propagation of bad ideas whenever i appeared and moreover might come to the hands of ones husband who from his own free life formerly and high passions as far as the transcriber knew might be uneasy at and angry with the innocent occasion of the insult  besides the apprehension it must give one that the man who could take this vile step might proceed to greater lengths which my busy fears could improve to duelling and murder  then the concern it must fill me with to the diverting of my mind from my first regards when any one looked at me wistfully that he might be the transcriber which must always give me confusion of thought  dearest madam can one forbear being vexed when all these imaginations dart in upon a mind apprehensive as mine indeed this action has given me great uneasiness at times ever since and i cannot help it  i am pleased with your delicacy my dear as i said before  you can never err while thus watchful over your conduct  and i own you have the more reason for it as you have married a mere julius caesar an openeyd rake that was her word who would on the least surmizes though ever so causeless on your part have all his passions up in arms in apprehension of liberties that might be offered like those he has not scrupled to take  oh but madam said i your dear brother has given me great satisfaction in one point for you must think i should not love him as i ought if i had not a concern for his future happiness as well as his present and that is he has assured me that in all the liberties he has taken he never attempted a married lady but always abhorred the thought of so great an evil  it is pity said her ladyship that a man who could conquer his passions so far could not subdue them entirely this shows it was in his own power to do so and increases his crime and what a wretch is he who scrupling under pretense of conscience or honor to attempt ladies within the pale boggles not to ruin a poor creature without although he knows he thereby most probably for ever deprives her of that protection by preventing her marriage which even among such rakes as himself is deemed inviolable and so casts the poor creature headlong into the jaws of perdition  ah madam replied i this was the very inference i made upon the occasion  and what could he say  he said my inference was just but called me pretty preacher  and once having cautioned me see vol ii p     not to be overserious with him so as to cast a gloom as he said over our innocent enjoyments i never dare to urge matters further when he calls me by that name  well said my lady you are an admirable girl gods goodness was great to our family when it gave thee to it  no wonder continued her ladyship as my brother says every body that sees you and has heard your character loves you and this is some excuse for the inconsiderate folly even of this unknown transcriber  ah madam said i but is it not a sad thing that people if they must take upon them to like ones behavior in general should have the worst instead of the best thoughts upon it if i were as good as i ought to be and as some think me must they wish to make me bad for that reason and so to destroy the cause of that pleasure which they pretend to take in seeing a body set a good example for what my dear lady could a wretch mean even by the words your ladyship thinks most innocent she cannot love me if she would and to say truth  as if this truth were extorted rather by his fears than his wishes  twere pity that she should   but why then if this be the case and that he would bear his sorrows as the poet calls them to the grave should he not keep them to himself make that very mind their grave which gave them their birth if the bold creature whoever he be had not thought this might be a hint that might somehow be improved and a vile foundation for some viler superstructure would he have transcribed them and caused them to be placed where they were found  then in my humble opinion the thought that is contained in these lines since that loved hand this mortal wound does give so handsomely the thing contrive that she may guiltless of it live so perish that her killing thee may a chancemedley and no murder be is rather a conceit or prettiness that will not bear examination than that true wit in which this fine poet excels  for if she cannot love him if she would and if it were pity that she should love him this implies she was a lady under previous obligation whether marriage or betrothment is the same thing to him then need the thing to be so handsomely contrived need any pains be taken if her repulse had killed as poetical license makes him say this invader of anothers right to bring it in chancemedley  since no jury could have brought it in murder except that sort of murder which is called felo de se you know my lady what a scholar your brother has made me so that i presume to think the poet himself is not so blameless in this as he has taken care to be in most of his pieces and permit me to make one observation my good lady that if the chastest writers supposing cowley meant ever so well may have their works and their thoughts turned to be panders and promoters of the wickedness of coarse minds whose grosser ideas could not be clothed in a dress fit to appear in decent company without their assistance how careful ought a good author to be whose works are so likely to live to the end of time how he propagates the worst of mischiefs to such a duration when he himself is dead and gone and incapable of antidoting the poison he has spread  her ladyship was pleased to kiss me as we sat my charming pamela my more than sister  did she say  yes she did say so and made my eyes overflow with joy to hear the sweet epithet  how your conversation charms me  i charge you when you get to town let me have your remarks on the diversions you will be carried to by my brother now i know what to expect from you and you know how acceptable every thing will be to me that comes from you i promise great pleasure as well to myself as to my worthy friends particularly lady betty in your unrestrained free correspondence  indeed pamela i must bring you acquainted with lady betty she is one of the worthies of our sex and has a fine understanding  i am sure you will like her  but for the world say it not to my brother nor let lady betty know i tell you so if ever you should be acquainted  i had carried the matter so far by my officious zeal to have my brother married to so fine a lady not doubting his joyful approbation that it was no small disappointment to her i can tell you when he married you and this is the best excuse i can make for my furious behavior to you at the hall for though i am naturally very hasty and passionate yet then i was almost mad  indeed my disappointment had given me so much indignation both against you and him that it is well i did not do some violent thing by you compare this part of the conversation with lady daverss behavior to pamela vol ii p     to   0 i believe you did feel the weight of my hand  but what was that  twas well i did not kill you dead  these were her ladyships words  for how could i think the wild libertine capable of being engaged by such noble motives or thee what thou art  so this will account to thee a little for my violence then  your ladyship said i all these things considered had but too much reason to be angry at your dear brothers proceedings so well as you always loved him so high a concern as you always had to promote his honor and interest and so far as you had gone with lady betty  i tell thee pamela said she that the old story of eleanor and rosamond run in my head all the way of my journey and i almost wished for a potion to force down thy throat and when i came and found thy lewd paramour absent for little did i think thou wast married to him though i expected thou would endeavor to persuade me to believe it apprehending that his intrigue with thee would effectually frustrate my hopes as to lady betty and him now thought i all happens as i wish  now will i confront this brazen girl  now will i try her innocence as i please by offering to take her with me out of his hands if she refuses take that refusal for a demonstration of her guilt and then thought i i will make the creature provoke me in the presence of my nephew and my woman and i hoped to have got that woman jewkes to testify for me too and i cannot tell what i might have done if thou had not got out of the window as thou did especially after thou had told me thou wast as much married as i was and had shown me his tender letter to thee which had a quite different effect upon me than thou had hoped for but if i had committed any act of violence what remorse should i have had when i came to reflect and had known what an excellence i had injured thank god thou did escape me thank god thou did and then her ladyship folded her arms about me and kissed me  this was a sad story you will say my dear miss and i wonder what her ladyships passion would have made her do surely she would not have killed me dead indeed surely she would not  let it not however miss nor you my dear father and mother  when you see it  go out of your own hands nor be read for my ladys sake to any body else  no miss not to your own dear mamma  it made me tremble a little even at this distance to think what a sad thing passion is when way is given to its ungovernable tumults and how it deforms and debases the noblest minds  we returned from this agreeable airing but just time enough to dress before dinner and then i attended my lady and we went together into the countesss apartment where i received abundance of compliments from both as this brief conversation will give you some notion of that management and economy for which they heaped upon me their kind praises i will recite to you what passed in it and hope you will not think me too vain and the less because what i underwent formerly from my ladys indignation half intitles me to be proud of her present kindness and favor  lady davers said your ladyship must excuse us that we have lost so much of your company but here this sweet girl has entertained me in such a manner that i could have staid out with her all day and several times did i bid the coachman prolong his circuit  my good lady davers madam said i has given me inexpressible pleasure and has been all condescension and favor and made me as proud as proud can be  you my dear mrs b said she may have given great pleasure to lady davers for it cannot be otherwise  but i have no great notion of her ladyships condescension as you call it pardon me madam said she to her smiling when she cannot raise her style above the word girl coming off from a tour you have made so delightful to her  i protest to you my lady c replied her ladyship with great goodness that epithet which once indeed i bestowed through pride as you will call it i now give for a very different reason i begin to doubt whether to call her sister is not more honor to myself than to her and to this hour am not quite convinced when i am i will call her so with pleasure  i was quite overcome with this fine compliment but could not answer a word and the countess said i could have spared you longer had not the time of day compelled your return for i have been very agreeably entertained as well as you although but with the talk of my woman and yours for here they have been giving me such an account of mrs bs economy and family management as has highly delighted me i never knew the like and in so young a lady too we shall have strange reformations to make lady davers when we go home in our families were we to follow so good an example  why my dear mrs b continued her ladyship you outdo all your neighbors and indeed i am glad i live so far from you  for were i to try to imitate you it would still be but imitation and you would have the honor of it  yet you hear and you see by yesterdays conversation said lady davers how much her best neighbors of both sexes admire her they all yield to her the palm unenvying  then my good ladies said i it is a sign i have most excellent neighbors full of generosity and willing to encourage a young person in doing right things so it makes considering what i was more for their honor than my own for what censures should not such an one as i deserve who have not been educated to fill up my time like ladies of condition were i not to employ myself as i do i who have so little other merit and who brought no fortune at all  come come pamela none of your selfdenying ordinances  that was lady daverss word  you must know something of your own excellence  if you do not i will tell it you because there is no fear you will be proud or vain upon it i dont see then that there is the lady in your neighborhood of any neighborhood that behaves with a more proper decorum or better keeps up the port of a lady than you do how you manage it i cannot tell but you do as much by a look and a pleasant one too that is the rarity as i do by high words and passionate exclamations i have often nothing but blunder upon blunder as if the wretches were in a confederacy to try my patience  perhaps madam said i the awe they have of your ladyship because of your high qualities makes them commit blunders for i myself have always been more afraid of appearing before your ladyship when you have visited your honored mother than of any body else and have been the more sensibly awkward through that very aweful respect  psha psha pamela that is not it it is all in yourself i used to think my mamma and my brother too had as awkward servants as i ever saw anywhere  except mrs jervis  well enough for a bachelor indeed  but here  thou have not parted with one servant  have thou  no my lady  how said the countess what excellence is here all of them pardon me mrs b your fellow servants as one may say and all of them so respectful so watchful of your eye and you at the same time so gentle to them so easy so cheerful  dont you think me miss insufferably vain but it is what they were pleased to say twas their goodness to me and showed how much they can excel in generous politeness so i will proceed  why this continued the countess must be born dignity  born discretion  education cannot give it  if it could why should not we have it  the ladies said many more kind things of me then and after dinner they mentioned all over again with additions before my best friend who was kindly delighted with the encomiums given me by two ladies of such distinguishing judgment in all other cases they told him how much they admired my family management then would have it that my genius was universal for the employments and accomplishments of my sex whether they considered it they were pleased to say as employed in penmanship in needle work in paying or receiving visits in music and i cannot tell how many other qualifications which their goodness made them attribute to me over and above the family management saying that i had an understanding that comprehended every thing and an eye that penetrated into the very bottom of matters in a moment and was never at a loss for the should be the why or wherefore and the how these were their comprehensive words  i did every thing with so much celerity clearing all as i went and leaving nothing that was their observation to recur or come over again that could be dispatched at once by which means they said every hand was clear to undertake a new work as well as my own head to direct it and there was no hurry nor confusion but every coming hour was fresh and ready and unincumberd so they said for its new employment and to this they attributed that ease and pleasure with which every thing was performed and that i could do and cause to be done so much business without hurry either to myself or servants  these kind things they would have it they observed in part themselves and in part from the observations of their women who looked they said so narrowly into every part of the management as if they were spies upon it but were such faithful ones that it was like a good cause brought to a strict scrutiny the brighter and fairer for it  thus my dear miss did their ladyships praise me for what i ought to be and i will endeavor to improve more and more by their kind admonitions which come clothed in the agreeable and flattering shape of praise the noblest incitement to the doing of ones duty  judge you how pleasing this was to my best beloved who found in their kind approbation such a justification of his own conduct that could not fail of being pleasing to him especially as lady davers was one of the kind praisers  lord davers was so highly delighted that he rose once begging his brothers excuse to salute me and remained standing over my chair with a pleasure in his looks that cannot be expressed nowandthen lifting up his hands and his goodnatured eye glistening with joy which a pierglass gave me the opportunity of seeing as sometimes i stole a bashful glance toward it not knowing how or which way to look even mr h seemed to be touched very sensibly and recollecting his behavior to me at the hall he once cried out what a sad whelp was i to behave as i once did to so much excellence  not mr b that i was any thing uncivil neither  but in unworthy sneers and nonsense  you know me well enough  p  x on me for a jackanapes  you called me see vol ii p     tinseld toy though madam dont you remember that and said twenty or thirty years hence when i was at age you would give me an answer  egad i shall never forget your looks nor your words neither  they were d  nd severe speeches were they not sir  o you see mr h said my dear gentleman pamela is not quite perfect  we must not provoke her for she will call us both so perhaps for i wear a laced waistcoat sometimes as well as you  nay faith i cannot be angry said he i deserved it richly that i did had it been worse  thy silly tongue said my lady runs on without fear or wit what is past is past  why in faith madam i was plaguily wrong and i said nothing of any body but myself  and have been ready to hang myself since as often as i have thought of my nonsense  my nephew said my lord must bring in hanging or the gallows in every speech he makes or it will not be he  mr b smiling said with severity enough in his meaning as i could see by the turn of his countenance  mr h knows that his birth and family entitle him more to the block than the rope or he would not make so free with the latter  good very good by jupiter said mr h laughing the countess smiled lady davers shook her head at her brother and said to her nephew you are a goodnatured foolish fellow that thou art  for what madam why the word foolish aunt what have i said now  nothing to any purpose indeed said she when thou do i will write it down  then madam said he have your pen and ink always about you when i am present  the devils in it if you will not put that down to begin with  this made every one laugh what a happy thing it is thought i that goodnature generally accompanies this character else my dear miss how would some people be supportable  but here i will break off it is time you will say  but you know whom i write to as well as to you and they will be pleased with all my silly scribble  so excuse one part for that and another for friendships sake and then i shall be wholly excusable to you  now the trifler again resumes her pen i am in some pain miss for tomorrow because of the rules we observe of late in our family on sundays and of going through a crowd to church which will afford new scenes to our noble visitors either for censure or otherwise but i will sooner be censured for doing what i think my duty than for the want of it and so will break nothing into our usual way  i hope i shall not be thought ridiculous or as one who aims at works of supererogation for what i think is very short of my duty  some order surely becomes the heads of families and besides it would be discrediting ones own practice if one did not appear at one time what one does at another for that which is a reason for discontinuing a practice for some company would seem to be a reason for laying it aside for ever especially in a family visiting and visited as ours  and i remember well a hint given me by my dearest friend once on another subject see vol ii p  0   that it is in every ones power to prescribe rules to himself after a while and persons see what is ones way and that we are not to be put out of it  but my only doubt is that to ladies who have not been accustomed perhaps to the necessary strictness i should make myself censurable as if i aimed at too much perfection for however ones duty is ones duty and ought not to be dispensed with yet when a person who uses to be remiss sees so hard a task before them and so many great points to get over all to be no more than tolerably regular it is rather apt to frighten and discourage than to allure and one must proceed as i have read soldiers do in a difficult siege inch by inch and be more studious to entrench and fortify themselves as they go on gaining upon the enemy than by rushing all at once upon an attack of the place be repulsed and perhaps obliged with great loss to abandon an hopeful enterprise  and permit me to add that young as i am i have often observed that overgreat strictnesses all at once enjoined and insisted upon are not fit for a beginning reformation but for stronger christians only and therefore generally do more harm than good in such a circumstance  what a miserable creature am i said a neighboring widow gentlewoman whom i visited in her illness at her own desire though a stranger to me but by name if all the good you do and the strict life you live is no more than absolutely necessary to salvation  i saw the poor gentlewoman through illness and low spirits was ready to despond and to comfort her i said dear madam dont be cast down god almighty gives us all a light to walk by in these our dark paths and it is my humble opinion he will judge us according to the unforced and unbyassed use we make of that light i think it my duty to do several things which perhaps the circumstances of others will not permit them to do or which they on serious and disinterested reflection may not think absolutely necessary to be done in each case our judgments are a law to each and i ought no more to excuse myself from doing such parts as i think my duty than you to condemn yourself for not doing what does not appear to you so strictly necessary and besides madam you may do as much good one way as i another and so both may be equally useful in the general system of providence  but shall i not be too grave my dear miss  excuse me for this is saturday night and as it was a very good method which the ingenious authors of the spectators took generally to treat their more serious subjects on this day so i think one should when one can consider it as the preparative eve to a still better  sunday now my dear miss by what i have already written it is become in a manner necessary to acquaint you briefly with the method my dear mr b not only permits but incourages me to take in the family he leaves to my care as to the sunday duty  the worthy dean at my request and by my beloveds permission recommended to me as a sort of family chaplain for sundays a young gentleman of great sobriety and piety and sound principles who having but lately taken orders has at present no other provision and this gentleman comes and reads prayers to us about seven in the morning in the lesser hall as we call it a retired apartment next the little garden for we have no chapel with us here as in your neighborhood and this generally with some suitable exhortation or meditation out of some good book which the young gentleman is so kind to let me choose nowandthen when i please takes up little more than half an hour  we have a great number of servants of both sexes and myself my good mrs jervis and my polly barlow are generally in a little closet which when we open the door is but just a separation and that is all from the hall  mr adams for that is our young clergymans name has a desk at which sometimes mr jonathan makes up his running accounts to mr longman who is very scrupulous of admitting any body to the use of his office because of the writings in his custody and the order he values himself upon having every thing in  about seven in the evening the young gentleman comes again and i generally let me have what company i will find time to retire for about another halfhour and my dear mr b connives at and excuses my absence if inquired after though for so short a time i am seldom missed  to the young gentleman i shall present every quarter five guineas and mr b presses him to accept of a place at his table at his pleasure but as we have generally a good deal of company his modesty makes him decline it and sit down when he pleases with mr longman and mrs jervis who have a separate table  mr longman is so kind as to join with us very often in our sunday office and mr colbrand seldom misses and they tell mrs jervis that they cannot express the pleasure they have to meet me there and the edification they receive as they are so kind to say from my example and the cheerful temper i am always in which does em good to look upon me and they will have it that i do credit to religion but if they do but think so it must have been of service to me in the order i have now established as i hope and that through less difficulties than i expected to meet with especially from the sea vol i p     vol ii p     cookmaid but she says she comes with double delight to have the opportunity to see her beloved lady as she calls me it seems at every word  my best beloved dispenses as much as he can with the servants for the evening part if he has company or will be attended only by john or abraham perhaps by turns and sometimes looks upon his watch and says it is near seven and if he says so they take it for a hint they may be dispensed with for half an hour and this countenance which the dear gentleman gives me has not contributed a little to make the matter easy and delightful to me and to every one  i am sure my dear miss were only policy to be considered this method must be laudable for since i have begun it there is not a more diligent a more sober nor more courteous set of servants in any family in a great way we have no broils no hard words no revilings no commandings nor complainings and mrs jerviss government is made so easy as she says that she need not speak twice and all the language of the servants is pray john or pray jane do so or so and they say their dear masters service is a heaven upon earth  when i part from them on the breaking up of our assembly they generally make a little row on each side to the halldoor and when i have made my compliments and paid my thanks to mr adams one whispers as i go out god bless you madam and so says another and another and indeed every one and bow and courtsy with such pleasure in their honest countenances as greatly delights me and i say if it so happens so my good friends  i am glad to see you  not one absent  or but one  as it falls out  this is very obliging i cry and thus i show them that i take notice if any body be not there and back again i go to pay my duty to my earthly benefactor and he is pleased to say sometimes that i come to him with such a radiance playing about my eyes and shining over my whole face as gives him double pleasure to behold me and often he tells me afterward that but for appearing too fond before company he could meet me as i enter with embraces as pure as my own heart  i hope in time i shall prevail upon the dear gentleman to give me his company  but thank god i am enabled to go thus far already  i will leave the rest to his providence for i have a point very delicate to touch upon in this particular and i must take care not to lose the ground i have gained by too precipitately pushing at too much at once this is my comfort that next to being uniform himself is that permission and encouragement he gives me to be so and the pleasure he takes in seeing me so delighted  and besides the dear gentleman always gives me his company to church o how happy should i think myself if he would be pleased to accompany me to the divine office which yet he has not done though i have urged him as much as i durst one thing after another he says we shall be better and better i hope but nobody is good all at once but my dear miss as i consider this as the seal of all the rest and he himself has an awful notion of it i shall hardly think my dear mr bs morals fully secured till then  mrs jervis asked me on saturday evening if i would be concerned to see a larger congregation in the lesser hall next morning than usual i said no by no means she said mrs worden and mrs lesley the two ladies women and mr sydney my lord daverss gentleman and mr hs servant and the coachmen and footmen belonging to our noble visitors who are she says all great admirers of our family management and good order having been told our method begged to join in it i knew i should be a little dashed at so large a company but the men being pretty orderly for lords servants and mrs jervis assuring me that they were very earnest in their request i consented to it  when at the usual time attended by my polly i went down i found mr adams there to whom i made my first compliments and every one of our own people waiting for me mr colbrand excepted whom mr h had kept up late the night before together with mrs worden and mrs lesley and mr sydney with the servants of our guests who as also worthy mr longman and mrs jervis and mr jonathan paid me their respects and i said this is early rising mrs lesley and mrs worden you are very kind to countenance us with your companies in this our family order  mr sidney i am glad to see you how do you mr longman and looked round with complacency on the servants of our noble visitors and then i led mrs worden and mrs lesley to my little retiringplace and mrs jervis and my polly followed and throwing the door open mr adams began some select prayers and as the young gentleman reads with great emphasis and propriety and as if his heart was in what he read all the good folks were exceedingly attentive  after prayers mr adams read a meditation from a collection made for private use which i shall more particularly mention byandby and ending with the usual benediction i thanked the worthy gentleman and reproached him in mr bs name for his modesty in declining our table and thanking mr longman and mrs worden and mrs lesley received their kind wishes and hastened blushing through their praises to my chamber where being alone i pursued the subject for an hour till breakfast was ready when i attended the ladies and my best beloved who had told them of the verses placed under my cushion at church  we set out my lord and lady davers and myself and mr h in our coach and mr b and the countess in the chariot both ladies and the gentlemen splendidly dressed but i avoided a glitter as much as i could that i might not seem to vie with the two peeresses  mr b said why are you not full dressed my dear  i said i hoped he would not be displeased if he was i would do as he commanded he answered as you like best my love you are a charming creature in every dress  the chariot first drawing up to the churchdoor mr b led the countess into the church my lord davers did me that honor and mr h handed his aunt through a crowd of gazers many of whom as usual were strangers the neighboring gentlemen and their ladies paid us their silent respects but the thoughts of the wicked verses or rather as lady davers will have me say wicked action of the transcriber of them made me keep behind in the pew but my lady with great goodness sat down by me and whisperingly talked a good deal between whiles to me with great tenderness and freedom in her aspect which i could not but take kindly because i know she intended by it to show every one she was pleased with me  among other things she said softly who would wish to be a king or queen pamela if it is so easy for virtue and beauty so she was pleased to say to attract so many sincere admirers without any of their grandeur  look round my dear girl and see what a solemn respect and mingled delight appears in every countenance  and pressing my hand thou art a charming creature such a noble modesty and yet such a becoming dignity in thy whole appearance no wonder that every ones eyes are upon thee and that thou bring so many booted gentlemen as well as neighbors to crowd the church to behold thee  afterward she was pleased to add taking my hand and my dear gentleman and the countess heard her for she raised her voice to a more audible whisper i am proud to be in thy company and in this solemn place i take thy hand and acknowledge with pride my sister i looked down for here at church i can hardly at any time look up for who can bear to be gazed at so  and softly said oh my good lady how much you honor me the place and these surrounding eyes can only hinder me from acknowleging as i ought  my best friend with pleasure in his eyes said pressing his hand upon both ours as my lady had mine in hers you are two beloved creatures both excellent in your way god bless you both and you too my dear brother said my lady the countess whispered you should spare abody a little you give one ladies and mr b too much pleasure all at once such company and such behavior adds still more charms to devotion and were i to be here a twelvemonth i would never miss once accompanying you to this good place  mr h thought he must say something and addressing himself to his noble uncle who could not keep his goodnatured eye off me i will be hanged my lord if i know how to behave myself  why this outdoes the chapel  i am glad i put on my new suit and then he looked upon himself as if he would support as well as he could his part of the general admiration  but think you not my dear miss and my dearest father and mother that i am now at the height of my happiness in this life thus favored by lady davers  the dean preached an excellent sermon but i need not to have said that only to have mentioned that he preached was saying enough  my lord led me out when divine service was over and being a little tender in his feet from a gouty notice walked very slowly mr b led the countess and mr h his aunt lady towers and mrs brooks joined us in the porch and made us their compliments as did mr martin will you favor us with your company home my old acquaintance said mr b to that gentleman i cannot having a gentleman my relation to dine with me but if it will be agreeable in the evening i will bring him with me to taste of your burgundy for we have not any such in the county i shall be glad to see you and any friend of yours replied mr b  mr martin whispered it is more however to admire your lady i can tell you that than your wine  get into your coaches ladies said he with his usual freedom our maiden and widow ladies have a fine time of it wherever you come by my faith they must every one of them quit this neighborhood if you were to stay in it but all the hopes they have are that while youre in london they will have the game in their own hands  sister said lady davers most kindly to me in presence of many who in a respectful manner gathered near us mr martin is the same gentleman he used to be i see  mr martin madam said i smiling has but one fault he is too apt to praise whom he favors at the expense of his absent friends  i am always proud of your reproofs mrs b replied he  ay said lady towers that i believe and therefore i wish for all our sakes you would take him oftener to task mrs b  lady towers lady arthur mrs brooks and mr martin all claimed visits from us and mr b making excuses that he must husband his time because of being obliged to go to town soon proposed to breakfast with lady towers the next morning dine with mr arthur and sup with mrs brooks and as there cannot be a more social and agreeable neighborhood anywhere his proposal after some difficulty was accepted and our usual visiting neighbors were all to have notice accordingly at each of the places  i saw sir thomas atkyns coming toward us and fearing to be stifled with compliments i said your servant ladies and gentlemen and giving my hand to lord davers stepped into the chariot instead of the coach for people that would avoid bustle sometimes make it finding my mistake i would have come out but my lord said indeed you shall not and i will step in because i will have you all to myself  lady davers smiled now said she while the coach drew up is my lord davers pleased but i see sister you were tired with part of your company in the coach  it is well contrived my dear said mr b as long as you have not deprived me of this honor taking the countesss hand and leading her into the coach  will you excuse all this impertinence my dear miss  i know my dear father and mother will be pleased with it and you will have the goodness to bear with me on that account for their kind hearts will be delighted to hear every minute thing in relation to lady davers and myself  when mr martin came in the evening with his friend who is sir william g a polite young gentleman of lincolnshire he told us a deal of the praises lavished away upon me by several genteel strangers one saying to his friend he had traveled twenty miles to see me  my lady davers was praised too for her goodness to me and the gracefulness of her person the countess for the noble serenity of her aspect and that charming ease and freedom which distinguish her birth and quality my dear mr b he said was greatly admired too but he would not make him proud for he had superiorities enough already that was his word over his gentlemen neighbors but i can tell you said he that for most of your praises you are obliged to your lady for having rewarded her excellence as you have done for one gentleman added he said he knew no one but you could deserve her and he believed you did from that tenderness in your behavior to her and from that grandeur of air and majesty of person that seemed to show you formed for her protector as well as rewarder  get you gone to london both of you said he i did not intend to tell you mr b what was said of you  and indeed i see no such extraordinary excellence do you sir to his friend in that gentleman  sir william said mr b was all that was polite and noble and it was no wonder that every body pronounced us both the charmingest couple they had ever seen  the women of the two ladies had acquainted their ladyships with the order i observed for the day and the devout behavior of the servants etc and about seven i withdrawing as silently and as unobserved as i could was surprised as i was going through the great hall to be joined by both  i shall come at all your secrets pamela said my lady and be able in time to cut you out in your own way i know whither you are going  my good ladies said i forgive me leaving you i will attend you in half an hour  no my dear said lady davers the countess and i have resolved to attend you for that halfhour and we will return to company together  is it not descending too much my ladies as to the company  if it is for us it is for you said the countess so we will either act up to you or make you come down to us and we will judge of all your proceedings  nay my dear ladies said i and sat down on the first chair  nay my dear pamela returned my lady show us the way  if i must i must  but i was much abashed  every one but abraham who attended the gentlemen and all their ladyships servants and their two women and mr longman and mrs jervis were there which pleased me however because it showed me that even the strangers by this their second voluntary attendance had no ill opinion of the service but they were all startled ours and theirs to see my ladies accompanying me  i stepped up to mr adams  i was in hopes sir said i we should have been favored with your company at our table  your ladyship said he will excuse me i did not think myself company for such noble guests as were there  a gentleman and a scholar is company said the countess for the first quality  well sir said i you see the nobleness of these ladies they come now to be obliged to you for your good offices and you will have no better way of letting them return their obligation than to sup though you would not dine with them  my lady tappd me on the neck  genteelly said this was like my sister her own self mr longman said she how do you  we are come to be witnesses of my sisters goodness and the family decorum  we have a blessed lady madam said he and your ladyships presence augments our joys  let us follow you pamela said she we must learn of you what we are to do  i led to the little closet with as much presence of mind as i could and my two ladies followed me and mrs jervis and mrs worden and mrs lesley stood just without the door being half shut for their ladies sakes  i should have said we were not at church in the afternoon  and when i do not go we have the evening service read to us as it is at church which mr adams performed now with his usual distinctness and fervor and the ladies seemed not at all uneasy although we had a meditation besides  when all was concluded i said now my dearest ladies excuse me for the sake of the delight i take in seeing all my good folks about me in this decent and obliging manner  indeed i have no ostentation in it if i know my own heart  indeed i have not  the countess and my lady davers delighted to see such good behavior in every one sat a moment or two looking upon one another in silence and then my lady davers caught me in her arms beloved deservedly beloved of the kindest of husbands what a blessing art thou to this family  and to every family said the countess who have the happiness to know and the grace to follow her example and saluted me too but where said my lady collectedst thou all this good sense and fine spirit in thy devotions  the bible my dear ladies said i is the foundation of all but this and their common prayer book and the duty of man our good folks have every one of them and are so good as to employ themselves in them at all leisure opportunities on other days for which reason that i may diversify their devotions i have with the assistance of mr adams and by advice of the dean made extracts from several good pieces which we read on these days mr adams said my lady davers will you oblige me with a copy of my sisters book at your leisure he readily engaged to do this and the countess desired another copy which he also promised  lady davers then turning herself to mrs jervis how do you good woman said she  why you are now made ample amends for the love you bore to this dear creature formerly  you have an angel and not a woman for your lady my good mrs jervis said the countess  mrs jervis folding her uplifted hands together o my lady you know not our happiness no not one half of it we were before blessed with plenty and a bountiful indulgence by our good master but our plenty brought on wantonness and pride but now we have peace as well as plenty and peace of mind my dear lady in doing all in our respective powers to show us thankful creatures to god and to the best of masters and mistresses  good soul said i and was sorcd to put my handkerchief to my eye your heart is always overflowing thus with gratitude and praises for what you so well merit from us  mr longman said my lady assuming a sprightly air although her eye twinkled to keep within its lids the precious water that sprang from a noble and wellaffected heart i am glad to see you here attending your pious young lady  well might you love her honest man well might you  i did not know there was so excellent a creature in any rank  madam said the other worthy heart unable to speak but in broken sentences  you dont know  indeed you dont what a  what a  hap  happy  family we are  truly we are like unto alexanders soldiers every one fit to be a general so well do we all know our duties and practice them too let me say  nay and please your ladyship we all of us long till morning comes thus to attend my lady and after that is past we long for evening for the same purpose for she is so good to us  you cannot think how good she is but permit your honored fathers old servant to say one word more that though we are always pleased and joyful on these occasions yet we are in transports to see our masters noble sister thus favoring us with your ladyship too to the countess and approving our young ladys conduct and piety  blessing on you all said my lady  let us go my lady  let us go sister  for i can stay no longer  as i slid by following their ladyships how do you mr colorand said i softly  i feared you was not well in the morning  he bowed pardon me madame  i vas leetell indispose dat ish true  now my dear miss will you forgive me all this selfpraise as it may seem  yet when you know i give it you and my dear parents as so many instances of my lady daverss reconciliation and goodness to me and as it will show what a noble heart that good lady has at bottom when her pride of quality and her passion have subsided and her native good sense and excellence take place i flatter myself i may be the rather excused and especially as i hope to have my dear miss darnfords company and countenance one day in this my delightful sunday employment  i should have added for i think a good clergyman cannot be too much respected that i repeated my request to mr adams to oblige us with his company at supper but he so very earnestly begged to be excused and with so much concern of countenance that i thought it would be wrong to insist upon it though i was sorry for it because i am sure as of any thing that modesty is always a sign of merit  we returned to the gentlemen as soon as supper was ready and as cheerful and easy as lady davers observed as if we had not been present at so solemn a service and this said she after the gentlemen were gone makes religion so pleasant and delightful a thing that i profess i shall have a much higher opinion of those who make it a regular and constant part of their employment than ever i had but i have seen added her ladyship very humorously such wry faces and such gloomy countenances among some of your pious folks in and after a solemn office that quite disheartened me for i thought after such an exercise that it would be a sin to go to bed with a smile upon ones face or without sighing and groaning at such a rate as must rob one of all the comforts of life  then said she i was once i remember when a girl at the house of a very devout man for a week with his granddaughter my schoolfellow and there were such preachments against vanities and for selfdenials that were we to have followed the good mans precepts though indeed not his practice for well did he love his belly half god almightys creatures and works would have been useless and industry would have been banished the earth  there added her ladyship for she was in a pleasant vein have i heard the good man confess himself guilty of such sins that if true and by his hiding his face with his broadbrimd hat it looked a little bad against him he ought to have been hanged on a gallows fifty foot high  i said that this overgloominess was not religion i was persuaded but constitution and mistake and i was sorry always when i met with it for though it might betoken a pious mind it certainly showed a narrow one and i feared did more harm than good  these reflections as i said fell from my lady after the gentlemen were gone when she recounted to her dear brother the entertainment as she was pleased to call it i had given her on which she made high encomiums as did the countess and they praised also the natural dignity which they imputed to me saying i had taught them a way they never could have found out to descend to the company of servants and augment their respect and veneration for one at the same time and pamela said my lady you are certainly very right to pay so much regard to the young clergyman for that makes all he reads and all he says of greater efficacy with the auditors facilitates the work you have in view to bring about and in your own absence for your monarch may not always dispense with you perhaps strengthens his influences and encourages the young gentleman besides  monday i am to thank you my dear miss for your kind letter approving of my scribble see letter xxviii of this volume  when you come to my saturdays and sundays accounts i shall try your patience but no more of that for as you can read them or let them alone i am the less concerned especially as they will be more indulgently received somewhere else than they may merit so that my labor will not be wholly lost  i congratulate you with all my heart on your dismissing mr murray for besides that some of his qualities are not to be approved by a lady of your taste and judgment i will never give my consent that any gentleman shall have the honor of calling my miss darnford his who can so easily resign his pretensions to her and address her sister  you are extremely diverting my dear miss with your greater and lesser bearstars and i could not help showing it to mr b and what do you think the free gentleman said upon it i am half afraid to tell you but do now you are so happily disengaged get leave to come and let us two contrive to be even with him for it you are the only lady in the world that i would join with against him  he said that your characters of mr murray and miss nanny which he called severe but i will not call them so without your leave looked a little like pretty spite and as if you were sorry the gentleman took you at your word  that was what he said  pray let us punish him for it yet he called you charming lady and said a great deal in your praise and joined with me that mr murray could not possibly deserve you who was so easyto part with you  but pamela said he i know the sex well enough miss polly may not love mr murray yet to see her sister addressed and complimented and preferred to herself by one whom she thought so late in her own power to choose or to refuse is a mortifying thing and young ladies cannot bear to sit by neglected while two lovers are playing pugs tricks with one another  then said he all the preparations to matrimony the clothes to be bought the visits to be paid and received the compliments of friends the busy novelty of the thing and the day to be fixed and all the little foolish humors and nonsense attending a concluded courtship when one sister is to engross all the attention and regard the new equipages and so forth these are all subjects of mortification to the other though she had no great value for the man perhaps  well but sir said i a lady of miss darnfords good sense and good taste is not to be affected by these parades and has well considered the matter no doubt and i dare say rejoices rather than repines at missing the gentleman  thus my dear miss had we a dispute about you but i hope you will leave the happy pair for they are so if they think themselves so together and sir simon to rejoice in his accomplished soninlaw elect and give us your company to london for who would stay to be vexed by that illnatured miss nanny as you own you was at your last writing  but i will proceed with my journal and the rather as i have something to tell you of a conversation the result of which has done me great honor and given me inexpressible delight of which in its place  we pursued mr bs proposal returning several visits in one day for we have so polite and agreeable a neighborhood that all seem to concur in a desire to make every thing easy to one another and as i mentioned before hearing mr bs intention to set out for london as soon as our noble guests should leave us they dispensed with formalities being none of them studious to take things amiss and having a general good opinion of one anothers intentions not to disoblige  we came not home till ten in the evening and then found a letter directed from sir jacob swynford uncle by the halfblood to mr b acquainting him that hearing his niece lady davers was with him he would be here in a day or two being then upon his journey to pay a visit to his nephew and niece at the same time  this gentleman is very particularly odd and humoursome and his eldest son being next heir to the maternal estate if mr b should have no children has been exceedingly dissatisfied with his debasing himself in marrying me and would have been better pleased had he not married at all perhaps  there never was any cordial love between mr bs father and him nor between the uncle and nephew and niece for his positiveness roughness and selfinterestedness too though very rich has made him but little agreeable to the generous tempers of his nephew and niece yet when they meet which is not above once in four or five years they are always very civil and obligeing to him  lady davers wondered what could bring him hither now for he lives in herefordshire and seldom stirs ten miles from home mr b said he was sure it was not to compliment him and me on our nuptials no rather said my lady to satisfy himself if you are in a way to cut out his own cubs thank god we are said my dearest friend whenever i was strongest set against matrimony the only reason i had to weigh against my dislike to the state was that i was unwilling to leave so large a part of my estate see vol ii p  0 to that family  my dear said he to me dont be uneasy but you will see a relation of mine much more disagreeable than you can imagine but no doubt you have heard his character  ah pamela said lady davers we are a family that value ourselves upon our ancestry but upon my word sir jacob and all his line have nothing else to boast of and i have been often ashamed of my relation to them  no family i believe my lady has every body excellent in it replied i but i doubt i shall stand but poorly with sir jacob  he will not dare to affront you my dear said mr b although he will say to you and me and my sister too blunt and rough things but he will not stay above a day or two and we shall not see him again for some years to come so well bear with him i am now coming to the conversation i hinted at  tuesday on tuesday mr williams came to pay his respects to his kind patron i had been to pay a visit to the widow gentlewoman i mentioned before and on my return went directly to my closet so knew not of his being there till i came down to dinner for mr b and he were near two hours together in discourse in the library  when i came down mr b presented him to me my friend mr williams my dear said he  mr williams how do you do said i i am glad to see you  he rejoiced he said to see me look so well and had longed for an opportunity to pay his respects to his worthy patron and me before but had been prevented twice when he was upon the point of setting out  mr b said i have prevailed upon my old acquaintance to take up his residence with us while he stays in these parts do you my dear see that every thing is made agreeable to him  to be sure sir i will  mr adams being in the house mr b sent to desire he would dine with us if it were but in respect to a gentleman of the same cloth who gave us his company and with great modesty he came but neither of the gentlemen knew how to speak at first before lady davers who is so majestic a lady and has so majestic a character too that every one has an awe upon them in her presence  mr b when dinner was over and the servants were withdrawn said my dear mr williamss business in part was to ask my advice as to a living that is offered him by the earl of  who is greatly taken with his preaching and conversation  and to quit yours i presume sir said lord davers  no the earls is not quite so good as mine and his lordship would procure him a dispensation to hold both what would you advise my dear  it becomes not me sir said i to meddle with such matters as these  yes my dear it does when i ask your opinion  i beg pardon sir said i  my opinion then is that mr williams will not care to do any thing that requires a dispensation and which would be unlawful without it  your ladyship said mr williams speaks exceedingly well  i am glad mr williams said i that you approve of my sentiments you see they were required of me by one who has a right to command me in every thing otherwise this matter is above my sphere and i have so much good will to mr williams that i wish him every thing that will contribute to make him happy  well my dear said mr b but what would you advise in this case the earl proposes that mr williamss present living be supplied by a curate to whom no doubt mr williams will be very genteel and as we are seldom or never there his lordship thinks we shall not be displeased with it and insists upon it that he will propose it to me as he has done  lord davers said i think this may do very well brother but what pray mr williams do you propose to allow to your curate excuse me sir but i think the clergy do so hardly by one another generally that they are not to be surpised that some of the laity treat them as they do  indeed said mr h that is well observed for i have heard it said twenty and twenty times if you would know how to value a clergyman and what he deserves for spending his whole life in the duties of his function you need but form your opinion upon the treatment they give to one another and  0 or  0 l a year would be thought too much even for him who does all the labor  who says my nephew speaks not well says my lord  oh said my lady no wonder this is jackeys peculiar he has always something to say against the clergy for he never loved them because his tutors were clergymen and since said her ladyship very severely he never got any good from them why should they expect any from him  always hard upon my poor nephew said lord davers  thank you aunt said mr h  mr williams said mr hs observation was but too true that nothing gave greater cause of scandal than the usage some even of the dignified clergy gave their brethren that he had always lamented it as one of the greatest causes of the contempt with which the clergy are too generally treated  he was proceeding but lady davers said i am not at all surpised at their treatment of one another for if a gentleman of education and learning can so far forget what belongs to his function as to accept of two livings when one would afford him a handsome maintenance it is no wonder that such a one would make the most of it for does he not as good as declare that he takes it for that very purpose  i must not let this argument proceed said mr b without clearing my worthy friend he is under no difficulty about holding the two he proposes not to do it and like a good man as i always thought him is of opinion he ought not to do it but here is his difficulty and all his difficulty he is very desirous to oblige his good friend the earl who is very pressing to have him near him but apprehending that i may take it amiss if he relinquishes my living he came to ask my advice and after we had talked a good deal of the matter i told him we would refer it to pamela who was a kind of casuist in such matters of equity and good order as fell within the compass of her observation and capacity and so my dear said he give us your free opinion for this is a subject you have spoken your mind to me upon once before  i am very glad sir replied i that mr williamss own resolution was so conformable to what i wished it to be and indeed expected from his character and i can more freely speak my mind upon the occasion though i am but a poor casuist neither  you remember my dear said mr b what you observed to me in favor of the clergy and their maintenance when we fell occasionally upon that subject a while ago i found you had considered the point and thought you spoke well upon the subject let us hear your opinion now upon it  indeed replied i i say now as i then took the liberty to say that i have so general a good will for the function that if my wishes could have effect there is not one of it but should have a handsome competency at least such a one as to set him above contempt and this i am persuaded would be a great furtherance to the good we expect from them in teaching the lower rank of people as well as the higher their duties and making them good servants and useful members of the commonwealth  but my dear you took notice of some things that would if you can recollect them be very apropos to the subject we are now upon  i remember sir said i we were talking of impropriations i took the liberty to express myself a little earnestly against impropriations and i remember you stopped my mouth at once upon that head  as how sister said lady davers  ay as how mrs b said the countess  why madam mr b was pleased to say that when the clergy would come into a regulation for the more equal and useful disposition of the revenues that at present were in the church he would be the first that would bring in a bill for restoring to it all that it had lost by impropriations and other secularizations and leave it upon the public to make satisfaction to such of the laity as would be sufferers by the restoration  that was not my dear what i meant returned mr b you was particularly against dispensations which is the point before us now  i remember sir i did say that as there are so many gentlemen of the function who have no provision at all i could not wish any one of it should hold two livings especially if they cannot perform the duties of both and where one would afford a tolerable competence much less i remember i took the liberty to add could i think it excusable that a gentleman should rate the labors of his brother who does every thing so low as is too frequently the case and pay himself so well for doing nothing at all  this is what i mean returned mr b and i thought you observed very well my dear for my own part i have always been of opinion that the clergy who do thus make the best excuse that can be made for impropriators and laypatrons for here is a gentleman the son of a layman i speak to general cases is sent to the university and takes orders he has interest perhaps to get two or more livings and hires a person who is as deserving as himself but destitute of friends at a low rate to do the duties of one of them we will suppose in his favor that he has several children to provide for out of these and makes that his pretense for oppressing the person he employs to do his own duty some of these children are males some females and not one in five of the former is brought up to the church and all that he saves for them and gives them out of what he squeezes from his unhappy brother is it not secularizing as it were at least as far as he can do it the revenues appropriated to the church and can he whatever others may blame an impropriator for applying that portion of the produce of church lands to his layfamily which the other intends for the layfamily he is endeavoring to build up some one or two of which impropriators sons may possibly too in order to possess the living in their fathers gift be brought up to the church what is the difference i would fain know  if the clergy were always to have done thus continued mr b should we not have wanted many endowments and charitable foundations which we now have and i am verry sorry to have reason to say that we owe such sort of works more to the piety of the clergy of past times than the present for now let us cast our eye upon the practices of some of our prelates for who is it that looks not up first for examples to that venerable order and we shall find that too many among them seem more intent upon making a family as it is called and thereby secularizing as i observed as much as they can the revenues of the church than to live up either to the ancient hospitality or with a view to those acts of munificence which were the reason for endowing the church with such ample revenues as it once had and still has were it not so unequally distributed and in so few hands  but dear sir said i what a sad hardship do the inferior clergy labor under all this time  to be oppressed and kept down by their brethren and the laity too this is hard indeed  it is pity methinks this at least could not be remedied  it will hardly ever be done my dear the evil lies deep it is in human nature and when that can be mended it will be better but i see not how it can be expected while those who have most influence to procure the redress are most interested to prevent it and the views of others aspiring to the same power and interest make too many wish to have things left as they are although they have no present benefit by it and those would join in a cry of the churchs danger were the legislature to offer at a redress  it is pity sir said i the convocation are not permitted to sit they would perhaps undertake this province and several others for the benefit of the whole body of the clergy and i should think such regulations would come best from them  so it is my dear would they employ themselves and their deliberations in such good works but it is a sad thing to consider that there is little good to be expected from bodies of men in general for although an individual cares not to pull down upon himself the odium of a bad or unpopular action yet when there are many to share it among them i see not that they stand upon it but far be it from me to say this with a view to convocations as convocations i speak what is but too generally the case in all bodies of men whatever whether clergy or laity and let us look into the greater or lesser corporations and societies throughout the kingdom and you will find if you excuse a poor witicism that bodies are really bodies and act too often as if they had no souls among them  i hope sir said the countess that when you judge thus hardly of bodies you include the two supreme bodies  thou shall not said mr b  i know these reverend gentlemen looking at mr williams and mr adams will tell me speak evil of the rulers of thy people  but i wish i could always defend what i am loath at any time to censure but were you to read or attend to the debates in both houses which sometimes happen in cases almost selfevident you would find it impossible not to regret that you are now and then under a necessity to join with the minority as well in your house lord davers as in ours  i wish brother replied his lordship i could differ from you with reason but this always was and i fear always will be so more or less in every session  but to return to our first subject said mr b you know my dear how much pleasure i take to hear your opinion in cases of natural equity and you must tell us freely what you would advise your friend mr williams to do  and must i sir speak my mind before so many better judges  yes sister said her ladyship a name she is now pleased to give me freely before strangers after her dear brothers example who is kindest though always kind at such times you must if i may be allowed to say must  why then said i i beg leave to ask mr williams one question that is whether his present parishioners do not respect and esteem him in that particular manner which i think every body must who knows his worth  i am very happy madam in the good will of all my parishioners and have great acknowlegements to make for their civilities to me  i dont doubt said i but it will be the same wherever you go for bad as the world is a prudent and good clergyman will never fail of respect but sir if you think your ministry among them is attended with good effects if they esteem your person with a preference and listen to your doctrines with attention methinks for their sakes it is pity to leave them were the living of less value as it is of more than the other for how many people are there who can benefit by one gentlemans preaching rather than anothers although possibly the ones abilities may be no way inferior to the others there is a great deal in a delivery as it is called in a way a manner a deportment to engage peoples attention and esteem and as you are already in possession of their esteem you are sure to do much of the good you aim and wish to do for where the flock loves the shepherd all his work is easy and more than half done and without that let him have the tongue of an angel and let him live the life of a saint he will be heard with indifference and oftentimes as his subject may be with disgust  i paused here but every one being silent as to the earls friendship sir continued i you are best judge what force that ought to have upon you and what i have mentioned would be the only difficulty with me were i in mr williams case to be sure it will be an high obligation upon his lordship and so he ought to think it that you quit a better living to oblige him and he will be bound in honor to make it up to you for i am far from thinking that a prudent regard to worldly interest misbecomes the character of a good clergyman and i wish all such were set above the world for their own sakes as well as for the sakes of their hearers since independency gives a man respect besides the power of doing good which will inhance that respect strengthen his influences and of consequence give greater efficacy to his doctrines  the countess mentioned hereupon the saying of dr fisher bishop of rochester who was beheaded in the reign of henry viii because he would not own the kings supremacy this prelate being offered a richer bishopric he would not accept of it saying he looked upon his bishopric as his wife and he should not think it excusable to part with his wife because she was poor this brought so many reflections upon the frequent translations and the earnestness with which richer bishoprics were sought after that i was very sorry to hear or think there was occasion for them and i did take the liberty to say that as mr b had observed the fault was in human nature and though it was an inexcusable one perhaps we that censured them might find it hard in their circumstances to resist the temptation  mr b said he wished for the sake of the clergy in general that there was a law against translations and that all the bishoprics in england were made equal in revenue for do we not see said he that the prelates almost to a man vote with power and by this means contribute not a little to make themselves and the whole body of a clergy so numerous and so deserving too as that of the church of england a byword to freethinkers of all denominations who are ever ready to take occasion to malign them and their venerable order  would you not asked lord davers have the two primacies distinguished in revenue  no said mr b the distinction of dignity and precedence would be enough if not too much for where there is but one pope the whole college of cardinals seventy in number are always looking up to and gaping after the chair and i would have no temptations laid in the way of good men to forfeit their characters and weaken their influences which are of so much consequence for examplesake to the public weal  i think said lord davers there was some reason for the celibacy of the clergy in the roman church at first although the inconveniences arising from it are too many and too obvious to wish the restraint so general for the provision for families and children furnishes so natural and so laudable a pretense to a clergyman to lay up all he can for them that their characters suffer not a little on that account  if we look round us said mr b and see how many good and worthy families are sprung from the clergy and look abroad and see what are too often the effects of celibacy in the roman church and the scandal worse than what we complain of ever thrown upon them even by bigots of their own communion we shall have sufficient reason to condemn the celibacy which that church enjoins besides a bad mind an oppressive or covetous nature will be the same whether married or single for have we not seen to what a scandalous height nepotism has been carried in that church and has not a pope of a private and narrow spirit done as much for his nephews and nieces and perhaps nearer relations under those names as he could have done for his sons and daughters so still here too we must resolve all into that common sewer of iniquity human nature and conclude that a truly good man will not do a bad thing upon any the nearest and most affecting considerations and that a bad man will never want a pretense to display his evil qualities nor flatterers neither if he has power to defend him for the worst he can do  i well remember the argument when i was at rome used to the pope on such an occasion his holiness declared against nepotism saying that he would never look upon the revenues of the church as the patrimony of his private family and forbad his numerous relations who on his promotion swarmed about him with faces as hungry as if they were so many northbritons traveling southward for preferment  that was mr bs word spoken pleasantly to think of him in any other light than that of the common father of all his people and as having no other relation but merit  this was setting out well you will say but what was the event  why two thirds of his relations rushed into orders directly and it was not long before parasites were found to represent to the holy father that it was a sin to deprive the church of so many excellent props and buttresses and that for the good of the public he ought to prefer them to the first dignities so that the good man overcome with their reasons and loath to continue in so great a sin graced the cardinalate with one the episcopate with half a dozen and the richest abbacies with a score or two and the emperor having occasion to make interest with his holiness found merit enough in some of the layrelations to create them princes and counts of the holy roman empire  but sir said i for i am always sorry to hear things said to the discredit of the clergy because i think it is of public concern that we venerate the function though not the failings of particulars have i not been a silent witness that you have made the same observations on a minister of state who though he shall be perhaps the first to blame this disposition in a clergyman will be equally ready to practice it himself to relations and children full as worthless to the exclusion of the worthy  so that sir this is all human nature still and should we not be tender in our censures of the one when we are so ready to acquit the other  there is this difference mrs b said the countess from the one we expect a better example from the other no example fit to be followed and this is one reason that makes a first minister generally so hated a thing because he resolves all considerations into self and is beloved by no body but those to whom he gives the overflowings of such benefits as he has not relations enough to heap them upon  well mr adams said i if i may be allowed to be so serious does not this show the excellency of the prayer we are taught by the supreme teacher and that part of it lead us not into temptation  for it seems too natural a consequence that no sooner are we tempted but we deliver up our selves to evil  right sister said lord davers and this ends in mr bs human nature again  what remains then said lady davers but that we take the world as we find it give praise to the good dispraise to the bad and every one try to mend one  yet i wish said mr b so overtender are many good clergymen of the failings they would not be guilty of in their brethren that we should avoid displeasing them if they were to know the freedom of this conversation though we are all so welldisposed to reverence their function  i hope otherwise said mr williams for it is but giving due praise and dispraise as my lady says and were evil actions to go uncensurd good ones would lose their reward and vice by being put upon a foot with virtue in this life would meet with too much countenance  but give me leave said lady davers to interpose a little in the matter we have departed from that of the curate and dispensation and when i have delivered my sentiments i insist upon it that mrs b will as freely give us hers as if i had been silent  dispensations are usual things mr williams may pay a young gentleman handsomely and the censure we have passed is only upon such as do not to a young man at first setting out a good curacy will be very acceptable if he has merit it will put him in a way of showing it and he may raise himself by it if he has not he will not deserve more and mr williams may marry perhaps and have a family to provide for his opportunities may not always be the same the earl may die and he should be excused to make the best use of his interest and favor for the very reason mrs b gave that as he is a good man it will strengthen his influences and come brother you know i am always for prescribing here is a worthy young gentleman in our eye that will not take it amiss to begin with a curacy and you shall give your dispensation previous to the legal one on condition that mr williams will permit you to present his curate and thus all will be solved  both the gentlemen bowed  and mr williams was going to speak but mr b said take my sister at her word pamela and if you have any thing to say to this scheme speak it freely as if her ladyship had been silent for i perceive by your downcast eye and silence you could say something if you would  ay pray do said my lady i love to hear you speak you always make me think of something i had not considered before  i am very loath to say anything on so nice a subject indeed it would not become me there is so much generosity and benevolence in my good ladys scheme that i ought not  ought not said my dearest friend interrupting me none of your ought nots i know you are always forming in your mind notions of right and wrong in the common cases of life let us therefore have your opinion in this matter more fully than you have hitherto given it and deliver it too without hesitation and with that ease and freedom that are born with you for i can tell you that when through the corruptions of human nature we lose the distinction of right and wrong i know not where we can better apply ourselves than to such as you to recover them  i bowed and said if you will have it so sir it must be so and i will then bespeak all your kind allowances casting my eye around me to each and tell you all i think upon this matter and when i have done submit my poor sentiments as becomes me to your superior judgments  thus then i would say  pardon me my lady for taking your ladyships words for my theme as i remember them and hardly any thing falls from your ladyship that i do not remember  that dispensations are usual things  i am sure i am going to display my ignorance because knowing nothing of their original or design i must presume them to be very ancient in this kingdom and introduced only when there were fewer clergymen than benefices was there ever such a time  they smiled  nay now you would command me sir to speak when i needed to do nothing else to expose my self there was a time as i have read that there were so few scholars that the benefit of clergy was allowed to some sort of criminals who could do no more than read because the commonwealth could so ill spare learned men  and might not there be a time then when dispensations were allowed to worthy men because it was difficult to find enough of such as deserved that character to fill the church preferments  tell us pamela said mr b whether you do not intend this as a satire upon the practice or is it really your pretty ignorance that has made you pronounce one of the severest censures upon it that could be thought of  i smiled and said indeed sir i think only some such reason or a worse must be the original of dispensations for is it right that one gentleman shall have two or three livings the duties of no more than one of which he can personally attend while so many are destitute of bread almost and exposed to contempt the too frequent companion of poverty and what though custom may have sanctified it to be sure that is all that can and a good man will not do all he may do without incurring a penalty because there is in every thing a right and a wrong and because be the custom what it will a man should regulate his actions by his conscience and the golden rule  my good lady says mr williams may pay a gentleman handsomely i dont doubt but mr williams would and this i am sorry to say it would be doing what is not so often done as one would wish but may i be permitted to ask for what would he pay the gentleman handsomely  why for doing that duty for him which in conscience and honor he ought to do himself and which when he takes institution and induction he engages solemnly to do and pray excuse me my dear everybody  that was my foolish word which made them smile  to what end is all this  only that the gentleman who does all the labor in the vineyard shall live upon  0  0 or  0 l per annum more or less while the gentleman who has best nothing but best interest another of my foolish phrases shall receive twice and perhaps three times the sum for doing nothing at all can any dispensation my dear friends make this a just or equitable thing indeed if the living be so poor as too many of them are that a man cannot comfortably and creditably subsist without putting two poor ones together to make one tolerable one that is another thing but pray now my good mr williams excuse me if mr adams can live on a curacy of  0 or  0 l a year cannot another gentleman live unless his rectory or vicarage bring him   or  00 mr adams may marry as well as mr williams and both i believe will find gods providence a better reliance than the richest benefice in england  a good curacy no doubt continued i may be a comfortable thing at setting out to a young gentleman but if here be a rectory or vicarage of  00 l a year for example for if it be of no more value than a good curacy he must be content is not that  00 l a year the reward for doing such and such labor and if this be the stated hire for this labor to speak in the scripture phrase is not the labourer worthy of his hire or is he that does not labor to go away with the greatest part of it  if the gentleman my lady is pleased to say has merit this curacy may put him in the way of showing it but does the manifestation of merit and the reward of it always go together   my lady is so good as to observe  but may i madam be excused   proceed proceed child  i shall only have a care of what i say before you for the future that is all  and i too said mr h  which made them smile  nay now my lady   proceed i tell you  i only wonder as my brother has said on another occasion where thou gottest all these equitable notions  my lady is so good as to observe proceeded i for they were pleased to be attentive that mr williams should make use of his opportunities i know her ladyship speaks this rather in generous indulgence to the usual practice than what always ought to be the chief consideration for if the earl should die may not some other friend arise to a gentleman of mr williamss merit  as to strengthening of a good mans influence which is a point always to be wished i would not say so much as i have done if i had not heard mr longman say and i am sure i heard it with great pleasure that the benefice mr williams so worthily enjoys is a clear   0 l a year  but after all does happiness to a gentleman a scholar a philosopher rest in a greater or lesser income  does it not rather rest in a happy competency or mediocrity suppose my dear mr b had  000 l a year added to his present large income would that increase his happiness that it would add to his cares is no question but could that addition give him one single comfort which he has not already and if the dear gentleman had   or  000 less might he be less happy on that account no surely for it would render a greater prudence on my humble part necessary and a nearer inspection and greater frugality on his own and he must be contented if he did not as now perhaps lay up every year so long as he lived within his income  and who will say that the obligation to greater prudence and economy is a misfortune  the competency therefore the golden mean is the thing and i have often considered the matter and endeavored to square my actions by that consideration for a person i have this notion dear sir from that manuscript poem you was pleased to show me of not preferring people above their native condition and which has been an excellent lesson to me for a person i was going to say who being not born to an estate is not satisfied with a competency will know no limits to his desires such a one that an acquisition of  00 or  00 l a year will not satisfy will not sit down contented with any sum although he may propose to himself at a distance that such and such an acquisition will be the height of his ambition yet he will as he approaches to that advance upon himself farther and farther  and know no bounds till the natural one is forced upon him and his life and his views end together  now let me humbly beg pardon of you all ladies and gentlemen said i turning my eye to each but most of you my good lady whose observations i have made so free with if you can forgive me it will be an instance of your goodness that i may hope for but hardly can expect will you my dear lady said i and laid my hand upon her ladyships in a supplicatory manner for she sat next me  i think not said her ladyship i think i ought not  should i brother can i my lord  ought i my lady countess  brother brother if you have been in any degree contributing to the excellency of this  what shall i call her how cunningly do you act to make her imbibe your notions and then utter them with such advantage that you have the secret pride to find your own sentiments praised from her mouth but i will forgive you both he it as it will for i am sure outdone as i am in thought word and deed and by so young a gypsey  that was her word it is by one that would outdo every body else as well as me only i would except your ladyship  none of your exceptions lady davers replied the countess  i know not in so young a lady whether i should most envy or admire her excellence  well but since i have the pleasure said i to find myself forgiven may i be indulged a few moments prattle more only just to observe that the state of the case i have given is but one side of the question that which a good clergyman in my humble opinion would choose to act but when we come to the other side what it would be kind we of the laity should think and act by them that is another thing for when we think of the hardships the clergy lie under more than almost any other body of men we shall see they are entitled to better usage than they often meet with  here in the first place a youth is sent to the university after a painful course to qualify him for it he endangers his health and impairs his constitution by hard study and a sedentary life and after he has passed such a number of years he is admitted into orders perhaps gets a small fellowship turns tutor a painful employment and his education having been designed for all his portion and that expended in it he at last by interest or favor gets a curacy or little living of  0  0 or  0 l a year if less so much the worse and is obliged to maintain himself in a genteel appearance out of that and be subject not seldom to the jests of buffoons and rakes at a great mans table where the parson is too often the butt to receive the supposed witty shafts of such as can allow themselves to say any thing if he marries which possibly too he is kept from contrary to his wishes of all men he is the least to follow his own liking since prudence too often obliges him to take the person his inclination would not  if children follow what melancholy views has he of providing for them did not his strong reliance on providence exercise his faith against worldly appearance  then has he too often to contend for his dues the produce of his poor income with churlish and ignorant spirits whom his function would make him wish to smooth and instruct who though they farm and pay to the landlord for no more than nine tenths of the lands they occupy hardly think it a sin to cheat the parson of his tithe who however has the same right to it by the laws of the land as the gentleman has to the estate or the tenant to the produce of his farm  this obliges the poor gentleman to live in a state of war among a people with whom both his duty and inclination would make him desirous to cultivate a good understanding and what benefits can result from his ministry in such a situation when the people to be instructed look upon him as an invader of their substance at the very time that they are robbing him of what is legally his  in the next place i presume to think that the clergy are too much looked upon by some as a detached body as i may say from the rest of the people and as persons acting upon a separate interest quite opposite to that of the laity when possibly that very churl who refuses them their right or would cheat them of it has a view to bring up one of his family to the church and hopes to get him provided for out of its revenues and are not the clergy moreover the fathers the sons the uncles the brothers of the laity who shall set themselves against their maintenance and must their education debar them of those comforts which it better qualifies them to enjoy and which it incapacitates them any other way to procure  what opportunity have not the laity in general of all degrees and ranks to make their lives easy and happy to what the clergy have here is a middling family with three or four sons suppose the fathers circumstances will allow him to bring up one to the law what opportunities has he unenvied to make a fortune another is brought up to trade if he has but tolerable success in the world in what ease and affluence does he support himself and provide for his family the physic line what fortunes are not raised in that and no body envies any of these but the son whose inclination shall lead him perhaps best to deserve and most to require an easy and comfortable subsistence and who ought wholly to appropriate himself to the duties of his function is grudged envied and treated as if he were not a son of the same family and had not a natural right and stake in the same commonwealth  there are it is true preferments and some great ones and honors too in the church but how few compared to the numbers of the clergy or to those livings which are so poor as can hardly set a man above penury and contempt  and how are those few engrossed by the descendants or dependants of the rich and powerful and what by commendams dispensations and suchlike contrivances how does one man of interest and address swallow up the provision which was designed for several as deserving perhaps at least as himself  for my good lady you have forgiven me and must not be displeased a gentlemans friends may die off and he must you know make the best use of his opportunities  o you dear saucebox as my brother calls you  how dare you by that arch pretty look triumph over me thus  let me brother give her a slap for this  i am sure she deserves it  i think she is a little insolent indeed lady davers  but to the case in hand there is so much truth in what pamela says of the hardships to which the clergy the inferior clergy particularly are subjected that i wonder any gentleman who can choose for himself and has no probable prospects should enter into orders under such discouragements  i humbly conceive sir said i that there can be but one good inducement and that is what the apostle hints at in the words  if in this life only we have hope we are of all men most miserable  well said mr b so much as this is their motive so much are they entitled to that better hope and may that better hope never deceive them  but i have the pleasure to acquaint this company that i had a mind only to hear what pamela who as i hinted talked to me learnedly on this very subject a few days ago would say when she came face to face to her two worthy friends mr williams and mr adams and so i desired mr williams would let her run on if i could set her into the subject  else my old acquaintance was resolved not to hold both livings since either he was so good as to say would afford him as handsome a provision as he wished for his only difficulty being about obliging the earl or whether he should not disoblige me if he complied with that noblemans request  indeed madam said mr williams this is the very case and after what i have heard from your ladyship so he called me i would not for the world have been of another mind nor have put it upon any other foot than i did  you are a good gentleman said i and i have such an opinion of your worthiness and the credit you do your character that i would sooner suspect my own judgment and so i ought than yours but pray sir what may i ask have you determined to do  why madam replied he i am staggered in that too by the observation your ladyship made that where a man has the love of his parishioners he ought not to think of leaving them  else sir i find you had rather inclined to oblige the earl though the living be of less value this is very noble sir it is more than generous  my dear said mr b i will tell you for mr williamss modesty will not let him speak it before all the company what is his motive and a worthy one you will say it is excuse me mr williams  for the reverend gentleman blushed  the earl has of late years  we all know his character  given himself up to carousing and he will suffer no man to go from his table sober mr williams has taken the liberty to expostulate as became his function with his lordship on this subject and upon some other irregularities in so agreeable a manner that the earl has taken a great liking to him and promises that he will suffer his reasonings to have an effect upon him and that he shall reform his whole household if he will come and live near him and regulate his table by his own example  the countess is a very good lady and privately presses mr williams to oblige the earl and this is our worthy friends main inducement with the hope which i should not forget to mention that he has of preserving untainted the morals of the two young gentlemen the earls sons who he fears will be carried away by the force of such an example and he thinks as the earls living has fallen mine probably will be better supplied than the earls if he as he kindly offers gives it me back again otherwise the earl as he apprehends will find out for his some gentleman if such an one can be found as will rather further than obstruct his own irregularities as was the unhappy case of the last incumbent  well said lady davers and so said the countess we shall always have the highest respect for mr williams for a conduct so genteel and so prudent but brother will you and will you mr williams put this whole affair in all its parts into mrs bs hands since you have such testimonies both of you of her rectitude of thinking and acting  with all my heart madam replied mr williams and i shall be proud of such a direction  what say you brother you are to suppose the living in your own hands again will you leave the whole matter to my sister here  come my dear says mr b let us hear how you would wish it to be ordered i know you have not need of one moments consideration when once you are mistress of a point  nay said lady davers that is not the thing i repeat my demand shall it be as mrs b lays it out or not  this is a weighty matter my good sister and bad as i have been i think patrons are accountable in a great measure for the characters of the persons they present and i do assure you that had i twenty livings in my gift i should think i ought not to prefer my brother to any one of them if his morals and character were not likely to do honor to the church as well as to my presentation and i expected to hear from pamela when she was enumerating the hardships of the clergy of that scandalous practice of some patrons who rob the regularlybred clergymen by pushing into orders some kinsman or friend or friends kinsman or friend when a living falls in let his character or qualifications be ever so faulty and defective i could name you several such instances that ought to make the ordainers as well as the ordained blush as were i to borrow one of pamelas serious inferences i would say it will one day make them both tremble when they come to give an account of the trusts committed to them  well says my lady i have a noble brother that is true what pity you ever were wicked at all but come and laid her hand upon mine this same good girl will be a blessing to you nay why say i will be she is and the greatest that mortal man can receive  but still i must have you put this matter into mrs bs hands  conditionally i will  provided i cannot give satisfactory reasons why i ought not to conform to her opinion for this as i said is a point of conscience with me and i made it so when i presented mr williams to the living and have not been deceived in that presentation  to be sure said i that is very reasonable sir and on that condition i shall the less hesitate to speak my mind because i shall be sure of being in no danger to commit an irreparable error  i know well lady davers added mr b the power your sex have over ours and their subtle tricks and so will never be drawn in in my weakest moments to make a blindfold promise there hve been several instances both in sacred and profane story of mischiefs done by such surprises so you must allow me to suspect myself when i know the dear sluts power over me and have been taught by the inviolable regard she pays to her own word to value mine  and now pamela speak all that is in your heart to say  well sir said i with your requisite condition in my eye i will but let me see that i state the matter right and preparative to it pray mr williams though you have not been long in possession of this living yet maybe you can compute what it is likely by what you know of it to bring in clear  madam said he by the best calculation i can make i thank you for it good sir it may one year with another be reckoned at  00 l per annum it is the best living within twenty miles of it having been improved within these two last years  if it was  00 l and would make you happier  for that sir is the thing i should wish it you said i and think it short of your merits but pray sir what is the earls living valued at  at about   0 l madam  well then replied i very pertly i believe now i have it  mr williams for motives most excellently worthy of his function inclines to surrender up to mr b his living of  00 l per annum and to accept of the earls living of   0 l per annum dear sir i am going to be very bold but under your condition nevertheless  let the gentleman to whom you shall present the living of f allow  0 l per annum out of it to mr williams till the earls favor shall make up the difference to him and no longer  and  but i dare not name the gentleman  for how dear sir were i to be so bold shall i part with my chaplain  admirable most admirable said lord and lady davers in the same words the countess praised the decision too and mr h with his let me be hanged and his before gads  and such exclamations natural to him made his plaudits  mr williams said he could wish with all his heart it might be so and mr adams was so abashed and surprised he could not hold up his head  but joy danced in his silent countenance for all that  mr b having hesitated a few minutes lady davers called out for his objection or consent according to condition and he said i cannot so soon determine as that prompt slut did i will withdraw one minute  he did so as i found afterward to advise like the considerate and genteel spirit he possesses with mr williams whom he beckoned out and to examine whether he was in earnest willing to give it up or had any body he was very desirous should succeed him telling him that if he had he thought himself obliged in return for his worthy behavior to him to pay a particular regard to his recommendation and so being answered as he desired in they came together again  but i should say that his withdrawing with a very serious aspect made me afraid i had gone too far and i said before they came in what shall i do if i have incurred mr bs anger by my overforwardness  did he not look displeased dear my ladies if he be so plead for me and i will withdraw when he comes in for i cannot stand his anger i have not been used to it  never fear you charming pamela said my lady he cannot be angry at any thing you say or do but i wish for the sake of what i have been witness to of mr adamss behavior and modesty that such a thing could be done for him  mr adams bowed and said oh my good ladies it is too too considerable a thing  i cannot expect it  i do not  it would be presumption if i did  just then reenterd mr b and mr williams the first with a stately air the other with a more peaceportending smile on his countenance  but mr b sitting down well pamela said he very gravely i see that power is a dangerous thing in any hand  sir sir said i  my dear lady whispering to lady davers i will withdraw as i said i would  and i was getting away as fast as i could but he arose and coming up to me took my hand why is my charmer so soon frightened said he most kindly and still more kindly with a noble air pressed it to his lips  i must not carry my jest too far upon a mind so apprehensive as i otherwise might be inclined to do and leading me to mr adams and mr williams he said taking mr williamss hand with his left as he held mine in his right your worthy brother clergyman mr adams gives me leave to confirm the decision of my dear spouse and you are to thank her for the living of f upon the condition she proposed and may you give but as much satisfaction there as you have done in this family and as mr williams has given to his flock and they will then after a while be pleased as much with your ministry as they have hitherto been with his  mr adams trembled with joy and begged leave to withdraw  i cannot  i cannot said he  bear  bear  this excess of goodness and he retired with an air of gratitude and transport in his countenance which words cannot equally express  this affected me a good deal as it did all the company but i was still more affected when mr b said here my dear thank good mr williams for inabling you to give such a shining proof of your excellence and remember that whenever i put any power into your hands for the future you keep this happy instance in mind and in every thing that offers i shall then have no will nor choice but yours  could i avoid my dear miss being thus nobly more than generously  what shall i do for a word to express my sense of his graciousness to me  could i avoid i say doing a weak thing without regarding the presence i was in i fell on my knees to him and kissed his dear hand how shall i  how shall i said i  oppressed with your hourly goodness  find words  but oh forgive me meanings crowd so thick upon me that my words patting my bosom with my other hand stick here just here  and i cannot   and indeed i could say no more and he in the delicacy of his apprehensiveness for me clasped his kind arms about me and withdrew with me into the next parlour and placed himself by me on the settee putting my face on his generous breast and said take care take care my best beloved that the joy which overflows your dear heart for having done a beneficent and a noble action to a deserving gentleman does not affect you too much you have no body just now my dear life added he your spirit has absorbed it all but you must descend or what will become of me and take care you dont do it too precipitately for a circumstance so delicate and so delightful to me  my lady davers followed us where is my angel sister where is my noble brother said she rest her dear head on my bosom for i have a share in her next to yourself and return to a company where you will not find a dry eye nor an opening lip but looking upon one another in speechless rapture at the exalted scene you have exhibited between you  my dear mr b delighted with every occasion that makes for my honor and to endear me to his beloved sister said take care then of my jewel and let her dear face adorn the bosom of a lady i love next to herself and rising went into the great parlour  i would have stood up but quite abashed at my recollected behavior before so many witnesses and confounded with the goodness of such a brother and such a sister my feet were unwilling to support me and my dear lady davers o miss what a happy pamela is your friend what a happy daughter my dear father and mother  clasped me in her arms and to her bosom and kissed me five or six times running over with expressions of favor and goodness in a style and words i cannot repeat for she is mistress of a flowery rhetoric and has such a charming gift of utterance that could i but half equal her when she thus loftily soars i should deserve the compliments she made me  coffee being ready lady davers led me to the great withdrawing room and we were joined by all the company and mr adams too and my lord davers was pleased to make me several fine compliments and so did mr h after his manner but the countess exceeded herself in goodness  mr williams seemed so pleased and so elated with the deserved acceptance his worthy conduct had met with that it showed he was far from repenting at the generous turn the matter had taken in favor of mr adams on the contrary he congratulated him upon it telling him he would introduce him when his generous patron thought proper to his new parishioners and would read prayers for him at his first preaching and i think mr adams said he since this happy affair has been brought about from the conversation upon dispensations you and i both by our examples and our arguments must on all occasions discredit that practice since as my lady has observed gods providence is a better reliance than the richest benefice in england and since as her ladyship has also observed we ought not to look beyond a happy competency as if in this life only we had hope  my lady said mr adams has given me many lessons relating to different parts of my duty both as a christian and a clergyman that will not only furnish me with rules for my future conduct but with subjects for the best sermons i shall ever be able to compose  mr b was pleased to say it is a rule with me not to leave till tomorrow what can be done today and when my dear do you propose to dispense with mr adamss good offices in your family or did you intend to induce him to go to town with us  i had not proposed any thing sir as to that for i had not asked your kind direction but the good dean will supply us i doubt not and when we set out for london mr adams will be at full liberty with his worthy friend mr williams to pursue the happy scheme which your goodness has permited to take effect  mr adams my dear who came last from the university can perhaps recommend such another young gentleman as himself for your domestic duties  i looked it seems a little grave and mr b said what have you to offer pamela what have i said amiss  amiss dear sir   ay and dear madam too i see by your bashful seriousness in place of that smiling approbation which you always show when i utter any thing you entirely approve that i have said something which would rather meet with your acquiescence than choice so as i have often told you none of your reserves and never hesitate to me your consent in any thing while you are sure i will conform to your wishes or pursue my own liking as either shall appear reasonable to me when i have heard your reasons  why then dear sir what i had presumed to think but i submit it to your better judgment was whether as the gentleman who is so kind as to direct our family duties in some measure acts in the province of the worthy dean it were not right that our own parish minister whether here or at london should name or at least approve our naming the gentleman  why could not i have thought of that as well as you saucebox lady davers i am entirely on your side i think she deserves a slap now for us both  i will forgive her said my lady since i find her sentiments and actions as much a reproach to others as to me  mr williams did you ever think said mr b it would have come to this did you ever know such a saucy girl in your life  already to give herself these reproaching airs  no never if your honor is pleased to call the most excellent lady in the world by such a name nor any body else  pamela i charge you said the dear gentleman if you study for it be sometimes in the wrong that one may not always be taking lessons from such an assurance but in our turns have something to teach you  then dear sir said i must i not be a strange creature for how when you and my good ladies are continually giving me such charming examples can i do a wrong thing  mr h said let him be hanged if he would not marry as soon as ever he could get any body to have him  foolish fellow said lady davers do think that thou wilt meet with such a wife as that when thou marryest  why not madam  for if i am not so good as mr b now is i have not been so bad neither as he was formerly excuse me sir and so i may stand a chance  a chance said my lady  that is like thee  did ever hear of such an one as she  i never said he and fell a laughing saw such an one i own and take that my good lady for calling me foolish fellow  there is not the reproach in thy answer that thou intendest except to thy own grinning insolence said her ladyship severe enough but smiling that makes thee think that a reflection that is none in this case  egad madam youre always hard upon me i can say nothing to please you while every body else gives and receives compliments i can come in for nothing but foolish fellow with your ladyship  nephew said my lord laughing i think you come in for a large part and a facetious one too for when youre present and conversation takes a serious turn you make an excellent character to set us all a laughing  he got up and bowed very low i thank your lordship  you might as well have called me a jackpudden in plain words  but then i would have looked upon you all as so many mountebanks  there i have you said he and fell a laughing  the countess shuddering said dear dear mr h be silent i beseech you whenever we are serious for you tear one from the feast of souls to the froth of bodies  was not that a fine rebuke miss is not this a charming lady  i hope miss you will forgive me for being so tedious on the aforegoing subject and its most agreeable conclusion it is an important one because several persons as conferrers or receivers have found their pleasure and account in it and it would be well if conversation were often attended with like happy consequences i have one merit to plead in behalf even of my prolixity that in the delightful conferences i have the pleasure of holding with our noble guests and mr b although several which i omit may be more worthy of recital than those i give yet am i careful not to write twice upon one topic so that you have as much variety from me as the nature of the facts and cases will admit of  but here i will conclude having a very different subject as a proof of what i have advanced to touch in my next till when i am  your most affectionate and faithful p b  letter xxxi my dear miss i now proceed with my journal which i brought down to tuesday evening and of course i begin with  wednesday toward the evening came sir jacob swynford on horseback attended by two servants in liveries i was abroad for i had got leave for a whole afternoon attended by my polly which time i passed in visiting no less than four several poor sick families whose hearts i made glad but i should be too tedious were i to give you the particulars and besides i have a brief list of cases which when you will favor me with your company i may show you for i have obliged myself see vol ii p      though not desired to keep an account of what i do with no less than  00 l a year that my dear mr b allows me to expend in acts of charity and benevolence  lady davers told me afterward that sir jacob carried it mighty stiff and formal when he alighted he strutted about the courtyard in his boots with his whip in his hand and though her ladyship went to the great door in order to welcome him he turned short and whistling followed the groom into the stable as if he had been at an inn only instead of taking off his hat pulling its broad brim over his eyes for a compliment in she went in a pet as she says saying to the countess a surly brute he always was my uncle he is more of an hostler than a gentleman i am resolved i will not stir to meet him again and yet the wretch loves respect from others though he never practices common civility himself  the countess said she was glad he was come for she loved to divert herself with such odd characters nowandthen  and now let me give you a short description of him as i found him when i came in that you may the better conceive what sort of a gentleman he is  he is about sixtyfive years of age a coarse strong bigbond gentleman with large irregular features he has a haughty supercilious look a swaggering gait and a person not at all bespeaking ones favor in behalf of his mind and his mind as you shall hear byandby not clearing up those prepossessions in his disfavour with which his person and features at first impress one his voice is big and surly his eyes little and fiery his mouth large with what teeth he has left ground down as it seemed even with his manycolourd gums as if by constant use but with all these imperfections he has an air that sets him somewhat above the mere vulgar and such as makes one think that half his disadvantages are rather owing to his own haughty humor than to nature for he seems to be a perfect tyrant at first sight a man used to prescribe and not to be prescribed to and has the advantage of a shrewd penetrating look which yet methinks seems rather acquired than natural  after he had seen his horses well served and put on an oldfashioned goldbuttond coat which by its freshness showed he had been very chary of it a better wig but in stiff buckle and a long sword stuck stiffly as if through his coat lappets in he came and with an imperious air entering the parlour what nobody come to meet me said he and saluting her ladyship how do you do niece and looked about haughtily she says as if he expected to see me  my lady presenting the countess said the countess of c sir jacob  o cry mercy said he  your most obedient humble servant madam i hope his lordship is well  at your service sir jacob  i wish he was said he bluntly he should not have voted as he did last sessions i can tell you that  why sir jacob said she servants dont always in this free kingdom do as their masters would have em  mine do i can tell you that madam  right or wrong sir jacob  it cannot be wrong if i command them  why truly sir jacob there is many a private gentleman carries it higher to a servant than he cares his prince should to him but i thought till now twas the king only could do no wrong  but madam i always take care to be right  a good reason  because i dare say you never think you can be in the wrong  your ladyship should spare me i am but just come off a journey let me turn myself about and i will be up with you never fear madam but where is my nephew lady davers and where is your lord i was told you were all here and young h too upon a very extraordinary occasion so i was willing to see how causes went among you and what you were about it will be long enough before you come to see me  my brother and lord davers and mr h are all rid out together  well niece strutting with his hands behind him and his head held up  ha  he has made a fine kettle on it  hant he  sblood that was his profligate word that ever such a rake should be so caught  they tell me she is plaguey cunning and quite smart and handsome  but i wish his father were but living  yet what could he have done he was always unmanageable but i wish he would been my son  by my faith i do  what i hope niece he locks up his baby while youre here you dont keep her company do you  yes sir jacob replied my lady i do and you will not scruple to do so too when you see her  why thou countenancest him in his folly child i would a better opinion of thy spirit thou married to a lord and thy brother to a  can tell me what barbara if thou can prythee do  to an angel and so you will say when you see her  what do think i shall look through his foolish eyes  what a disgrace to a family ancienter than the conquest  o tempora o mores what will this world come to  the countess was diverted with this odd gentleman but run on in my praise for fear he should say some rude things to me when i came in and lady davers seconded her but all it seems signified nothing he would tell us both his mind let the young whelp that was his word take it as he would and pray said he cannot i see this fine body before he comes in let me but turn her round two of three times and ask her a question or two and by her answers i shall know what to think of her in a twinkling  she is gone to take a little airing sir jacob and will not be back till suppertime  suppertime why she is not to sit down at table is she if she does i will not that is positive  but now you talk of supper what have you  i must have a boiled chicken and shall eat it all myself  who is housekeeper now i suppose all is turned upside down  no there is not one new servant except a girl that waits upon her own person all the old servants are continued  that is much these creatures generally take as great state upon em as a born lady and they are in the right if they can make the man stoop to the great point they will hold his nose to the grindstone never fear and all the little ones come about in course  well sir jacob when you see her you will alter your mind  never never that is positive  ay sir jacob i was as positive as you once but i love her now as well as if she was my own sister  o hideous hideous  tell it not in gath for thou wilt make the daughters of philistia triumph all the fools that he has made wherever he has traveled will clap their hands at him and at you too if you talk at this rate  but let me speak to mrs jervis if she be here i will order my own supper  so he went out saying he knew the house though in a better mistresss days  the countess said if mr b kept his temper as she hoped he would there would be good diversion with the old gentleman  o yes said my lady my brother will i dare say he despises this surly brute too much to be angry at him let him say what he will  he went and talked a great deal against me to mrs jervis you may guess miss that she launched out in my praises and he was offended at her and said woman woman forbear these illtimed praises her births a disgrace to our family what my sisters waitingmaid taken upon charity i cannot bear it  i mention all these things as the ladies afterward told them to me because it shall prepare you to judge what a fine time i was likely to have of it  when mr b and my lord davers and mr h came home which they did about half an hour after six they were told who was there just as they entered the parlour and mr b smiled at lord davers and entering  sir jacob said he welcome to bedfordshire and thrice welcome to this house i rejoice to see you  my lady says never was so odd a figure as the old baronet made when thus accosted he stood up indeed but as mr b offered to take his hand he put em both behind him  not that you know of sir  and then looking up at his face and down at his feet three or four times successively  are you my brothers son that very individual son that your good father used to boast of and say that for handsome person true courage noble mind was not to be matched in any three counties in england  the very same dear sir that my honored fathers partiality used to think he never praised enough  and what is all of it come to at last  he paid well did he not to teach you to know the world  ads life nephew had thou been a born fool or a raw greenhead or a doting greyhead   what then sir jacob  what then  why then thou would have done just as thou have done  come come sir jacob you know not my inducements you know not what an angel i have in person and mind your eyes shall byandby be blessed with the sight of her your ears with hearing her speak  and then you will call all you have said profanation  what is it i hear what is it i hear  you talk in the language of romance and from the housekeeper to the head of the house youre all starkstaring mad by my soul nephew i wish for thy own credit thou were  but what signifies wishing  i hope you will not bring your siren into my company  yes i will sir because i love to give you pleasure and say not a word more for your own sake till you see her  you will have the less to unsay sir jacob and the less to repent of  the devil  i am in an enchanted castle that is certain what a plague has this little witch done to you all  and how did she bring it about  the ladies and lord davers laughed it seems and mr b begging him to sit down and answer him some family questions he said for it seems he is very captious at times what a devil am i to be laughed at lord davers i hope youre not bewitched too are you  indeed sir jacob i am my sister b is my doatingpiece  whew whistled he with a wild stare and how is it with you youngster  with me sir jacob said mr h i would give all i am worth in the world and ever shall be worth for such another wife  he ran to the window and throwing up the sash looking into the courtyard said hollo  soho  groom  jack  jonas  get me my horse  i will keep no such company  i will be gone why jonas calling again  youre not in earnest sir jacob said mr b  i am by my soul  i will away to the village this night why youre all upon the highgame  i will  but who comes here  for just at that instant the chariot brought me into the courtyard  who is this who is she  one of my daughters started up the countess my youngest daughter jenny  she is the pride of my family sir jacob  by my soul said he i was running for i thought it was the grand inchantress  out stepped lady davers to me dear pamela said she humor all that is said to you here is sir jacob come youre the countess of c  s youngest daughter jenny  that is your cue  ah but madam said i lady jenny is not married  looking before i thought on a circumstance that i think too much of sometimes though i carry it off as well as i can  she laughed at my exception come lady jenny said she for i just then entered the great door i hope you have had a fine airing  a very pretty one madam said i as i entered the parlour this is a pleasant country lady davers  wink when i am wrong whispered i  where is mrs b  then as seeing a strange gentleman i started half back into a more reserved air and made him a low courtsy  sir jacob looked as if he did not know what to think of it now at me now at mr b  but the dear gentleman put him quite out of doubt by taking my hand well lady jenny did you meet my fugitive in your tour  no mr b said i did she go my way i told you i would keep the great road  lady jenny c  said mr b presenting me to his uncle a charming creature added the dear gentleman have you never a son worthy of such an alliance  ay marry nephew this is a lady indeed why the plague whispered he could you not have pitched your tent here  miss by your leave and saluting me turned to the countess by my soul madam you have a charming daughter had my rash nephew seen this lovely creature and you would have condescended he would never have stooped to the cottage as he has done  youre right sir jacob returned mr b but i always ran too fast for my fortune yet these ladies of family never bring out their jewels into batchelors company and when too late we see what we have missed we are vexed at our precipitation  well said however boy by my soul i wish thee repentance though it is out of thy power to amend be that one of thy curses when thou see this lady as i make no doubt it is  again taking my hand and surveying me from head to foot and turning me round which it seems is a mighty practice with him to a strangerlady and a modest one too you will say miss  why truly youre a charming creature miss  lady jenny i would say  by your leave once more  upon my soul my lady countess she is a charmer  but  but  staring at me are you married madam  i looked a little silly and my new mamma came up to me and took my hand why jenny you are dressed oddly to day  what a hoop you wear it makes you look i cannot tell how  upon my soul madam i thought so what signifies lying  but it is only the hoop i see  really and truly lady jenny your hoop is enough to make half an hundred of our sex despair for fear you should be married i thought it was something few ladies escape my notice i always kept a good lookout for i have two daughters of my own but it is the hoop i see plainly enough you are so slender every where but here putting his hand upon my hip which quite dashed me and i retired behind my lady countesss chair  fie sir jacob said mr b before us young gentlemen to take such liberties with a maiden lady  you give a bad example  hang him that sets you a bad example nephew but i see youre right i see lady jennys a maiden lady or she would not have been so shamefaced i will swear for her on occasion ha ha ha  i am sure repeated he she is a maiden  for our sex give the married ladies a freer air in a trice  how sir jacob said lady davers  o fie said the countess  cannot you praise the maiden ladies but at the expense of the married ones what do you see of freedom in me  or in me said lady davers  nay for that matter you are very well ladies i must needs say  but will you pretend to blush with that virgin rose  will ye ods my life miss  lady jenny i would say taking my hand come from behind your mammas chair and you two ladies stand up now together  there so you do  why now blush for blush and lady jenny shall be three to one and a deeper crimson by half look you there look you there else an hundred guineas to one against the field  then stamping with one foot and lifting up his hands and eyes  o christ lady jenny has it all to nothing  by my soul she has  ha ha ha  you may well sit down both of you but youre a blush too late i can tell ye that  well have thou done lady jenny  i was hastening away and he said but let us see you again miss for now i will stay if they bring nobody else  and away i went for i never was more out of countenance  what a strange creature thought i is this  supper being near ready he continued calling out for lady jenny for he said the sight of her did him good but he was resolved he would not sit down at table with somebody else  the countess said she would fetch her daughter and stepping out returned saying mrs b understands that sir jacob is here and that he does not choose to see her so she begs to be excused and my jenny and she desire to sup together  the very worst tidings i have heard this twelvemonth why nephew let your girl sup with any body so we may have lady jenny back with us   i know said the countess who was desirous to see how far he would carry it jenny will not leave mrs b so if you see one you must see the other  nay then if it must be so i must sit down contented  but yet i should be glad to see lady jenny that i should but i will not sit down at table with mr bs girl  that is positive  well well let em sup together and there is an end of it said mr b  i see my uncle has as good a judgment as any body of fine ladies  that i have nephew  but he cannot forego his humor in compliment to the finest lady in england  consider nephew consider  it is not thy doing a foolish thing and calling a girl wife shall cram a niece down my throat that is positive the moment thy girl comes down to take place of these ladies i am gone that is most certain  well then shall i go up and oblige pamela to sup by herself and persuade lady jenny to come down to us  with all my soul nephew  a good motion  but pamela  did you say  a queer sort of name i have heard of it somewhere  is it a christian or a pagan name  linseywolsey  half one half the other  like thy girl  ha ha ha  let me be hanged whispered mr h to his aunt if sir jacob has not a power of wit though he is so whimsical with it i like him much  but hark ye nephew said sir jacob as mr b was going out of the parlour  one word with you dont fob upon us your girl with the pagan name for lady jenny i have set a mark upon her and should know her from a thousand although she had changed her hoop  then he laughed again and said he hoped lady jenny would come  and come without any body with her  but i smell a plot said he  by my soul i will not stay if they both come together i will not be put upon  but here comes one or both  where is my whip  i will go  indeed mr b i had rather have staid with mrs b  said i as i entered  as he had bid me  it is she it is she  you have no body behind you  no she has not  why now nephew youre right i was afraid you would have put a trick upon me  you would rather repeated he have stayed with mrs b  yes i warrant  but you shall be placed in better company my dear child  sister said mr b will you be pleased to take that chair for pamela does not choose to give my uncle disgust who so seldom comes to see us  my lady took the upper end of the table and i sat next below my new mamma so jenny said she how have you left mrs b  a little concerned said i  but she was the easier as mr b himself desired i would come down  my lord davers sat next me and sir jacob said shall i beg a favor of you my lord to let me sit next to lady jenny  mr b said will not it be better to sit over against her uncle  ay that is right in faith nephew thou know what is right well so i will  he accordingly removed his seat and i was very glad of it for though i was sure to be stard at sufficiently by him yet i was afraid if he sat next me he would not keep his hands off my hoop  he run on a deal in my praises after his manner but so rough at times that he gave me pain  after supper the gentlemen sat down to their bottle and the ladies and i withdrew and about twelve they broke up sir jacob talking of nothing but lady jenny and wishing mr b had married so happily as with such a charming creature one he said that carried tokens of her high birth in her face and whose every feature and look showed her nobly descended  they let him go to bed with his mistake but the countess said next morning she thought she never saw a greater instance of stupid pride and churlishness and she should be sick of the advantage of birth or ancestry if this was the natural fruit of it for a man said her ladyship to come to his nephews house and to suffer the mistress of it as he thinks to be closetted up and not permitted to appear in order to humor his absurd and brutal insolence and to behave as he has done is such a ridicule upon the pride of descent that i shall think of it as long as i live o mrs b said she what advantages have you over every one that sees you but most over those who pretend to treat you unworthily  i expect to be called to breakfast every minute and shall then perhaps see how this matter will end i wish when it is revealed he is not in a fury and think himself imposed on i fear it will not end so well as i wish for every body seems to be grave and angry at sir jacob  thursday i now proceed with my tale at breakfasttime when every one was sat and a chair left for me sir jacob began to call out for lady jenny but said he i will have none of your girl nephew although the chair at the teatable is left for somebody no said mr b well get lady jenny to supply mrs bs place as you dont care to see her  with all my heart replied he  but uncle said mr b have you really no desire no curiosity to see the girl i have married no none at all by my soul  just then i came in and paying my compliments to the company and to sir jacob shall i said i supply mrs bs place in her absence and down i sat  after breakfast and the servants were withdrawn lady jenny said lady davers you are a young lady who have all the advantages of birth and descent and some of the best blood in the kingdom runs in your veins and here sir jacob swynford is your great admirer cannot you from whom it will come with a double grace convince him that he does an unkind thing at my brothers house to keep the person my brother has thought worthy of making the mistress of it out of company and let us know your opinion whether my brother himself does right to comply with such an unreasonable distaste  why how now lady davers this from you i did not expect it  my uncle said mr b is the only person in the kingdom that i would have humoured thus and i made no doubt when he saw how willing i was to oblige him in so high a point he would have acted a more generous part than he has yet done but lady jenny what say you to my sisters questions  if i must speak my mind replied i i should take the liberty to be very serious with sir jacob and to say that when a thing is done and cannot be helped he should take care how he sows the seeds of indifference and animosity between man and wife and how he makes a gentleman dissatisfied with his choice and perhaps unhappy as long as he lives  nay miss said he if all are against me and you whose good opinion i value more than all you may even let the girl come and sit down if you will  if she is but half as pretty and half as wise and modest as you i shall as it cannot be helped as you say be ready to think better of the matter for it is a little hard i must needs say if she has hitherto appeared before all the good company to have her kept out of the way on my account  really sir jacob said the countess i have blushed for you more than once on this occasion but the mistress of this house is more than half as wise and modest and lovely and in hopes you will return me back some of the blushes i have lent you see there in my daughter jenny whom you have been so justly admiring the mistress of the house and the lady with the pagan name  sir jacob sat aghast looking at one and at another and at me each in turn and then cast his eyes on the floor  at last up he got and swore a sad oath and am i thus tricked and bamboozled that was his word am i  there is no bearing this house nor her presence now that is certain and i will be gone  mr b looking at me and nodding his head toward sir jacob as he was in a flutter to be gone i arose from my chair and went to him and took his hand i hope sir jacob you will be able to bear both when you shall see that there is no other difference but that of descent between the supposed lady jenny whom you so kindly praised and the girl your dear nephew has so much exalted  let me go said he i am most confoundedly bit  i cannot look you in the face  by my soul i cannot  for it is impossible you should forgive me  indeed it is not sir you have done nothing but what i can forgive you for if your dear nephew can for to him was the wrong if any and i am sure he can overlook it  and for his sake to the uncle of so honored a gentleman to the brother of my late good lady i can with a bent knee thus ask your blessing and desire your excuse for joining to keep you in this suspense  bless you  o christ said he and stamped  who can choose but bless you and he kneeled down and wrapped his arms about me  but curse me that was his strange word if ever i was so touched before  my dear mr b for fear my spirits should be too much affected for the rough baronet in his transport had bent me down lower than i kneeled came to me and held me by my arm but let sir jacob raise me only saying how does my angel now she has made this conquest she has completed all her triumphs  angel did you call her  by my soul i am confounded with her goodness and her sweet carriage  rise and let me see if i can stand myself  and believe me i am sorry i have acted so much like a bear as i have done and the more i think of it the more i shall be ashamed of myself  and the tears as he spoke ran down his rough cheeks which moved me a good deal for to see a man with so rough and so hard a countenance weep was a touching sight  mr h putting his handkerchief to his eyes his aunt said what is the matter jackey  the matter answered he i dont know how the d  l it is  but here is strange doings as ever i knew  for here day after day ones ready to cry without knowing whether it be for joy or sorrow  what a plagues the matter with me i wonder  and out he went the two ladies whose charming eyes too glistend with pleasure smiling at the effect the scene had upon mr h and at what he said  well madam said sir jacob approaching me for i had sat down but then stood up  you will forgive me and from my heart i wish you joy by my soul i do  and saluted me  i could not have believed there had been such a person breathing i dont wonder at my nephews loving you  and you call her sister lady davers dont you  if you do i will own her for my niece  dont i  yes i do said her ladyship coming to me and am proud so to call her and this i tell you for your comfort though to my own shame that i used her worse than you have done before i knew her excellence and have repented of it ever since  i bowed to her ladyship  and kissing her hand  my dearest lady said i you have made me rich amends since i am sure i may say that it was good for me that i was afflicted  why nephew she has the fear of god i perceive before her eyes too i am sure i have heard those words they are somewhere in the scripture i believe  why who knows but she may be a means to save your soul  hay you know  ay sir jacob said mr b she will be a means to save an hundred souls and might go a great way to save yours if you were to live with her but one month  well but nephew i hope you forgive me too for now i think of it i never knew you take any matter so patiently in my life  i knew said the dear gentleman that every extravagance you insisted upon was heightening my charmers triumph and increasing your own contrition and as i was not indeed deprived of her company i could bear with every thing you said or did  yet dont you remember that i cautioned you that the less you said against her the less you would have to unsay and the less to repent of  i do and let me ride out and call myself to account for all i said against her in her own hearing and when i can think of but one half and how she has taken it by my soul i believe twill make me more than half mad  at dinner when we had mr williamss company the baronet told me he admired me now as much as he did when he thought me lady jenny but complained of the trick put upon him by us all and seemed nowandthen a little serious upon it  he took great notice of the dexterity which he imputed to me in performing the honors of the table and every nowandthen he lifted up his eyes god take me very clever by my soul  why madam you seem to me to be born to these things  i will be helped by nobody but you  and you will have a task of it i can tell you for i have a whipping stomach and were there fifty dishes i always taste of every one and indeed john was in a manner wholly employed in going to and fro between the baronet and me for half an hour together  he went from us afterward to mrs jervis and made her answer him abundance of questions about me and how all these matters had come about as he phrased it and returning when we drank coffee said i have been confabbing that was his word with mrs jervis about you niece by my soul i never heard the like she tells me you can play on the spinnet and sing too will you let a body have a tune or so my mab can play pretty well and so can dolly  i am a judge of music and would fain hear you i said if he was a judge i should be afraid to play before him but i would not be asked twice when we had taken our coffee  accordingly he repeating his request i gave him a tune and sung to it ods my life said he you do it purely  but i see where it is  my girls have got my fingers and then he held both hands out and a fine pair of paws showed he  plague on it they touch two keys at once but those slender and nimble fingers how they sweep along my eye cannot follow em  whew  whistled he  they are here and there and everywhere at once  why nephew i believe you have put another trick upon me my niece is certainly of quality and report has not done her justice  one more tune one more song  by my faith your voice goes sweetly to your fingers slife  i will thresh my jades  that was his polite phrase when i come home  lady davers you know not the money they have cost me to qualify them and here is a mere baby to them outdoes em by a bars length without any expense at all bestowed upon her go over that again  confound me for a puppy i lost it by my prating  ay there you have it  that is it by my soul it is oh that i could but dance as well as thou singst i would give you a saraband as old as i am  after supper we fell into a conversation of which i must give you some account because it was upon a topic that mr b has been blamed for in his marrying me and which has stuck by some of his friends even after they have in kindness to me acquitted him in every other respect and that is the example that he has set to young gentlemen of family and fortune to marry beneath them  it was begun by sir jacob who said i am in love with my new niece that i am but still one thing sticks with me in this affair and that is what will become of degree or distinction if this practice of gentlemen marrying their mothers waitingmaids excuse me madam should come into vogue already young ladies and young gentlemen are too apt to be drawn away in this manner and to disgrace their family we have too many instances of this you will forgive me both of you  that said lady davers is the only thing  i must needs say sir jacob has hit upon the point that would make one wish this example had not been set by a gentleman of such an ancient family till one comes to be acquainted with this dear creature and then every body thinks it ought not to be otherwise than it is  ay pamela said mr b what can you say to this cannot you defend me from this charge this is a point that has been often objected to me try for one of your pretty arguments in my behalf  indeed sir replied i looking down it becomes not me to say any thing to this  but indeed it does if you can and i beg you will help me to some excuse if you have any at hand  will not you sir dispense with me on this occasion indeed i know not what to say indeed i should not if i may judge for myself speak one word to this subject  for it is my absolute opinion that degrees in general should be kept up although i must always deem the present case an happy exception to the rule  mr b looking as if he still expected i should say something will not you sir dispense with me repeated i indeed i should not speak to this point if i may be my own judge  i always intend my dear you shall judge for yourself and you know i seldom urge you farther when you use those words but if you have any thing upon your mind to say let us have it for your arguments are always new and unborrowd  i would then if i must sir ask if there be not a nation or if there has not been a law in some nation that whenever a young gentleman be his degree what it would has seduced a poor creature be her degree what it would obliges the gentleman to marry that unhappy person  i think there is such a law in some country i cannot tell where said sir jacob  and do you think sir whether it be so or not that it is equitable it should be so  yes by my troth  though i must needs own if it were so in england many men that i know would not have had the wives they now have  you speak to your knowledge i doubt not sir jacob said mr b  why indeed  why truly  i dont know but i do  all then said i that i would infer is whether another law would not be a still more just and equitable one that the gentleman who is repulsed from a principle of virtue and honor should not be censured for marrying a person he could not seduce and whether it is not more for both their honors if he does inasmuch as it is nobler to reward a virtue than to repair a shame were that shame to be repaired by matrimony which i take the liberty to doubt but i beg pardon you commanded me sir  else this subject should not have found a speaker to it in me  this is admirably said  by my soul it is said sir jacob  but yet this comes not up to the objection said mr b the setting an example to waitingmaids to aspire and to young gentlemen to descend and i will enter into the subject myself and the rather because as i go along i will give sir jacob a faint sketch of the merit and character of my pamela of which he cannot be so well informed as he has been of the disgrace which he imagined i had brought upon myself by marrying her  in order to this give me leave to say that i think it necessary that as well those persons who are afraid the example should be taken as those who are inclined to follow it should take all the material parts of it into their consideration otherwise i think the precedent may be justly cleared and the fears of the one be judged groundless and the plea of the other but a pretense in order to cover a folly into which they would have fallen whether they had this example or not  for instance in order to lay claim to the excuses which my conduct if i may suppose it of force enough to do either good or hurt will furnish it is necessary  that the object of their wish should be a girl of exquisite beauty and that not only in their own blinded and partial judgments but in the opinion of every one who sees her friend or foe in order to justify the force that the first attractions have upon him  that she be descended of honest and conscientious though poor and obscure parents who having preserved their integrity through great trials and afflictions have by their examples as well as precepts laid deep in the girls mind the foundations of piety and virtue  it is necessary that to the charms of person this waitingmaid should have an humble teachable mind fine natural parts a sprightly yet inoffesive wit a temper so excellent and a judgment so solid as should promise for her by the love and esteem these qualities should attract to herself from her fellow servants superior and inferior that she would become an higher station and be respected in it  it is necessary that after so good a foundation laid by her parents she should have all the advantages of female education conferred upon her the example of an excellent lady improving and building upon so worthy a foundation a capacity surpriseingly ready to take in all that is taught her an attention assiduity and diligence almost peculiar to herself at her time of life insomuch as at fifteen or sixteen years of age to be able to vie with any young lady of rank as well in the natural genteelness of her person as in her acquirements and that in nothing but her humility she should manifest any difference between herself and the highborn  it will be necessary moreover that she should have a mind above temptation that she should resist the offers and menaces of one upon whom all her worldly happiness seemed to depend the son of a lady to whom she owed the greatest obligations a person whom she did not hate but greatly feared and whom her grateful heart would have been glad to oblige and who sought to prevail over her virtue by all the inducements that could be thought of to attract a young unexperienced virgin at one time or to frighten her at another into his purposes who offered her high very high terms her circumstances considered as well for herself as for parents she loved better than herself whose circumstances at the same time were low and distressful  that she should show on requisite occasions that she preferred her virtue to her life that if ever she should be cast wholly into the power of one who she had too much reason to think would stick at nothing to gain his ends she should bear persecution from his agents withstand repeated offers from himself though trying to influence her by revenge when he could not move her other passions revenge the darling passion of the sex so seldom failing to answer a tempters purpose be he man or devil that was his expression in pretending to put her persecutor in her power  and when she saw no visible way to escape having been disappointed in an hundred pretty machinations she had formed young and unassisted as she was and threatened that if she yielded not to the high and alluring terms he offered he would execute all his purposes and she should not have one advantage that he then tendered to her  yet to be able to answer in such words as these which will always dwell upon my memory   see vol i p     and seqq i reject your proposals with all my soul  may god desert me whenever i make worldly grandeur my chiefest good  i know i am in your power i dread your will to ruin me is as great as your power  yet will i dare to tell you i will make no free will offering of my virtue all that i can do poor as it is i will do to show you that my will bore no part in my violation  and when future marriage was intimated to her to induce her to yield to be able to answer the moment i yield to your proposals there is an end of all merit if now i have any  and i should be so far from expecting such an honor that i will pronounce i should be most unworthy of it  if i say my dear friends such a girl can be found thus beautifully attractive in every ones eye and not partially so only in a young gentlemans own and after that what good persons would infinitely prefer to beauty thus piously principled thus genteelly educated and accomplished thus brilliantly witty thus prudent modest generous undesigning and having been thus tempted thus tried by the man she hated not pursued not intriguingly pursuing be thus inflexibly virtuous and proof against temptation let her reform her libertine and let him marry her and were he of princely extraction i dare answer for it that no two princes in one age take the world through would be in danger for although i am sensible it is not to my credit i will say that i never met with a repulse nor a conduct like this and yet i never sunk very low for the subjects of my attempts either at home or abroad  these are obvious inferences added the dear gentleman and not refinements upon my pamelas story and if the gentleman were capable of thought and comparison would rather make such an example as is apprehended more than less difficult than before  but if indeed added he the young fellow be such a booby that he cannot reflect and compare and take the case with all its circumstances together i think his good papa or mamma should get him a wife to their own liking as soon as possible and the poorest girl in england who is honest would rather have reason to bless herself for escaping such a husband than to glory in the catch she would have of him for such a young fellow as that would hardly do honor to his family in any one instance  indeed said the countess it would be pity after all that such an one should marry any lady of prudence and birth for it is enough in conscience that he is a disgrace to one worthy family it would be pity he should make two unhappy  why really nephew said sir jacob i think you have said a great deal to the purpose there is not so much danger from the example as i apprehended from sensible and reflecting minds i did not consider this matter thoroughly i must needs say  all the business is said lady davers  you will excuse me sister  there will be more people will hear that mr b has married his mothers waitingmaid than will know his inducements  not many i believe sister  for when it is known i have some character in the world and am not quite an idiot and my faults in having not been one of the most virtuous of men will stand me in some stead in this case though hardly in any other they will naturally inquire into my inducements  but see you not when we go abroad to church or elsewhere what numbers of people her character draws to admire the dear creature does not this show that her virtue has made her more conspicuous than my fortune had made me for i passed up and down quietly enough before handsome as my equipage always was and attracted not any bodys notice and indeed i had as lieve these honors were not so publicly paid her for even were i fond of show and parade what are they but a reproach to me  and can i have any excellence but a secondary one in having after all my persecutions of her done but common justice to her merit  this answers your objection lady davers and shows that my inducements and her story must be equally known and upon my conscience i think every thing i have said considered and every thing that might still farther be urged and the conduct of that dear creature in the station she adorns so much exceeding all i hoped or could flatter myself with from the most promising appearances that she does me more honor than i have done her and if i am capable of putting myself in a third persons place i think i should be of the same opinion were i to determine upon such another pair exactly circumstancd as we are  you may believe miss how much this generous defense of the step he had taken attributing every thing to me and depreciating his worthy self affected me i played with a cork now with my rings another time turning them round my fingers looked down and on one side and every way i looked but on the company for they gazed too much upon me all the time so that i could only glance a tearful eye nowandthen upon the dear gentleman and when it would overflow catch in my handkerchief the escaped fugitives that would start unbidden beyond their proper limits though i often endeavored by a twinkling motion to disperse the gathering water before it had formed itself into drops too big to be restrained  all the company praised the dear generous speaker and he was pleased to say farther although my good friends i can truly say that with all the pride of family and the insolence of fortune which once made me doubt whether i should not sink too low if i made my pamela my mistress for i should then have treated her not ungenerously and should have suffered her perhaps to call herself by my name i have never once repented of what i have done on the contrary i have always rejoiced in it and it has been from the first day of our marriage my pride and my boast and shall be let others say what they will that i can call such an excellence and such a purity which i so little deserve mine and i look down with contempt upon the rashness of all such as reflect upon me for they can have no notion of my happiness or her merit  o dear sir said i how do you overrate my poor merit  some persons are happy in a life of comforts but mine is a life of joy  one rapturous instance follows another so fast that i know not how to bear them  whew  whistled sir jacob  whereabouts am i  i hope byandby you will come down to our pitch that one may put in a word or two with you  may you be long thus blessed and thus happy together said lady davers i know not which to admire most the dear girl that never was bad or the dear gentleman that having been bad is now so good  said my lord davers there is hardly any bearing these moving scenes so quick as my sister says following one another  the countess was pleased to say that till now she had been at a loss to form any notion of the happiness of the first pair before the fall but now by so fine an instance as this she comprehended it in all its force  god continue you to one another added her ladyship for a credit to the state and to human nature  mr h having his elbows on the table folded his hands shaking them and looking down upon the table egad this is uncommon life that it is  your two souls i can see that are like welltuned instruments but they are too highset for me a vast deal  the best thing said lady davers always severe upon her poor nephew thou ever said the music must be equal to that of orpheus which can make such a savage as thee dance to it i charge thee say not another word tonight  why indeed aunt returned he laughing i believe it was pretty well said for your foolish fellow though it was by chance i must confess i did not think of it  that i believe replied my lady  if thou had thou would not have spoken so well  sir jacob and mr b afterward fell into a family discourse and sir jacob gave us an account of two or three courtships by his three sons and to his two daughters and his reasons for disallowing them and i could observe he is an absolute tyrant in his family though they are all men and women grown and he seemed to please himself how much they stood in awe of him  one odd piece of conversation i must tell you miss because of the inference that followed it  sir jacob asked mr b if he did not remember john wilkins his steward he was an honest fellow said he as ever lived  but he is dead alas for him poor jack  he physicked himself out of his life  he would be always taking slops had i done so i should have gone to the dogs long ago  but whom do you think nephew i have got in his place  nay you cannot know him neither why it is jerry sherwood a boy i took upon charity and taught to write and read or paid for it and that is the same thing  hay you know  and now jerrys a gentlemans fellow and is much respected by all our hunters for he is a keen sportsman i will assure you i brought him up to that myself and many a jirk has the dog had from me before i could make any thing of him many and many a good time have i whacked the rascals jacket and he owes all he is and will be to me and i now suffer him to sit down at table with me when i have no guests  but is not this a bad example said mr b to promote so low a servant to the command of the family under you what do gentlemen say to this  gentlemen say to it  why what gentlemen have any thing to do with my family management  surely i may do as i will in my own house and in my own family or else it would be very hard  true sir jacob but people will be meddling where they have least business but are not all the gentlemen uneasy for fear their lowest servants from the example set by so leading a man as you a chairman of the sessions a colonel of militia a deputy lieutenant and a justice of quorum should want to be made their stewards  why i cannot say that any body has taken it into their heads to question me upon this subject i should think em plaguey impertinent if they had and bid them mind their own business  but you will allow sir jacob that every one who knows you have raised your footboy to be your steward will not know your inducements although i doubt not they are very good ones  lady davers shook her head at her brother saying very well sir very well  sir jacob cried out o ho nephew are you thereabouts with your bears why i cannot say but youre in with me now  let us see what have i said  ay by my soul you have nabbed me cleverly faith and troth you have convinced me by an example of my own that i was impertinent to trouble my head about the management of your family  though near kindred makes some excuse for me too  and besides a steward and a wife are two things  so i would have em be sir jacob but a good wife is but a steward to her husband in many cases and mine is the best that ever gentleman had  pretty expensive ones nephew for all that as the world runs  most gentlemen find i believe these sort of stewards run em out more than they save but that is not your case i dare say  in faith though you have nicked me cleverly that you have  but my witty brother said my lady i believe you would better for all your fling at me as to inducements stick to your first defense as to the example sake for who stands upon birth or degree in the office of a steward  it will answer several purposes sister and come nearer the point in what you object than you are aware of were we to dispute upon it but i have gained my end in the observation sir jacob takes the force of the comparison and is convinced i dare say there is some justice in it  ay ay a great deal said sir jacob for a wife is or ought to be her husbands steward i am sure when mine was living i made her so and had no other for she made memorandums and i digested them into book and yet she brought me a noble fortune too as you all know  here i conclude my tedious narrations  be so good as to skim them over lightly that you may not think the worse of me and then return them to me with some of your charming penmanship that i may send them on to kent to be sure i would not have been so tediously trifling but for the sake of my dear parents and there is so much selfpraise as it may seem from a person repeating the fine things said of herself that i am half of opinion i should send them to kent only and to think you should be obliged to me for saving you so much trouble and impertinence  do dear miss be so free as to forbid me to send you any more long journals but common letters only of how do you and who and who is together and of respects to one and to another and so forth  letters that one might dispatch as sir jacob says in a twinkling and perhaps be more to the purpose than the tedious scrawl which kisses your hands from  dear miss yours most sincerely p b do dear good sir simon let miss polly add to our delights by her charming company mr murray and the new affair will divert you in her absence  so pray as my good lady darnford has consented and miss is willing and her sister can spare her dont be so cross as to deny me    letter xxxiv from miss darnford to mrs b my dear mrs b i must recapitulate the pleasure you have given us in your charming accounts of your conversations with your london guests and the verses put so boldly and wickedly under your seat and your just observations on the lines and the occasion but we all humbly request you will be pleased to give us the copy of the manuscript verses from which you transcribe the pretty lines beginning  but oh forgive me heaven if often my fair  i am quite shocked when i think of lady daverss passionate intentions at her first coming down to you to the hall but have let nobody into the worst of the matter in compliance with your desire we are delighted with your account of family management and your sundays service  what an excellent lady are you and how happy and how good you make every one who knows you is seen by the ladies joining in your evening service as well as their servants  we go on here swimmingly with our courtship never was there a fonder couple than mr murray and miss nancy the moody girl is quite alive easy and pleased except nowandthen with me  we had a sad fallingout the other day thus it was  she had the assurance on my saying they were so fond and so free beforehand that they would leave nothing for improvement afterward to tell me she had for some time perceived that my envy was very disquieting to me this she said before mr murray who had the good manners to retire seeing a storm rising between us  poor foolish girl cried i when he was gone provoked to great contempt by her expression before him thou will make me despise thee in spite of my heart  but prythee manage thy matters with common decency at least  good lack common decency i say common decency when my sister polly is able to show me what it is i shall hope to be better for her example  no thou wilt never be better for any bodys example thy ill nature and perverseness will keep thee from that as it has always hitherto done  my illtemper you have often told me is natural to me so it must become me but upon such a sweettemperd young lady as miss polly it sits but ill  i must have had no bad temper and that every one says to bear with thy sullen and perverse one as i have done all my life  but why cannot you bear with it a little longer sister  does any thing provoke you now with a sly leer and affected drawl that did not formerly  provoke me  what should provoke me  i gave thee but a hint of thy fond folly which makes thee behave so before company that every one smiles at thee and i would be glad to save thee from contempt for thy new good humor as i used to try to do for thy old bad nature  is that it  what a kind sister have i  but perhaps i see it vexes you and illnatured folks love to teize you know  but dear polly dont let the affection mr murray expresses for me put such a goodtemperd body out of humor pray dont  who knows continued the provoker who never says a tolerable thing that is not illnatured that being her talent but the gentleman may think himself happy that he has found a way with so much ease to dispense with the difficulty that eldership laid him under  but as he did you the favor to let the repulse come from you dont be angry sister that he took you at the first word  indeed indeed said i with a contemptuous smile you are right nancy to take the gentleman at his first word hold him fast and play over all thy monkey airs with him with all my heart who knows but it may engage him more for should he leave thee i might be too much provoked at thy ingratitude to turn over another gentleman to thee  and let me tell you without such an introduction thy temper would keep any body from thee that knows it  poor miss polly  come be as easy as you can  who knows but we may find out some cousin or friend of mr murrays between us that we may persuade to address you dont make us your enemies well try to make you easy if we can  it is a little hard that you should be so cruelly taken at your word that it is  do think said i poor stupid illjudging nancy that i can have the same regret for parting with a man i could not like that thou had when thy vain hopes met with the repulse they deserved from mr b  mr b come up again i have not heard of mr b a great while  no but it was necessary replied i that one nail should drive out another for thou would been repining still had not mr murray been turned over to thee  turned over you used that word once before sister such great wits as you methinks should not use the same word so often  how do thou know what wits should or should not do thou have no talent but ill nature and it is enough for thee that one view takes up thy whole thought pursue that  but i would only caution thee that thou do not satiate where thou would oblige that is all or if thy man can be so gross as to like thy fondness that thou leavest something for hereafter  i will call him in again sister and you shall acquaint us how you would have it bell for the maid came in just then tell mr murray i desire him to walk in  i am glad to see thee so teachable all at once  i find out now what was the cause of thy constant perverseness for had the unavailing lessons my mamma was always inculcating upon thee come from a man thou could have had hopes of they had succeeded better  in came sir simon with his crutchstick  but can you bear this nonsense mrs b  what sparring jangling again you sluts  o what fiery eyes on one side and contemptuous looks on the other  why papa my sister polly has turned over mr murray to me and she wants him back again and he will not come  that is all the matter  you know your daughter nancy papa  she could never bear reproof and yet would always deserve it  i was only gently remarking for her instruction on her fondness before company and she is as she used to be  the poor girl has not indeed been used to be courted and so knows not how to behave herself  so polly because you have been able to run over a long list of humble servants you must insult your sister must you  but are you really concerned polly  hay  sir this or any thing is very well from you  but these imputations of envy before mr murray must make the man very considerable with himself poor nancy dont consider that  but indeed how should she how should she be able to reflect who knows not what reflection is except of the spiteful sort but papa should the poor thing add to his vanity which wants no addition at the expense of her own  i saw her affected and was resolved to pursue my advantage  prythee nancy continued i can thou not have a little patience child  my papa will set the day as soon as he shall think it proper and dont let thy man toil to keep pace with thy fondness for i have pitied him many a time when i have seen him stretched on the tenters to keep thee in countenance  this set the illnatured girl into tears and fretfulness all her old temper came upon her as i designed it should for she had kept me at bay longer than usual and i left her under the dominion of it and because i would not come into a fresh dispute got my mammas leave and the chariot and went and begged a dinner at lady joness and then came home as cool and as easy as i used to be and found nancy as sullen and silent as was her custom before mr murray tendered himself to her ready acceptance but i went to my spinnet and suffered her to swell on  we have said nothing but no and yes ever since and i wish i was with you for a month and all their nonsense over without me i am my dear obliging and excellent mrs b  your faithful and affectionate polly darnford the two following anticipating the order of time for the reasons mentioned p     we insert here    letter xxxv from miss darnford to mrs b my dear mrs b pray give my service to your mr b and tell him he is very unpolite in his reflections see this vol p     upon me in relation to mr murray when he supposes i regret the loss of him you are much more favorable and just too i will say to your polly darnford these gentlemen the very best of them are such indelicates they think so highly of their saucy selves and confident sex as if a lady cannot from her heart despise them but if she turns them off as they deserve and happens to continue her dislike what should be interpreted in her favor as a just and regular piece of conduct is turned against her and it must proceed from spite  mr b may think he knows a good deal of the sex but perhaps were i as malicious as he is reflecting and yet if i have any malice he has raised it i could say that his acquaintance was not with the most unexceptionable till he had the happiness to know you and he has not long enough been happy in you i find to do justice to those who are proud to emulate your virtues  but i cannot bear it seems to see my sister addressed and complimented and preferred by one whom i had thought in my own power but he may be mistaken with all his sagacity he has been often nor is it so mortifying a thing to me as he imagines to sit and see two such anticks playing their pugs tricks as he calls them with one another  but you hardly ever saw such pugs tricks played as they play at so early a time of courtship the girl hangs upon his arm and receives his empty head on her shoulder already with a freedom that would be censurable in a bride before folks a stiff sullen proud scornful girl as she used to be she now puts on airs that are not natural either to her features or her character and judge then how it must disgust one especially when one sees her man so proud and vain upon it that like a true man he treats her with the less ceremony for her condescensions putting on airs of consequence while her easiness of behavior makes him secure of acceptance and a kind reception let him be as negligent or as forward as he pleases  i say mrs b there can be no living with these men upon such beginnings  they ought to know their distance or be taught it and not to think it in their power to confer that as a favor which they should think it an honor to receive  but neither can i bear it seems the preparatives to matrimony the fine clothes the compliments the busy novelty as he calls it the new equipages and so forth that is his mistake again tell him for one who can look forwarder than the nine days of wonder can easily despise so flashy and so transient a glare and were i fond of compliments it would not perhaps be the way to be pleased if i were to marry  compliments in the single state are a ladys due whether courted or not and she receives them or ought always to receive them as such but in courtship they are poured out upon one like a hasty shower that one knows will soon be over  a mighty comfortable consideration this to a lady who loves to be complimented  instead of the refreshing aprillike showers which beautify the sunshine she shall stand a deluge of complaisance be wet to the skin with it and then  what then  why be in a libyan desert ever after  experience a constant parching drought and all her fine attributes will be swallowed up in the quicksands of matrimony  it may be otherwise with you and it must be otherwise because there is such an infinite variety in your excellence every rising sun adorns you with some new rays and sets not without leaving you brighter than he himself can hold it  but does mr b think it must be so in every matrimony  it is true he improves every hour as i see in your kind papers in his fine speeches to you but it could not be mr b if he did not your merit extorts it from him and what an ungrateful as well as absurd churl would he be who should seek to obscure a meridian luster that dazles the eyes of every one else  but let me observe moreover that you had so few of these fine speeches beforehand that you have all the reason in the world to expect them now and this lessens his merit a good deal as the most he can say is but common justice on full preof for can the like generosity be attributed to him as might to a gentleman who praises on trust  you promise if i will come to you you will join with me against mr b on this subject it is very kindly offered but when mr b is in the question i expect very little assistance from you be the argument what it will  but it is not my fault i dont come i am quite tired with the perverse folly of this nancy of ours she every day behaves more like a fool to mr murray and less like a sister to me and takes delight to teize and vex me by all the little ways in her power and then surliness and illtemper are so natural to her that i who can but throw out a spiteful word by way of flourish as i may say and it is over and i am sorry for it as soon as spoken am no match for her  for she perseveres so intolerably and comes back to the attack though never so often repulsed rising like antaeus with fresh vigor for every fall or like the lernaean hydra which had a new head sprouting up as fast as any one of the seven was lopt off that there is no bearing her wedlock in fine must be her hercules and will furnish me i doubt with a revenge i wish not for  but let me thank you for your delightful narratives and beg you to continue them i told you how your saturdays conversation with lady davers and your sunday employments charm us all so regular and so easy to be performed  that is the delightful thing  what every body may do  and yet so beautiful so laudable so uncommon in the practice especially among people in genteel life  your conversation and decision in relation to the two parsons more than charm transport us mr b let me tell you judges right and acts a charming part to throw such a fine game into your hands and so excellently do you play it that never surely was so happy a couple  he has a prodigious merit with me i can tell him though he thinks not so well of me as i would have him to see to praise and to reward a virtue is next to having it ones self and in time he will make as good a man these fine appearances encourage one to hope so as he is a husband  your notions of dispensations and double livings are admirably just mr williams is more my favorite than ever  and the amplyrewarded mr adams how did that scene affect us  again and again i say for what can i say else or more  since i cannot find words to speak all i think youre a charming lady  yet methinks poor mr h makes but a sorry figure among you  we are delighted with lady davers but still more if possible with the countess she is a fine lady as you have drawn her but your characters though truth and nature are the most shocking or the most amiable that ever i read  we are full of impatience to hear of the arrival of sir jacob swynford we know his character pretty well but when he has sat for it to your pencil it must be an original indeed  i will have another trial with my papa to move him to let me attend you i am rallying my forces for that purpose i have got my mamma on my side again who is concerned to see her girl vexed and insulted by her younger sister and who yet minds no more what she says to her than what i say and sir simon loves at his heart to make mischief between us instead of interposing to silence either and truly i am afraid the delight of this kind which he takes will make him deny his polly what she so ardently wishes for  i had a good mind to be sick to be with you i could fast two or three days to give it the better appearance but then my mamma who loves not deceit would blame me if she knew my stratagem and be grieved if she thought i was really ill  i know fasting when one has a stomach to eat gives one a very gloomy and mortified air  what would not one do in short to procure to ones self the inexpressible pleasure that i should have in your company and conversation but continue to write to me till then however and that will be next best i am  your most obliged and obedient polly darnford  letter xxxvi from the same my dearest mrs b i am all over joy and rapture my good papa has given me leave to tell you that he will put his polly under your protection when you go to london if you have but a tenth part of the pleasure i have on this occasion i am sure i shall be as welcome as i wish but he will insist upon it he says that mr b signs some acknowlegement which i am to carry along with me that i am entrusted to his honor and yours and to be returned to him heartwhole and dutiful and with a reputation as unsullied as he receives me  but do dearest mrs b continue your journals till then for i have promised to take them up where you leave off to divert our friends in these parts there will be presumption but yet i will write nothing but what i will show you and have your consent to send for i was taught early not to tell tales out of school and a school the best i ever went to will be your charming conversation  we have been greatly diverted with the trick put upon that barbarian sir jacob his obstinacy repentance and amendment followed so irresistibly in one halfhour from the happy thought of the excellent lady countess that i think no plot was ever more fortunate it was like springing a lucky mine in a siege that blew up twenty times more than was expected from it and answered all the besiegers ends at once  mr bs defense of his own conduct toward you is quite noble and he judges with his usual generosity and good sense when by adding to your honor he knows he inhances his own mr pitts fine diamond met with a world of admirers but all turned upon this reflection what a happy man is mr pit who can call such a jewel his own  how greatly do you excel this diamond and how much does mr b outdo mr pit  who has contributed to give so rich a jewel a polish so admirable and then has set it in so noble a light as makes its beauty conspicuous to every eye  you bid me skim over your writings lightly bur it is impossible i will not flatter you my dear mrs b nor will i be suspected to do so and yet i cannot find words to praise so much as i think you deserve so i will only say that your good parents for whose pleasure you write as well as for mine cannot receive or read them with more delight than i do  even my sister nancy judge of their effect by this will at any time leave murray and forget to frown or be illnatured while she can hear read what you write  and angry as she makes me sometimes i cannot deny her this pleasure because possibly among the innumerable improving reflections they abound with some one may possibly dart in upon her and illuminate her as your conversation and behavior did sir jacob  but your application in p s to my papa pleased him and confirmed his resolution to let me go  he snatched the sheet that contained this that is to me said he  i must read this myself he did  and said  in faith she is a sweet one  do dear good sir simon repeated he aloud let miss polly add to our delights  so she shall then  if that will do it  and yet this same mrs b has so many delights already that i should think she might be contented  but dame darnford i think i will let her go these sisters then you will see how they will love at a distance though always quarrelling when together he read on  the new affair will divert you  lady darnford has consented  miss is willing and her sister can spare her  very prettily put faith  and dont you be so cross  very sweet  to deny me  why dear mrs b i will not be so cross then indeed i will not  and so polly let em send word when they set out for london and you shall join em there with all my heart but i will have a letter every post remember that girl  any thing any thing dear papa said i so i can but go he called for a kiss for his compliance i gave it most willingly you may believe  nancy looked envious although mr murray came in just then  she looked almost like a great glutton whom i remember one sir jonathan smith who killed himself by eating he used while he was heaping up his plate from one dish to watch the others and follow the knife of every body else with such a greedy eye as if he could swear a robbery against any one who presumed to eat as well as he this is a gross simile but all greedy and envious folks look alike about the eyes and thinking of nancy on this occasion who envied a happiness she knew i preferred to that she has in prospect i could not but call to mind sir jonathan at the same time  well let us know when you set out and you shall not have been a week in london if i can help it but you shall be told by my tongue as now by my pen how much i am  your obliged admirer and friend polly darnford p s remember the verses i wrote about if proper see this vol p      you hint too at some other verses ibid p      dont let us lose any thing    letter xxxvii my dear miss  i now proceed with my journal which i had brought down to thursday night  friday the two ladies resolving as they said to inspect all my proceedings insisted upon it that i would take them with me in my benevolent round as they after we returned would call it which i generally take once a week among my poor and sick neighbors and finding i could not get off i set out with them my lady countess proposing mrs worden to fill up the fourth place in the coach  we talked all the way of charity and the excellency of that duty and my lady davers took notice of the text that it would hide a multitude of faults and if as she was pleased to say there was to be any truth in the popish doctrine of supererogation what abundance of such merits would arise from the life and actions of our dear friend here kindly looking at me  i said that when we had the pleasure to reflect that we served a master who exacted no hard terms from us but in every case almost that could be thought of only required of us to do justice and show mercy to one another and gave us reason to think he would judge us by those rules it must be a mighty inducement to acts of charity and benevolence but indeed added i were there not that inducement the pleasure that attends such acts is an high reward and i am sure the ladies i have the honor to speak to must have found it in an hundred instances  the countess said she had once a much better opinion of herself than she found she had reason for within these few days past and indeed mrs b said she when i get home i shall make a good many people the better for your example and so said lady davers which gave me no small inward pleasure and i acknowlegd in suitable terms the honor they both did me  the coach set us down by the side of a large common about five miles distant from our house and we alighted and walked a little way choosing not to have the coach come nearer that we might be taken as little notice of as possible and they entered with me into two mean cots with great condescension and goodness one belonging to a poor widow and five children who had been all down in agues and fevers the other to a man and his wife bedridden with age and infirmities and two honest daughters one a widow with two children the other married to an husbandman who had also been ill but now by comfortable cordials and good physic were pretty well to what they had been  the two ladies were well pleased with my demeanor to the good folks to whom i said that as i should go soon to london i was willing to see them before i went to wish them better and better and to tell them that i should leave orders with mrs jervis concerning them to whom they must make known their wants and that mr barrow would take care of em i was sure and do all that was in the power of physic for the restoration of their healths  now you must know miss that i am not so good as the old ladies of former days who used to distill cordial waters and prepare medicines and dispense them themselves i knew if i was so inclined my dear mr b would not have been pleased with it because in the approbation he has kindly given to my present method he has twice or thrice praised me that i dont carry my charity to extremes and make his house a dispensatory i would not therefore by aiming at doing too much lose the opportunity of doing any good at all in these respects and besides as the vulgar saying is one must creep before one goes but this is my method  i am upon an agreement with this mr barrow who is deemed a very skilful and honest apothecary and one mr simmonds a surgeon of like character to attend all such cases and persons as i shall recommend mr barrow to administer physic and cordials as he shall judge proper and even in necessary cases to call in a physician and nowandthen calling ones self or sending a servant to ask questions all is kept right  besides one can take this method without the ostentation as some would deem it which would attend the other and having ones dear friends gate always crowded with unhappy objects and some that deserve no countenance perhaps and would possibly be the most clamorous and then one does not subject the poor neither to the insolence of servants who sometimes in a bodys absence might were they some servants show that they were far from being influenced by the same motives as their principals besides the advantage the poor have from the skill and experience which education and constant practice give to the gentlemen i employ and with whom i agree but by the quarter because if there were a just foundation of complaint for negligence or hardness of heart i would not be tied down from changing for in such cases in a crisis the poor people depending on the assistance of those gentlemen might look no farther and so my good intentions might not only be frustrated but do harm  my lady davers observed a bible a common prayer book and a whole duty of man in each cot in leathern outside cases to keep them clean and a church catechism or two for the children and was pleased to say it was right and her ladyship asked one of the children a pretty girl who learnt her her catechism and she courtsyd and looked at me for i do ask the children questions when i come to know how they improve it is as i thought said my lady my sister provides for both parts god bless you my dear said she and tappd my neck  my ladies left tokens of their bounty behind them to both families and all the good folks blessed and prayed for us at parting and as we went out my lady davers with a serious air was pleased to say to me take care of your health my dear sister and god give you when it comes a happy hour for how many real mourners would you have if you were to be called early to reap the fruits of your piety  gods will must be done my lady said i the same providence that has so wonderfully put it in my power to do a little good will raise up new friends to the honest hearts that rely upon him  this i said because some of the good people heard my lady and seemed troubled and began to redouble their prayers for my safety and preservation  we walked thence to our coach and stretched a little farther to visit two farmers families about a mile distant from each other one had the mother of the family with two sons just recovering the former from a fever the latter from tertian agues and i asked when they saw mr barrow they told me with great commendations of him that he had but just left them so having congratulated their hopeful way and wished them to take care of themselves and not go too early to business i said i should desire mr barrow to watch over them for fear of relapse and should hardly see em again for some time and so under the notion of my foy i dropped a couple of guineas in the good womans hand for i had had an hint given me by mrs jervis that their illness had made it low with them  we proceeded then to the other farm where the case was a married daughter who had had a very dangerous lyingin and a wicked husband who had abused her and run away from her but she was mending apace by good comfortable things which from time to time i had caused to be sent her her old father had been a little unkind to her before i took notice of her for she married against his consent and indeed the world went hard with the poor man and he could not do much and besides he had a younger daughter who had lost all her limbs and was forced to be tied in a wicker chair to keep her up in it which having expended much to relieve her was a great pullback as the good old woman called it and having been a year in arrear to a cruel landlord who finding a good stock upon the ground wanted to distress the poor family and turn them out of all i advanced the money upon the stock and the poor man has already paid me half of it for i must keep within compass too miss which was  0 l at first and is in a fair way to pay me the other half and make as much more for himself  here i found mr barrow and he gave me an account of the success of two other cases i had recommended to him and told me that john smith a poor man who in thatching a barn had tumbled down and broken his leg and bruised himself all over was in a fair way of recovery  this poor creature had like to have perished by the cruelty of the parish officers who would have passed him away to essex where his settlement was though in a burning fever occasioned by his misfortune but hearing of the case i directed mr simmonds to attend him and provide for him at my expense and gave my word if he died to bury him  i was glad to hear he was in so good a way and told mr barrow i hoped to see him and mr simmonds together at mr bs before i set out for london that we might advise about the cases under their direction and that i might acquit myself of some of my obligations to them  you are a good man mr barrow added i god will bless you for your care and kindness to these poor destitute creatures they all praise you and do nothing but talk of your humanity to them  o my good lady said he who can forbear following such an example as you set mr simmonds can testify as well as i for nowandthen a case requires us to visit together that we can hardly hear any complaints from our poor patients let em be ever so ill for the praises and blessings they bestow upon you  it is good mr b that enables and encourages me to do what i do tell them they must bless god and bless him and pray for me and thank you and mr simmonds we all join together you know for their good  the countess and lady davers asked the poor lyingin woman many questions and left with her and for her poor sister a miserable object indeed  god be praised that i am not such an one marks of their bounty in gold but i saw not how much and looking upon one another and then upon me and lifting up their hands could not say a word till they were in the coach and so we were carried home after we had just looked in upon a country school where i pay for the learning of eight children  and here miss   i hope i recite not this with pride though i do with pleasure is a cursory account of my benevolent weekly round as my ladies will call it  i know you will not be displeased with it but it will highly delight my worthy parents who in their way do a great deal of discreet good in their neighborhood for indeed miss a little matter prudently bestowed and to true objects of compassion whose cases are soon at a crisis as are those of most laboring people will go a great way and especially if laid out properly for em according to the exigencies of their respective cases  for such poor people who live generally low want very seldom any thing but reviving cordials at first and good wholesome kitchen physic afterward and then the wheels of nature being uncloggd newoild as it were and set right they will go round again with pleasantness and ease for a good while together by virtue of that exercise which their labor gives them while the rich and voluptuous are forced to undergo great fatigues to keep theirs clean and in order  thus is it well remarked in a manuscript poem in my dear mr bs possession written in answer to a friend who recommended a poor man of genius to the favor of the author in order to induce the benevolent gentleman to lift him into a higher life than that to which he was born would thou by change of life i should intail gouts fevers surfeits every torturing ail that our rich blood infects on this poor swain and turn his fansyd woes to real pain if he want food or raiment these will i fit for his station cheerfully supply but is his slavish life much more fatiguing than our bad hours hard huntings lewd intriguing for needful exercise dont all who have wealth at times but to preserve themselves in health our bodies less prepared our nerves less strong do more than any of the laboring throng   i mentioned before see this vol p      that this poem had given me some proper hints in relation to the good one should dispense in which one ought to consult a persons usual way of life and not to be so lavish to some one object or two as should limit ones power to relieve others and at the same time by lifting the poor folks into a state they had not been used to make them possibly more unhappy than ever i will transcribe a few more lines from this piece for your entertainment  but yet my friend i cannot join with thee to think so hard of native poverty it is not to live at ease makes happiness eat and drink well lie soft it is nothing less than sweet content whatever be the state can make us truly happy wise or great if this he want not whatever else he be he is happier far i judge than you or me and if he want it much i fear my friend he will find no state will his condition mend for human minds still on aspiring bent not checked at first are seldom ever content   and again the man who in one way was always bred till thrice twelve winters have passed over his head is or should be contented with his fate nor covet totally to change his state for discontent once cherished in his breast desire of change will never let him rest unfixd unsettled he all comfort past knows his first wish but never will know his last   i must go on a little further it seems that the recommending friend had praised the poor man for a genius above the sphere he was placed in to this the judicious benefactor replies stating the plea in the first line but he has parts and wit above his sphere the neighboring throng will then his wit revere if by sound judgment tempered and who knows how useful he may be but to compose small strifes that even homely cots invade from rugged minds by partial passions swayed shall naught but thistles in one climate grow and intermingling no sweet roses blow remote from towns among the rural swains he will be the priest and justice of the plains and nothing sure on earth yields more delight than differing minds in social bands tunite   i believe you will excuse me if i transcribe more we the discomforts know of what we are but little think what states superior share how aukwardly our parts we should sustain in a new scene and oh what mighty pain for this is not the least to a generous mind with obligations pressed or to dependence joined or sit they light from me as ever they will it is obligation and dependence still to thoughtful minds  and grant he might be happy while i live how may he fare with those who me survive my fortune may perhaps to those descend who knew not joseph nor loved josephs friend who like too many heirs reverse whatever was wont to engage their predecessors care in such a case what cause he would have to mourn forced to the life he now beholds with scorn by long disuse made still more grievous to return shall the slow carthorse with the courser run would every twinkling star become a sun yet in their order this adorns the sky and that helps on the general harmony   then follow some lines that i often think of with pleasure and which used to please my dear lady who made me write them down in my commonplace book you my honored father and mother have seen them see vol ii p     but as you my dear miss have not i will transcribe them for thou want not to know wise providence does various parts for various minds dispense the meanest slaves or those who hedge and ditch are useful by their sweat to feed the rich the rich in due return impart their store which comfortably feeds the laboring poor nor let the rich the lowest slave disdain he is equally a link of natures chain labors to the same end joins in one view and both alike the will divine pursue and at the last are levelled king and slave without distinction in the silent grave   but now you will be curious to know since this gentleman declined raising the poor man what good he really thought proper to do for him this then will satisfy you  but he has children  well this is a plea that strongly recommends his case to me i will take a boy or two and if i find the youngsters honest faithful well inclined if able to sustain those parts which we call vainly better i will their patron be first to the menial service i will inure em and as they merit better will procure em in short the swain for what he is i will prize consistent with his degree augment his joys and tell him this from me that would he know true happiness unmixed with certain woe here will he rest his hopes nor farther wish to go   i dont remember ever to have read any thing of this subject placed in these natural easy and i therefore think uncommon lights and believe you will allow them to be right lights for there are certainly no cases in the world that require more judgment and distinction than charitable ones and except a casual distress among those who make a trade of begging such persons especially if i see them often and so much in the same place as if they were as tenacious of their stand as others of their freehold move not my compassion or notice they cannot be lower in spirit nor being frequently brought up to it do they often wish to be higher in calling or to change their idle state for a laborious one but the poor industrious souls reduced by sickness or misfortune or even mistake not wilful or persisted in who sigh in secret and cannot make known what they suffer such unhappy objects are worthy of ones pains to find out and relieve  saturday morning it is hardly right to trouble either of you my honored correspondents with an affair that has vexed me a good deal and indeed should affect me more than any other mistress of a family for reasons which will be obvious to you when i tell you the case and this it is so present with me i cannot forbear  a pretty genteel young body my polly barlow as i call her having been well recommended and indeed behaved with great prudence till this time is the occasion and this it is  my dear mr b and the two ladies agreed with me to take a little airing in the coach and to fall in upon mr martin who had a present made him for his menagerie in which he takes great delight of a rare and uncommon creature a native of the east indies but just as sir jacob was on horseback to accompany them and the ladies were ready to go i was taken with a sudden disorder and faintishness so that lady davers who is very tender of me and watches every turn of my countenance would not let me go with them though my disorder was going off and my dear mr b was pleased to excuse me and just meeting with mr williams as they went to the coach they took him with them to fill up the vacant place so i retired to my closet and shut myself in  they had asked mr h to go with them as company to sir jacob but he as i believe by what followed on purpose could not be found when they set out so they supposed he was upon some ramble with mr colbrand his great favorite  i was writing to you being pretty well recovered when i heard polly as i supposed and as it proved come into my apartment and down she sat and sung a little catch and cried hem twice and presently i heard two voices but suspecting nothing i wrote on till i heard a kind of rustling and struggling and pollys voice crying fie  how can you do so  pray sir  this alarmed me much because we have such orderly folks about us and i looked through the keyhole and to my surprise and concern saw mr h  foolish gentleman  taking liberties with polly that neither became him to offer nor more foolish girl her to suffer  i did not know what to do but having reason to think that this was not their first interview and freedom  and the girl sometimes encouragingly laughing as at other times inconsistently struggling and complaining in an accent that was too tender for the occasion i forced a faint cough this frighted them both mr h swore and said who can that be  your ladys gone with them int she  i believe so i hope so said the silly girl  yet that was like her voice  mem are you in your closet mem said she coming up to the door mr h standing like a poor thief half behind the windowcurtains till he knew if it was i  i opened the door away sneaked mr h and she leaped with surprise not hoping to find me there though she asked the question  i thought  indeed  mem  i thought you were gone out  it is plain you did polly  go and shut the chamber door and come to me again  she did but trembled and was so full of confusion that i pitied the poor creature and hardly knew how to speak to her or what to say  for my compassion got the upperhand of my resentment and as she stood quaking and trembling and looking on the ground with a countenance i cannot describe i nowandthen cast my eye upon her and was as often forced to put my handkerchief to it  at last i said how long have these freedoms past polly between you and mr h  she said never a word  i am loath to be censorious polly but it is too plain that mr h would not have followed you into my chamber if he had not met you at other places before  still the poor girl said never a word  little did i expect polly that you would have shown so much imprudence you have had instances of the vile arts of men against poor maidens have you any notion that mr h intends to do honorably by you  mem  mem  i believe  i hope  i dare say mr h would not do otherwise  so much the worse that you believe so if you have not very good reason for your belief  does he pretend he will marry you polly  she was silent  tell me polly if he does  he says he will do honorably by me  but you know there is but one word necessary to explain that other precious word honor in this case it is matrimony that words as soon spoken as any other and if he means it he will not be shy to speak it  she was silent  tell me polly for i am really greatly concerned for you what you think yourself do you hope he will marry you  she was silent  do good polly i hope i may call you good yet  answer me  pray madam and she wept and turned from me to the wainscot  pray madam excuse me  but indeed polly i cannot excuse you you are under my protection i was once in as dangerous a situation as you can be and i did not escape it child by the language and conduct i heard from you  language and conduct mem  yes polly language and conduct for you have heard my story no doubt all the world has and do you think if i had sat me down in my ladys bedchamber and sung a song and hemmed twice and mr b had come to me upon that signal for such i doubt it was and i had kept my place and suffered myself to be rumpled and only in a soft voice and with an encouraging laugh cried how can you do so that i should have been what i am  mem i dare say my lord so all the servants call him and his aunt often when she puts jackey to it means me no hurt  no hurt polly what and make you cry fie  or do you intend to trust your honor to his mercy rather than to your own discretion  i hope not mem  i hope not too polly  but you know he was free enough with you to make you say fie  and what might have been the case who knows had i not coughed on purpose unwilling for your sake polly to find matters so bad as i feared and that you would have been led beyond what was reputable  reputable mem  yes polly reputable i am sorry you oblige me to speak so plain but your good requires it instead of flying from him you not only laughed all the time you cried out fie and how can you do so but had no other care then to see if any body heard you and you observe how he slid away like a guilty gentleman as soon as i opened my door  do these things look well polly do you think they do  and if you hope to emulate my good fortune do you think this is the way  i wish mem i had never seen mr h for nobody will look upon me if i lose your favor  it will still polly and i took her hand with a kind look be in your own power to keep it and i will not mention this matter if you make me your friend and tell me all that has passed  again she wept and was silent  this made me more uneasy dont think polly said i that i would envy any other persons preferment when i have been so much exalted myself if mr h has talked to you of marriage tell me  no mem i cannot say he has yet  yet polly then he never will for when men do talk of it they dont always mean it but whenever they mean it how can they confirm a doubting maiden without mentioning it but alas alas for you poor polly  the freedoms you have permitted to him no doubt previous to those i heard and which would have been greater possibly had i not surprised you with my cough show too well that he need not make any promises to you  indeed mem  indeed said she sobbing i might be too little upon my guard but i would not have done any ill for the world  i hope you would not polly but if you suffer these freedoms you cannot tell what you would have permitted  tell me do you love mr h  he is a very goodhumored gentleman madam and is not proud  no it is not his business to be proud when he hopes to humble you  humble you indeed beneath the lowest person of the sex that is honest  i hope   you hope interrupted i  you hope too much and i fear a great deal for you because you fear so little for yourself  but tell me how often have you been in private together  in private mem  i dont know what your ladyship calls private  why that is private polly when as just now you neither hoped nor intended any body should see you  she was silent and i see miss by this poor girl that lovers are true to their secret though perhaps their ruin depends upon it but it behooved me on more accounts than it would any body else as i hinted before to examine this matter narrowly because if mr h should marry her it would have been laid upon mr bs example  and if my polly should be ruined it would be a sad thing and people would have said ay she could take care enough of herself but none at all of her servant her waitingmaid had a much more remiss mistress than pamela found or the matter would not have been thus  well polly i see continued i that you will not speak out to me you may have several reasons for it possibly though not one good one but as soon as lady davers comes in who has a great concern in this matter as well as lord davers and are answerable to lord h in a matter of so much importance as this i will leave it to her ladyships consideration and shall no more concern myself to ask you questions about it  for then i must take her ladyships directions and part with you to be sure  the poor girl frighted at this for every body fears lady davers wrung her hands and begged for gods sake i would not acquaint lady davers with it  but how can i help it said i  must i not connive at your proceedings if i do not you are no fool polly in other cases tell me how is it possible for me in my situation to avoid it  i will tell your ladyship the whole truth indeed i will  if you will not tell lady davers i am ready to sink at the thoughts of lady davers knowing any thing of this  this looked sadly i pitied her but yet was angry in my mind for i saw too plainly that her conduct could not bear a scrutiny not even in her own opinion poor creature  i said make me acquainted with the whole  will your ladyship promise   i will promise nothing polly  when i have heard all you think fit to say i will do what befits me to do but with as much tenderness as i can for you  and that is all you ought to expect me to promise  why then madam  but how can i speak it  i can speak sooner to any body but lady davers and you madam  for her ladyships passion and your ladyships virtue  how shall i  and then she threw herself at my feet and hid her face with her apron  i was in agonies for her almost i wept over her i raised her up and said tell me all  you cannot tell me worse than i apprehend nor i hope so bad o polly tell me soon  for you give me great pain   and my back with grief and compassion for the poor girl was ready to open as it seemed to me  in my former distresses i have been overcome by fainting next to death and was deprived of sense for some moments  but else i should have imagined i must have had some such affecting sensations as the unhappy girls case gave me  then madam i own said she i have been too faulty  as how  as what  in what way  how faulty  asked i as quick as thought you are not ruined are you  tell me polly  no madam but   but what  say but what  i had consented   to what  to his proposals madam  what proposals  why madam i was to live with mr h  i understand you too well  but is it too late to break so wretched a bargain  have you already made a sacrifice of your honor  no madam but i have given it under my hand  under your hand  ah polly if you have not given it under your heart too it were well but what foolishness is this what consideration has he made you  he has given it under his hand that he will always love me and when his lordships father dies he will own me  what foolishness is this said i on both sides  but are you willing to be released from this vile bargain  indeed i am madam and i told him so yesterday but he says he will sue me and ruin me if i dont stand to it  you are ruined if you do  and i wish  but tell me polly are you not ruined as it is  indeed i am not madam  i doubt then said i you were upon the brink of it had not this providential indisposition kept me at home  you met i suppose to conclude your shocking bargain  o poor unhappy girl  but let me see what he has given under his hand  he has em both madam to be drawn up fair and in a strong hand that shall be like a record  could i have thought miss that a girl of nineteen could be so ignorant and foolish in a point so important when in every thing else she has shown no instances like this imprudent folly  has he given you money  yes madam he gave me  he gave me  a note here it is he says any body will give me money for it  and this was a bank note of  0 l which she pulled out of her bosom  i instantly thought of those lines of cowley which my dear lady several times made me read to her though these supposed an infinitely more excuseable case  marriage for money  take heed take heed thou lovely maid nor be by glittering ills betrayed thyself for money o let no man know the price of beauty fallen so low what dangers ought thou not to dread when love that is blind is by blind fortune led the result was he was to settle  00 l a year upon her and hers poor poor girl  and he was to own her as she calls it but as wife or mistress she stipulated not when his father died and he came into the title and estate  i told her it was impossible for me to conceal the matter from lady davers if she would not by her promises to be governed entirely by me and to abandon all thoughts of mr h give me room to conclude that the wicked bargain was at an end  and to keep the poor soul in some spirits and to enable her to look up and to be more easy under my direction i blamed him more than i did her though considering what virtue requires of a woman and custom has made shameless in a man i think the poor girl inexcuseable and shall not be easy while she is about me for she is more to blame because of the two she has more wit than the man  but what can i do miss if i put her away twill be to throw her directly into his hands he will not stay long and she may see her folly but here her eyes were open she knew what she had to trust to  and by their wicked beginning and her encouraging repulses i doubt she would have been utterly ruined that very day  i knew the rage lady davers would be in with both so this was another embarass and yet should my good intentions be frustrated and they should conclude their vile bargain and it appeared that i knew of it but would not acquaint her then should i have been blamed more than any mistress of a family being circumstancd as i am  upon the whole as to the girl i resolved to comfort her as well as i could till i had gained her confidence that my advice might have the more weight with her and by degrees be the more likely to reclaim her for poor soul there would be an end of her reputation the most precious of all jewels the moment the matter was known and that would be a sad thing  and as to the man i thought it best to take courage and you that know me will say i must have a good deal more than usual to talk to mr h on this subject  and the poor body consenting i should and with great protestations declaring her sorrow and repentance begging me to get her note of hand again on which she laid a foolish stress and desiring me to give him back his note of  0 l i went down to find him  he shunned me as a thief would a constable at the head of a hue and cry as i entered one place or room he went into another looking with conscious guilt but yet confidently humming a tune at last i fixed him speaking to rachel bidding her tell polly he wanted to send a message by her to her lady by which i doubted not he was desirous to know what she had owned in order to govern himself accordingly  his back was toward me and i said mr h here i am myself to take your commands  he gave a caper half a yard high  madam i wanted  i wanted to speak to  i would have spoken with   you wanted to send polly to me perhaps mr h to ask if i would take a little walk with you in the garden  very true madam  very true indeed  you have guessed the matter  i thought it was pity this fine day as every body was taking an airing   well then sir please to lead the way and i will attend you  yet i fansy madam the wind is a little too high for you  will not you catch cold  no never fear mr h i am not afraid of a little air  i will attend you presently madam you will be in the great gravel walk or on the terrace  i will wait upon you in an instant  i had the courage to take hold of his arm as if i had like to have slipped for thought i thou shall not see the girl worthy friend till i have talked to thee a little if thou do then  excuse me mr h  i hope i have not hurt my foot  i must lean upon you  will you be pleased madam to have a chair i fear you have spraind your foot  shall i help you to a chair  no no sir i shall walk it off if i hold by you  so he had no excuse to leave me and we proceeded into the garden but never did any thing look so silly  so like a foolish fellow as his aunt calls him he looked if possible half a dozen ways at once hemmed coughd wriggled about turned his head behind him every nowandthen and started half a dozen silly subjects in hopes to hinder me from speaking  i appeared i believe under some concern how to begin with him for he would have it i was not very well and begged he might step in one minute to desire mrs jervis to attend me  so i resolved to begin with him lest i should lose the opportunity seeing my eel so very slippery and placing myself at the seat at the upper end of the gravel walk i asked him to sit down he declined it and would wait upon me presently he said and seemed going so i began  it is easy for me mr h to penetrate the reason why you are so willing to leave me but it is for your own sake that i desire you to hear me that no mischief may ensue among friends and relations on an occasion to which you are no stranger  lord madam what can you mean  surely madam you dont think amiss of a little innocent liberty or so  mr h replied i i want not any evidence of your inhospitable designs upon a poor unwary young creature whom your birth and quality have found it too easy a task to influence  inhospitable designs madam  a harsh word by gad  you very nice ladies cannot admit of the least freedom in the world  why madam i have kissed a ladys woman before now in a civil way or so and never was called to an account for it as a breach of hospitality  it is not for me mr h said i to proceed to very nice particulars with a gentleman who can act as you have done by a poor girl that could not have had the assurance to look up to a man of your quality had you not levelled all distinction between you in order to level the weak creature to the common dirt of the highway i must tell you that the poor girl heartily repents of her folly and to show you that it signifies nothing to deny it she begs you will give her back the note of her hand you have extorted from her foolishness and i hope you will be so much of a gentleman as not to keep in your power such a testimony of the weakness of any of the sex  has she told you that madam  why maybe  indeed  i cannot but say  truly it may not look so well to you madam but young folks will have frolicks  it was nothing but a frolic  let me be hanged if it was  be pleased then sir to give up her note to me to return to her  reputation should not be frolickd with sir especially that of a poor girl who has nothing else to depend upon  i will give it to her myself and laugh at her into the bargain if you please madam why it is comical enough if the little pug thought i was in earnest i must have a laugh or two at her madam when i give it her up  mr h said i since it is but a frolic you will not take it amiss that when we are set down to supper we call polly in and demand a sight of her note and that will make every one merry as well as you  cotso madam that may not be so well neither  for perhaps they will be apt to think it is in earnest when as i hope to live it is but a jest nothing in the world else upon honor  i put on then a still more serious air  as you hope to live say you mr h  and upon your honor  how fear you not an instant punishment for this appeal and what is the honor you swear by  take that and answer me sir do gentlemen give away bank notes for frolicks and for mere jests and nothing in the world else  i am sorry to be obliged to deal thus with you but i thought i was talking to a gentleman that would not forfeit his veracity and that in so solemn an instance as this  he looked like a man thunderstruck his face was distorted and his head seemed to turn about upon his neck like a weathercock in a hurricane to all points of the compass his hands clenched as in a passion and yet shame and confusion struggling in every limb and feature  at last he said i am confoundedly betrayed but if i am exposed for the wretch thought of nobody but himself to my uncle and aunt i am undone and shall never be able to look em in the face it is true i had a design upon her and since she has betrayed me i think i may say that she was as willing almost as i  ungenerous contemptible wretch thought i  but our sex that can thus give up their virtue ought to expect no better for he that sticks not at one bad action will not scruple another to vindicate himself and so devillike become the tempter and the accuser too  but if you will be so good said he as to take no notice of this to my uncle and especially to my aunt and mr b i swear to you i never will think of her as long as i live  and you will bind this promise will you sir by your honor and as you hope to live  dear good madam forgive me i beseech you dont be so severe upon me by all that is   dont swear mr h but as an earnest that i may believe you give me back the girls foolish note that though it is of no signification she may not have that to witness to her folly  he took out his pocketbook there it is madam  and i beg you will forgive this attempt i see i ought not to have made it i doubt it was a breach of the laws of hospitality as you say but to make it known will only expose me and it can do no good and mr b will resent it maybe and my aunt will never let me hear the last of it nor my uncle neither  and i shall be sent to travel again  and added the poor creature i was once in a storm and the crossing the sea again would be death to me  what a wretch art thou thought i  what could such an one as thou find to say to a poor creature that if put in the scale against virtue and honor should make the latter kick the beam  poor poor polly barlow thou art sunk indeed too low for excuse and almost beneath pity  i told him if i could observe that nothing passed between them that should lay me under a necessity of revealing the matter i should not be forward to expose him nor the maiden either but that he must in his own judgment excuse me if i made every body acquainted with it if i were to see the correspondence between them likely to be renewed or carried on for added in that case i should owe it to myself to mr b to lord and lady davers and to you and the unhappy body too to do so  he would needs drop down on one knee to promise this and with a thousand acknowlegements left me to find mr colbrand in order to ride to meet the coach on its return  i went in and gave the foolish note to the silly girl which she received eagerly and immediately burnt and i told her i would not suffer her to come near me but as little as possible when i was in company while mr h staid but consigned her entirely to the care of mrs jervis to whom only i said i would hint the matter as tenderly as i could and for this i added i had more reasons than one first to give her the benefit of a good gentlewomans advice to which i had myself formerly been beholden and from whom i concealed nothing next to keep her out of mr hs way and lastly that i might have an opportunity from mrs jerviss opinion to judge of the sincerity of her repentance for polly said i you must imagine so regular and uniform as all our family is and so good as i thought all the people about me were that i could not suspect that she the duties of whose place made her nearest to my person was the farthest from what i wished  i have set this matter so strongly before her and mrs jervis has so well seconded me that i hope the best for the grief the poor creature carries in her looks and expresses in her words cannot be described frequently accusing herself with tears saying often to mrs jervis she is not worthy to stand in the presence of a mistress whose example she has made so bad an use of and whose lessons she had so ill followed  i am sadly troubled at this matter however but i take great comfort in reflecting that my sudden indisposition looked like a providential thing which may save one poor soul and be a seasonable warning to her as long as she lives  mean time i must observe that at supper last night mr h looked abject and mean and like a poor thief as i thought and conscious of his disappointed folly though i seldom glanced my eye upon him had less to say for himself than ever  and once my lady davers laughing said i think in my heart my nephew looks more foolish every time i see him than the last  he stole a look at me and blushed and my lord said jackey has some grace  he blushes  hold up thy head nephew  have thou nothing at all to say for thyself  sir jacob said a blush becomes a young gentleman  i never saw one before though in mr h  what is the matter sir  only said lady davers his skin or his conscience is mended that is all  thank you madam was all he said bowing to his aunt and affecting a careless yet confused air as if he whispered a whistle  oh wretch thought i see what it is to have a condemning conscience while every innocent person looks round unconscious smiling and erect  but yet it was not the shame of a bad action i doubt but being discovered and disappointed that gave him this confusion of face  what a sad thing it is for a person to be guilty of such actions as shall put it into the power of another even by a look to mortify him and if poor souls can be thus abjectly struck at such a discovery as this by a fellow creature how must they appear before an unerring and omniscient judge with a conscience standing in the place of a thousand witnesses  the words weeping and wailing howling and gnashing of teeth exceedingly well express what nothing but the divine book can equally express which in another place points them out as calling upon the mountains to fall upon them and the hills to cover them  how serious this subject makes one  saturday evening i am just retired from a kind of fatiguing service for who should come hither to dine with mr b but that sad rake sir charles hargrave and mr walgrave mr sedley and mr floyd three as bad as himself inseparable companions whose whole delight and that avowedly is drinking and hunting and lewdness but otherwise gentlemen of wit and large estates three of them broke in upon us at the sea vol ii p     hall on the happiest day of my life to our great regret and they had been long threatening to make this visit in order to see me as they told mr b  they whipped out two bottles of champaign instantly for a whet as they called it and went to view the stud and the kennel and then took a walk in the garden till dinner was ready my lord davers mr h and sir jacob as well as mr b for they are all acquainted accompanying them  sir charles it seems as lord davers told me afterward said he longed to see mrs b she was the talk wherever he went and he had conceived an high opinion of her beforehand  lord davers said i defy you gentlemen to think so highly of her as she deserves take mind and person together  mr floyd said he never saw any woman yet that came up to what he expected where fame had been lavish in her praise  but how brother baronet said sir charles to sir jacob came you to be reconciled to her  i heard that you would never own her  oons man said sir jacob i was taken in  i was by my soul  they contrived to clap her upon me as lady jenny c and pretended they would keep the other out of my sight and i was plaguily bit and forced to get off as well as i could  that was a bite indeed said mr walgrave and so you fell a praising lady jenny i warrant to the skies  ye  as  by my soul drawling out the affirmative monosyllable i was used most scurvily faith i was  i bear em a grudge for it still i can tell em that  for i have hardly been able to hold up my head like a man ever since  but am forced to sneak about and go and come and do as they bid me by my troth i never was so manageable in my life  your herefordshire neighbors sir jacob said mr sedley with an oath will rejoice to hear this for the whole county there cannot manage you  i am quite cowed now by my soul as you will see byandby nay for that matter if you can set mrs b a talking there is never a puppy of you all will care to open your lips except to say as she says  never fear old boy said sir charles well bear our parts in conversation i never saw the woman yet that could give me either awe or love for six minutes together what think you mr b have you any notion that your lady will have so much power over us  i think sir charles i have one of the finest women in england but i neither expect nor desire you rakes should see her with my eyes  you know if i have a mind to love her and make court to her too mr b i will and i am half in love with her already although i have not seen her  they came in when dinner was near ready and the four gentlemen took each a large bumper of old hock for another whet  the countess lady davers and i came down together the gentlemen knew our two noble guests and were known to them in person as well as by character mr b in his usual kind and encouraging manner took my hand and presented the four gentlemen to me each by his name sir charles said pretty bluntly that he hoped he was more welcome to me now than the last time he was under the same roof with me for he had been told since that that was our happy day  i said mr bs friends were always welcome to me  it is well madam said mr sedley we did not know how it was we should have quartered ourselves upon mr b for a week together and kept him up day and night  i thought this speech deserved no answer especially as they were gentlemen who wanted no countenance and addressed myself to lord davers who is always kindly making court to me i hope my good lord said i you find yourself quite recovered of your headache  of which he complained at breakfast  i thank you my dear sister pretty well  i was telling sir charles and the other gentlemen niece said sir jacob how i was cheated here when i came first with a lady jenny  it was a very lucky cheat for me sir jacob for it gave you a prepossession in my favor under so advantageous a character that i could never have expected otherwise  i wish said the countess my daughter for whom sir jacob took you had mrs bs qualities to boast of  how am i obliged to your ladyships goodness returned i when you treat me with even greater indulgence than you use to so beloved a daughter  nay now you talk of treating said sir charles when ladies will you treat our sex with the politeness which you show to one another  when your sex deserve it sir charles said lady davers  who is to be judge of that said mr walgrave  not the gentlemen i hope replied my lady  well then mrs b said sir charles we bespeak your good opinion of us for you have ours  i am obliged to you gentlemen but i must be more cautious in declaring mine lest it should be thought i am influenced by your kind and perhaps too hasty opinions of me  sir charles swore they had seen enough of me the moment i entered the parlour and heard enough the moment i opened my lips to answer for their opinions of me  i said i made no doubt when they had as good a subject to expatiate upon as i had in the pleasure before me of seeing so many agreeable friends of mr bs they would maintain the title they claimed to every ones good opinion  this said sir jacob is binding you over gentlemen to your good behavior  you must know my niece never shoots flying as you do  the gentlemen laughed is it shooting flying sir jacob returned sir charles to praise that lady  adsbud i did not think of that  o sir jacob said the countess you need not be at a fault  for a good sportsman always hits his mark flying or not and the gentlemen had so fair an one that they could not well miss it  you are fairly helped over the style sir jacob said mr floyd  and indeed i wanted it though i limpd like a puppy before i was lame one cannot think of every thing as one used to do at your time of life gentlemen  this flippant stuff was all that passed which i can recite for the rest at table and after dinner was too polite by half for me such as the quantity of wine each man could carry off that was the phrase dogs horses hunting racing cockfighting and all accompanied with swearing and cursing and that in good humor and out of wantonness the least excusable and most profligate sort of swearing and cursing of all loud laughing with a little touching nowandthen on the borders of sir simons beloved subject to try if they could make a lady show she understood their hints by her blushes see vol ii p      a certain indication that those who seek a blush in others are past it themselves and by their turning it into ridicule when they find it in their friends that they would not for the world have it imputed to them talking three or four at once and as loud as if they were in the field pursuing their game at a quarter of a miles distance from one another  these were the subjects and this the entertainment that held my ladies and me for one hour after a tedious dinner when we retired and glad we were to do so and so well did the gentlemen like the wine that we had the felicity to drink tea and coffee by ourselves only mr b upon our inviting the gentlemen to partake with us sliding in for a few minutes to tell us they would stick by what they had and taking a dish of coffee with us  i should not omit one observation that sir jacob when they were gone said they were pure company and mr h that he never was so delighted in his born days  while the two ladies put up their prayers that they might never have such another entertainment and being encouraged by their declaration i presumed to join in the same petition  yet it seems these are men of wit i believe they must be so  because i could neither like nor understand them  yet if their conversation had much wit in it i should think my ladies would have found it out  however this they did find out and agree in that these gentlemen were of the true modern cast of libertines and foxhunters and indifferently as they liked them could not be easily outdone by any of the same stamp in england  god defend my dear miss darnford and every worthy single lady from such an husband as a gentleman of this character would make  i wonder really how mr b who chooses not this sort of conversation and always whatever faults he had besides was a sober gentleman can sit for hours so easy and cheerful in it and yet he never says much when they are in their high delight  when all is done miss there are very unpleasant things which persons in genteel life are forced to put up with as well as those in lower and were the one to be balanced against the other the difference as to true happiness would not perhaps be so great as people in the latter imagine  if it did not turn in their favor well says the above quoted manuscript  we the discomforts know of what we are but little think what states superior share  the gentlemen permit me to add went away very merry to ride ten miles by owllight for they would not accept of beds here they had two french horns with them and gave us a blast or flourish or two at going off each had a servant besides but the way they were in would have given me more concern than it did had they been related to mr b and less used to it and indeed it is a happiness that such gentlemen take no more care than they generally do to interest any body intimately in their healths and preservation for these are all single men nor is the public any more than the private under any necessity to be much concerned about them for let such persons go when they will if they continue single their next heir cannot well be a worse commonwealthsman and there is a great chance he may be a better  you know i end my saturdays seriously and this to what i have already said makes me add that i cannot express how much i am my dear miss  your faithful and affectionate p b  letter xxxviii from mrs b to miss darnford in answer to letters xxxv and xxxvi my dear miss darnford i skip over the little transactions of several days to let you know how much you rejoice me in telling me see p     sir simon has been so kind as to comply with my wishes both your charming letters came to my hand together and i thank you an hundred times for them and i thank your dear mamma and sir simon too for the pleasure they have given me in this obliging permission how happy shall we be together but how long will you be permitted to stay though  all the winter i hope  and then when that is over let us set out together if god shall spare us directly for lincolnshire and so pass most of the summer too in each others company what a sweet thought is this  let me indulge it a little while  mr b read your letters and says you are a charming young lady and surpass yourself in every letter i told him that he was more interested in the pleasure i took in this favor of sir simons than he imagined as how my dear said he a plain case sir replied i for endeavoring to improve myself by miss darnfords conversation and behavior i shall every day be more worthy of your favor he kindly would have it that nobody no not miss darnford herself excelled me  it is right you know miss he should think so  though i must know nothing at all if i was not sensible how inferior i am to my dear miss darnford and yet when i look abroad nowandthen i could be a proud slut if i would and not yield the palm to many others  but dont let every body know how vain i am yet they may too if they take in at the same time that i have some excuse when i have won so happily the favor of two such judges as mr b and miss darnford and had the good fortune too to rejoice in that of lady davers and the countess of c  well my dear miss  sunday is past and gone as happily as the last the two ladies and at their earnest request sir jacob bearing us company in the evening part my polly was there morning and evening with her heart broken almost poor girl  i put her in a corner of my closet because her concern should not be minded mrs jervis gives me great hopes of her  and she seems to abhor the thought of mr h  but as there proves to be so little of real love in her heart though even if there had she would have been without excuse  is she not the wickeder by half for that miss to consent and take earnest as i may say to live with a man who did not pretend to marry her  how inexcusable this  what a frailty  yet so modest in appearance so honestly descended and an example so much better  forgive me to say  before her  dear dear how could it be  sir jacob was much pleased with our family order and said twas no wonder i kept so good myself that was his word and made others so and he was of opinion that the four rakes for he run on how much they admired me would be converted if they saw how well i passed my time and how cheerful and easy every one as well as myself was under it he said when he came home he thought he must take such a method himself in his family for he believed it would make not only better masters and mistresses but better children and better servants too but poor gentleman he has i doubt a great deal to mend in himself before he can begin such a practice with efficacy in his family  monday in the afternoon sir jacob took his leave of us highly satisfied with us both and particularly  so he said  with me and promised that my two cousins as he called his daughters  and his sister an old maiden lady if they went to town this winter should visit me and be improved by me  that was his word mr b accompanied him some miles on his journey attended by mr colbrand and abraham and the two ladies and lord davers and i took an airing in the coach  mr b was so kind as to tell me when he came home with a whisper that miss goodwin presented her duty to me  i have got a multitude of fine things for the dear little creature and mr b promises to give me a dairyhouse breakfast when our guests are gone  i enclose the history of this little charmer see vol ii p     and seq  by my beloveds consent since you are to do us the honor as he as well as i pleases himself to be one of our family  but keep it to yourself whatever you do i am guaranty that you will and have put it in a separate paper that you may burn it as soon as you have read it  for i shall want your advice maybe on this subject having a great desire to get this child into my possession and yet lady davers has given me an see p  0  of this volume hint that dwells a little with me when i have the pleasure i hope for i will lay all before you and be determined and proceed as far as i have power by you you my good father and mother know the story by my former papers  tuesday you must know i pass over the days thus swiftly not that i could not fill them up with writing as ample as i have done the former but having a mind to give you a general idea of our way of life and conversation and having gone through a whole week and more you may judge pretty well how it is one day with another nowandthen neighbourly visits received and paid needlework sometimes music nowandthen cards sometimes though i dont love them  one more benevolent round  improving conversations with my dear mr b and my two good ladies  a lesson when alone either in french or latin which my master always learns me on his knee  there is encouragement a new pauper case or two  a visit from the good dean  mr williamss departure in order to put the newprojected alteration in force which is to deprive me of my chaplain  by the way the dean is highly pleased with this affair and the motives for it mr adams being a favorite of his and a distant relation of his lady  mr hs and pollys mutual endeavor to avoid one another  my lessons to the poor girl and cautions as if she was my sister  these my dear miss and my honored father and mother are the pleasant employments of our time so far as we females are concerned  for the gentlemen hunt ride out and divert themselves in their way and bring us home the news and occurrences they meet with abroad and nowandthen a straggling gentleman they pick up in their diversions  and so i shall not enlarge upon these articles after the tedious specimens i have given already yet the particulars of one conversation possibly i may give you another time when i have least to do because three young ladies relations of mrs towers and mrs arthur were brought to visit me for the benefit of my instructions for that was the kind compliment of those ladies to me  wednesday could you ever have thought miss that husbands have a dispensing power over their wives which kings are not allowed over the laws i have this day had a smart debate with mr b and i fear it will not be the only one upon this subject can you believe that if a wife thinks a thing her duty to do and her husband does not approve of her doing it he can dispense with her performing it and no sin shall lie at her door mr b maintains this point i have great doubts about it particularly one that if a matter be my duty and he dispenses with my performance of it whether even although that were to clear me of the sin it will not fall upon himself and to be sure miss a good wife would be as much concerned at this as if it was to remain upon her yet he seems set upon it what can one do  did you ever hear of such a notion before miss of such a prerogative in a husband would you care to subscribe to it this is one of mr bs particularities he has several of them the effects as i take it of his former too free life polygamy as i have mentioned heretofore is another that is a bad one indeed yet he is not so determined on this as he seems to be on the other in a certain case that is too nice for me at present to explain to you and so i might as well have taken no notice of it as yet  only the argument was so present to my mind held within this hour and i write a journal you know of what passes but i will some time hence submit it at least to your judgments my father and mother you are well read in the scriptures and have gone through the occasion often and both mr b and i found our arguments on scripture though we are so different in our opinions he says my ladies are of his opinion i am afraid they are and so will not ask them but perhaps i may not live and other things may happen and so i will say no more of it at present for the sequel of this matter see vol iv p      thursday my lady urging me to procure her the verses you also desire about the love quarrel i this day prevailed upon mr b to favor me with a sight of them and he was so kind as to give us the following history of the parties and the quarrel  a fine gentleman his friend blessed with an ample fortune and extraordinary qualities but not free from faults as great as his perfections principally with regard to ladies was approved of by the parents of a lady beautiful as a may morning tender and meek as a lamb  and prudent and witty but so diffident that she had hardly a will of her own which subjected her to inconveniences  the gentleman made a campaign as a voluntier having a fondness for the miliary life and no inclination to marry but being slightly wounded and coming over to be cured and the match being proposed their fortunes very great on both sides he so well approved the proposal and the lady fell so much in love with him that it was in a manner concluded upon  the ladys uncle sir g k a man of a very waspish positive and sordid temper to whose large estate as well as her fathers the young lady was heiress opposes the match it is put off to please him the gentleman makes another campaign her father dies mean time leaving sir g her guardian but with express desire to see her married to that gentleman and no other sir g endeavors to bring about another match for the lady with a man of quality notwithstanding his brothers desire but the lady who had fixed her affections on the gentleman rejects the proposal and her lover coming over at the end of the campaign the lady consents to perform her fathers will a will so conformable to her own inclinations but would not fix the day till he had made up with her uncle and got his consent which the old spiteful knight was resolved not to give and for a great while the gentleman not to ask despising the knight and having a spirit above suppling himself to an unworthy mind for sordid interest sake  at last however she prevails her lover with no good will resolves to court sir george who to have a pretense to break the matter off treats him with great indignity setting his servants to insult him this the young gentleman resenting the knight following him with outrage to the top of a pair of stairs he twirled him from top to bottom almost and spraind the knights foot in the fall and went away with indignation  this being reported to the lady who lived not at that time with sir george but at her paternal seat and being greatly aggravated to her she flies to her uncle resolves to break with her lover and takes up her residence with sir george for a while the old knight keeping up her resentment and prevailing on her to refuse access to the man to whom she was betrothed believing poor lady that her affections were more in her own power than she afterward found them to her sorrow for she carried the point so far renouncing him through fresh aggravations invented against him though indeed he had formerly given himself too great liberties that he went abroad again giving her quite for lost and entered into other engagements which made them both unhappy to the end of their lives  this is the introduction as briefly as i can give it now come the verses in a letter from the lover when abroad to his friend who knew the whole transaction  fain would thou o my friend thou say in verse have me my last short interview rehearse with my maria once i thought her so but can a mind surcharged with so much woe harmoniously in easy numbers flow but yet to show your power and my esteem hard though it be your choice shall fix my theme by various means in vain i would often essayed to see and pacify the angry maid with idle tales still the malicious knight keeps up her wrath and hides her from my sight the more i beg the humbler i appear the haughtier stills the too resenting fair proud of her power she makes me meanly sue nor doubts to bring me to her uncles view thus barred access i by a common friend my innocence endeavor to defend our friend reports her temper fixed i find a way by letter to express my mind the haughty maid still with such anger burns the seal unbroke the suppliant scroll returns what can i do i hate myself to find such vile unwonted meanness in my mind for well thou know till so much excellence engaged my soul i scorned dull wedlocks fence and but i thought the charmer met my flame had never wished to propagate my name is not this very insolent miss did he not deserve some punishment but it seems he had a most noble mind great and good qualities though intermingled with bad ones as it is observable that those who have great beauties of mind have often great defects and that persons of parts seldom commit small faults you will find however that one reason though he puts it not ungenerously for his pride of spirit to the lady is he thinks she loves him and that to be sure she did or else a lady of her virtue would not have been betrothed to him with her own consent thus he proceeds making her however more obliged to his generosity than affection as one would think  now fearful that if i my former view the savage military life pursue the charming maid my innocence too late appearing should lament her newborn hate and her soft mind with loves extreme annoyed unable to support her present pride returning love should feel and she should grieve to find me gone and lost beyond retrieve charge to herself the ills that might attend the vagrant life of so sincere a friend lest this should be the case i write once more and humbly her returning love implore protest my innocence beg to be heard and claim but as i make it clear regard then fix a time for the angry fair to prove the happy impulse of rekindled love and vow if after that she hold her hate to quit my suit and seek a kinder fate this i resolve myself if speech denied humbly to offer at her chariotside next morn if she as usual shall repair to the delightful downs to take the air accordingly i mount my steed next morn about the time she used the meads tadorn the fairone comes  submissive i approach but oh her watchful dragons in the coach good morrow polly  john more gently drive  how can you thus my honest nature grieve too well you know your power but lovelyst maid sure you have not learnt your tyrant sexs trade o let me not your scorn the rather meet because you see me prostrate at your feet you know my temper long i cannot bear hard usage even from you once taught despair i am lost for ever  be you ever lost who finds you next will find you to their cost her uncle interrupts mean time i spy i think compassion in her downcast eye but yet the charming maid makes no reply her throbbing breasts thought i her mind confess she sighs but would her struggling sighs suppress this way and that she looks with wild amaze and down her cheeks a pearl escaped strays but soon alas this hopeful dawns overcast the beamy sunshine was too gay to last where are you niece her sordid uncle cries can he whod murder me delight your eyes i saw her temper hardning as i thought and her full mind with various passions fraught still more and more insulted by the knight i feared to act some rashness in her sight so fresh offense to avoid i in her lap with air submissive the fond letter drop this the lady as you will hear throws out of the coach to be sure as things had proceeded between them in a case of betrothment and she had acknowlegd her love to him it was enough to provoke such a high spirit  and see how her conduct surprises him but can it be believed  i sawt  these eyes beheld the fair with rage unwonted rise selfmovd the act her own  mine the reproach whirl it with wild disdain from out the coach my servant takes it up  judge my surprise  indeed i hardly could believe my eyes how art thou changed o charming maid can thou so soon forget what thou so late did vow can idle tales so much reverse my fate and so much love so soon be turned to hate but yet i think extremes can never last the maids all softness  when this storm is past her error seen love will again return and then she will with more generous ardor burn this rub surmounted sweet twill be to tell the different passions that our bosoms swell sweet will it be to hear the charmer own her faulty wrath and in my bosom moan the pangs she gave me promise future guard against my foes and all those pangs reward once more i will try but how or when or where can i have wished access the house of prayer when next she visits all serene her mind hopeful for who not mercy wants to find the gracious god of mercy peace and love propitious to her earnest wishes prove when she has offered up her prayers to heaven and hopes as she forgives to be forgiven here i will present my self and once more try if my fates fixed and if i cannot spy some rays relenting in her softened eye but if her usual piety the place the holy service alter not the case well may i then conclude no hope is left and that her heart of love to mes bereft well may i then my former schemes pursue and bid for ever love and her adieu when the next happy sabbath set apart to mend the mind and purify the heart oftwishd arrives impatient i repair with decent equipage to the house of prayer as up the ayle with mind disturbed i walk i find our difference made the gentrys talk see there  for so they said  the handsome squire see see his lovely mistress all on fire see whisper they she cannot stand his sight o born to plague each other and delight i take my seat sh averts her face thought i this sweet emotion sure should give me joy she cannot indiffrent be much less can hate the man who can this soft distress create well i forgive thee charmer and i know too much of love to make thee stoop too low i see thou love me still all all i fear is that vile demon uncle at thy ear   he then gives a pretty description of the country lads and lasses at church and ends it with a reflection that shows had the lady been less diffident of herself more diffident of those who hated her lover and had placed a greater confidence in the man she loved they might have been very happy together for he could not surely have a bad heart who could write thus it seems he was patron of the church thus he says i then look round and pleased behold the swains and guileless nymphs whom no vile action stains   i made polly read this piece to me to see i transcribed it right and when she came to this last line she was covered poor girl with blushes  read that again polly  and guileless nymphs read she blushing and weeping whom no  whom no  vile  vile  action  stains  with wholesome cheeks and neat from top to toe trip to their benches a delightful row and though as patron i have an upper seat i join in prayer with them and god entreat that at the last account in the great day when all distinctions set aside i may be found as worthy and be blessed as they then follow the lines i gave you in a former letter which will bear repeating  but oh forgive me heaven if often my fair robs thee of my devoir disturbs my prayer confounds my best resolves and makes me prove that she is too much a rival in thy love but better thoughts my happier hopes suggest when once this stormy doubts expelled my breast when once this agitated flame shall turn to steadier heat and more intensely burn my dear maria then thought i will join and we one heart one soul shall all be thine the service ended often in vain i watch a sidelong look or stolen glance to catch i am glad thought i thyself thou dare not trust nor glance this way for fear thou should be just to both our passions but this open war take care my fair thou carryst not too far once could i think thy sex in thee toostrong fair as thou art i could not bear it long i see i must go first the stubborn maid moves not her trembling feet nor turns her head meansould sir george i see thee as thou art thy rageswoln face displays thy rancrous heart trembling with malice and a thousand fears you are safe beneath the refuge of thy years the charmer mine thou know and must my fate in doubtful balance hang for thy estate and can the lovely maid so sordid be to bow herself and hope to supple me to views so mean  empire itself cannot have attractions strong enough my mind tenslave if this must be the case my fair adieu i wonot stoop thus low  not even for you i quit my seat and ere i am well aware bow to the pew that holds the averted fair walk slowly down my tenants in a row with grateful blessings hail me as i go for well thou know by no rackrents oppressed they are honest to their landlord and their priest the meaning of this mr b explained that it was the gentlemans custom whenever he granted or renewed a lease which he always did without exacting a fine of the descendants of the old tenants to the estate to remind the tenant that he let him but nine parts of his farm that he might think himself concerned in conscience to pay the tenth where due a method mr b always takes on the like occasions  as through the porch to trifle time i pass call by their name each neighboring lad and lass ask honest roger how my godson thrives if ready for his second coat  the wives i see not of their health inquire  i know what keeps em hence  ha william int it so increasing blessings  ah your honors right when was she brought to bed  at ten last night what has god sent her  oh a thumping boy welcome the little stranger  give her joy from me tell her i will not forget her and every day be sure you love her better it seems miss that if he stood not himself or procured not gossips for the christening of the children of his poorer tenants he always sent them a large rich cake and good store of sugar sack and october on the occasion what pity such good qualities had any intermixtures  now comes the haughty maid led by the knight so late my joy my rapture and delight her sullen aspect well i see reveals she cherishes resentment through false tales and balances my love in passions partial scales the timorous knight conscious of his deserts quits the fair prize and to the chariot starts her halfunwilling hand i seize to lead her to her chariot and thus whispering plead o hear me polly  shall the partial knight thy halfsould uncle banish me thy sight conscious of native honor faithful true my souls highset and cannot meanly sue it is not my happiness i wish alone in seeking thee but heavens my judge thy own our fortunes famlies thy dear parents will all give thee mine and pardon if i have skill thy own kind wishes yea thy plighted vows confirm the choice thou can no other spouse faults black enough i own my life have cursed but oh long since dear maid thoust known the worst against myself i have always owned the truth and thoust forgiven the lapses of my youth with scorn she turns her lovely face  no more urge thy vain suit but quit my chariotdoor if ever i wished thee well know now my hate exceeds my former love  i am fixed as fate one visit more permit if i not prove i am greatly wronged for ever renounce my love i would clear the matter up  indeed i am loath to take such measures as may hurt us both when past recall thou findst my innocence thou wilt wish thou would heard me in my own defense go where thou will so i never see thee more nor hear thy name once mentioned in my door i shall be happy happy may thou be whatever fate betides unhappy me in twelve diurnal suns if i not hear thoust changed thy mind i surely disappear the wanderer then takes place and thou in vain shall wish the unhappy fugitive again with fixed disdain she to her chariot flings draws up the glass and leaves me with a thousand stings adieu dear maid  may never returning love give thee this action rash to disapprove unhappy will thou be nor blame me for it if thou the heroine still can not support i will stay the promised time but faintly burns that love which not in twelve days space returns forgive my friend this tedious scrawl it is hard to quit the subjects of our first regard once love takes place no other subject shares our thoughts for love absorbs all other cares i turn about assume a sprightly air salute the gentry round to hide my care haste to my chariot with the reverend priest with cheerful visage but with heart oppressed the gentry censure as they pass along the unusual scene nor less the rural throng some sad offense they cry must sure be meant that so much sweetness could so much resent some say twas this some that some layt to spite but most agree to blame the rancrous knight but each young lady does her triumph show that lady l has brought his pride so low our sex is well revenged the fairones cry look to it how ye offend their lovers by the threatening fan and the arch look revere and my unwonted tameness justly jeer now my best friend i am got to foreign shores i charge thee tell me not the fair deplores her rashness past that love once more returns in her soft breast but that her wrath still burns still hardens her dear heart believes m offense and banishes my love for ever thence for oh should she relent one torment know now it is too late twould fill my mind with woe preserve her bounteous heaven conserve her free from every thought of love and every thought of me till you shall raise for her some finished youth worthy if man can be her charms her truth her piety and may the fairone see those many happy years she hoped once with me i expect miss you will thank me for this piece which is in no other hand and was not so much as transcribed before by any body but mr b was so obligingly kind to us both as to say he would deny nothing to me that he thought would enable me to give miss darnford pleasure  friday mr h and my lord and lady davers and the excellent countess of c  having left us this day a good deal to my regret and as it seemed to their own the former put the following letter into my hands with an air of respect and even reverence  dear good madam i cannot content myself with common thanks on leaving yours and mr bs hospitable house because of that there affair which i need not mention and truly am ashamed to mention as i have been to look you in the face ever since it happened i dont know how it came about but i thought but at first of joking a little or so and seeing polly heard me with more attentiveness than i expected i was encouraged to proceed and so now i recollect it came about  but she is innocent for me and i dont know how that came about neither for we were out one moonlight night together in the garden walking about and afterward took a nap of two hours i believe in the summer house in the little garden being overpowered with sleep for i would make her lay her head upon my breast till before we were aware we fell asleep together but before that we had agreed on what you discovered  this is the whole truth and all the intimacies we ever had to speak of but i believe we should have been better acquainted had you not luckily for me prevented it by being at home when we thought you abroad for i was to come to her when she hemmed two or three times for having made a contract you know madam it was natural enough to take the first occasion to put it in force  she could not keep her own secret and may have told you more perhaps than is true so what i write is to clear myself and to tell you how sorry i am in such a good house as yours and where there is so much true godliness that i should ever be drawn away to have a thought to dishonor it but i will take care of being overfamiliar for the future with underlings for see how a man may be taken in  if she had resented it at first when i began to kiss her or so for you know we young fellows will take liberties sometimes where they dont become us to our own disparagements chiefly that is true i should have had an awe upon me or if she had told you or but said she would i should have flown as soon as had any thoughts further about the matter  but what had one of our sex to do you know madam when they find little resistance and that she would stand quietly and tell no tales and make no great struggle and not keep out of ones way neither but to dillydally on till one brought it to more than one at first intended  poor polly i pity her too dont think the worse of her dear madam so as to turn heraway because it may be her ruin i dont desire to see her i might have been drawn in to do strange foolish things and been ruined at the long run for who knows where this thing might have ended my uncle would have never seen me my father too his lordship you know madam is a very cross man and never loved me much might have cut off the intail my aunt would have despised me and scorned me i should have been her foolish fellow in earnest not in jest as now you would have resented it and mr b who knows might have called me to account for he is bloody passionate i saw that at the hall and has fought two or three duels as i have heard for abusing the freedom of his house and breaking the laws of hospitality as you told me and so it is not unlikely i might have died like a dog in a ditch and there would have been an end of a noble family that have been peers of the realm time out of mind what a sad thing would this have been a public as well as private loss for you know madam what my lady countess said and nobody says better things or knows more of the matter than her ladyship that every peer of the realm is a jewel in the crown a fine saying god grant i may keep it in mind when my time comes and my father shall happen to die  well but good madam can you forgive me you see how happy i am in my disappointment but i must take another sheet of paper  i did not think to write so much  for i dont love it but on this occasion know not how to leave off  i hope you can read my letter i know i write a clumsy hand and spell most lamentably for i never had a talent for these things i was readier by half to admire the orchardrobbing picture in lilys grammar than any other part of the book excuse my nonsense madam but many a time have i helped to fill a satchel and always supposed that picture was put there on purpose to tell boys what diversions are allowed them and are proper for them several of my schoolfellows took it for granted as well as i and we could never reconcile it to our reason why we should be punished for practicing a lesson taught us by our grammars  but hey whither am i running i never writ to you before and never may again unless you or mr b command it for your service so pray excuse me madam  i know i need give no advice to polly to take care of first encouragements poor girl she might have suffered sadly as well as i  for if my father and my uncle and aunt had required me to turn her off you know it would have been undutiful to have refused them notwithstanding our bargain and want of duty to them would have been to have added fault to fault as you once observed i remember that one fault never comes alone but draws after it generally five or six to hide or vindicate it and they every one perhaps as many more each  i shall never forget several of your wise sayings i have been vexed may i be hanged if i have not many a time that i could not make such observations as you make who am so much older too and a man besides and a peers son and a peers nephew but my talents lie another way and by that time my father dies i hope to improve myself in order to cut such a figure as may make me be no disgrace to my name or country for i shall have one benefit over many young lords that i shall be more fond of making observations than speeches and so shall improve of course you know  well but what is all this to the purpose  i will keep close to my text and that is to thank you dear madam for all the favors i have received in your house to thank you for disappointing me and for convincing me in so kind yet so shaming a manner how wrong i was in the matter of that polly and for not exposing my folly to any body but myself for i should have been ready to hang myself if you had and to beg your pardon for it and to assure you that i will never offer the like as long as i breathe i am madam with the greatest respect  your most obliged most faithful and most obedient humble servant j h pray excuse blots and blurs     well miss darnford what shall we say to this fine letter  you will allow it to be an original i hope yet maybe not for how does one know but it may be as well written and as sensible a letter as this class of people generally write  but what then shall we be able to say for such poor creatures of our sex as are taken in as mr h calls it by such pretty fellows as this who if they may happen to write better hardly think better or design to act better and are not so soon brought to repentance and promises of amendment  mr h dresses well is not a contemptible figure of a man laughs talks where he can be heard and his aunt is not present  and cuts to use his own word a considerable figure in a country town  but see  yet i will not say what i might  he is lord daverss nephew and if he makes his observations and forbears his speeches i mean can be silent and only laugh when he sees somebody of more sense laugh and never approve or condemn but in leadingstrings he may possibly pass in a crowd of gentlemen  but poor poor polly barlow what can i say for polly barlow  i have a time in view when possibly my papers may fall under the inspection of a dear gentleman to whom next to god i am accountable for all my actions and correspondencies so i will either write an account of the matter and seal it up separately for mr b or at a proper opportunity will break it to him and let him know under secrecy if i can engage him to promise it the steps i took in it for fear something should arise hereafter when i cannot answer for myself to render any thing dark or questionable in it a method i believe very proper to be taken by every married lady and i presume the rather to say so having had a good example for it for i have often thought of a little sealdup parcel of papers my lady made me burn in her presence about a month before she died  they are pamela said she such as i have no reason to be concerned about let who will see them could they know the springs and causes of them but for want of a clue my son might be at a loss what to think of several of those letters were he to find them in looking over my other papers when i am no more  let me add that nothing could be more endearing than our parting with our noble guests my lady repeated her commands for what she often engaged me to promise that is to say to renew the correspondence begun between us so much as she was pleased to say to her satisfaction  i could not help showing her ladyship who was always inquiring after my writing employment most of what passed between you and me miss and she admires you much and wished mr h had more wit that was her word she should in that case she said be very glad to set on foot a treaty between you and him  but that i fansy can never be tolerable to you and i only mention it en passant  there is a french woman for you  the countess was full of her kind wishes for my happiness and my lady davers told me that if i could give them timely notice she would be present on a certain occasion  but my dear miss what could i say  i know nothing of the matter  only that i am a sad coward and have a thousand anxieties which i cannot mention to any body  but if i have such in the honorable estate of matrimony what must those poor souls have who have been seduced and have all manner of reason to apprehend that the crime shall be followed by a punishment so natural to it a punishment in kind as i may say which if it only ends in forfeiture of life following the forfeiture of fame must be thought merciful and happy beyond expectation for how shall they lay claim to the hope that is given to persons in their circumstance that they shall be saved in childbearing since the condition is if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety  now my honored mother and my dear miss since i am upon this affecting subject does not this text seem to give a comfortable hope to a virtuous woman who shall die in this circumstance that she shall be happy in the divine mercies for the apostle in the context says that he suffers not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence  and what is the reason he gives why a reason that is a natural consequence of the curse on the first disobedience that she shall be in subjection to her husband  for says he adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression as much as to say had it not been for the woman adam had kept his integrity and therefore her punishment shall be as it is said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow in thy conception in sorrow shall thou bring forth children  and thy husband shall rule over thee but nevertheless if thou shall not survive the sharpness of thy sorrow thy death shall be deemed to be such an alleviation of thy part of the intailed transgression that thou shall be saved if thou have continued in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety  this my honored parents and my dear friend is my paraphrase and i reap no small comfort from it when i meditate upon it  but i shall make you as serious as myself and my dear miss perhaps frighten you from entering into a state in which our poor sex suffer so much from the bridal morning let it rise as gayly as it will upon a thoughtful mind to that affecting circumstance throughout its whole progression for which nothing but a tender a generous and a worthy husband can make them any part of amends  and when one is so blessed one has so many fears added to ones sorrows and so much apprehension through human frailty of being separated from so beloved a partner that a body had need of all ones fortitude to support ones self but maybe i am the weakest and most apprehensive of my sex  maybe i am  and when one sees how common the case is and yet how few die in it how uneasy many ladies are not to be in this circumstance my good lady davers particularly at times and rachel and hannah in holy writ and then how a childless estate might lessen one in the esteem of ones husband one ought to bring these considerations in balance and to banish needless fears and so i will if i can  but a word or two more as to the parting with our honored guests i was a little indisposed and my ladies would excuse me against my will from attending them in the coach some miles which their dear brother did both ladies most tenderly saluted me twice and thrice apiece folding their kind arms about me and wishing my safety and health and charging me to think little and hope much for they saw me thoughtful at times though i endeavored to hide it from them  my lord davers was pleased to say with a goodness of temper that is his peculiar my dearest dear sister  may god preserve you  and multiply your comforts i shall pray for you more than ever i did for myself though i have so much more need of it  i must leave you  but i leave a lady that i love and honor next to lady davers and ever shall  mr h looked conscientiously silly  i can say nothing madam  but saluting me that i shall never forget your goodness to me  adding in his frothy way now can i say i have saluted an angel if ever there was an angel on earth  i had before in mrs jerviss parlour taken leave of mrs worden and mrs lesley my ladys women they each stole as it were at the same time a hand of mine and kissed it begging pardon as they said for the freedom but i answered taking each by her hand and kissing her i shall always think of you with pleasure my good friends for you have encouraged me constantly by your presence in my private duties and may god bless you and the worthy families you so laudably serve as well for your sakes as their own  they turned away with tears and mrs worden would have said something to me but could not  only both taking mrs jervis by her hand happy happy mrs jervis said they almost in a breath  and happy happy i too repeated i in my mrs jervis and in such kind and worthy wellwishers as mrs worden and mrs lesley wear this mrs worden wear this mrs lesley for my sake  and i gave each of them a ring with a crystal and brilliants set about it which my dearest mr b had bought a week before for this very purpose for he has a great opinion of both the good folks and often praised their prudence and their quiet and respectful behavior to every body so different from the impertinence that was his word of most ladies women who are favorites  mrs jervis said i have enjoyed many happy hours in your conversation mrs worden and mrs lesley i shall miss you very much  i must endeavor said i taking her hand to make it up to you my good friend as well as i can and of late we have not had so many opportunities together as i should have wished had i not been so agreeably engaged as you know  so we must each try to comfort the other when we have lost i such noble and you such worthy guests  mrs jerviss honest heart before touched by the parting showed itself at her eyes  wonder not my good friends said i to the two gentlewomen wiping with my handkerchief her venerable cheeks that i always endeavor thus to dry up all my good mrs jerviss tears and then i kissed her thinking of you my dear mother and i was forced to withdraw a little abruptly lest i should be too much moved myself because i was going up to our noble guests who had they inquired into the occasion would perhaps have thought it derogatory though i should not to my present station and too much retrospecting to my former  i could not in conversation between mr b and myself when i was gratefully expatiating upon the amiable characters of our noble guests and of their behavior and kindness to me help observing that i had little expected from some see vol ii p     hints which formerly dropped from mr b to find my good lord davers so polite and so sensible a nobleman  he is a very goodnatured man replied mr b i believe i might once or twice drop some disrespectful words of him but it was the effect of passion at the time and with a view to two or three points of his conduct in public life for which i took the liberty to find fault with him and received very unsatisfactory excuses one of these i remember particularly was in a conference between a committee of each house of parliament in which he behaved in a way i could not wish from a gentleman so nearly allied to me by marriage for all he could talk of was the dignity of their house when the reason of the thing was strong with the other and it fell to my lot to answer what he said which i did with some asperity which occasioned a coolness between us for some time  but no man makes a better figure in private life than lord davers especially now that my sisters good sense has got the better of her passions and she can behave with tolerable decency toward him for formerly pamela it was not so the violence of her spirit making him appear in a light too little advantageous either to his quality or merit but now his lordship improves upon me every time i see him  you know not my dear continued mr b what a disgrace a haughty and passionate woman brings upon her husband and upon herself too in the eye of her own sex as well as ours nay even those ladies who would be as glad of dominion as she if they might be permitted to exercise it despise others who do and the man most who suffers it  and let me tell you my pamela said the dear gentleman with an air that showed he was satisfied with his own conduct in this particular that you cannot imagine how much a lady owes to her husband as well with regard to her own peace of mind as to both their reputations however it may go against the grain with her sometimes if he be a man who has discretion to keep her incroaching passions under a genteel and reasonable control  how do you like this doctrine miss  i will warrant you believe that i could do no less than drop mr b one of my best courtsies in acknowlegement of my obligation to him for so considerately preserving to me my peace of mind and my reputation as well as his own in this case  but after all when one duly weighs the matter i cannot tell but what he says may be right in the main for i have not been able to contradict him partial as i am to my sex when he has pointed out to me instances in the behavior of certain ladies who like children the more they have been humored the more humoursome they have grown which must have occasioned as great uneasiness to themselves as to their husbands will you excuse me miss  this is between ourselves for i did not own as much to mr b  for one should not give up ones sex you know if one can help it for the men will be as apt to impose as the ladies to incroach i doubt  well but here my honored father and mother and my dear miss darnford at last i end my journalwise letters as i may call them our noble guests being gone and our time and employments rolling on in much the same manner as in the past days of which i have given an account  if any thing new or uncommon or more particularly affecting to me than usual occurs i shall not fail to trouble you with it as i have opportunity but i have now my correspondence with lady davers to resume and how shall i do about that  oh i can easily tell it is but trespassing a little on your indulgent allowance for me my everdear parents  and you my dear miss will find it a relief instead of an occasion for regret to be eased of a great many impertinencies which i write to you in my hearts confidence and in the familiarity of friendship  besides i shall have the happiness of changing our papercorrespondence into personal conversation with you when at london  and what a sweet change for me will that be  i will end with the joyful thought and with the assurance that i am  my dearest father and mother and bestbeloved miss your dutiful and affectionate p b  letter xxxix my dear miss darnford i hear that mrs jewkes is in no good state of health i am very sorry for it i pray for her life that she may be a credit if it please god to the penitence she has so lately assumed  for if she die it will look discouraging to some thoughtless minds who penetrate not the methods providence takes with its poor creatures that as soon as she had changed her manner of living and was in a reformed state she was taken away though it is certain that a person is fittest to die when worthiest to live and what a mercy will it be to her if she should not live long that she saw her errors and repented before twas too late  do my dear good miss vouchsafe to the poor soul the honor of a visit she may be lowspirited  she may be too much sunk with the recollection of past things  comfort with that sweetness which is so natural to miss darnford her drooping heart and let her know that i have a true concern for her and give it her in charge to take care of herself and spare nothing that will administer either to her health or peace of mind  you will pardon me my dear miss that i put you upon such an office an office indeed unsuitable from a lady in your station to one in hers but not to your piety and charity where a duty so eminent as that of visiting the sick and chearing the doubting mind is in the question  i know your condescension will give her great comfort and if she should be hastening to her account what a pleasure will it give such a lady as you to have illuminated a benighted mind when it was tottering on the verge of life  but i hope she will get the better of her indisposition and live many years a thankful monument of gods mercies and to do more good by her example in the latter part of her life than she may possibly have done evil in the former  i know she will want no spiritual help from good mr peters but then the kind notice of so generally esteemed a young lady will raise her more than can be imagined for there is a tenderness a sympathy in the good persons of our sex to one another that while the best of the other seem but to act as in office saying to one those things which though edifying and convincing one is not certain proceeds not rather from the fortitude of their minds than the tenderness of their natures mingles from sex to sex with ones very spirits thins the animal mass and runs through ones heart in the same lify current i cannot cloathe my thought suitably to express what i would express giving assurance as well as pleasure in the most arduous cases and brightening our misty prospects till we see the sun of righteousness rising on the hills of comfort and dispelling the heavy fogs of doubt and diffidence  this it is makes me wish and long as i do for the company of my dear miss darnford o when shall i see you when shall i  to speak to circumstance it is all i long for and pardon my freedom of expression as well as thought when i let you know in this instance how early i experience the ardent longings of one in the way i am in  but i ought not to set my heart upon any thing that is not in my own power and which may be subject to accidents and the control of others but let whatever interventions happen so i have your will to come i must be rejoiced in your kind intention although your power should not prove answerable  and now my dearest honored mother let me tell you that i build no small consolation in the hope that i shall on a certain occasion have your presence and be strengthened by your advice and comfortings for this was a proposal of the best and most considerate of gentlemen who is every day if he but sees the least thoughtfulness upon my brow studying to say or to do something to dispel it but i believe it is the grateful sense i have of his goodness to me that makes me thus overanxious for the apprehensions of a separation from such an excellent husband from hopes so chearing prospects so delightful must at times affect one let ones affiance and desires be ever so strong where they ought to be preferably placed  then one would live to do a little more good if one might  i am a sad weak apprehensive body to be sure i am how much better fitted for the contingencies of life are the gay frolic minds that think not of any thing before it comes upon them than such thoughtful futuritypokers as me  but why should i trouble you my honored and dear friends with my idle fears and follies  just as if nobody was ever in my circumstance before  yet weak and apprehensive spirits will be gloomilyaffected sometimes and how can one help it  and if i may not hope for the indulgent soothings of the best of parents and of my miss darnford in whose bosom besides can one disburden ones heart when oppressed by too great a weight of thought  you will come and be in the house with me my dear mother for some time when my best friend sends to you  will not you  and you will spare my dear mother my best of fathers will not you  yes yes i am sure ye will  and i am sure my miss darnford will be with me if she can and these are my comforts but how i run on  for i am so much a novice that   but i will say no more than that i am my honored father and mother your everdutiful daughter and my dear miss darnford  your affectionate and obliged p b  the end of vol iii
