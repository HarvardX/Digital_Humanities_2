know that i was dead but in fact i only received a flesh wound in a quarrel  a fainting fit succeeded the loss of blood and gave occasion to the report of my death  but the moment i recovered strength enough to travel i mounted my horse and set out to pay my respects and keep my engagement   don ped i really dont know what to say to it  you have the appearance of a gentleman but i have had such assurances that don felix was dead that unless i have some strong proofs to the contrary  you will pardon me sir  i mean no harm  but truly in a matter of this consequence a little caution you know

obliquely at opposite sides of the stage as entrances to different chambers enter lazarillo lazar i have often heard that gentlemen that is fine gentlemen had no conscience but i believe the truth is they have no stomachs they seem to think of every thing but eating and for my part i think of nothing else but here comes one of my masters   enter clara with a paper clara has don pedro been here to enquire for me   lazar truly sir i cannot tell   clara was he here   lazar ay that he was certainly   clara did he leave nothing with you for me   lazar not that i know of   clara what no money   lazar money   clara ay money  i expected a purse with  00 pistoles   lazar i believe i have made a small mistake the purse belongs to this master and i gave it to the other aside are you certain you expected a purse with  00 pistoles   clara certain  yes  what does the fellow stare at   lazar you are sure they were not for another gentleman that shall be nameless   clara is the booby drunk   lazar it must be with wind then why sir i did receive a purse with the sum you mention and from don pedro but whether it was intended for you is a point that requires some consideration   clara what did don pedro say to you   lazar i will tell you sir friend says don pedro there are  00 pistoles for your master   clara well dolt head and who is your master   lazar there is the point now  there is the puzzle ah sir there are many things you would not find it easy to explain though you was educated at salamanca and are no doubt a great scholar   clara give me the money fool and no more of your impertinence   lazar there it is sir heaven do you good with it i think i know some people who would be glad of just than sum especially if they thought they had a right to it   clara no more  i expect don pedro bid borachio get a good dinner and here take this letter of credit lock it up carefully i shall have occasion for a good deal of cash and this way it is most portable be careful of it

comes borachio  i will try if my host understands any thing of a table  enter borachio signior borachio or master borachio or don joseph de borachio you come most opportunely we must have a dinner immediately   bora name your hour i am always prepared two hours hence an hour half an hour  my cooks are the readiest fellows    lazar ay but this must not be one of your every day dinners the first thing comes to hand tossed up and warmed over again neither hot nor cold like a day in the beginning of april  that is villainous   bora do you think i have kept the first tavern in the city so long not to know how to please a gentleman   lazar some gentlemen are easily pleased other gentlemen are hard to be pleased now i am of the latter order   bora gentleman forsooth   lazar a gentlemans gentleman that is my masters master in most things but in the business of his eating absolute and uncontrollable   bora very well sir then let me know your orders   lazar master borachio learn to respect a man of science i lived two years with a canon of the estremadura  the greatest eater in all portugal a churchman who did not eat to live but lived to eat  he thought of nothing else dreamt of nothing else i have rode ten miles in a morning to get him a partridge that fed upon green corn and a black lobster with the pea in it what do you think he discharged me for   bora good faith i know not   lazar for putting six pullets eggs into a venison pasty   bora indeed   lazar if i had robbed a church and committed sacrilege he could not have been more outrageous he called it blasphemy a crying sin against the first elements of cookery i see him this moment before me  his huge paunch blown up like a feather bed his gouty legs resting on two down pillows his eyes sparkling his mouth watering the napkin tucked under his rosy gills and the whole pie devoured in imagination before he had tasted a morsel of it but when it was uncovered when he saw the eggs  ass blockhead villain cried he eggs in a brown pie eggs in a brown pie out of my sight and let me never see thee more   bora was there no way to appease him   lazar i knew it was in vain so did not attempt it  but come master borachio let us have your idea of a dinner   bora to courses to be sure   lazar two courses and a desert   bora five in the first and seven in the second   lazar good   bora why in the middle i would have a rich savoury soup   lazar made with crawfish  good   bora at the top two delicate white trout just fresh from the river   lazar good excellent go on go on   bora at the bottom a roast duck   lazar a scavanger an unclean bird a wadling glutton his bill is a shovel and his body but a dirtcart away with your duck  let me have a roast turkey plump and full breasted his craw full with marrow   bora you shall have it   lazar now for the side dishes   bora at one side stewed venison at the other an english plum pudding   lazar an english plum pudding that is a dish i am a stranger to how do you make it   bora you take a proper quantity of plums and raisins spice marrow and brandy crumbs of bread and flower mix them well together boil it and so serve it up to table   lazar it soulds like a recipe to an apothecary i will try it the english are a good sort of a rich proud melancholy generous unreasonable seafaring sort of people fight too like their own mastiffs and bear taxes as an elephant does palanquins and rice bags but i am not very fond of their cookery now signior borachio to your second course   bora roast lamb at the top partridge at the bottom jelly and omlette on one side pig and ham at the other and olla podrida in the middle   lazar all wrong all wrong  what should be at the top you put at the bottom and two dishes of pork at the same side it will not do  it will never do i tell you   bora how would you have it i can order it no better   lazar it will never do mind i dont find fault with the things the things are good enough very good but half the merit of a service consists in the manner in which you put it on the table pig and ham at the same side why you might as well put a hebrew jew into the same stall at church with the grand inquisitor mind me do but mind me see now suppose this floor was the table goes upon one knee and tears the bank note left him by his master here is the top and there is the bottom  put your partridge here  places a piece of the bank note your lamb there  another piece of the bank note there is top and bottom your jelly in the middle  another piece of the note olla podrida and pig at this side together  two pieces of the note and the omlette and ham at this   two pieces more of the note there is a table laid our for you as it should be   looking at it with great satisfaction enter clara and don pedro clara hey day what are you about on your knees there   lazar showing mine host how to lay out your honors dinner i am no novice at these matters  i will venture a wager  there are the dishes   clara get up puppy  what is this as i live the letter of credit i left with him to put up for me all torn to pieces   lazar oh the devil i was so full of the dinner every thing else slipped out of my memory aside upon my soul sir i quite forgot it i was so taken up about the main chance i quite forgot the value of the paper   clara dolt idiot a letter of credit for no less than four hundred pistoles  what amends can you make for such inconceivable stupidity   bora to lazarillo the merit of a dinner consists you know in the manner in which you put the things on the table this was a confounded dear dinner truly   lazar plague upon it it was your fault and not mine it never would have happened if you had served up the course properly  pig and ham at the same side such a blunder was never heard of   clara to don pedro what can i do with this fellow   don ped the mischief is not without remedy you must take up the pieces join them and paste them on a sheet of paper your bankers will not refuse it   clara hear you  do you understand don pedro   lazar perfectly but in truth sir borachios stupidity was enough to drive every thing out of ones memory he wanted sir    clara silence take these fragments and join them as don pedro directed you make haste and attend at dinner   lazar yes sir they will make twenty mistakes if i am not present to direct them   exit don ped really young gentleman nothing could be more apropos than your arrival a days delay longer had lost you your mistress and a good portion into the bargain have you seen any thing of ferdinand your rival since   clara yes and was upon the point of a most desperate combat but your daughter stepped in and he ran to her for protection but i frightened him soundly   don ped indeed   clara it must be some very great some extraordinary provocation makes me draw but when once my sword is out i am never tired of fighting it is as natural to me as the clothes on my back   don ped i dont doubt it i dont doubt it i was the same myself when i was young but what with a little gout and rheumatism in my arms and better than three score years over my head my appetite for the duello is somewhat abated

flourishing a long toledo   clara leave him to me i can manage him as easily as his son i would as soon fight two as one of them   don ped don sancho besides was bred a soldier commerce and money dealing have been my business to take a man in his own trade is a great disadvantage i might as soon think of working miracles with st jago or killing a man secundumartem with doctor fillgrave the first physician in granada   clara right sir right leave it to me and you shall never hear more of it   don ped it is not that i am afraid only being out of practice i am a little unwilling   clara i understand i understand i have felt just the same way more than once   don ped to think at my time of life of fighting myself out of the world with cold iron when fur and flannel can hardly keep me warm in it would be a very absurd piece of precipitation   clara you are perfectly right   don ped then do you consider how difficult it is to bring an old man up to my years as to your young people they die and are born every hour few of them come to maturity and no great matter  but a hale healthy stout old man as i am is invaluable your young puny tender shrubs are not missed from a plantation but if the old tree falls think what a length of time it requires to replace him my eyes run over when i reflect upon it   clara no wonder there is something very melancholy in the idea   don ped that all the care i took of myself should be thrown away  never exposing myself to the night air never fatiguing myself beyond a gentle perspiration so careful of my diet so regular in my hours so chaste in my amors and after all this in the evening of my days to have a long spado run through my guts and look like a bluebreechd fly with a corking pin sticking in it   clara say no more say no more
