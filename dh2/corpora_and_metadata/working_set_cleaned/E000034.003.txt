mathematics  mathematics originally signified any kind of discipline or learning but now it is taken for that science which teaches or contemplates whatever is capable of being numbered or measured that part of the mathematics which relates to numbers only is called arithmetic and that which is concerned about measure in general whether length breadth motion force c is called geometry as to the usefulness of arithmetic it is well known that no business commerce trade or employment whatsoever even from the merchant to the shopkeeper c can be managed and carried on without the assistance of numbers for by these the trader computes the value of all sorts of goods that he dealeth in does his business with ease and certainty and informs himself how matters stand at any time with respect to men money or merchandise to   profit and loss whether he goes forward or backward grows richer or poorer neither is this science only useful to the merchant but is reckoned the primum mobile or first mover of all mundane affairs in general and is useful for all sorts and degrees of men from the highest to the lowest as to the usefulness of geometry it is as certain that no curious art or mechanic work can either be invented improved or performed without its assisting principles it is owing to this that astronomers are put into a way of making their observations coming at the knowledge of the extent of the heavens the duration of time the motions magnitudes and distances of the heavenly bodies their situations positions risings settings aspects and eclipses also the measure of seasons of years and of ages it is by the assistance of this science that geographers present to our view at once the magnitude and form of the whole earth the vast extent of the seas the divisions of empires kingdoms and provinces it is by the help of geometry the ingenious mariner is instructed how to guide a ship through the vast ocean from one part of the earth to another the nearest and safest way and in the shortest time by help of this science the architects take their just measures for the structure of buildings as private houses churches palaces ships fortifications c by its help engineers conduct all their works take the situation and plan of towns forts and castles measure their distances from one another and carry   their measures into places that are only accessible of the eye from hence also is deduced that admirable art of drawing sundials on any plane howsoever situate and for any part of the world to point out the exact time of the day suns declination altitude amplitude azimuth and other astronomical matters by geometry the surveyor is directed how to draw a map of any country to divide his lands and to lay down and plot any piece of ground and thereby discover the area in acres rods and perches the gauger is instructed how to find the capacities or solid contents of all kinds of vessels in barrels gallons bushels c and the measurer is furnished with rules for finding the areas and contents of superficies and solids and casting up all manner of workmanship all these and many more useful arts too many to be enumerated here wholly depend upon the aforesaid sciences—viz arithmetic and geometry this science is descended from the infancy of the world the inventors of which were the first propagators of human kind as adam noah abraham moses and divers others there has not been any science so much esteemed and honored as this of the mathematics nor with so much industry and vigilance become the care of great men and labored in by the potentates of the world—viz emperors kings princes c mathematical demonstrations are a logic of as much or more use than that commonly learned at schools serving to a just formation of the mind enlarging its   capacity and strengthening it so as to render the same capable of exact reasoning and discerning truth from falsehood in all occurrences even subjects not mathematical for which reason it is said the egyptians persians and lacedæmonians seldom elected any new kings but such as had some knowledge in the mathematics imagining those who had not men of imperfect judgments and unfit to rule and govern though platos censure that those who did not understand the    th proposition of the   th book of euclids elements ought not to be ranked amongst rational creatures was unreasonable and unjust yet to give a man the character of universal learning who is destitute of a competent knowledge in the mathematics is no less so the usefulness of some particular parts of the mathematics in the common affairs of human life has rendered some knowledge of them very necessary to a great part of mankind and very convenient to all the rest that are any way conversant beyond the limits of their own particular callings those whom necessity has obliged to get their bread by manual industry where some degree of art is required to go along with it and who have had some insight into these studies have very often found advantages from them sufficient to reward the pains they were at in acquiring them and whatever may have been imputed to some other studies under the notion of insignificancy and loss of time yet these i believe never caused repentance in any except it was for their remissness in the prosecution of them   philosophers do generally affirm that human knowledge to be most excellent which is conversant amongst the most excellent things what science then can there be more noble more excellent more useful for men more admirably high and demonstrative than this of the mathematics i shall conclude with what plato says in the seventh book of his republic with regard to the excellence and usefulness of geometry being to this purpose dear friend you see then that mathematics are necessary because by the exactness of the method we get a habit of using our minds to the best advantage and it is remarkable that all men being capable by nature to reason and understand the sciences the less acute by studying this though useless to them in every other respect will gain this advantage—that their minds will be improved in reasoning aright for no study employs it more nor makes it susceptible of attention so much and those who we find have a mind worth cultivating ought to apply themselves to this study xvii on true happiness  the desire of happiness in general is so natural to us that all the world are in pursuit of it all have this one end in view though they take such different   methods to attain it and are so much divided in their notions of it evil as evil can never be chosen and though evil is often the effect of our own choice yet we never desire it but under the appearance of an imaginary good many things we indulge ourselves in may be considered by us as evils and yet be desirable but then they are only considered as evils in their effects and consequences not as evils at present and attended with immediate misery reason represents things to us not only as they are at present but as they are in their whole nature and tendency passion only regards them in their former light when this governs us we are regardless of the future and are only affected with the present it is impossible ever to enjoy ourselves rightly if our conduct be not such as to preserve the harmony and order of our faculties and the original frame and constitution of our minds all true happiness as all that is truly beautiful can only result from order whilst there is a conflict betwixt the two principles of passion and reason we must be miserable in proportion to the struggle and when the victory is gained and reason so far subdued as seldom to trouble us with its remonstrances the happiness we have then is not the happiness of our rational nature but the happiness only of the inferior and sensual part of us and consequently a very low and imperfect happiness to what the other would have afforded us   if we reflect upon any one passion and disposition of mind abstract from virtue we shall soon see the disconnexion between that and true solid happiness it is of the very essence for instance of envy to be uneasy and disquieted pride meets with provocations and disturbances upon almost every occasion covetousness is ever attended with solicitude and anxiety ambition has its disappointments to sour us but never the good fortune to satisfy us its appetite grows the keener by indulgence and all we can gratify it with at present serves but the more to inflame its insatiable desires the passions by being too much conversant with earthly objects can never fix in us a proper composure and acquiescence of mind nothing but an indifference to the things of this world an entire submission to the will of providence here and a wellgrounded expectation of happiness hereafter can give us a true satisfactory enjoyment of ourselves virtue is the best guard against the many unavoidable evils incident to us nothing better alleviates the weight of the afflictions or gives a truer relish of the blessings of human life what is without us has not the least connexion with happiness only so far as the preservation of our lives and health depends upon it health of body though so far necessary that we cannot be perfectly happy without it is not sufficient to make us happy of itself happiness springs immediately from the mind health is but to be considered as a condition or circumstance without which this happiness cannot be tasted pure and unabated  0 virtue is the best preservative of health as it prescribes temperance and such a regulation of our passions as is most conducive to the wellbeing of the animal economy so that it is at the same time the only true happiness of the mind and the best means of preserving the health of the body if our desires are to the things of this world they are never to be satisfied if our great view is upon those of the next the expectation of them is an infinitely higher satisfaction than the enjoyment of those of the present there is no happiness then but in a virtuous and selfapproving conduct unless our actions will bear the test of our sober judgments and reflections upon them they are not the actions and consequently not the happiness of a rational being xviii on government—no i  government is aptly compared to architecture if the superstructure is too heavy for the foundation the building totters though assisted by outward props of art but leaving it to everybody to mould the similitude according to his particular fancy i shall only observe that the people have made the most considerable part of the legislature in every free state which has been more or less so in proportion to the share they have had in the administration of affairs the english constitution is fixed on the strongest basis we choose whomsoever we please    for our representatives and thus we have all the advantages of a democracy without any of its inconveniences popular governments have not been framed without the wisest reasons it seemed highly fitting that the conduct of magistrates created by and for the good of the whole should be made liable to the inspection and animadversion of the whole besides there could not be a more potent counterpoise to the designs of ambitious men than a multitude that hated and feared ambition moreover the power they possessed though great collectively yet being distributed among a vast number the share of each individual was too inconsiderable to lay him under any temptations of turning it to a wrong use again a body of people thus circumstanced cannot be supposed to judge amiss on any essential points for if they decide in favor of themselves which is extremely natural their decision is just inasmuch as whatever contributes to their benefit is a general benefit and advances the real public good hence we have an easy solution of the sophism so often proposed by the abettors of tyranny who tell us that when differences arise between a prince and his subjects the latter are incapable of being judges of the controversy for that would be setting up judge and party in the same person some foreigners have had a truer idea of our constitution we read in the memoirs of the late archbishop of cambray fenelon the celebrated author of telemachus a conversation which he had with the pretender son of james the second of england    if ever you come to the crown of england says the bishop you will be a happy prince with an unlimited power to do good and only restrained from doing evil a blunt briton perhaps would have said in plain english you ll be at liberty to do as much good as you please but by g— you shall do us no hurt the bishop sweetened the pill for such it would appear in its simple form to a mind fraught with notions of arbitrary power and educated among a people who with the utmost simplicity boast of their slavery what can be more ridiculous than to hear them frequently object to the english gentlemen that travel in their country what is your king commend me to our grand monarch who can do whatever he pleases  but begging pardon of these facetious gentlemen whom it is not my intention to disturb in their many notions of government i shall go on to examine what were the sentiments of the ancient romans on this head we find that their dictator a magistrate never created but in cases of great extremity vested with power as absolute during his office which never exceeded six months as the greatest kings were never possessed of—this great ruler was liable to be called to an account by any of the tribunes of the people  whose persons were at the same time rendered sacred by the most solemn laws    this is evident proof that the romans were of opinion that the people could not in any sense divest themselves of the supreme authority by conferring the most extensive power they possibly could imagine on one or more persons acting as magistrates this appears still more evident in remarking that the people sat as umpire of the differences which had arisen between the dictator and senate in the case of young fabius  the great deference which cicero paid to the judgment of the roman people appears by those inimitable orations of which they were the sole judges and auditors that great orator had a just opinion of their understanding nothing gave him a more sensible pleasure than their approbation but the roman populace were more learned than ours more virtuous perhaps but their sense of discernment was not better than ours however the judgment of a whole people especially of a free people is looked upon to be infallible so that it has become a common proverb that the voice of god is the voice of the people vox dei est populi vox and this is universally true while they remain in their proper sphere unbiased by faction undeluded by the tricks of designing men thank god we are in the full enjoyment of all these privileges but can we be taught to prize them too much or how can we prize them equal to their value if we do not know their intrinsic worth    and that they are not a gift bestowed upon us by other men but a right that belongs to us by the laws of god and nature since they are our right let us be vigilant to preserve them uninfringed and free from encroachments if animosities arise and we should be obliged to resort to party let each of us range himself on the side which unfurls the ensigns of public good faction will then vanish which if not timely suppressed may overturn the balance the palladium of liberty and crush us under its ruins the design of this paper is to assert the common rights of mankind by endeavouring to illustrate eternal truths that cannot be shaken even with the foundations of the world i may take another opportunity to show how a government founded on these principles rises into the most beautiful structure with all the graces of symmetry and proportion as much different from that raised on arbitrary power as roman architecture from a gothic building on government—no ii  an ancient sage of the law  says the king can do no wrong for if he doeth wrong he is not the king  and in another place when the king doth justice he is gods vicar but when he doth    unjustly he is the agent of the devil  the politeness of the later times has given a softer turn to the expression it is now said the king can do no wrong but his ministers may in allusion to this the parliament of      declared they made war against the king for the kings service but his majesty affirmed that such a distinction was absurd though by the way his own creed contained a greater absurdity for he believed he had an authority from god to oppress the subjects whom by the same authority he was obliged to cherish and defend aristotle calls all princes tyrants from the moment they set up an interest different from that of their subjects and this is the only definition he gives us of tyranny our own countryman before cited and the sagacious greek both agree on this point that a governor who acts contrary to the ends of government loses the title bestowed on him at his institution it would be highly improper to give the same name to things of different qualities or that produce different effects matter while it communicates heat is generally called fire but when the flames are extinguished the appellation is changed sometimes indeed the same sound serves to express things of a contrary nature but that only denotes a defect or poverty in the language a wicked prince imagines that the crown receives a new lustre from absolute power whereas every step he takes to obtain it is a forfeiture of the crown his conduct is as foolish as it is detestable he    aims at glory and power and treads the path that leads to dishonor and contempt he is a plague to his country and deceives himself during the inglorious reigns of the stuarts except a part of queen annes it was a perpetual struggle between them and the people those endeavouring to subvert and these bravely opposing the subverters of liberty what were the consequences one lost his life on the scaffold another was banished the memory of all of them stinks in the nostrils of every true lover of his country and their history stains with indelible blots the english annals the reign of queen elizabeth furnishes a beautiful contrast all her views centred in one object which was the public good she made it her study to gain the love of her subjects not by flattery or little soothing arts but by rendering them substantial favors it was far from her policy to encroach on their privileges she augmented and secured them and it is remarked to her eternal honor that the acts presented to her for her royal approbation forty or fifty of a session of parliament were signed without examining any farther than the titles this wise and good queen only reigned for her people and knew that it was absurd to imagine they would promote any thing contrary to their own interests which she so studiously endeavoured to advance on the other hand when this queen asked money of the parliament they frequently gave her more than she demanded and never inquired    how it was disposed of except for forms sake being fully convinced she would not employ it but for the general welfare happy princes happy people what harmony what mutual confidence seconded by the hearts and purses of her subjects she crushed the exorbitant power of spain which threatened destruction to england and chains to all europe that monarchy has ever since pined under the stroke so that now when we send a manofwar or two to the west indies it puts her into such a panic fright that if the galleons can steal home she sings te deum as for a victory this is a true picture of government its reverse is tyranny xix on discoveries  the world but a few ages since was in a very poor condition as to trade and navigation nor indeed were they much better in other matters of useful knowledge it was a greenheaded time every useful improvement was hid from them they had neither looked into heaven nor earth into the sea nor land as has been done since they had philosophy without experiments mathematics without instruments geometry without scale astronomy without demonstration they made war without powder shot cannon or    mortars nay the mob made their bonfires without squibs or crackers they went to sea without compass and sailed without the needle they viewed the stars without telescopes and measured latitudes without observation learning had no printingpress writing no paper and paper no ink the lover was forced to send his mistress a deal board for a loveletter and a billetdoux might be about the size of an ordinary trencher they were clothed without manufacture and their richest robes were the skins of the most formidable monsters they carried on trade without books and correspondence without posts their merchants kept no accounts their shopkeepers no cashbooks they had surgery without anatomy and physicians without the materia medica they gave emetics without ipecacuanha drew blisters without cantharides and cured agues without the bark as for geographical discoveries they had neither seen the north cape nor the cape of good hope south all the discovered inhabited world which they knew and conversed with was circumscribed within very narrow limits viz france britain spain italy germany and greece the lesser asia the west part of persia arabia the north parts of africa and the islands of the mediterranean sea and this was the whole world to them not that even these countries were fully known either and several parts of them not inquired into at all germany was known little further than the banks of the elbe poland as little beyond the vistula or hungary as little beyond the danube muscovy or russia perfectly    unknown as much as china beyond it and india only by a little commerce upon the coast about surat and malabar africa had been more unknown but by the ruin of the carthaginians all the western coast of it was sunk out of knowledge again and forgotten the northern coast of africa in the mediterranean remained known and that was all for the saracens overrunning the nations which were planted there ruined commerce as well as religion the baltic sea was not discovered nor even the navigation of it known for the teutonic knights came not thither till the thirteenth century america was not heard of nor so much as a suggestion in the minds of men that any part of the world lay that way the coasts of greenland or spitsbergen and the whalefishing not known the best navigators in the world at that time would have fled from a whale with much more fright and horror than from the devil in the most terrible shapes they had been told he appeared in the coasts of angola congo the gold and the grain coasts on the west side of africa whence since that time such immense wealth has been drawn not discovered nor the least inquiry made after them all the east india and china trade not only undiscovered but out of the reach of expectation coffee and tea those modern blessings of mankind had never been heard of all the unbounded ocean we now call the south sea was hid and unknown all the atlantic ocean beyond the mouth of the straits was frightful and terrible in the distant prospect nor durst any one peep into it  0 otherwise than as they might creep along the coast of africa towards sallee or santa cruz the north sea was hid in a veil of impenetrable darkness the white sea or archangel was a very modern discovery not found out till sir hugh willoughby doubled the north cape and paid dear for the adventure being frozen to death with all his crew on the coast of lapland while his companions ship with the famous mr chancellor went on to the gulf of russia called the white sea where no christian strangers had ever been before him in these narrow circumstances stood the worlds knowledge at the beginning of the fifteenth century when men of genius began to look abroad and about them now as it was wonderful to see a world so full of people and people so capable of improving yet so stupid and so blind so ignorant and so perfectly unimproved it was wonderful to see with what a general alacrity they took the alarm almost all together preparing themselves as it were on a sudden by a general inspiration to spread knowledge through the earth and to search into every thing that it was possible to uncover how surprising is it to look back so little a way behind us and see that even in less than two hundred years all this now so selfwise part of the world did not so much as know whether there was any such place as a russia a china a guinea a greenland or a north cape that as to america it was never supposed there was any such place neither had the world though they stood upon the shoulders of four thousand years experience the    least thought so much as that there was any land that way  as they were ignorant of places so of things also so vast are the improvements of science that all our knowledge of mathematics of nature of the brightest part of human wisdom had their admission among us within these two last centuries what was the world then before and to what were the heads and hands of mankind applied the rich had no commerce the poor no employment war and the sword was the great field of honor the stage of preferment and you have scarce a man eminent in the world for any thing before that time but for a furious outrageous falling upon his fellowcreatures like nimrod and his successors of modern memory the world is now daily increasing in experimental knowledge and let no man flatter the age with pretending we have arrived at a perfection of discoveries   what s now discovered only serves to show   that nothing s known to what is yet to know    xx the waste of life  anergus was a gentleman of a good estate he was bred to no business and could not contrive how to waste his hours agreeably he had no relish for any of the proper works of life nor any taste at all for the improvements of the mind he spent generally ten hours of the fourandtwenty in his bed he dozed away two or three more on his couch and as many were dissolved in good liquor every evening if he met with company of his own humor five or six of the rest he sauntered away with much indolence the chief business of them was to contrive his meals and to feed his fancy beforehand with the promise of a dinner and supper not that he was so absolute a glutton or so entirely devoted to appetite but chiefly because he knew not how to employ his thoughts better he let them rove about the sustenance of his body thus he had made a shift to wear off ten years since the paternal estate fell into his hands and yet according to the abuse of words in our day he was called a man of virtue because he was scarce ever known to be quite drunk nor was his nature much inclined to lewdness one evening as he was musing alone his thoughts happened to take a most unusual turn for they cast a glance backward and began to reflect on his manner of life he bethought himself what a number of living beings had been made a sacrifice to support    his carcass and how much corn and wine had been mingled with those offerings he had not quite lost all the arithmetic that he had learned when he was a boy and he set himself to compute what he had devoured since he came to the age of man about a dozen of feathered creatures small and great have one week with another said he given up their lives to prolong mine which in ten years amounts to at least six thousand fifty sheep have been sacrificed in a year with half a hecatomb of black cattle that i might have the choicest part offered weekly upon my table thus a thousand beasts out of the flock and the herd have been slain in ten years time to feed me besides what the forest has supplied me with many hundreds of fishes have in all their varieties been robbed of life for my repast and of the smaller fry as many thousands a measure of corn would hardly afford me fine flour enough for a months provision and this arises to above six score bushels and many hogsheads of ale and wine and other liquors have passed through this body of mine this wretched strainer of meat and drink and what have i done all this time for god or man what a vast profusion of good things upon a useless life and a worthless liver there is not the meanest creature among all these which i have devoured but hath answered the end of its creation better than i it was made to support human nature and it hath done so every crab and oyster i have eat and every grain of corn i have devoured    hath filled up its place in the rank of beings with more propriety and honor than i have done o shameful waste of life and time in short he carried on his moral reflections with so just and severe a force of reason as constrained him to change his whole course of life to break off his follies at once and to apply himself to gain some useful knowledge when he was more than thirty years of age he lived many following years with the character of a worthy man and an excellent christian he performed the kind offices of a good neighbour at home and made a shining figure as a patriot in the senatehouse he died with a peaceful conscience and the tears of his country were dropped upon his tomb the world that knew the whole series of his life stood amazed at the mighty change they beheld him as a wonder of reformation while he himself confessed and adored the divine power and mercy which had transformed him from a brute to a man but this was a single instance and we may almost venture to write miracle upon it are there not numbers of both sexes among our young gentry in this degenerate age whose lives thus run to utter waste without the least tendency to usefulness when i meet with persons of such a worthless character as this it brings to my mind some scraps of horace   nos numerus sumus et fruges consumere nati             alcinoique              juventus   cui pulchrum fuit in medios dormire dies c      paraphrase    there are a number of us creep   into this world to eat and sleep   and know no reason why they re born   but merely to consume the corn   devour the cattle fowl and fish   and leave behind an empty dish   though crows and ravens do the same   unlucky birds of hateful name   ravens or crows might fill their places   and swallow corn and eat carcáses   then if their tombstone when they die   be nt taught to flatter and to lie   there s nothing better will be said   than that they ve eat up all their bread   drunk all their drink and gone to bed there are other fragments of that heathen poet which occur on such occasions one in the first of his satires the other in the last of his epistles which seem to represent life only as a season of luxury      exacto contentus tempore vitæ   cedat uti conviva satur   lusisti satis edisti satis atque bibisti   tempus abire tibi est which may be thus put into english   life s but a feast and when we die   horace would say if he were by   friend thou hast eat and drunk enough   t is time now to be marching off   then like a wellfed guest depart   with cheerful looks and ease at heart   bid all your friends good night and say   you ve done the business of the day    xxi necessary hints to those that would be rich the use of money is all the advantage there is in having money for six pounds a year you may have the use of one hundred pounds provided you are a man of known prudence and honesty he that spends a groat a day idly spends idly above six pounds a year which is the price for the use of one hundred pounds he that wastes idly a groats worth of his time per day one day with another wastes the privilege of using one hundred pounds each day he that idly loses five shillings worth of time loses five shillings and might as prudently throw five shillings into the sea he that loses five shillings not only loses that sum but all the advantage that might be made by turning it in dealing which by the time that a young man becomes old will amount to a considerable sum of money again he that sells upon credit asks a price for what he sells equivalent to the principal and interest of his money for the time he is to be kept out of it therefore he that buys upon credit pays interest for what he buys and he that pays ready money might let that money out to use so that he that possesses any thing he has bought pays interest for the use of it yet in buying goods it is best to pay ready money    because he that sells upon credit expects to lose five per cent by bad debts therefore he charges on all he sells upon credit an advance that shall make up that deficiency those who pay for what they buy upon credit pay their share of this advance he that pays ready money escapes or may escape that charge   a penny saved is two pence clear   a pin a day s a groat a year xxii the way to wealth as clearly shown in the preface of an old almanac entitled poor richard improved  richard saunders courteous reader i have heard that nothing gives an author so great pleasure as to find his works respectfully quoted by others judge then how much i must have been gratified by an incident i am going to relate to you i stopped my horse lately where a great number of people were collected at an auction of merchants    goods the hour of the sale not being come they were conversing on the badness of the times and one of the company called to a plain clean old man with white locks pray father abraham what think you of the times will not these heavy taxes quite ruin the country how shall we ever be able to pay them what would you advise us to do father abraham stood up and replied if you would have my advice i will give it you in short for a word to the wise is enough as poor richard says they joined in desiring him to speak his mind and gathering round him he proceeded as follows friends said he the taxes are indeed very heavy and if those laid on by the government were the only ones we had to pay we might more easily discharge them but we have many others and much more grievous to some of us we are taxed twice as much by our idleness three times as much by our pride and four times as much by our folly and from these taxes the commissioners cannot ease or deliver us by allowing an abatement however let us hearken to good advice and something may be done for us god helps them that help themselves as poor richard says i it would be thought a hard government that should tax its people onetenth part of their time to be employed in its service but idleness taxes many of us much more sloth by bringing on diseases absolutely shortens life sloth like rust consumes faster than labor wears while the used key is always bright as poor richard says but dost thou love life    then do not squander time for that is the stuff life is made of as poor richard says how much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep forgetting that the sleeping fox catches no poultry and that there will be sleeping enough in the grave as poor richard says if time be of all things the most precious wasting time must be as poor richard says the greatest prodigality since as he elsewhere tells us lost time is never found again and what we call time enough always proves little enough let us then up and be doing and doing to the purpose so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity sloth makes all things difficult but industry all things easy and he that riseth late must trot all day and shall scarce overtake his business at night while laziness travels so slowly that poverty soon overtakes him drive thy business let not that drive thee and early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise as poor richard says so what signifies wishing and hoping for better times we may make these times better if we bestir ourselves industry need not wish and he that lives upon hopes will die fasting there are no gains without pains then help hands for i have no lands or if i have they are smartly taxed he that hath a trade hath an estate and he that hath a calling hath an office of profit and honor as poor richard says but then the trade must be worked at and the calling followed or neither the estate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes if we are industrious we shall never starve for at the working mans house  0 hunger looks in but dares not enter nor will the bailiff nor the constable enter for industry pays debts while despair increaseth them what though you have found no treasure nor has any rich relation left you a legacy diligence is the mother of good luck and god gives all things to industry then plough deep while sluggards sleep and you shall have corn to sell and to keep work while it is called today for you know not how much you may be hindered tomorrow one today is worth two tomorrows as poor richard says and further never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today if you were a servant would not you be ashamed that a good master should catch you idle are you then your own master be ashamed to catch yourself idle when there is so much to be done for yourself your family your country and your king handle your tools without mittens remember that the cat in gloves catches no mice as poor richard says it is true there is much to be done and perhaps you are weakhanded but stick to it steadily and you will see great effects for constant dropping wears away stones and by diligence and patience the mouse ate in two the cable and little strokes fell great oaks methinks i hear some of you say must a man afford himself no leisure i will tell thee my friend what poor richard says employ thy time well if thou meanest to gain leisure and since thou art not sure of a minute throw not away an hour leisure is time for doing something useful this leisure the diligent man will obtain but the lazy man never for a life of leisure and a life of laziness    are two things many without labor would live by their wits only but they break for want of stock whereas industry gives comfort and plenty and respect fly pleasures and they will follow you the diligent spinner has a large shift and now i have a sheep and a cow everybody bids me good morrow ii but with our industry we must likewise be steady settled and careful and oversee our own affairs with our own eyes and not trust too much to others for as poor richard says   i never saw an oft removed tree   nor yet an oftremoved family   that throve so well as those that settled be and again three removes are as bad as a fire and again keep thy shop and thy shop will keep thee and again if you would have your business done go if not send and again   he that by the plough would thrive   himself must either hold or drive and again the eye of a master will do more work than both his hands and again want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge and again not to oversee workmen is to leave them your purse open trusting too much to others care is the ruin of many for in the affairs of this world men are saved not by faith but by the want of it but a mans own care is profitable for if you would have a faithful servant and one that you like serve yourself a little neglect may breed great mischief for want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horse was lost    and for want of a horse the rider was lost being overtaken and slain by the enemy all for want of a little care about a horseshoe nail iii so much for industry my friends and attention to ones own business but to these we must add frugality if we would make our industry more certainly successful a man may if he knows not how to save as he gets keep his nose all his life to the grindstone and die not worth a groat at last a fat kitchen makes a lean will and   many estates are spent in the getting   since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting   and men for punch forsook hewing and splitting if you would be wealthy think of saving as well as of getting the indies have not made spain rich because her outgoes are greater than her incomes away then with your expensive follies and you will not then have so much cause to complain of hard times heavy taxes and chargeable families for   women and wine game and deceit   make the wealth small and the want great and further what maintains one vice would bring up two children you may think perhaps that a little tea or a little punch now and then diet a little more costly clothes a little finer and a little entertainment now and then can be no great matter but remember many a little makes a mickle beware of little expenses a small leak will sink a great ship as poor richard says and again who dainties love    shall beggars prove and moreover fools make feasts and wise men eat them here you are all got together at this sale of fineries and knickknacks you call them goods but if you do not take care they will prove evils to some of you you expect they will be sold cheap and perhaps they may for less than they cost but if you have no occasion for them they must be dear to you remember what poor richard says buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries and again at a great pennyworth pause a while he means that perhaps the cheapness is apparent only and not real or the bargain by straitening thee in thy business may do thee more harm than good for in another place he says many have been ruined by buying good pennyworths again it is foolish to lay out money in a purchase of repentance and yet this folly is practised every day at auctions for want of minding the almanac many a one for the sake of finery on the back have gone with a hungry belly and halfstarved their families silks and satins scarlet and velvets put out the kitchen fire as poor richard says these are not the necessaries of life they can scarcely be called the conveniences and yet only because they look pretty how many want to have them by these and other extravagances the genteel are reduced to poverty and forced to borrow of those whom they formerly despised but who through industry and frugality have maintained their standing in which case it appears plainly that a ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on    his knees as poor richard says perhaps they have had a small estate left them which they knew not the getting of they think it is day and will never be night that a little to be spent out of so much is not worth minding but always taking out of the mealtub and never putting in soon comes to the bottom as poor richard says and then when the well is dry they know the worth of water but this they might have known before if they had taken his advice if you would know the value of money go and try to borrow some for he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing as poor richard says and indeed so does he that lends to such people when he goes to get it again poor dick further advises and says   fond pride of dress is sure a very curse   ere fancy you consult consult your purse and again pride is as loud a beggar as want and a great deal more saucy when you have bought one fine thing you must buy ten more that your appearance may be all of a piece but poor dick says it is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it and it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich as for the frog to swell in order to equal the ox   vessels large may venture more   but little boats should keep near shore it is however a folly soon punished for as poor richard says pride that dines on vanity sups on contempt pride breakfasted with plenty dined with poverty and supped with infamy and after all of what use is this pride of appearance for which so    much is risked so much is suffered it cannot promote health nor ease pain it makes no increase of merit in the person it creates envy it hastens misfortune but what madness must it be to run in debt for these superfluities we are offered by the terms of this sale six months credit and that perhaps has induced some of us to attend it because we cannot spare the ready money and hope now to be fine without it but ah think what you do when you run in debt you give to another power over your liberty if you cannot pay at the time you will be ashamed to see your creditor you will be in fear when you speak to him you will make poor pitiful sneaking excuses and by degrees come to lose your veracity and sink into base downright lying for the second vice is lying the first is running in debt as poor richard says and again to the same purpose lying rides upon debts back whereas a freeborn englishman ought not to be ashamed nor afraid to see or speak to any man living but poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue it is hard for an empty bag to stand upright what would you think of that prince or of that government who should issue an edict forbidding you to dress like a gentleman or gentlewoman on pain of imprisonment or servitude would you not say that you were free have a right to dress as you please and that such an edict would be a breach of your privileges and such a government tyrannical and yet you are about to put yourself under such tyranny when you run in debt for such dress your    creditor has authority at his pleasure to deprive you of your liberty by confining you in gaol till you shall be able to pay him when you have got your bargain you may perhaps think little of payment but as poor richard says creditors have better memories than debtors creditors are a superstitious sect great observers of set days and times the day comes round before you are aware and the demand is made before you are prepared to satisfy it or if you bear your debt in mind the term which at first seemed so long will as it lessens appear extremely short time will seem to have added wings to his heels as well as his shoulders those have a short lent who owe money to be paid at easter at present perhaps you may think yourselves in thriving circumstances and that you can bear a little extravagance without injury but—   for age and want save while you may   no morning sun lasts a whole day gain may be temporary and uncertain but ever while you live expense is constant and certain and it is easier to build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel as poor richard says so rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt   get what you can and what you get hold   t is the stone that will turn all your lead into gold and when you have got the philosophers stone sure you will no longer complain of bad times or the difficulty of paying taxes iv this doctrine my friends is reason and    wisdom but after all do not depend too much upon your own industry and frugality and prudence though excellent things for they may all be blasted without the blessing of heaven and therefore ask that blessing humbly and be not uncharitable to those that at present seem to want it but comfort and help them remember job suffered and was afterwards prosperous and now to conclude experience keeps a dear school but fools will learn in no other as poor richard says and scarce in that for it is true we may give advice but we cannot give conduct however remember this they that will not be counselled cannot be helped and further that if you will not hear reason she will surely rap your knuckles as poor richard says thus the old gentleman ended his harangue the people heard it and approved the doctrine and immediately practised the contrary just as if it had been a common sermon for the auction opened and they began to buy extravagantly i found the good man had thoroughly studied my almanacs and digested all i had dropped on these topics during the course of twentyfive years the frequent mention he made of me must have tired any one else but my vanity was wonderfully delighted with it though i was conscious that not a tenth part of the wisdom was my own which he ascribed to me but rather the gleanings that i had made of the sense of all ages and nations however i resolved to be the better for the echo of it and though i had at first determined to buy stuff for a new coat i went away resolved    to wear my old one a little longer reader if thou wilt do the same thy profit will be as great as mine i am as ever thine to serve thee richard saunders speaking of the prefaces to poor richards almanacs mr parton says  year after year they play upon titan leeds in whose name a rival almanac once published by keimer annually appeared mr richard saunders poor richard begins his first preface by avowing that his motive in publishing an almanac is not at all a disinterested one the plain truth of the matter is said richard i am excessive poor and my wife good woman is i tell her excessive proud she cannot bear she says to sit spinning in her shift of tow while i do nothing but gaze at the stars and has threatened more than once to burn all my books and rattlingtraps as she calls my instruments if i do not make some profitable use of them for the good of my family the printer has offerd me some considerable share of the profits and i have thus began to comply with my dames desire long ago he continues he would have given the world an almanac but for the fear of injuring his friend and fellowstudent titan leeds but this obstacle i am far from speaking it with pleasure is soon to be removed since inexorable death who was never known to respect merit has already prepared the mortal dart the fatal sister has already    extended her destroying shears and that ingenious man must soon be taken from us he dies by my calculation made at his request on october           ho    m pm at the very instant of the ♂ of ☉ and ☿ by his own calculation he will survive till the   th of the same month this small difference between us we have disputed whenever we have met these nine years past but at length he is inclined to agree with my judgment which of us is most exact a little time will now determine as therefore these provinces may not longer expect to see any of his performances after this year i think myself free to take up the task the next year he joyfully acknowledged the success of his almanac through which his wife had been able to buy a pot of her own instead of being obliged to borrow one and they had got something to put into it she has also got a pair of shoes two new shifts and a new warm petticoat and for my part i have bought a secondhand coat so good that i am not now ashamed to go to town or be seen there these things have renderd her temper so much more pacifick than it usd to be that i may say i have slept more and more quietly within this last year than in the three foregoing years put together returning to titan leeds he says he cannot positively say whether he is dead or alive since he was unable to be present at the closing scene the stars he observes only show to the skilful what will happen in the natural and universal chain of causes and effects but t is well known that the events which would otherwise certainly happen at  0 certain times in the course of nature are sometimes set aside or postpond for wise and good reasons by the immediate particular dispositions of providence which particular dispositions the stars can by no means discover or foreshow there is however and i cannot speak it without sorrow there is the strongest probability that my dear friend is no more for there appears in his name as i am assured an almanack for the year      in which i am treated in a very gross and unhandsome manner in which i am called a false predicter an ignorant a conceited scribbler a fool and a lyar mr leeds was too well bred to use any man so indecently and so scurrilously and moreover his esteem and affection for me was extraordinary so that it is to be feared that pamphlet may be only a contrivance of somebody or other who hopes perhaps to sell two or three years almanacks still by the sole force and virtue of mr leedss name in next years preface the fooling is still more exquisite having received much abuse from titan leeds deceased titan leeds when living would not have used me so i say having received much abuse from the ghost of titan leeds who pretends to be still living and to write almanacks in spight of me and my predictions i cannot help saying that tho i take it patiently i take it very unkindly and whatever he may pretend t is undoubtedly true that he is really defunct and dead first because the stars are seldom disappointed never but in the case of wise men sapiens dominabitur astris and they foreshowed his death at the time i predicted it    secondly t was requisite and necessary he should die punctually at that time for the honor of astrology the art professed both by him and his father before him thirdly t is plain to every one that reads his two last almanacks for      and    that they are not written with that life his performances used to be written with the wit is low and flat the little hints dull and spiritless nothing smart in them but hudibrass verses against astrology at the heads of the months in the last which no astrologer but a dead one would have inserted and no man living would or could write such stuff as the rest titan leeds retorted by saying that there was not and never had been such a person as richard saunders to which next year franklin humourously replied one preface purported to be written by bridget saunders the wife of poor richard and another contained a long letter from the departed spirit of titan leeds assuring his old friend that he did die at the time predicted by him from the numbers of poor richard that are accessible i select as

wife whose lot it is to have him the astronomical notices of poor richard have in them a strong spice of the comic and he has many paragraphs in ridicule of the predictions which the almanacmakers of that day were accustomed to insert during the first visible eclipse saturn is retrograde for which reason the crabs will go sidelong and the ropemakers backward mercury will have his share in these affairs and so confound the speech of the people that when a pennsylvanian would say panther he shall say painter when a new yorker thinks to say this he shall say diss and the people of new england

lackomony  richard saunders rivalship in almanacmaking courteous reader this is the ninth year of my endeavours to serve thee in the capacity of a calendarwriter the encouragement i have met with must be ascribed in a great measure to your charity excited by the open honest declaration i made of my poverty at my first appearance this my brother philomaths could without being conjurers discover and poor richards success has produced ye a poor will and a poor robin and no doubt poor john c will follow and we shall all be in name what some folks say we    are already in fact a parcel of poor

authors and printers were angry hard names and many were bestowed on me they denied me to be the author of my own works declared there never was any such person asserted that i was dead sixty years ago prognosticated my death to happen within a twelvemonth with many other malicious inconsistencies the effects of blind passion envy at my success and a vain hope of depriving me dear reader of thy wonted countenance and favor who knows him they cry where does he live but what is that to them if i delight in a private life have they any right to drag me out of my retirement i have good reasons for concealing the place of my abode it is time for an old man as i am to think of preparing for his great remove the perpetual teasing of both neighbours and strangers to calculate nativities give judgments on schemes and erect figures discover thieves detect horsestealers describe the route of runaways and strayed cattle the crowd of visitors with a thousand trifling questions will my ship return safe will my mare win the race will her next colt be a pacer when will my wife die who shall be my husband and how long first when is the best time to cut hair trim cocks or sow sallad these and the like impertinences i have now neither taste nor leisure for i have had enough of them all that these angry folks can say will never provoke    me to tell them where i live i would eat my nails first my last adversary is j j——n philomat who declares and protests in his preface      that the false prophecy put in my almanac concerning him the year before is altogether false and untrue and that i am one of baals false prophets this false false prophecy he speaks of related to his reconciliation with the church of rome which notwithstanding his declaring and protesting is i fear too true two things in his elegiac verses confirm me in this suspicion he calls the first of november allhallows day reader does not this smell of popery does it in the least savour of the pure language of friends but the plainest thing is his adoration of saints which he confesses to be his practice in these words page     when any trouble did me befall   to my dear mary then i would call did he think

you are certainly no protestant i could heartily wish your religion were as good as your verses richard saunders     xxiii causes of earthquakes  the late earthquake felt here and probably in all the neighbouring provinces having made many  0 people desirous to know what may be the natural cause of such violent concussions we shall endeavour to gratify their curiosity by giving them the various opinions of the learned on that head here naturalists are divided some ascribe them to water others to fire and others to air and all of them with some appearance of reason to conceive which it is to be observed that the earth everywhere abounds in huge subterraneous caverns veins and canals particularly about the roots of mountains that of these cavities veins c some are full of water whence are composed gulfs abysses springs rivulets and others full of exhalations and that some parts of the earth are replete with nitre sulphur bitumen vitriol c this premised   the earth itself may sometimes be the cause of its own shaking when the roots or basis of some large mass being dissolved or worn away by a fluid underneath it sinks into the same and with its weight occasions a tremor of the adjacent parts produces a noise and frequently an inundation of water   the subterraneous waters may occasion earthquakes by their overflowing cutting out new courses c add that the water being heated and rarefied by the subterraneous fires may emit fumes blasts c which by their action either on the water or immediately on the earth itself may occasion great succussions   the air may be the cause of earthquakes for the air being a collection of fumes and vapors raised from the earth and water if it be pent up in too narrow viscera of the earth the subterraneous or its own    native heat rarefying and expanding it the force wherewith it endeavours to escape may shake the earth hence there arise divers species of earthquakes according to the different position quantity c of the imprisoned aura lastly fire is a principal cause of earthquakes both as it produces the aforesaid subterraneous aura or vapors and as this aura or spirit from the different matter and composition whereof arise sulphur bitumen and other inflammable matters takes fire either from other fire it meets withal or from its collision against hard bodies or its intermixture with other fluids by which means bursting out into a greater compass the place becomes too narrow for it so that pressing against it on all sides the adjoining parts are shaken till having made itself a passage it spends itself in a volcano or burning mountain but to come nearer to the point dr lister is of opinion that the material cause of thunder lightning and earthquakes is one and the same—viz the inflammable breath of the pyrites which is a substantial sulphur and takes fire of itself the difference between these three terrible phenomena he takes only to consist in this that this sulphur in the former is fired in the air and in the latter under ground which is a notion that pliny had long before him quid enim says he aliud est in terrâ tremor quam in nube tonitru this he thinks abundantly indicated by the same sulphurous smell being found in any thing burnt with lightning and in the waters c cast up in    earthquakes and even in the air before and after them add that they agree in the manner of the noise which is carried on as in a train fired the one rolling and rattling through the air takes fire as the vapors chance to drive as the other fired under ground in like manner moves with a desultory noise thunder which is the effect of the trembling of the air caused by the same vapors dispersed through it has force enough to shake our houses and why there may not be thunder and lightning under ground in some vast repositories there i see no reason especially if we reflect that the matter which composes the noisy vapor above us is in much larger quantities under ground that the earth abounds in cavities everybody allows and that these subterraneous cavities are at certain times and in certain seasons full of inflammable vapors the damps in mines sufficiently witness which fired do every thing as in an earthquake save in a lesser degree add that the pyrites alone of all the known minerals yields this inflammable vapor is highly probable for that no mineral or ore whatsoever is sulphurous but as it is wholly or in part a pyrites and that there is but one species of brimstone which the pyrites naturally and only yields the sulphur vive or natural brimstone which is found in and about the burning mountains is certainly the effects of sublimation and those great quantities of it said to be found about the skirts of volcanoes is only    an argument of the long duration and vehemence of those fires possibly the pyrites of the volcanoes or burning mountains may be more sulphurous than ours and indeed it is plain that some of ours in england are very lean and hold but little sulphur others again very much which may be one reason why england is so little troubled with earthquakes and italy and almost all round the mediterranean sea so very much though another reason is the paucity of pyrites in england comparing our earthquakes thunder and lightning with theirs it is observed that there it lightens almost daily especially in summertime here seldom there thunder and lightning is of long duration here it is soon over there the earthquakes are frequent long and terrible with many paroxysms in a day and that for many days here very short a few minutes and scarce perceptible to this purpose the subterraneous caverns in england are small and few compared to the vast vaults in those parts of the world which is evident from the sudden disappearance of whole mountains and islands dr woodward gives us another theory of earthquakes he endeavours to show that the subterraneous heat or fire which is continually elevating water out of the abyss to furnish the earth with rain dew springs and rivers being stopped in any part of the earth and so diverted from its ordinary course by some accidental glut or obstruction in the pores or passages through which it used to ascend to the surface becomes by such means preternaturally assembled in a greater quantity than usual into one    place and therefore causeth a great rarefaction and intumescence of the water of the abyss putting it into great commotions and disorders and at the same time making the like effort on the earth which being expanded upon the face of the abyss occasions that agitation and concussion we call an earthquake this effort in some earthquakes he observes is so vehement that it splits and tears the earth making cracks and chasms in it some miles in length which open at the instant of the shock and close again in the intervals betwixt them nay it is sometimes so violent that it forces the superincumbent strata breaks them all throughout and thereby perfectly undermines and ruins the foundation of them so that these falling the whole tract as soon as the shock is over sinks down into the abyss and is swallowed up by it the water thereof immediately rising up and forming a lake in the place where the said tract before was that this effort being made in all directions indifferently the fire dilating and expanding on all hands and endeavouring to get room and make its way through all obstacles falls as foul on the waters of the abyss beneath as on the earth above forcing it forth which way soever it can find vent or passage as well through its ordinary exits wells springs and the outlets of rivers as through the chasms then newly opened through the camini or spiracles of ætna or other neighbouring volcanoes and those hiatuses at the bottom of the sea whereby the abyss below opens into it and communicates with it that as the water resident in the abyss is    in all parts of it stored with a considerable quantity of heat and more especially in those where those extraordinary aggregations of this fire happen so likewise is the water which is thus forced out of it insomuch that when thrown forth and mixed with the waters of wells or springs of rivers and the sea it renders them very sensibly hot he adds that though the abyss be liable to those commotions in all parts yet the effects are nowhere very remarkable except in those countries which are mountainous and consequently stony or cavernous underneath and especially where the disposition of the strata is such that those caverns open into the abyss and so freely admit and entertain the fire which assembling therein is the cause of the shock it naturally steering its course that way where it finds the readiest reception which is towards those caverns besides that those parts of the earth which abound with strata of stone or marble making the strongest opposition to this effort are the most furiously shattered and suffer much more by it than those which consist of gravel sand and the like laxer matter which more easily give way and make not so great resistance but above all those countries which yield great store of sulphur and nitre are by far the most injured by earthquakes those minerals constituting in the earth a kind of natural gunpowder which taking fire upon this assemblage and approach of it occasions that murmuring noise that subterraneous thunder which is heard rumbling in the bowels of the earth during earthquakes and by the assistance of its explosive power renders the    shock much greater so as sometimes to make miserable havoc and destruction and it is for this reason that italy sicily anatolia and some parts of greece have been so long and often alarmed and harassed by earthquakes these countries being all mountainous and cavernous abounding with stone and marble and affording sulphur and nitre in great plenty further that ætna vesuvius hecla and the other volcanoes are only so many spiracles serving for the discharge of this subterraneous fire when it is thus preternaturally assembled that where there happens to be such a structure and conformation of the interior parts of the earth as that the fire may pass freely and without impediment from the caverns wherein it assembles unto those spiracles it then readily gets out from time to time without shaking or disturbing the earth but where such communication is wanting or passage not sufficiently large and open so that it cannot come at the spiracles it heaves up and shocks the earth with greater or lesser impetuosity according to the quantity of fire thus assembled till it has made its way to the mouth of the volcano that therefore there are scarce any countries much annoyed by earthquakes but have one of these fiery vents which are constantly in flames when any earthquake happens as disgorging that fire which whilst underneath was the cause of the disaster lastly that were it not for these diverticula it would rage in the bowels of the earth much more furiously and make greater havoc than it doth    we have seen what fire and water may do and that either of them are sufficient for all the phenomena of earthquakes if they should both fail we have a third agent scarce inferior to either of them the reader must not be surprised when we tell him it is air monsieur amontons in his mémoires de lacadémie des sciences an   0  has an express discourse to prove that on the foot of the new experiments of the weight and spring of the air a moderate degree of heat may bring the air into a condition capable of causing earthquakes it is shown that at the depth of       fathoms below the surface of the earth air is only one fourth less heavy than mercury now this depth of       fathoms is only a seventyfourth part of the semidiameter of the earth and the vast sphere beyond this depth in diameter         fathoms may probably be only filled with air which will be here greatly condensed and much heavier than the heaviest bodies we know in nature but it is found by experiment that the more air is compressed the more does the same degree of heat increase its spring and the more capable does it render it of a violent effect and that for instance the degree of heat of boiling water increases the spring of the air above what it has in its natural state in our climate by a quantity equal to a third of the weight wherewith it is pressed whence we may conclude that a degree of heat which on the surface of the earth will only have a moderate effect may be capable of a very violent one below and as we are assured that there are in nature degrees of heat much    more considerable than that of boiling water it is very possible there may be some whose violence further assisted by the exceeding weight of the air may be more than sufficient to break and overturn this solid orb of       fathoms whose weight compared to that of the included air would be but a trifle chemistry furnishes us a method of making artificial earthquakes which shall have all the great effects of natural ones which as it may illustrate the process of nature in the production of these terrible phenomena under ground we shall here add to twenty pounds of iron filings add as many of sulphur mix work and temper the whole together with a little water so as to form a mass half moist and half dry this being buried three or four feet under ground in six or seven hours time will have a prodigious effect the earth will begin to tremble crack and smoke and fire and flame burst through such is the effect even of the two cold bodies in cold ground there only wants a sufficient quantity of this mixture to produce a true ætna if it were supposed to burst out under the sea it would produce a spout and if it were in the clouds the effect would be thunder and lightning an earthquake is defined to be a vehement shake or agitation of some considerable place or part of the earth from natural causes attended with a huge noise like thunder and frequently with an eruption of water or fire or smoke or winds c they are the greatest and most formidable phenomena of nature aristotle and pliny distinguish    two kinds with respect to the manner of the shake—viz a tremor and a pulsation the first being horizontal in alternate vibrations compared to the shaking of a person in ague the second perpendicular up and down their motion resembling that of boiling agricola increases the number and makes four kinds which albertus magnus again reduces to three—viz inclination when the earth vibrates alternately from right to left by which mountains have been sometimes brought to meet and clash against each other pulsation when it beats up and down like an artery and trembling when it shakes and totters every way like a flame the philosophical transactions furnish us with abundance of histories of earthquakes particularly one at oxford in      by dr wallis and mr boyle another at the same place in      by mr pigot another in sicily in       by mr hartop father alessandro burgos and vin bonajutus which last is one of the most terrible ones in all history it shook the whole island and not only that but naples and malta shared in the shock it was of the second kind mentioned by aristotle and pliny—viz a perpendicular pulsation or succussion it was impossible says the noble bonajutus for anybody in this country to keep on their legs on the dancing earth nay those that lay on the ground were tossed from side to side as on a rolling billow high walls leaped from their foundations several paces the mischief it did is amazing almost all the  0 buildings in the countries were thrown down fiftyfour cities and towns besides an incredible number of villages were either destroyed or greatly damaged we shall only instance the fate of catania one of the most famous ancient and flourishing cities in the kingdom the residence of several monarchs and a university this once famous now unhappy catania to use words of father burgos had the greatest share in the tragedy father antonio serovita being on his way thither and at the distance of a few miles observed a black cloud like night hovering over the city and there arose from the mouth of mongibello great spires of flame which spread all round the sea all of a sudden began to roar and rise in billows and there was a blow as if all the artillery in the world had been at once discharged the birds flew about astonished the cattle in the fields ran crying c his and his companions horse stopped short trembling so that they were forced to alight they were no sooner off but they were lifted from the ground above two palms when casting his eyes towards catania he with amazement saw nothing but a thick cloud of dust in the air this was the scene of their calamity for of the magnificent catania there is not the least footstep to be seen bonajutus assures us that of       inhabitants   000 perished therein the same author from a computation of the inhabitants before and after the earthquake in the several cities and towns finds that near  0000 perished out of     00 jamaica is remarkable for earthquakes the inhabitants    dr sloane informs us expect one every year that author gives us the history of one in      another horrible one in      is described by several anonymous authors in two minutes time it shook down and drowned nine tenths of the town of port royal the houses sunk outright thirty or forty fathoms deep the earth opening swallowed up people and they rose in other streets some in the middle of the harbour and yet were saved though there were two thousand people lost and one thousand acres of land sunk all the houses were thrown down throughout the island one hopkins had his plantation removed half a mile from its place of all wells from one fathom to six or seven the water flew out at the top with a vehement motion while the houses on the one side of the street were swallowed up on the other they were thrown on heaps and the sand in the street rose like waves in the sea lifting up everybody that stood on it and immediately dropping down into pits and at the same instant a flood of waters breaking in rolled them over and over some catching hold of beams and rafters c ships and sloops in the harbour were overset and lost the swan frigate particularly by the motion of the sea and sinking of the wharf was driven over the tops of many houses it was attended with a hollow rumbling noise like that of thunder in less than a minute three quarters of the houses and the ground they stood on with the inhabitants were all sunk quite under water and the little pile left behind was no better than a heap of rubbish the shake was so violent    that it threw people down on their knees or their faces as they were running about for shelter the ground heaved and swelled like a rolling sea and several houses still standing were shuffled and moved some yards out of their places a whole street is said to be twice as broad now as before and in many places the earth would crack and open and shut quick and fast of which openings two or three hundred might be seen at a time in some whereof the people were swallowed up others the closing earth caught by the middle and pressed to death in others the heads only appeared the larger openings swallowed up houses and out of some would issue whole rivers of water spouted up a great height into the air and threatening a deluge to that part the earthquake spared the whole was attended with stenches and offensive smells the noise of falling mountains at a distance c and the sky in a minutes time was turned dull and reddish like a glowing oven yet as great a sufferer as port royal was more houses were left standing therein than on the whole island beside scarce a plantinghouse or sugarwork was left standing in all jamaica a great part of them were swallowed up houses people trees and all at one gape in lieu of which afterwards appeared great pools of water which when dried up left nothing but sand without any mark that ever tree or plant had been thereon about twelve miles from the sea the earth gaped and spouted out with a prodigious force vast quantities of water into the air yet the greatest violences were among the mountains and rocks and it is a    general opinion that the nearer the mountains the greater the shake and that the cause thereof lay there most of the rivers were stopped up for twentyfour hours by the falling of the mountains till swelling up they found themselves new tracts and channels tearing up in their passage trees c after the great shake those people who escaped got on board ships in the harbour where many continued above two months the shakes all that time being so violent and coming so thick sometimes two or three in an hour accompanied with frightful noises like a ruffling wind or a hollow rumbling thunder with brimstone blasts that they durst not come ashore the consequence of the earthquake was a general sickness from the noisome vapors belched forth which swept away above three thousand persons after the detail of these horrible convulsions the reader will have but little curiosity left for the less considerable phenomena of the earthquake at lima in      described by father alvarez de toledo wherein above five thousand persons were destroyed this being of the vibratory kind so that the bells in the church rung of themselves or that at batavia in      by witsen that in the north of england in   0  by mr thoresby or lastly those in new england in      and

both seem concerned lest i have imbibed some erroneous opinions doubtless i have my share and when the natural weakness and imperfection of human understanding is considered the unavoidable influence of education custom books and company upon our ways of thinking i imagine a man must have a good deal of vanity who believes and a good deal of boldness who affirms that all the doctrines he holds are true and all he rejects are false and perhaps the same may be justly said of every sect church and society of men when they assume to themselves that infallibility which they deny to the pope and councils i think opinions should be judged of by their influences and effects and if a man holds none that tend to make him less virtuous or more vicious it may be concluded he holds none that are dangerous which i hope is the case with me i am sorry you should have any uneasiness on my account and if it were a thing possible for one to alter his opinions in order to please another i know none whom i ought more willingly to oblige in that respect than yourselves but since it is no more in a mans power to think than to look like another methinks all that should be expected from me is to keep my mind open to conviction to hear patiently and    examine attentively whatever is offered me for that end and if after all i continue in the same errors i believe your usual charity will induce you to rather pity and excuse than blame me in the mean time your care and concern for me is what i am very thankful for my mother grieves that one of her sons is an arian another an arminian what an arminian or an arian is i cannot say that i very well know the truth is i make such distinctions very little my study i think vital religion has always suffered when orthodoxy is more regarded than virtue and the scriptures assure me that at the last day we shall not be examined what we thought but what we did and our recommendation will not be that we said lord lord but that we did good to our fellowcreatures see matt xxv as to the freemasons i know no way of giving my mother a better account of them than she seems to have at present since it is not allowed that women should be admitted into that secret society she has i must confess on that account some reason to be displeased with it but for any thing else i must entreat her to suspend her judgment till she is better informed unless she will believe me when i assure her that they are in general a very harmless sort of people and have no principles or practices that are inconsistent with religion and good manners we have had great rains here lately which with the thawing of snow on the mountains back of our country have made vast floods in our rivers and by carrying away bridges boats c made travelling    almost impracticable for a week past so that our post has entirely missed making one trip i hear nothing of dr crook nor can i learn any such person has ever been here i hope my sister jennys child is by this time recovered i am your dutiful son b franklin benjamin franklin    july      philadelphia jane mecom xxv to mrs jane mecom philadelphia    july      dearest sister jenny i took your admonition very kindly and was far from being offended at you for it if i say any thing about it to you it is only to rectify some wrong opinions you seem to have entertained of me and this i do only because they give you some uneasiness which i am unwilling to be the occasion of you express yourself as if you thought i was against the worshipping of god and doubt that good works would merit heaven which are both fancies of your own i think without foundation i am so far from thinking that god is not to be worshipped that i have composed and wrote a whole book of devotions for my own use and i imagine there are few if any in the world so weak as to imagine that the little good we can do here can merit so vast a reward hereafter there are some things in your new england doctrine and worship which i do not agree with but i do not therefore condemn them or desire to shake    your belief or practice of them we may dislike things that are nevertheless right in themselves i would only have you make me the same allowance and have a better opinion both of morality and your brother read the pages of mr edwardss late book entitled some thoughts concerning the present revival of religion in new england from     to     and when you judge of others if you can perceive the fruit to be good dont terrify yourself that the tree may be evil but be assured it is not so for you know who has said men do not gather grapes of thorns and figs of thistles i have no time to add but that i shall always be your affectionate brother b franklin p s—it was not kind in you when your sister commended your good works to suppose she intended it a reproach to you it was very far from her thoughts xxvi a proposal for promoting useful knowledge among the british plantations in america  philadelphia    may      the english are possessed of a long tract of continent from nova scotia to georgia extending north and south through different climates having different    soils producing different plants mines and minerals and capable of different improvements manufactures c the first drudgery of settling new colonies which confines the attention of people to mere necessaries is now pretty well over and there are many in every province in circumstances that set them at ease and afford leisure to cultivate the finer arts and improve the common stock of knowledge to such of these who are men of speculation many hints must from time to time arise many observations occur which if well examined pursued and improved might produce discoveries to the advantage of some or all of the british plantations or to the benefit of mankind in general but as from the extent of the country such persons are widely separated and seldom can see and converse or be acquainted with each other so that many useful particulars remain uncommunicated die with the discoverers and are lost to mankind it is to remedy this inconvenience for the future proposed that one society be formed of virtuosi or ingenious men residing in the several colonies to be called the american philosophical society who are to maintain a constant correspondence that philadelphia being the city nearest the centre of the continent colonies communicating with all of them northward and southward by post and with all the islands by sea and having the advantage of a good growing library be the centre of the society that at philadelphia there be always at least seven    members viz a physician a botanist a mathematician a chemist a mechanician a geographer and a general natural philosopher besides a president treasurer and secretary that these members meet once a month or oftener at their own expense to communicate to each other their observations and experiments to receive read and consider such letters communications or queries as shall be sent from distant members to direct the dispersing of copies of such communications as are valuable to other distant members in order to procure their sentiments thereupon that the subjects of the correspondence be all newdiscovered plants herbs trees roots their virtues uses c methods of propagating them and making such as are useful but particular to some plantations more general improvements of vegetable juices as ciders wines c new methods of curing or preventing diseases all newdiscovered fossils in different countries as mines minerals and quarries new and useful improvements in any branch of mathematics new discoveries in chemistry such as improvements in distillation brewing and assaying of ores new mechanical inventions for saving labor as mills and carriages and for raising and conveying of water draining of meadows c all new arts trades and manufactures that may be proposed or thought of surveys maps and charts of particular parts of the seacoasts or inland countries course and junction of rivers and great roads situation of lakes and mountains nature of the soil and productions new methods of improving the  0 breed of useful animals introducing other sorts from foreign countries new improvements in planting gardening and clearing land and all philosophical experiments that let light into the nature of things tend to increase the power of man over matter and multiply the conveniences or pleasures of life that a correspondence already begun by some intended members shall be kept up by this society with the royal society of london and with the dublin society that every member shall have abstracts sent him quarterly of every thing valuable communicated to the societys secretary at philadelphia free of all charge except the yearly payment hereafter mentioned that by permission of the postmastergeneral such communications pass between the secretary of the society and the members postagefree that for defraying the expense of such experiments as the society shall judge proper to cause to be made and other contingent charges for the common good every member send a piece of eight per annum to the treasurer at philadelphia to form a common stock to be disbursed by order of the president with the consent of the majority of the members that can conveniently be consulted thereupon to such persons and places where and by whom the experiments are to be made and otherwise as there shall be occasion of which disbursements an exact account shall be kept and communicated yearly to every member that at the first meetings of the members at    philadelphia such rules be formed for regulating their meetings and transactions for the general benefit as shall be convenient and necessary to be afterwards changed and improved as there shall be occasion wherein due regard is to be had to the advice of distant members that at the end of every year collections be made and printed of such experiments discoveries and improvements as may be thought of public advantage and that every member have a copy sent him that the business and duty of the secretary be to receive all letters intended for the society and lay them before the president and members at their meetings to abstract correct and methodize such papers as require it and as he shall be directed to do by the president after they have been considered debated and digested in the society to enter copies thereof in the societys books and make out copies for distant members to answer their letters by direction of the president and keep records of all material transactions of the society benjamin franklin the writer of this proposal offers himself to serve the society as their secretary till they shall be provided with one more capable    benjamin franklin   november      philadelphia cadwallader colden xxvii to cadwallader colden  philadelphia   november      sir— i received the favor of yours with the proposal for a new method of printing which i am much pleased with and since you express some confidence in my opinion i shall consider it very attentively and particularly and in a post or two send you some observations on every article my long absence from home in the summer put my business so much behindhand that i have been in a continual hurry ever since my return and had no leisure to forward the scheme of the society but that hurry being now near over i purpose to proceed in the affair very soon your approbation being no small encouragement to me    i cannot but be fond of engaging in a correspondence so advantageous to me as yours must be i shall always receive your favors as such and with great pleasure i wish i could by any means have made your sons longer stay here as agreeable to him as it would have been to those who began to be acquainted with him i am sir with much respect your most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin philadelphia edward eggleston jane mecom xxviii to edward and jane mecom philadelphia date uncertain dear brother and sister if you still continue your inclination to send benny  you may do it by the first vessel to new york write a line by him directed to mr james parker printer on hunters key new york i am confident he will be kindly used there and i shall hear from him every week you will advise him to be very cheerful and ready to do every thing he is bid and endeavour to oblige everybody for that is the true way to get friends dear sister i love you tenderly for your care of our father in his sickness i am in great haste your loving brother b franklin    benjamin franklin philadelphia jane mecom xxix to mrs jane mecom philadelphia date uncertain dear sister i received your letter with one for benny and one for mr parker and also two of bennys letters of complaint which as you observe do not amount to much i should have had a very bad opinion of him if he had written to you those accusations of his master which you mention because from long acquaintance with his master who lived some years in my house i know him to be a sober pious and conscientious man so that newport to whom you seem to have given too much credit must have wronged mr parker very much in his accounts and have wronged benny too if he says benny told him such things for i am confident he never did as to the bad attendance afforded him in the smallpox i believe if the negro woman did not do her duty her master or mistress would if they had known it have had that matter mended but mrs parker was herself if i am not mistaken sick at that time and her child also and though he gives the woman a bad character in general all he charges her with in particular is that she never brought him what he called for directly and sometimes not at all he had the distemper favorably and yet i suppose was bad enough to be like other sick people a little impatient and perhaps might think a short time long and sometimes call for things not proper for one in his condition    as to clothes i am frequently at new york and i never saw him unprovided with what was good decent and sufficient i was there no longer ago than march last and he was then well clothed and made no complaint to me of any kind i heard both his master and mistress call upon him on sunday morning to get ready to go to meeting and tell him of his frequently delaying and shuffling till it was too late and he made not the least objection about clothes i did not think it any thing extraordinary that he should be sometimes willing to evade going to meeting for i believe it is the case with all boys or almost all i have brought up four or five myself and have frequently observed that if their shoes were bad they would say nothing of a new pair till sunday morning just as the bell rung when if you asked them why they did not get ready the answer was prepared i have no shoes and so of other things hats and the like or if they knew of any thing that wanted mending it was a secret till sunday morning and sometimes i believe they would rather tear a little than be without the excuse as to going on petty errands no boys love it but all must do it as soon as they become fit for better business they naturally get rid of that for the masters interest comes in to their relief i make no doubt but mr parker will take another apprentice as soon as he can meet with a likely one in the mean time i should be glad if benny would exercise a little patience there is a negro woman that does a great many of those errands i do not think his going on board the privateer    arose from any difference between him and his master or any ill usage he had received when boys see prizes brought in and quantities of money shared among the men and their gay living it fills their heads with notions that half distract them and put them quite out of conceit with trades and the dull ways of getting money by working this i suppose was bens case the catherine being just before arrived with three rich prizes and that the glory of having taken a privateer of the enemy for which both officers and men were highly extolled treated presented c worked strongly upon his imagination you will see by his answer to my letter is not unlikely i send it to you enclosed i wrote him largely on the occasion and though he might possibly to excuse that slip to others complain of his place you may see he says not a syllable of any such thing to me my only son before i permitted him to go to albany left my house unknown to us all and got on board a privateer from whence i fetched him no one imagined it was hard usage at home that made him do this every one that knows me thinks i am too indulgent a parent as well as master i shall tire you perhaps with the length of this letter but i am the more particular in order if possible to satisfy your mind about your sons situation his master has by a letter this post desired me to write to him about his staying out of nights sometimes all night and refusing to give an account where he spends his time or in what company this i had not heard of before though i perceive you have i do not wonder at his correcting him for    that if he was my own son i should think his master did not do his duty by him if he omitted it for to be sure it is the high road to destruction and i think the correction very light and not likely to be very effectual if the strokes left no marks his master says farther as follows i think i cannot charge my conscience with being much short of my duty to him i shall now desire you if you have not done it already to invite him to lay his complaints before you that i may know how to remedy them thus far the words of his letter which giving me a fair opening to inquire into the affair i shall accordingly do it and i hope settle every thing to all your satisfactions in the mean time i have laid by your letters both to mr parker and benny and shall not send them till i hear again from you because i think your appearing to give ear to such groundless stories may give offence and create a greater misunderstanding and because i think what you write to benny about getting him discharged may tend to unsettle his mind and therefore improper at this time i have a very good opinion of benny in the main and have great hopes of his becoming a worthy man his faults being only such as are commonly incident to boys of his years and he has many good qualities for which i love him i never knew an apprentice contented with the clothes allowed him by his master let them be what they would jemmy franklin when with me was always dissatisfied and grumbling when i was last in boston his aunt bid him go to a shop and please himself which the gentleman    did and bought a suit of clothes on my account dearer by one half than any i ever afforded myself one suit excepted which i dont mention by way of complaint of jemmy for he and i are good friends but only to show you the nature of boys the letters to mr vanhorne were sent by mr whitefield under my cover i am with love to brother and all yours and duty to mother to whom i have not time now to write your affectionate brother b franklin xxx an account of the newinvented pennsylvanian fireplaces  wherein their construction and manner of operation is particularly explained their advantages above every other method of warming rooms demonstrated and all objections that have been raised against the use of them answered and obviated with directions for putting them up and for using them to the best advantage and a copperplate in which the several parts of the machine are exactly laid down from a scale of equal parts philadelphia printed and sold by b franklin      in these northern colonies the inhabitants keep fires to sit by generally seven months in the year    that is from the beginning of october to the end of april and in some winters near eight months by taking in part of september and may wood our common fuel which within these hundred years might be had at any mans door must now be fetched near one hundred miles to some towns and makes a very considerable article in the expense of families as therefore so much of the comfort and conveniency of our lives for so great a part of the year depends on the article of fire since fuel is become so expensive and as the country is more cleared and settled will of course grow scarcer and dearer any new proposal for saving the wood and for lessening the charge and augmenting the benefit of fire by some particular method of making and managing it may at least be thought worth consideration the new fireplaces are a late invention to that purpose of which this paper is intended to give a particular account that the reader may the better judge whether this method of managing fire has any advantage over those heretofore in use it may be proper to consider both the old and new methods separately and particularly and afterwards make the comparison in order to do this it is necessary to understand well some few of the properties of air and fire viz   air is rarefied by heat and condensed by cold that is the same quantity of air takes up more space when warm than when cold this may be shown by several very easy experiments take any clear glass bottle a florence flask stript of the straw is  0 best place it before the fire and as the air within is warmed and rarefied part of it will be driven out of the bottle turn it up place its mouth in a vessel of water and remove it from the fire then as the air within cools and contracts you will see the water rise in the neck of the bottle supplying the place of just so much air as was driven out hold a large hot coal near the side of the bottle and as the air within feels the heat it will again distend and force out the water or fill a bladder not quite full of air tie the neck tight and lay it before a fire as near as may be without scorching the bladder as the air within heats you will perceive it to swell and fill the bladder till it becomes tight as if full blown remove it to a cool place and you will see it fall gradually till it becomes as lank as at first   air rarefied and distended by heat is specifically  lighter than it was before and will rise in other air of greater density as wood oil or any other matter specifically lighter than water if placed at the bottom of a vessel of water will rise till it comes to the top so rarefied air will rise in common air till it either comes to air of equal weight or is by cold reduced to its former density a fire then being made in any chimney the air over the fire is rarefied by the heat becomes lighter and therefore immediately rises in the funnel and goes out the other air in the room flowing towards the chimney supplies its place is rarefied in its    turn and rises likewise the place of the air thus carried out of the room is supplied by fresh air coming in through doors and windows or if they be shut through every crevice with violence as may be seen by holding a candle to a keyhole if the room be so tight as that all the crevices together will not supply so much air as is continually carried off then in a little time the current up the funnel must flag and the smoke being no longer driven up must come into the room   fire that is common fire throws out light heat and smoke or fume the two first move in right lines and with great swiftness the latter is but just separated from the fuel and then moves only as it is carried by the stream of rarefied air and without a continual accession and recession of air to carry off the smoky fumes they would remain crowded about the fire and stifle it   heat may be separated from the smoke as well as from the light by means of a plate of iron which will suffer heat to pass through it without the others   fire sends out its rays of heat as well as rays of light equally every way but the greatest sensible heat is over the fire where there is besides the rays of heat shot upwards a continual rising stream of hot air heated by the rays shot round on every side these things being understood we proceed to consider the fireplaces heretofore in use viz   the large open fireplaces used in the days of our fathers and still generally in the country and in kitchens      the newerfashioned fireplaces with low breasts and narrow hearths   fireplaces with hollow backs hearths and jambs of iron described by m gauger in his tract entitled la méchanique de feu for warming the air as it comes into the room   the holland stoves with iron doors opening into the room   the german stoves which have no opening in the room where they are used but the fire is put in from some other room or from without   iron pots with open charcoal fires placed in the middle of a room   the first of these methods has generally the conveniency of two warm seats one in each corner but they are sometimes too hot to abide in and at other times incommoded with the smoke there is likewise good room for the cook to move to hang on pots c their inconveniences are that they almost always smoke if the door be not left open that they require a large funnel and a large funnel carries off a great quantity of air which occasions what is called a strong draft to the chimney without which strong draft the smoke would come out of some part or other of so large an opening so that the door can seldom be shut and the cold air so nips the backs and heels of those that sit before the fire that they have no comfort till either screens or settles are provided at a considerable expense to keep it off which both cumber the room and darken the fireside a moderate quantity of wood on the fire in so large a hearth seems but little and in so strong and    cold a draft warms but little so that people are continually laying on more in short it is next to impossible to warm a room with such a fireplace and i suppose our ancestors never thought of warming rooms to sit in all they purposed was to have a place to make a fire in by which they might warm themselves when cold   most of these oldfashioned chimneys in towns and cities have been of late years reduced to the second sort mentioned by building jambs within them narrowing the hearth and making a low arch or breast it is strange methinks that though chimneys have been so long in use their construction should be so little understood till lately that no workman pretended to make one which should always carry off all smoke but a chimneycloth was looked upon as essential to a chimney this improvement however by small openings and low breasts has been made in our days and success in the first experiments has brought it into general use in cities so that almost all new chimneys are now made of that sort and much fewer bricks will make a stack of chimneys now than formerly an improvement so lately made may give us room to believe that still farther improvements may be found to remedy the inconveniences yet remaining for these new chimneys though they keep rooms generally free from smoke and the opening being contracted will allow the door to be shut yet the funnel still requiring a considerable quantity of air it rushes in at every crevice so strongly as to make a continual whistling or howling and it is very    uncomfortable as well as dangerous to sit against any such crevice many colds are caught from this cause only it being safer to sit in the open street for then the pores do all close together and the air does not strike so sharply against any particular part of the body the spaniards have a proverbial saying   if the wind blows on you through a hole   make your will and take care of your soul women particularly from this cause as they sit much in the house get colds in the head rheums and defluctions which fall into their jaws and gums and have destroyed early many a fine set of teeth in these northern colonies great and bright fires do also very much contribute to damage the eyes dry and shrivel the skin and bring on early the appearances of old age in short many of the diseases proceeding from colds as fevers pleurisies c fatal to very great numbers of people may be ascribed to strongdrawing chimneys whereby in severe weather a man is scorched before while he is froze behind  in the mean time very little is    done by these chimneys towards warming the room for the air round the fireplace which is warmed by the direct rays from the fire does not continue in the room but is continually crowded and gathered    into the chimney by the current of cold air coming behind it and so is presently carried off in both these sorts of fireplaces the greatest part of the heat from the fire is lost for as fire naturally darts heat every way the back the two jambs and the hearth drink up almost all that is given them very little being reflected from bodies so dark porous and unpolished and the upright heat which is by far the greatest flies directly up the chimney thus five sixths at least of the heat and consequently of the fuel is wasted and contributes nothing towards warming the room   to remedy this the sieur gauger gives in his book entitled la méchanique de feu published in   0  seven different constructions of the third sort of chimneys mentioned above in which there are hollow cavities made by iron plates in the back jambs and hearths through which plates the heat passing warms the air in those cavities which is continually coming into the room fresh and warm the invention was very ingenious and had many conveniences the room was warmed in all parts by the air flowing through the heated cavities cold air was prevented rushing through the crevices the funnel being sufficiently supplied by those cavities    much less fuel would serve c but the first expense which was very great the intricacy of the design and the difficulty of execution especially in old chimneys discouraged the propagation of the invention so that there are i suppose very few such chimneys now in use the upright heat too was almost all lost in these as in the common chimneys   the holland iron stove which has a flue proceeding from the top and a small iron door opening into the room comes next to be considered its conveniences are that it makes a room all over warm for the chimney being wholly closed except the flue of the stove very little air is required to supply that and therefore not much rushes in at crevices or at the door when it is opened little fuel serves the heat being almost all saved for it rays out almost equally from the four sides the bottom and the top into the room and presently warms the air around it which being rarefied rises to the ceiling and its place is supplied by the lower air of the room which flows gradually towards the stove and is there warmed and rises in its turn so that there is a continual circulation till all the air in the room is warmed the air too is gradually changed by the stovedoors being in the room through which part of it is continually passing and that makes these stoves wholesomer or at least pleasanter than the german stoves next to be spoken of but they have these inconveniences there is no sight of the fire which is in itself a pleasant thing one cannot conveniently make any    other use of the fire but that of warming the room when the room is warm people not seeing the fire are apt to forget supplying it with fuel till it is almost out then growing cold a great deal of wood is put in which soon makes it too hot the change of air is not carried on quite quick enough so that if any smoke or ill smell happens in the room it is a long time before it is discharged for these reasons the holland stove has not obtained much among the english who love the sight of the fire unless in some workshops where people are obliged to sit near windows for the light and in such places they have been found of good use   the german stove is like a box one side wanting it is composed of five iron plates screwed together and fixed so as that you may put the fuel into it from another room or from the outside of the house it is a kind of oven reversed its mouth being without and body within the room that is to be warmed by it this invention certainly warms a room very speedily and thoroughly with little fuel no quantity of cold air comes in at any crevice because there is no discharge of air which it might supply there being no passage into the stove from the room these are its conveniences its inconveniences are that people have not even so much sight or use of the fire as in the holland stoves and are moreover obliged to breathe the same unchanged air continually mixed with the breath and perspiration from one anothers bodies which is very disagreeable to those who have not been accustomed to it e  f      charcoal fires in pots are used chiefly in the shops of handicraftsmen they warm a room that is kept close and has no chimney to carry off the warmed air very speedily and uniformly but there being no draft to change the air the sulphurous fumes from the coals be they ever so well kindled before they are brought in there will be some mix with it render it disagreeable hurtful to some constitutions and sometimes when the door is long kept shut produce fatal consequences to avoid the several inconveniences and at the same time retain all the advantages of other fireplaces was contrived the pennsylvanian fireplace now to be described this machine consists of a bottom plate i see plate i a back plate ii two side plates iii iii two middle plates iv iv which joined together form a tight box with winding passages in it for warming the air a front plate v a top plate vi these are all cast of iron with mouldings or ledges where the plates come together to hold them fast and retain the mortar used for pointing to make tight joints when the plates are all in their places a pair of slender rods with screws are sufficient to bind the whole very firmly together as it appears in figure   there are moreover two thin plates of wrought iron viz the shutter vii and the register viii  0 besides the screwrods o p all which we shall explain in their order i the bottom plate or hearthpiece is round before with a rising moulding that serves as a fender to keep coals and ashes from coming to the floor c it has two ears f g perforated to receive the screwrods o p a long airhole a a through which the fresh outward air passes up into the airbox and three smokeholes b c through which the smoke descends and passes away all represented by dark squares it has also double ledges to receive between them the bottom edges of the back plate the two side plates and the two middle plates these ledges are about an inch asunder and about half an inch high a profile of two of them joined to a fragment of plate appears in figure   ii the back plate is without holes having only a pair of ledges on each side to receive the back edges of the two iii iii side plates these have each a pair of ledges to receive the side edges of the front plate and a little shoulder for it to rest on also two pair of ledges to receive the side edges of the two middle plates which form the airbox and an oblong airhole near the top through which is discharged into the room the air warmed in the airbox each has also a wing or bracket h and i to keep in falling brands coals c and a small hole q and r for the axis of the register to turn in iv iv the airbox is composed of the two middle plates d e and f g the first have five thin ledges or partitions cast on it two inches deep    the edges of which are received in so many pair of ledges cast in the other the tops of all the cavities formed by these thin deep ledges are also covered by a ledge of the same form and depth cast with them so that when the plates are put together and the joints luted there is no communication between the airbox and the smoke in the winding passages of this box fresh air is warmed as it passes into the room v the front plate is arched on the under side and ornamented with foliages c it has no ledges vi the top plate has a pair of ears m n answerable to those in the bottom plate and perforated for the same purpose it has also a pair of ledges running round the under side to receive the top edges of the front back and side plates the airbox does not reach up to the top plate by two inches and a half vii the shutter is of thin wrought iron and light of such a length and breadth as to close well the opening of the fireplace it is used to blow up the fire and to shut up and secure it at nights it has two brass knobs for handles d d and commonly slides up and down in a groove left in putting up the fireplace between the foremost ledge of the side plates and the face of the front plate but some choose to set it aside when it is not in use and apply it on occasion viii the register is also of thin wrought iron it is placed between the back plate and airbox and can by means of the key s be turned on its axis so as to lie in any position between level and upright    the screwrods o p are of wrought iron about a third of an inch thick with a button at bottom and a screw and nut at top and may be ornamented with two small brasses screwed on above the nuts to put this machine to work   a false back of fourinch or in shallow small chimneys twoinch brick work is to be made in the chimney four inches or more from the true back from the top of this false back a closing is to be made over to the breast of the chimney that no air may pass into the chimney but what goes under the false back and up behind it   some bricks of the hearth are to be taken up to form a hollow under the bottom plate across which hollow runs a thin tight partition to keep apart the air entering the hollow and the smoke and is therefore placed between the airhole and smokeholes   a passage is made communicating with the outward air to introduce that air into the fore part of the hollow under the bottom plate whence it may rise through the airhole into the airbox   a passage is made from the back part of the hollow communicating with the flue behind the false back through this passage the smoke is to pass the fireplace is to be erected upon these hollows by putting all the plates in their places and screwing them together its operation may be conceived by observing the plate entitled profile of the chimney and fireplace see plate ii m the mantelpiece or breast of the chimney g  profile of the pennsylvania chimney and fireplace    c the funnel b the false back and closing e true back of the chimney t top of the fireplace f the front of it a the place where the fire is made d the airbox k the hole in the side plate through which the warmed air is discharged out of the airbox into the room h the hollow filled with fresh air entering at the passage i and ascending into the airbox through the airhole in the bottomplate near g the partition in the hollow to keep the air and smoke apart p the passage under the false back and part of the hearth for the smoke the arrows show the course of the smoke the fire being made at a the flame and smoke will ascend and strike the top t which will thereby receive a considerable heat the smoke finding no passage upwards turns over the top of the airbox and descends between it and the back plate to the holes in the bottom plate heating as it passes both plates of the airbox and the said back plate the front bottom and side plates are also all heated at the same time the smoke proceeds in the passage that leads it under and behind the false back and so rises into the chimney the air of the room warmed behind the back plate and by the sides front and top plates becoming specifically lighter than the other air in the room is obliged to rise but the closure    over the fireplace hindering it from going up the chimney it is forced out into the room rises by the mantelpiece to the ceiling and spreads all over the top of the room whence being crowded down gradually by the stream of newlywarmed air that follows and rises above it the whole room becomes in a short time equally warmed at the same time the air warmed under the bottom plate and in the airbox rises and comes out of the holes in the side plates very swiftly if the door of the room be shut and joins its current with the stream before mentioned rising from the side back and top plates the air that enters the room through the airbox is fresh though warm and computing the swiftness of its motion with the areas of the holes it is found that near ten barrels of fresh air are hourly introduced by the airbox and by this means the air in the room is continually changed and kept at the same time sweet and warm it is to be observed that the entering air will not be warm at first lighting the fire but heats gradually as the fire increases a square opening for a trapdoor should be left in the closing of the chimney for the sweeper to go up the door may be made of slate or tin and commonly kept close shut but so placed as that turning up against the back of the chimney when open it closes the vacancy behind the false back and shoots the soot that falls in sweeping out upon the hearth this trapdoor is a very convenient thing in rooms where much smoking of tobacco is used    it is also convenient to have a small hole about five or six inches square cut near the ceiling through into the funnel this hole must have a shutter by which it may be closed or operated at pleasure when open there will be a strong draft of air through it into the chimney which will presently carry off a cloud of smoke and keep the room clear if the room be too hot likewise it will carry off as much of the warm air as you please and then you may stop it entirely or in part as you think fit by this means it is that the tobacco smoke does not descend among the heads of the company near the fire as it must do before it can get into common chimneys the manner of using this fireplace your cordwood must be cut into three lengths or else a short piece fit for the fireplace cut off and the longer left for the kitchen or other fires dry hickory or ash or any woods that burn with a clear flame are rather to be chosen because such are less apt to foul the smoke passages with soot and flame communicates with its light as well as by contact greater heat to the plates and room but where more ordinary wood is used half a dry fagot of brushwood burnt at the first making the fire in the morning is very advantageous as it immediately by its sudden blaze heats the plates and warms the room which with bad wood slowly kindling would not be done so soon and at the same time by the length of its flame turning in the passages consumes and cleanses away the soot that such bad smoky wood    had produced therein the preceding day and so keeps them always free and clean when you have laid a little back log and placed your billets on small dogs as in common chimneys and put some fire to them then slide down your shutter as low as the dogs and the opening being by that means contracted the air rushes in briskly and presently blows up the flames when the fire is sufficiently kindled slide it up again  in some of these fireplaces there is a little six inch square trapdoor of thin wrought iron or brass covering a hole of like dimensions near the fore part of the bottom plate which being by a ring lifted up towards the fire about an inch where it will be retained by two springing sides fixed to it perpendicularly see plate i fig   the air rushes in from the hollow under the bottom plate and blows the fire where this is used the shutter serves only to close the fire at nights the more forward you can make your fire on the hearthplate not to be incommoded by the smoke the sooner and more will the room be warmed at night when you go to bed cover the coals or brands with ashes as usual then take away the dogs and slide down the shutter close to the bottom plate sweeping a little ashes against it that no air may pass under it then turn the register so as very near to stop the flue behind    if no smoke then comes out at crevices into the room it is right if any smoke is perceived to come out move the register so as to give a little draft and it will go the right way thus the room will be kept warm all night for the chimney being almost entirely stopt very little cold air if any will enter the room at any crevice when you come to rekindle the fire in the morning turn open the register before you lift up the slider otherwise if there be any smoke in the fireplace it will come out into the room by the same use of the shutter and register a blazing fire may be presently stifled as well as secured when you have occasion to leave it for any time and at your return you will find the brands warm and ready for a speedy rekindling the shutter alone will not stifle a fire for it cannot well be made to fit so exactly but that air will enter and that in a violent stream so as to blow up and keep alive the flames and consume the wood if the draft be not checked by turning the register to shut the flue behind the register has also two other uses if you observe the draft of air into your fireplace to be stronger than is necessary as in extreme cold weather it often is so that the wood is consumed faster than usual in that case a quarter half or twothirds turn of the register will check the violence of the draft and let your fire burn with the moderation you desire and at the same time both the fireplace and the room will be the warmer because less cold air will enter and pass through them and if the chimney should happen to take fire which indeed there is very little danger of if the preceding    direction be observed in making fires and it be well swept once a year for much less wood being burnt less soot is proportionably made and the fuel being soon blown into flame by the shutter or the trapdoor bellows there is consequently less smoke from the fuel to make soot then though the funnel should be foul yet the sparks have such a crooked up and down roundabout way to go that they are out before they get at it i say if ever it should be on fire a turn of the register shuts all close and prevents any air going into the chimney and so the fire may be easily stifled and mastered the advantages of this fireplace its advantages above the common fireplaces are   that your whole room is equally warmed so that people need not crowd so close round the fire but may sit near the window and have the benefit of the light for reading writing needlework c they may sit with comfort in any part of the room which is a very considerable advantage in a large family where there must often be two fires kept because all cannot conveniently come at one   if you sit near the fire you have not that cold draft of uncomfortable air nipping your back and heels as when before common fires by which many catch cold being scorched before and as it were froze behind   if you sit against a crevice there is not that sharp draft of cold air playing on you as in rooms where there are fires in the common way by which    many catch cold whence proceed coughs  catarrhs toothaches fevers pleurisies and many other diseases   in case of sickness they make most excellent nursingrooms as they constantly supply a sufficiency of fresh air so warmed at the same time as to be no way inconvenient or dangerous a small one does well in a chamber and the chimneys being fitted for it it may be removed from one room to another as occasion requires and fixed in half an hour the equal temper too and warmth of the air of the room is thought to be particularly advantageous in some distempers for it was observed in the winters of    0 and      when the smallpox spread in pennsylvania that very few children of the germans died of that distemper in proportion to those of the english which was ascribed by some to the warmth and equal temper of air in their stoverooms which made the disease as favorable as it commonly is in the west indies but this conjecture we submit to the judgment of physicians   in common chimneys the strongest heat from the fire which is upwards goes directly up the chimney and is lost and there is such a strong draft into the chimney that not only the upright heat but also the back sides and downward heats are carried up the chimney by that draft of air and the warmth  00 given before the fire by the rays that strike out towards the room is continually driven back crowded into the chimney and carried up by the same draft of air but here the upright heat strikes and heats the top plate which warms the air above it and that comes into the room the heat likewise which the fire communicates to the sides back bottom and airbox is all brought into the room for you will find a constant current of warm air coming out of the chimney corner into the room hold a candle just under the mantelpiece or breast of your chimney and you will see the flame bent outwards by laying a piece of smoking paper on the hearth on either side you may see how the current of air moves and where it tends for it will turn and carry the smoke with it   thus as very little of the heat is lost when this fireplace is used much less wood  will serve you which is a considerable advantage where wood is dear   when you burn candles near this fireplace you will find that the flame burns quite upright and does not blare and run the tallow down by drawing towards the chimney as against common fires  0    this fireplace cures most smoky chimneys and thereby preserves both the eyes and furniture   it prevents the fouling of chimneys much of the lint and dust that contributes to foul a chimney being by the low arch obliged to pass through the flame where it is consumed then less wood being burnt there is less smoke made again the shutter or trapbellows soon blowing the wood into a flame the same wood does not yield so much smoke as if burnt in a common chimney for as soon as flame begins smoke in proportion ceases  0 and if a chimney should be foul it is much less likely to take fire if it should take fire it is easily stifled and extinguished    a fire may be very speedily made in this fireplace by the help of the shutter or trapbellows as aforesaid    a fire may be soon extinguished by closing it with the shutter before and turning the register behind which will stifle it and the brands will remain ready to rekindle    the room being once warm the warmth may be retained in it all night    and lastly the fire is so secured at night that not one spark can fly out into the room to do damage with all these conveniences you do not lose the pleasing sight nor use of the fire as in the dutch stoves but may boil the teakettle warm the flatirons heat heaters keep warm a dish of victuals by setting it on the top c  0  objections answered there are some objections commonly made by people that are unacquainted with these fireplaces which it may not be amiss to endeavour to remove as they arise from prejudices which might otherwise obstruct in some degree the general use of this beneficial machine we frequently hear it said they are of the nature of dutch stoves stoves have an unpleasant smell stoves are unwholesome and warm rooms make people tender and apt to catch cold as to the first that they are of the nature of dutch stoves the description of those stoves in the beginning of this paper compared with that of these machines shows that there is a most material difference and that these have vastly the advantage if it were only in the single article of the admission and circulation of the fresh air but it must be allowed there may have been some cause to complain of the offensive smell of iron stoves this smell however never proceeded from the iron itself which in its nature whether hot or cold is one of the sweetest of metals but from the general uncleanly manner of using those stoves if they are kept clean they are as sweet as an ironingbox which though ever so hot never offends the smell of the nicest lady but it is common to let them be greased by setting candlesticks on them or otherwise to rub greasy hands on them and above all to spit upon them to try how hot they are which is an inconsiderate filthy unmannerly custom for the slimy matter of spittle drying on burns and fumes when the stove is hot  0  as well as the grease and smells most nauseously which makes such close stoverooms where there is no draft to carry off those filthy vapors almost intolerable to those that are not from their infancy accustomed to them at the same time nothing is more easy than to keep them clean for when by any accident they happen to be fouled a lie made of ashes and water with a brush will scour them perfectly as will also a little strong soft soap and water that hot iron of itself gives no offensive smell those know very well who have as the writer of this had been present at a furnace when the workmen were pouring out the flowing metal to cast large plates and not the least smell of it to be perceived that hot iron does not like lead brass and some other metals give out unwholesome vapors is plain from the general health and strength of those who constantly work in iron as furnacemen forgemen and smiths that it is in its nature a metal perfectly wholesome to the body of man is known from the beneficial use of chalybeate or ironmine waters from the good done by taking steel filings in several disorders and that even the smithy water in which hot irons are quenched is found advantageous to the human constitution the ingenious and learned dr desaguliers to whose instructive writings the contriver of this machine acknowledges himself much indebted relates an experiment he made to try whether heated iron would yield unwholesome vapors he took a cube of iron and having given it a very great heat he fixed it so to a receiver  0  exhausted by the airpump that all the air rushing in to fill the receiver should first pass through a hole in the hot iron he then put a small bird into the receiver who breathed that air without any inconvenience or suffering the least disorder but the same experiment being made with a cube of hot brass a bird put into that air died in a few minutes brass indeed stinks even when cold and much more when hot lead too when hot yields a very unwholesome steam but iron is always sweet and every way taken is wholesome and friendly to the human body except in weapons that warmed rooms make people tender and apt to catch cold is a mistake as great as it is among the english general we have seen in the preceding pages how the common rooms are apt to give colds but the writer of this paper may affirm from his own experience and that of his family and friends who have used warm rooms for these four winters past that by the use of such rooms people are rendered less liable to take cold and indeed actually hardened if sitting warm in a room made one subject to take cold on going out lying warm in bed should by a parity of reason produce the same effect when we rise yet we find we can leap out of the warmest bed naked in the coldest morning without any such danger and in the same manner out of warm clothes into a cold bed the reason is that in these cases the pores all close at once the cold is shut out and the heat within augmented as we soon after feel by the glowing of the flesh and skin thus no one was ever known to catch cold by the use of the cold bath  0  and are not cold baths allowed to harden the bodies of those that use them are they not therefore frequently prescribed to the tenderest constitutions now every time you go out of a warm room into the cold freezing air you do as it were plunge into a cold bath and the effect is in proportion the same for though perhaps you may feel somewhat chilly at first you find in a little time your bodies hardened and strengthened your blood is driven round with a brisker circulation and a comfortable steady uniform inward warmth succeeds that equal outward warmth you first received in the room farther to confirm this assertion we instance the swedes the danes and the russians these nations are said to live in rooms compared to ours as hot as ovens  yet where are the hardy soldiers though bred in their boasted cool houses that can like these people bear the fatigues of a winter campaign in so severe a climate march whole days to the neck in snow and at night intrench in ice as they do  0  the mentioning of those northern nations puts me in mind of a considerable public advantage that may arise from the general use of these fireplaces it is observable that though those countries have been well inhabited for many ages wood is still their fuel and yet at no very great price which could not have been if they had not universally used stoves but consumed it as we do in great quantities by open fires by the help of this saving invention our wood may grow as fast as we consume it and our posterity may warm themselves at a moderate rate without being obliged to fetch their fuel over the atlantic as if pitcoal should not be here discovered which is an uncertainty they must necessarily do we leave it to the political arithmetician to compute how much money will be saved to a country by its spending two thirds less of fuel how much labor saved in cutting and carriage of it how much more land may be cleared by cultivation how great the profit by the additional quantity of work done in those trades particularly that do not exercise the body so much but that the workfolks are obliged to run frequently to the fire to warm themselves and to physicians to say how much healthier thickbuilt towns and cities will be now half suffocated with sulphury smoke when so much less of that smoke shall be made and the air breathed by the inhabitants be consequently so much purer these things it will suffice just to have mentioned let us proceed to give some necessary directions to the workman who is to fix or set up these fireplaces  0  directions to the bricklayer the chimney being first well swept and cleansed from soot c lay the bottom plate down on the hearth in the place where the fireplace is to stand which may be as forward as the hearth will allow chalk a line from one of its back corners round the plate to the other corner that you may afterwards know its place when you come to fix it and from those corners two parallel lines to the back of the chimney make marks also on each side that you may know where the partition is to stand which is to prevent any communication between the air and smoke then removing the plate make a hollow under it and beyond it by taking up as many of the bricks or tiles as you can within your chalked lines quite to the chimneyback dig out six or eight inches deep of the earth or rubbish all the breadth and length of your hollow then make a passage of four inches square if the place will allow so much leading from the hollow to some place communicating with the outer air by outer air we mean air without the room you intend to warm this passage may be made to enter your hollow on either side or in the fore part just as you find most convenient the circumstances of your chimney considered if the fireplace is to be put up in a chamber you may have this communication of outer air from the staircase or sometimes more easily from between the chamber floor and the ceiling of the lower room making only a small hole in the wall of the house entering the space betwixt those two  0  joists with which your airpassage in the hearth communicates if this airpassage be so situated as that mice may enter it and nestle in the hollow a little grate of wire will keep them out this passage being made and if it runs under any part of the hearth tiled over securely you may proceed to raise your false back this may be of four inches or two inches thickness as you have room but let it stand at least four inches from the true chimney back in narrow chimneys this false back runs from jamb to jamb but in large oldfashioned chimneys you need not make it wider than the back of the fireplace to begin it you may form an arch nearly flat of three bricks end to end over the hollow to leave a passage the breadth of the iron fireplace and five or six inches deep rounding at bottom for the smoke to turn and pass under the false back and so behind it up the chimney the false back is to rise till it is as high as the breast of the chimney and then to close over to the breast  always observing if there is a wooden manteltree to close above it if there is no wood in the breast you may arch over and close even with the lower part of the breast by this closing the chimney is made tight that no air or smoke may pass up it without going under the false back then from side to side of your hollow against the marks you made with chalk raise a tight partition brickonedge to separate the air from the smoke bevelling away to half an inch the brick that comes just under the airhole that the air may have  0  a free passage up into the airbox lastly close the hearth over that part of the hollow that is between the false back and the place of the bottom plate coming about half an inch under the plate which piece of hollow hearth may be supported by a bit or two of old iron hoop then is your chimney fitted to receive the fireplace to set it lay first a little bed of mortar all round the edges of the hollow and over the top of the partition then lay down your bottom plate in its place with the rods in it and tread it till it lies firm then put a little fine mortar made of loam and lime with a little hair into its joints and set in your back plate leaning it for the present against the false back then set in your airbox with a little mortar in its joints then put in the two sides closing them up against the airbox with mortar in their grooves and fixing at the same time your register then bring up your back to its place with mortar in its grooves and that will bind the sides together then put in your front plate placing it as far back in the groove as you can to leave room for the sliding plate then lay on your top plate with mortar in its grooves also screwing the whole firmly together by means of the rods the capital letters a b d e c in the cut plate ii show the corresponding parts of the several plates lastly the joints being pointed all round on the outside the fireplace is fit for use when you make your first fire in it perhaps if the chimney be thoroughly cold it may not draw the work too being all cold and damp in such case   0 put first a few shovels of hot coals in the fireplace then lift up the chimney sweepers trapdoor and putting in a sheet or two of flaming paper shut it again which will set the chimney a drawing immediately and when once it is filled with a column of warm air it will draw strongly and continually the drying of the mortar and work by the first fire may smell unpleasantly but that will soon be over in some shallow chimneys to make more room for the false back and its flue four inches or more of the chimneyback may be picked away let the room be made as tight as conveniently it may be so will the outer air that must come in to supply the room and draft of the fire be all obliged to enter through the passage under the bottom plate and up through the airbox by which means it will not come cold to your backs but be warmed as it comes in and mixed with the warm air round the fireplace before it spreads into the room but as a great quantity of cold air in extreme cold weather especially will presently enter a room if the door be carelessly left open it is good to have some contrivance to shut it either by means of screw hinges a spring or a pulley when the pointing in the joints is all dry and hard get some powder of black lead broken bits of black lead crucibles from the silversmiths pounded fine will do and mixing it with a little rum and water lay it on when the plates are warm with a hard brush over the top and front plates part of the side and bottom plates and over all the pointing     and as it dries rub it to a gloss with the same brush so the joints will not be discerned but it will look all of a piece and shine like new iron and the false back being plastered and whitewashed and the hearth reddened the whole will make a pretty appearance before the black lead is laid on it would not be amiss to wash the plates with strong lie and a brush or soap and water to cleanse them from any spots of grease or filth that may be on them if any grease should afterwards come on them a little wet ashes will get it out if it be well set up and in a tolerably good chimney smoke will draw in from as far as the fore part of the bottom plate as you may try by a bit of burning paper people are at first apt to make their rooms too warm not imagining how little a fire will be sufficient when the plates are no hotter than that one may just bear the hand on them the room will generally be as warm as you desire it      benjamin franklin   april      new york cadwallader colden xxxi to the hon cadwallader colden new york   april      sir— happening to be in this city about some particular affairs i have the pleasure of receiving yours of the   th past here and can now acquaint you that the society  as far as it relates to philadelphia is actually formed and has had several meetings to mutual satisfaction as soon as i get home i shall send you a short account of what has been done and proposed at these meetings the members are   dr thomas bond as physician   mr john bartram as botanist   mr thomas godfrey as mathematician   mr samuel rhoads as mechanician   mr william parsons as geographer   dr phineas bond as general nat philosopher   mr thomas hopkinson president   mr william coleman treasurer   b f—— secretary to whom the following members have since been added viz mr alexander of new york mr morris chief justice of the jerseys mr home secretary of do mr john coxe of trenton and mr martyn of the same place mr nicholls tells     me of several other gentlemen of this city that incline to encourage the thing and there are a number of others in virginia maryland and the new england colonies we expect to join us as soon as they are acquainted that the society has begun to form itself i am sir with much respect your most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   september      philadelphia josiah franklin abiah franklin xxxii to josiah and abiah franklin philadelphia   september      honored father and mother i apprehend i am too busy in prescribing and meddling in the doctors sphere when any of you complain of ails in your letters but as i always employ a physician myself when any disorder arises in my family and submit implicitly to his orders in every thing so i hope you consider my advice when i give any only as a mark of my good will and put no more of it in practice than happens to agree with what your doctor directs your notion of the use of strong lye i suppose may have a good deal in it the salt of tartar or salt of wormwood frequently prescribed for cutting opening and cleansing is nothing more than the salt of lye procured by evaporation mrs stevenss medicine for the stone and gravel the secret of which was lately purchased at a great price by the parliament     has for its principal ingredient salt which boerhaave calls the most universal remedy the same salt intimately mixed with oil of turpentine which you also mentioned makes the sapo philosophorum wonderfully extolled by some chemists for like purposes it is highly probable as your doctor says that medicines are much altered in passing between the stomach and bladder but such salts seem well fitted in their nature to pass with the least alteration of almost any thing we know and if they will not dissolve gravel and stone yet i am half persuaded that a moderate use of them may go a great way towards preventing these disorders as they assist a weaker digestion in the stomach and powerfully dissolve crudities such as those which i have frequently experienced as to honey and molasses i did not mention them merely as openers and looseners but also from conjecture that as they are heavier in themselves than our common drink they might when dissolved in our bodies increase the gravity of our fluids the urine in particular and by that means keep separate and suspended therein those particles which when unused form gravel c i will inquire after the herb you mention we have a botanist here an intimate friend of mine who knows all the plants in the country he would be glad of the correspondence of some gentlemen of the same taste with you and has twice through my hands sent specimens of the famous chinese ginseng found here to persons who desired it in boston neither of whom has had the civility to write him a word in answer or even to acknowledge the receipt     of it of which please to give a hint to brother john we have had a very healthy summer and a fine harvest the country is filled with bread but as trade declines since the war began i know not what our farmers will do for a market i am your affectionate and dutiful son b franklin benjamin franklin    august      philadelphia cadwallader colden xxxiii to cadwallader colden philadelphia    august      sir— i received your favor of the  0th past which your medical piece enclosed the reading of which gave me a great deal of pleasure i showed it to our friend mr bartram who carried it home and as he since tells me is taking a copy of it his keeping of it for that end has prevented my showing it to any other gentleman as you desired and hitherto prevented my writing to you upon it as i intended but lest you should conclude me the very worst correspondent in the world i shall delay no longer giving you some thoughts that occurred to me in reading of it choosing rather to be blamed for not writing to the purpose than for not writing at all i am extremely pleased with your doctrine of the absorbent vessels intermixed with the perspiratory ducts both on the external and internal superficies of the body after i had read sanctorius i imagined a constant stream of the perspirable matter issuing     at every pore in the skin but then i was puzzled to account for the effects of mercurial unctions for the strangury sometimes occasioned by an outward application of the flies and the like since whatever virtue or quality might be in a medicine laid upon the skin if it would enter the body it must go against wind and tide as one may say dr hales helped me a little when he informed me in his vegetable statics that the body is not always in a perspirable but sometimes in an imbibing state as he expresses it and will at times actually grow heavier by being exposed to moist air but this did not quite remove my difficulty since as these fits of imbibing did not appear to be regular or frequent a blistering plaster might lie on the body a week or a mercurial unguent be used a month to no purpose if the body should so long continue in a perspirable state your doctrine which was quite new to me makes all easy since the body may perspire and absorb at the same time through the different ducts destined to those different ends i must own however that i have one objection to the explanation you give of the operation of these absorbents that they should communicate with the veins and the perspirants with the arteries only seems natural enough but as all fluids by the hydrostatical law pass equally in all directions i question whether the mere direction of one of those minute vessels where it joins with a vein or artery with or against the stream of blood in the larger vessel would be sufficient to produce such contrary effects as perspiring and absorbing if it would both perspirants     and absorbents might proceed from the arteries only or from the veins only or from both indifferently as by the figure in the margin whether the vessel a b is an artery or a vein if the stream moves from a to b the minute communicating vessel c shall be a perspirant and d an absorbent and the contrary if it moves from b to a yet i cannot say i am certain the mere direction of the vessel will have no effect i only suspect it and am making a little machine to try an experiment with for satisfaction  it is a siphon made of two large joints of carolina cane united at e into which two small glass tubes f and g are to be inserted one on the descending and the other on the ascending side i propose to fill the siphon and the two glass tubes with water and when it is playing unstop at the same instant the tops of both glass tubes observing in which the water sinks fastest you shall know the success i conceive the pressure of the atmosphere on the apertures of the two glass tubes to be no way different from the pressure of the same on the mouths of the perspirants and absorbents and if the water sinks equally in the two tubes notwithstanding the direction of one against and the other with the stream i shall be ready to think we must look out for another solution you will say perhaps that it will then be time enough when the experiment is     tried and succeeds as i suspect yet i cannot forbear attempting at one beforehand while some thoughts are present in my mind if a new solution should be found necessary this may be ready for consideration  i do not remember that any anatomist that has fallen in my way has assigned any other cause of the motion of the blood through its whole circle than the contractile force of the heart by which that fluid is driven with violence into the arteries and so continually propelled by repetitions of the same force till it arrives at the heart again may we for our present purpose suppose another cause producing half the effect and say that the ventricles of the heart like syringes draw when they dilate as well as force when they contract that this is not unlikely may be judged from the valves nature has placed in the arteries to prevent the drawing back of the blood in those vessels when the heart dilates while no such obstacles prevent its sucking to use the vulgar expression from the veins if this be allowed and the insertion of the absorbents into the veins and of the perspirants into the arteries be agreed to it will be of no importance in what direction they are inserted for as the branches of the arteries are continually lessening in their diameters and the motion of the blood decreasing by means of the increased resistance there must as more is constantly pressed on behind arise a kind of crowding in the extremities of those vessels which will naturally force out what is contained in the perspirants that communicate with them this lessens the     quantity of blood so that the heart cannot receive again by the veins all it had discharged into the arteries which occasions it to draw strongly upon the absorbents that communicate with them and thus the body is continually perspiring and imbibing hence after long fasting the body is more liable to receive infection from bad air and food before it is sufficiently chylified is drawn crude into the blood by the absorbents that open into the bowels to confirm this position that the heart draws as well as drives the blood let me add this particular if you sit or lean long in such a manner as to compress the principal artery that supplies a limb with blood so that it does not furnish a due quantity you will be sensible of a pricking pain in the extremities like that of a thousand needles and the veins which used to raise your skin in ridges will be with the skin sunk in channels the blood being drawn out of them and their sides pressed so closely together that it is with difficulty and slowly that the blood afterwards enters them when the compressed artery is relieved if the blood was not drawn by the heart the compression of an artery would not empty a vein and i conjecture that the pricking pain is occasioned by the sides of the small vessels being pressed together i am not without apprehension that this hypothesis is either not new or if it is new not good for any thing it may however in this letter with the enclosed paper on a kindred subject serve to show the great confidence i place in your candor since to you i so freely hazard myself ultra crepidam in   0 meddling with matters directly pertaining to your profession and entirely out of the way of my own if you give yourself the trouble of reading them it is all i can modestly expect your silence about them afterwards will be sufficient to convince me that i am in the wrong and that i ought to study the sciences i dabble in before i presume to set pen to paper i will endeavour however to make you some amends by procuring you from better judges some better remarks on the rest of your piece and shall observe your caution not to let them know from whom i had it the piece on fluxions i purpose shortly to read again and that on the several species of matter when you shall have what little i shall be able to say about them the members of our society here are very idle gentlemen they will take no pains i must i believe alter the scheme and proceed with the papers i have and may receive in the manner you advise in one of your former letters the mention of your former letter puts me in mind how much i am in arrear with you like some honest insolvent debtors i must resolve to pay ready money for what i have hereafter and discharge the old debt by little and little as i am able the impertinence of these mosquitos to me now i am in the humor of writing prevents a great deal of mine to you so that for once they are of some use in the world i am sir your most humble servant b franklin     benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia cadwallader colden xxxiv to cadwallader colden philadelphia    november      sir— i shall be very willing and ready when you think proper to publish your piece on gravitation to print it at my own expense and risk if i can be the means of communicating any thing valuable to the world i do not always think of gaining nor even of saving by my business but a piece of that kind as it must excite the curiosity of all the learned can hardly fail of bearing its own expense i must not pretend to dispute with you on any part of the animal economy you are quite too strong for me i shall just mention two or three little things that i am not quite clear in if there is no contrivance in the frame of the auricles or ventricles of the heart by which they dilate themselves i cannot conceive how they are dilated it is said by the force of the venal blood rushing into them but if that blood has no force which was not first given to it by the contraction of the heart how can it diminished as it must be by the resisting friction of the vessels it has passed through be strong enough to overcome that contraction your doctrine of fermentation in the capillaries helps me a little for if the returning blood be rarefied by the fermentation its motion must be increased but as it seems to me that it must by its expansion resist the arterial blood behind it as much as it accelerates the venal blood before it i am still somewhat     unsatisfied i have heard or read somewhere too that the hearts of some animals continue to contract and dilate or to beat as it is commonly expressed after they are separated from the other vessels and taken out of the body if this be true their dilation is not caused by the force of the returning blood i should be glad to satisfy myself too whether the blood is always quicker in motion when the pulse beats quicker perhaps more blood is driven forward by one strong deep stroke than by two that are weak and light as a man may breathe more air by one long common respiration when in health than by two quick short ones in a fever i applied the siphon i mentioned to you in a former letter to the pipe of a waterengine e is the engine a its pipe b b b the siphon c and d the two glass pipes communicating with the siphon upon working the engine the water flowed through the siphon and the glass tube c but none was discharged through d when i stopped with my finger the end of the siphon the water issued at both glass tubes with equal force     and on only half stopping the end of the siphon it did the same i imagine the sudden bending of the siphon gives such a resistance to the stream as to occasion its issuing out of the glass tube c but i intend to try a farther experiment of which i shall give you an account  i am now determined to publish an american philosophical miscellany monthly or quarterly i shall begin with next january and proceed as i find encouragement and assistance as i purpose to take the compiling wholly upon myself the reputation of no gentleman or society will be affected by what i insert of anothers and that perhaps will make them more free to communicate their names shall be published or concealed as they think proper and care taken to do exact justice to matters of invention c i shall be glad of your advice in any particulars that occurred to you in thinking of this scheme for as you first proposed it to me i doubt not but you have well considered it  i have not the original of dr mitchells tract on the yellow fever  mine is a copy i had taken with his leave when here mr evans will make a copy of it for you i hope it will be confirmed by future experiment     that the yaws are to be cured by tarwater the case you relate to dr mitchell gives great hopes of it and should be published to induce people to make trials for though it should not always succeed i suppose there is no danger of its doing any harm as to your pieces on fluxions and the different species of matter it is not owing to reservedness that i have not yet sent you my thoughts but because i cannot please myself with them having had no leisure yet to digest them if i was clear that you are anywhere mistaken i would tell you so and give my reasons with all freedom as believing nothing i could do would be more obliging to you i am persuaded you think as i do that he who removes a prejudice or an error from our minds contributes to their beauty as he would do to that of our faces who should clear them of a wart or a wen i have a friend gone to new york with a view of settling there if he can meet with encouragement it is dr john bard  whom i esteem an ingenious physician and surgeon and a discreet worthy and honest man if upon conversation with him you find this character just i doubt not but you will afford him your advice and countenance which will be of great service to him in a place where he is entirely a stranger and very much oblige sir your most humble servant b franklin p s—i shall forward your letter to dr mitchell thank you for leaving it open for my perusal     benjamin franklin cadwallader colden xxxv to cadwallader colden date uncertain sir— i received yours with others enclosed for mr bartram and mr armit to which i suppose the enclosed are answers the person who brought yours said he would call for answers but did not or if he did i did not see him i understand parker  has begun upon your piece a long sitting of our assembly has hitherto hindered me from beginning the miscellany i shall write to dr gronovius as you desire i wish i had mathematics enough to satisfy myself whether the much shorter voyages made by ships bound hence to england than by those from england hither are not in some degree owing to the diurnal motion of the earth and if so in what degree it is a notion that has lately entered my mind i know not if ever any others ships in a calm at the equator move with the sea fifteen miles per minute at our cape suppose twelve miles per minute in the british channel suppose ten miles per minute here is a difference of two miles velocity per minute between cape henlopen and the lizard no small matter in so weighty a body as a laden ship swimming in a fluid how is this velocity lost in the voyage thither if not by the resistance of the water and if so then the water which resisted in part must have given way in part to the ship     from time to time as she proceeded continually out of parallels of latitude where the earths motion or rotation was quicker into others where it was slower and thus as her velocity tends eastward with the earths motion she perhaps makes her easting sooner suppose a vessel lying still in a calm at our cape could be taken up and the same instant set down in an equal calm in the english channel would not the difference of velocity between her and the sea she was placed in appear plainly by a violent motion of the ship through the water eastward i have not time to explain myself farther the post waiting but i believe i have said enough for you to comprehend my meaning if the reasons hinted at should incline you to think there is any thing in this notion i should be glad of an answer to this question if it be capable of a precise answer viz suppose a ship sails in a northeast line from latitude    to latitude    in thirty days how long will she be returning on the same line winds currents etc being equal just so much as the eastern motion of the earth helps her easting i suppose it will hinder her westing perhaps the weight and dimensions or shape of the vessel should be taken into consideration as the water resists bodies of different shapes differently i must beg you to excuse the incorrectness of this scrawl as i have not time to transcribe i am sir your most humble servant b franklin     benjamin franklin      philadelphia john franklin xxxvi to john franklin at boston philadelphia      — our people are extremely impatient to hear of your success at cape breton  my shop is filled with inquirers at the coming in of every post some wonder the place is not yet taken i tell them i shall be glad to hear that news three months hence fortified towns are hard nuts to crack and your teeth have not been accustomed to it taking strong places is a particular trade which you have taken up without serving an apprenticeship to it armies and veterans need skilful engineers to direct them in their attack have you any but some seem to think forts are as easy taken as snuff father moodys prayers look tolerably modest you have a fast and prayer day for that purpose in which i compute five hundred thousand petitions were offered up to the same effect in new england which added to the petitions of every family morning and evening multiplied by the number of days since january   th make fortyfive millions of prayers which set against the prayers of a few priests in the garrison to the virgin mary give a vast balance in your favor if you do not succeed i fear i shall have but an indifferent opinion of presbyterian prayers in such cases as long as i live indeed in attacking strong towns i should have more dependence on works than on faith for like the kingdom of heaven they are     to be taken by force and violence and in a french garrison i suppose there are devils of that kind that they are not to be cast out by prayers and fasting unless it be by their own fasting for want of provisions i believe there is scripture in what i have wrote but i cannot adorn the margin with quotations having a bad memory and no concordance at hand besides no more time than to subscribe myself c b franklin benjamin franklin    august      james read xxxvii to james read saturday morning    august      dear jemmy i have been reading your letter over again and since you desire an answer i sit down to write you one yet as i write in the market it will i believe be but a short one though i may be long about it i approve of your method of writing ones mind when one is too warm to speak it with temper but being quite cool myself in this affair i might as well speak as write if i had an opportunity are you an attorney by profession and do you know no better how to choose a proper court in which to bring your action would you submit to the decision of a husband a cause between you and his wife dont you know that all wives are in the right it may be you dont for you are yet but a young husband but see on this head the learned coke that oracle of the law in his chapter de jur     marit angl i advise you not to bring it to trial for if you do you will certainly be cast frequent interruptions make it impossible for me to go through all your letter i have only time to remind you of the saying of that excellent old philosopher socrates that in differences among friends they that make the first concessions are the wisest and to hint to you that you are in danger of losing that honor in the present case if you are not very speedy in your acknowledgments which i persuade myself you will be when you consider the sex of your adversary your visits never had but one thing disagreeable in them—that is they were always too short i shall exceedingly regret the loss of them unless you continue as you have begun to make it up to me by long letters i am dear jemmy with sincere love to our dearest suky your very affectionate friend and cousin b franklin xxxviii the speech of polly baker  the speech of miss polly baker before a court of judicatory in new england where she was prosecuted   0 for a fifth time for having a bastard child which influenced the court to dispense with her punishment and which induced one of her judges to marry her the next day—by whom she had fifteen children may it please the honourable bench to indulge me in a few words i am a poor unhappy woman who have no money to fee lawyers to plead for me being hard put to it to get a living i shall not trouble your honours with long speeches for i have not the presumption to expect that you may by any means be prevailed on to deviate in your sentence from the law in my favour all i humbly hope is that your honours would charitably move the governors goodness on my behalf that my fine may be remitted this is the fifth time gentlemen that i have been dragged before your court on the same account twice i have paid heavy fines and twice i have been brought to public punishment for want of money to pay those fines this may have been agreeable to the laws and i dont dispute it but since the laws are sometimes unreasonable in themselves and therefore repealed and others bear too hard on the subject in particular instances and therefore there is left a power somewhere to dispense with the execution of them i take the liberty to say that i think this law by which i am punished both unreasonable in itself and particularly severe with regard to me who have always lived an inoffensive life in the neighbourhood where i was born and defy my enemies if i have any to say i have wronged any man woman or child abstracted from the     law i cannot conceive may it please your honours what the nature of my offence is i have brought five children into the world at the risque of my life i have maintained them well by my own industry without burthening the township and would have done it better if it had not been for the heavy charges and fines i have paid can it be a crime in the nature of things i mean to add to the kings subjects in a new country that really wants people i own it i should think it rather a praiseworthy than a punishable action i have debauched no other womans husband nor enticed any youth these things i never was charged with nor has any one the least cause of complaint against me unless perhaps the ministers of justice because i have had children without being married by which they have missed a wedding fee but can this be a fault of mine i appeal to your honours you are pleased to allow i dont want sense but i must be stupefied to the last degree not to prefer the honourable state of wedlock to the condition i have lived in i always was and still am willing to enter into it and doubt not my behaving well in it having all the industry frugality fertility and skill in economy appertaining to a good wifes character i defy any one to say i ever refused an offer of that sort on the contrary i readily consented to the only proposal of marriage that ever was made me which was when i was a virgin but too easily confiding in the persons sincerity that made it i unhappily lost my honour by trusting to his for he got me with child and then forsook me     that very person you all know he is now become a magistrate of this country and i had hopes he would have appeared this day on the bench and have endeavoured to moderate the court in my favour then i should have scorned to have mentioned it but i must now complain of it as unjust and unequal that my betrayer and undoer the first cause of all my faults and miscarriages if they must be deemed such should be advanced to honor and power in the government that punishes my misfortunes with stripes and infamy i should be told t is like that were there no act of assembly in the case the precepts of religion are violated by my transgressions if mine is a religious transgression leave it to religious punishment you have already excluded me from the comforts of your church communion is not that sufficient what need is there then of your additional fines and whipping you believe i have offended heaven and must suffer eternal fire will not that be sufficient i own i do not think as you do for if i thought what you call a sin was really such i could not presumptuously commit it but how can it be believed that heaven is angry at my having children when to the little done by me towards it god has been pleased to add his divine skill and admirable workmanship in the formation of their bodies and crowned the whole by furnishing them with rational and immortal souls forgive me gentlemen if i talk a little extravagantly on these matters i am no divine but if you gentlemen must be making laws do not turn natural and useful actions into crimes by your prohibitions but     take into your wise consideration the great and growing number of bachelors in the country many of whom from the mean fear of the expense of a family have never sincerely and honestly courted a woman in their lives and by their manner of living leave unproduced which is little better than murder hundreds of their posterity to the thousandth generation is not this a greater offence against the public good than mine compel them then by law either to marriage or to pay double the fine of fornication every year what must poor young women do whom customs and nature forbid to solicit the men and who cannot force themselves upon husbands when the laws take no care to provide them any and yet severely punish them if they do their duty without them the duty of the first and great command of nature and natures god increase and multiply a duty from the steady performance of which nothing has been able to deter me but for its sake i have hazarded the loss of the public esteem and have frequently endured public disgrace and punishment and therefore ought in my humble opinion instead of a whipping to have a statue erected to my

alice addertongue xl on scandal mr gazetteer i was highly pleased with your last weeks paper upon scandal as the uncommon doctrine therein preached is agreeable both to my principles and practice and as it was published very seasonably to reprove the impertinence of a writer in the foregoing thursdays mercury who at the conclusion of one of his silly paragraphs laments forsooth that the fair sex are so peculiarly guilty of this enormous crime every blockhead ancient and modern that could handle a pen has i think taken upon him to cant in the same senseless strain if to scandalize be really a crime what do these puppies mean they describe it they dress it up in the most odious frightful and detestable colors they represent it as the worst of crimes and then roundly and charitably charge the whole race of womankind with it are not they then guilty of what they condemn at the same time that they condemn it if they accuse us of any other crime they must necessarily scandalize while they do it but to scandalize us with being guilty of scandal is in itself an egregious absurdity and can proceed from nothing but the most consummate impudence in conjunction with the most profound stupidity   0 this supposing as they do that to scandalize is a crime you have convinced all reasonable people is an opinion absolutely erroneous let us leave then these select mockmoralists while i entertain you with some account of my life and manners i am a young girl of about thirtyfive and live at present with my mother i have no care upon my head of getting a living and therefore find it my duty as well as inclination to exercise my talent at censure for the good of my countryfolks there was i am told a certain generous emperor who if a day had passed over his head in which he had conferred no benefit on any man used to say to his friends in latin diem perdidi that is it seems i have lost a day i believe i should make use of the same expression if it were possible for a day to pass in which i had not or missed an opportunity to scandalize somebody but thanks be praised no such misfortune has befell me these dozen years yet whatever good i may do i cannot pretend that i at first entered into the practice of this virtue from a principle of public spirit for i remember that when a child i had a violent inclination to be ever talking in my own praise and being continually told that it was ill manners and once severely whipped for it the confined stream formed for itself a new channel and i began to speak for the future in the dispraise of others this i found more agreeable to company and almost as much so to myself for what great difference can there be between putting yourself up or putting your neighbour down scandal like other virtues is in part its own reward     as it gives us the satisfaction of making ourselves appear better than others or others no better than ourselves my mother good woman and i have heretofore differed upon this account she argued that scandal spoilt all good conversation and i insisted that without it there would be no such thing our disputes once rose so high that we parted teatables and i concluded to entertain my acquaintance in the kitchen the first day of this separation we both drank tea at the same time but she with her visitors in the parlour she would not hear of the least objection to any ones character but began a new sort of discourse in some such queer philosophical manner as this i am mightily pleased sometimes says she when i observe and consider that the world is not so bad as people out of humor imagine it to be there is something amiable some good quality or other in every body if we were only to speak of people that are least respected there is such a one is very dutiful to her father and methinks has a fine set of teeth such a one is very respectful to her husband such a one is very kind to her poor neighbours and besides has a very handsome shape such a one is always ready to serve a friend and in my opinion there is not a woman in town that has a more agreeable air or gait this fine kind of talk which lasted near half an hour she concluded by saying i do not doubt but every one of you has made the like observations and i should be glad to have the conversation continued upon this subject just at this juncture i     peeped in at the door and never in my life before saw such a set of simple vacant countenances they looked somehow neither glad nor sorry nor angry nor pleased nor indifferent nor attentive but excuse the simile like so many images of ryedough i in the kitchen had already begun a ridiculous story of mr ——s intrigue with his maid and his wifes behaviour on the discovery at some of the passages we laughed heartily and one of the gravest of mammas company without making any answer to her discourse got up to go and see what the girls were so merry about she was followed by a second and shortly by a third till at last the old gentlewoman found herself quite alone and being convinced that her project was impracticable came herself and finished her tea with us ever since which saul also has been among the prophets and our disputes lie dormant by industry and application i have made myself the centre of all the scandal in the province there is little stirring but i hear of it i began the world with this maxim that no trade can subsist without returns and accordingly whenever i received a good story i endeavoured to give two or a better in the room of it my punctuality in this way of dealing gave such encouragement that it has procured me an incredible deal of business which without diligence and good method it would be impossible for me to go through for besides the stock of defamation thus naturally flowing in upon me i practise an art by which i can pump scandal out of people that are the least inclined that way shall i     discover my secret yes to let it die with me would be inhuman if i have never heard ill of some person i always impute it to defective intelligence for there are none without their faults no not one if she be a woman i take the first opportunity to let all her acquaintance know i have heard that one of the handsomest or best men in town has said something in praise either of her beauty her wit her virtue or her good management if you know any thing of human nature you perceive that this naturally introduces a conversation turning upon all her failings past present and to come to the same purpose and with the same success i cause every man of reputation to be praised before his competitors in love business or esteem on account of any particular qualification near the times of election if i find it necessary i commend every candidate before some of the opposite party listening attentively to what is said of him in answer but commendations in this latter case are not always necessary and should be used judiciously of late years i needed only observe what they said of one another freely and having for the help of memory taken account of all informations and accusations received whoever peruses my writings after my death may happen to think that during a certain time the people of pennsylvania chose into all their offices of honor and trust the veriest knaves fools and rascals in the whole province the time of election used to be a busy time with me but this year with concern i speak it people are grown so goodnatured so intent upon mutual feasting and friendly     entertainment that i see no prospect of much employment from that quarter i mentioned above that without good method i could not go through my business in my fathers lifetime i had some instruction in accounts which i now apply with advantage to my own affairs i keep a regular set of books and can tell at an hours warning how it stands between me and the world in my daybook i enter every article of defamation as it is transacted for scandals received in i give credit and when i pay them out again i make the persons to whom they respectively relate debtor in my journal i add to each story by way of improvement such probable circumstances as i think it will bear and in my ledger the whole is regularly posted i suppose the reader already condemns me in his heart for this particular of adding circumstances but i justify this part of my practice thus it is a principle with me that none ought to have a greater share of reputation than they really deserve if they have it is an imposition upon the public i know it is every ones interest and therefore believe they endeavour to conceal all their vices and follies and i hold that those people are extraordinary foolish or careless who suffer one fourth of their failings to come to public knowledge taking then the common prudence and imprudence of mankind in a lump i suppose none suffer above one fifth to be discovered therefore when i hear of any persons misdoing i think i keep within bounds if in relating it i only make it three times worse than it is and i reserve to myself the privilege of charging them with     one fault in four which for aught i know they may be entirely innocent of you see there are but few so careful of doing justice as myself what reason then have mankind to complain of scandal in a general way the worst that is said of us is only half what might be said if all our faults were seen but alas two great evils have lately befallen me at the same time an extreme cold that i can scarce speak and a most terrible toothache that i dare hardly open my mouth for some days past i have received ten stories for one i have paid and i am not able to balance my accounts without your assistance i have long thought that if you would make your paper a vehicle of scandal you would double the number of your subscribers i send you herewith accounts of four knavish tricks two    five      three drubbed wives and four henpecked husbands all within this fortnight which you may as articles of news deliver to the public and if my toothache continues i shall send you more being in the mean time your constant reader alice addertongue i thank my correspondent mrs addertongue for her good will but desire to be excused inserting the articles of news she has sent me such things being in reality no news at all     xli a case of casuistry to the printer of the gazette according to the request of your correspondent t p i send you my thoughts on the following case by him proposed viz a man bargains for the keeping of his horse six months whilst he is making a voyage to barbadoes the horse strays or is stolen soon after the keeper has him in possession when the owner demands the value of his horse in money may not the other as justly demand so much deducted as the keeping of the horse six months amounts to it does not appear that they had any dispute about the value of the horse whence we may conclude there was no reason for such dispute but it was well known how much he cost and that he could not honestly have been sold again for more but the value of the horse is not expressed in the case nor the sum agreed for keeping him six months wherefore in order to our more clear apprehension of the thing let ten pounds represent the horses value and three pounds the sum agreed upon for his keeping now the sole foundation on which the keeper can found his demand of a deduction for keeping a horse he did not keep is this your horse he may say which i was to restore to you at the end of six months was worth ten pounds if i now give you     ten pounds it is an equivalent for your horse and equal to returning the horse itself had i returned your horse value ten pounds you would have paid me three pounds for his keeping and therefore would have received in fact but seven pounds clear you then suffer no injury if i now pay you seven pounds and consequently you ought in reason to allow me the remaining three pounds according to our agreement but the owner of the horse may possibly insist upon being paid the whole sum of ten pounds without allowing any deduction for his keeping after he was lost and that for these reasons   it is always supposed unless an express agreement be made to the contrary when horses are put out to keep that the keeper is at the risk of them unavoidable accidents only excepted wherein no care of the keeper can be supposed sufficient to preserve them such as their being slain by lightning or the like this you yourself tacitly allow when you offer to restore me the value of my horse were it otherwise people having no security against a keepers neglect or mismanagement would never put horses out to keep   keepers considering the risk they run always demand such a price for keeping horses that if they were to follow the business twenty years they may have a living profit though they now and then pay for a horse they have lost and if they were to be at no risk they might afford to keep horses for less than they usually have so that what a man pays for his horses keeping more than the keeper could     afford to take if he ran no risk is in the nature of a premium for the insurance of his horse if i then pay you for the few days you kept my horse you should restore me his full value   you acknowledge that my horse eat of your hay and oats but a few days it is unjust then to charge me for all the hay and oats that he only might have eat in the remainder of the six months and which you have now still good in your stable if as the proverb says it is unreasonable to expect a horse should void oats which never eat any it is certainly as unreasonable to expect payment for those oats   if men in such cases as this are to be paid for keeping horses when they were not kept then they have a great opportunity of wronging the owners of horses for by privately selling my horse for his value ten pounds soon after you had him in possession and returning me at the expiration of the time only seven pounds demanding three pounds as a deduction agreed for his keeping you get that three pounds clear into your pocket besides the use of my money six months for nothing   but you say the value of my horse being ten pounds if you deduct three for his keeping and return me seven it is all i would in fact have received had you returned my horse therefore as i am no loser i ought to be satisfied this argument were there any weight in it might serve to justify a man in selling as above as many of the horses he takes to keep as he conveniently can putting clear into his own pocket that charge their owners must have been     at for their keeping for this being no loss to the owners he may say where no man is a loser why should not i be a gainer i need only answer to this that i allow the horse cost me but ten pounds nor could i have sold him for more had i been disposed to part with him but this can be no reason why you should buy him of me at that price whether i will sell him or not for it is plain i valued him at thirteen pounds otherwise i should not have paid ten pounds for him and agreed to give you three pounds more for his keeping till i had occasion to use him thus though you pay me the whole ten pounds which he cost me deducting only for his keeping those few days i am still a loser i lose the charge of those days keeping i lose the three pounds at which i valued him above what he cost me and i lose the advantage i might have made of my money in six months either by the interest or by joining it to my stock in trade in my voyage to barbadoes   lastly whenever a horse is put to keep the agreement naturally runs thus the keeper says i will feed your horse six months on good hay and oats if at the end of that time you pay me three pounds the owner says if you will feed my horse six months on good hay and oats i will pay you three pounds at the end of that time now we may plainly see the keepers performance of his part of the agreement must be antecedent to that of the owner and the agreement being wholly conditional the owners part is not in force till the keeper has performed his you then not having fed my   0 horse six months as you agreed to do there lies no obligation on me to pay for so much feeding thus we have heard what can be said on both sides upon the whole i am of opinion that no deduction should be allowed for the keeping of the horse after the time of his straying i am yours c the casuist xlii plain truth or serious considerations on the present state of the city of philadelphia and province of pennsylvania by a tradesman of philadelphia captâ urbe nihil fit reliqui victis sed per deos immortales vos ego appello qui semper domos villas signa tabulas vestras tantæ æstimationis fecistis si ista cujuscumque modi sint quæ amplexamini retinere si voluptatibus vestris otium præbere vultis expergiscimini aliquando et capessite rempublicam non agitur nunc     de sociorum injuriis libertas et anima nostra in dubio est      duc hostium cum exercitu

bene consulendo prospere omnia cedunt ubi socordiæ te atque ignaviæ tradideris nequicquam deos implores irati infestique sunt—m por cato in sallust translation should the city be taken all will be lost to the conquered therefore if you desire to preserve your buildings houses and countryseats your statues paintings and all your other possessions which you so highly esteem if you wish to continue in the enjoyment of them or to have leisure for any future pleasures i beseech you by the immortal gods rouse at last awake from your lethargy and save the commonwealth it is not the trifling concern of injuries from your allies that demands your attention your liberties lives and fortunes with every thing that is interesting and dear to you are in the most imminent danger can you doubt of or delay what you ought to do now when the enemys swords are unsheathed and descending on your heads the affair is shocking and horrid yet perhaps you are not afraid yes you are terrified to the highest degree but through indolence and supineness of soul gazing at each other to see who shall first rise to your succor and a presumptuous dependence on the immortal gods who indeed have preserved this republic in many dangerous seasons you delay and neglect every thing necessary for your preservation be not deceived divine assistance and protection are not to be obtained by timorous prayers and womanish supplications to succeed you must join salutary counsels vigilance and courageous actions if     you sink into effeminacy and cowardice if you desert the tender and helpless by providence committed to your charge never presume to implore the gods it will provoke them and raise their indignation against you  it is said the wise italians make this proverbial remark on our nation viz the english feel but they do not see that is they are sensible of inconveniences when they are present but do not take sufficient care to prevent them their natural courage makes them too little apprehensive of danger so that they are often surprised by it unprovided of the proper means of security when it is too late they are sensible of their imprudence after great fires they provide buckets and engines after a pestilence they think of keeping clean their streets and     common sewers and when a town has been sacked by their enemies they provide for its defence c this kind of afterwisdom is indeed so common with us as to occasion the vulgar though very significant saying when the steed is stolen you shut the stable door but the more insensible we generally are of public danger and indifferent when warned of it so much the more freely openly and earnestly ought such as apprehend it to speak their sentiments that if possible those who seem to sleep may be awakened to think of some means of avoiding or preventing the mischief before it be too late believing therefore that it is my duty i shall honestly speak my mind in the following paper war at this time rages over a great part of the known world our newspapers are weekly filled with fresh accounts of the destruction it everywhere occasions pennsylvania indeed situate in the centre of the colonies has hitherto enjoyed profound repose and though our nation is engaged in a bloody war with two great and powerful kingdoms yet defended in a great degree from the french on the one hand by the northern provinces and from the spaniards on the other by the southern at no small expense to each our people have till lately slept securely in their habitations there is no british colony excepting this but has made some kind of provision for its defence many of them have therefore never been attempted by an enemy and others that were attacked have generally defended themselves with success the length and difficulty of our bay and river have been thought     so effectual a security to us that hitherto no means have been entered into that might discourage an attempt upon us or prevent its succeeding but whatever security this might have been while both country and city were poor and the advantage to be expected scarce worth the hazard of an attempt it is now doubted whether we can any longer safely depend upon it our wealth of late years much increased is one strong temptation our defenceless state another to induce an enemy to attack us while the acquaintance they have lately gained with our bay and river by means of the prisoners and flags of truce they have had among us by spies which they almost everywhere maintain and perhaps from traitors among ourselves with the facility of getting pilots to conduct them and the known absence of ships of war during the greatest part of the year from both virginia and new york ever since the war began render the appearance of success to the enemy far more promising and therefore highly increase our danger that our enemies may have spies abroad and some even in these colonies will not be made much doubt of when it is considered that such has been the practice of all nations in all ages whenever they were engaged or intended to engage in war of this we have an early example in the book of judges too pertinent to our case and therefore i must beg leave a little to enlarge upon it where we are told chap xviii v   that the children of dan sent of their family five men from their coasts to spy out the land and search it saying go search the land these     danites it seems were at this time not very orthodox in their religion and their spies met with a certain idolatrous priest of their own persuasion v   and they said to him who brought thee hither what makest thou in this place and what hast thou here would to god no such priests were to be found among us and they said unto him v   ask counsel of god that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous and the priest said unto them go in peace before the lord is your way wherein you go are there no priests among us think you that might in the like case give an enemy as good encouragement it is well known that we have numbers of the same religion with those who of late encouraged the french to invade our mother country and they came v   to laish and saw the people that were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of the zidonians quiet and secure they thought themselves secure no doubt and as they never had been disturbed vainly imagined they never should be it is not unlikely that some might see the danger they were exposed to by living in that careless manner but that if these publicly expressed their apprehensions the rest reproached them as timorous persons wanting courage or confidence in their gods who they might say had hitherto protected them but the spies v   returned and said to their countrymen v   arise that we may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it is very good and are ye still be not slothful to go verse  0 when ye go ye shall come to a people secure that is a people that apprehend no     danger and therefore have made no provision against it great encouragement this and to a large land and a place where there is no want of any thing what could they desire more accordingly we find in the following verses that six hundred men only appointed with weapons of war undertook the conquest of this large land knowing that six hundred men armed and disciplined would be an overmatch perhaps for sixty thousand unarmed undisciplined and off their guard and when they went against it the idolatrous priest v    with his graven image and his ephod and his teraphim and his molten image plenty of superstitious trinkets joined with them and no doubt gave them all the intelligence and assistance in his power his heart as the text assures us being glad perhaps for reasons more than one and now what was the fate of poor laish the six hundred men being arrived found as the spies had reported a people quiet and secure vv       and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burnt the city with fire and there was no deliverer because it was far from zidon—not so far from zidon however as pennsylvania is from britain and yet we are if possible more careless than the people of laish as the scriptures are given for our reproof instruction and warning may we make a due use of this example before it be too late and is our country any more than our city altogether free from danger perhaps not we have it is true had a long peace with the indians but it is a long peace indeed as well as a long lane that has no ending the french know the power and importance     of the six nations and spare no artifice pains or expense to gain them to their interest by their priests they have converted many to their religion and these  have openly espoused their cause the rest appear irresolute what part to take no persuasions though enforced with costly presents having yet been able to engage them generally on our side though we had numerous forces on their borders ready to second and support them what then may be expected now those forces are by orders from the crown to be disbanded when our boasted expedition is laid aside through want as it may appear to them either of strength or courage when they see that the french and their indians boldly and with impunity ravage the frontiers of new york and scalp the inhabitants when those few indians that engaged with us against the french are left exposed to their resentment when they consider these things is there no danger through disgust at our usage joined with fear of the french power and greater confidence in their promises and protection than in ours they may be wholly gained over by our enemies and join in the war against us if such should be the case which god forbid how soon may the mischief spread to our frontier counties and what may we expect to be the consequence but desertion of plantations ruin bloodshed and confusion perhaps some in the city towns and plantations near the river may say to themselves an indian war on the frontiers will not affect us the enemy     will never come near our habitations let those concerned take care of themselves and others who live in the country when they are told of the danger the city is in from attempts by sea may say what is that to us the enemy will be satisfied with the plunder of the town and never think it worth his while to visit our plantations let the town take care of itself these are not mere suppositions for i have heard some talk in this strange manner but are these the sentiments of true pennsylvanians of fellowcountrymen or even of men that have commonsense or goodness is not the whole province one body united by living under the same laws and enjoying the same privileges are not the people of city and country connected as relations both by blood and marriage and in friendships equally dear are they not likewise united in interest and mutually useful and necessary to each other when the feet are wounded shall the head say it is not i i will not trouble myself to contrive relief or if the head is in danger shall the hands say we are not affected and therefore will lend no assistance no for so would the body be easily destroyed but when all parts join their endeavours for its security it is often preserved and such should be the union between the country and the town and such their mutual endeavours for the safety of the whole when new england a distant colony involved itself in a grievous debt to reduce cape breton we freely gave four thousand pounds for her relief and at another time remembering that great britain still more distant groaned under heavy taxes in supporting     the war we threw in our mite to her assistance by a free gift of three thousand pounds and shall country and town join in helping strangers as those comparatively are and yet refuse to assist each other but whatever different opinions we have of our security in other respects our trade all seem to agree is in danger of being ruined in another year the great success of our enemies in two different cruises this last summer in our bay must give them the greatest encouragement to repeat more frequently their visits the profit being almost certain and the risk next to nothing will not the first effect of this be an enhancing of the price of all foreign goods to the tradesman and farmer who use or consume them for the rate of insurance will increase in proportion to the hazard of importing them and in the same proportion will the price of those goods increase if the price of the tradesmans work and the farmers produce would increase equally with the price of foreign commodities the damage would not be so great but the direct contrary must happen for the same hazard or rate of insurance that raises the price of what is imported must be deducted out of and lower the price of what is exported without this addition and deduction as long as the enemy cruise at our capes and take those vessels that attempt to go out as well as those that endeavour to come in none can afford to trade and business must be soon at a stand and will not the consequences be a discouragement of many of the vessels that used to come from other places to   0 purchase our produce and thereby a turning of the trade to ports that can be entered with less danger and capable of furnishing them with the same commodities as new york c a lessening of business to every shopkeeper together with multitudes of bad debts the high rate of goods discouraging the buyers and the low rates of their labor and produce rendering them unable to pay for what they had bought loss of employment to the tradesman and bad pay for what little he does and lastly loss of many inhabitants who will retire to other provinces not subject to the like inconveniences whence a lowering of the value of lands lots and houses the enemy no doubt have been told that the people of pennsylvania are quakers and against all defence from a principle of conscience this though true of a part and that a small part only of the inhabitants is commonly said of the whole and what may make it look probable to strangers is that in fact nothing is done by any part of the people towards their defence but to refuse defending ones self or ones country is so unusual a thing among mankind that possibly they may not believe it till by experience they find they can come higher and higher up our river seize our vessels land and plunder our plantations and villages and retire with their booty unmolested will not this confirm the report and give them the greatest encouragement to strike one bold stroke for the city and for the whole plunder of the river it is said by some that the expense of a vessel to guard our trade would be very heavy greater than     perhaps all the enemy can be supposed to take from us at sea would amount to and that it would be cheaper for the government to open an insurance office and pay all losses but is this right reasoning i think not for what the enemy takes is clear loss to us and gain to him increasing his riches and strength as much as it diminishes ours so making the difference double whereas the money paid our own tradesmen for building and fitting out a vessel of defence remains in the country and circulates among us what is paid to the officers and seamen that navigate her is also spent ashore and soon gets into other hands the farmer receives the money for her provisions and on the whole nothing is clearly lost to the country but her wear and tear or so much as she sells for at the end of the war less than her first cost this loss and a trifling one it is is all the inconvenience but how many and how great are the conveniences and advantages and should the enemy through our supineness and neglect to provide for the defence both of our trade and country be encouraged to attempt this city and after plundering us of our goods either burn it or put it to ransom how great would that loss be besides the confusion terror and distress so many hundreds of families would be involved in the thought of this latter circumstance so much affects me that i cannot forbear expatiating somewhat more upon it you have my dear countrymen and fellowcitizens riches to tempt a considerable force to unite and attack you but are under no ties or engagements to unite for your defence     hence on the first alarm terror will spread over all and as no man can with certainty depend that another will stand by him beyond doubt very many will seek safety by a speedy flight those that are reputed rich will flee through fear of torture to make them produce more than they are able the man that has a wife and children will find them hanging on his neck beseeching him with tears to quit the city and save his life to guide and protect them in that time of general desolation and ruin all will run into confusion amidst cries and lamentations and the hurry and disorder of departers carrying away their effects the few that remain will be unable to resist sacking the city will be the first and burning it in all probability the last act of the enemy this i believe will be the case if you have timely notice but what must be your condition if suddenly surprised without previous alarm perhaps in the night confined to your houses you will have nothing to trust to but the enemys mercy your best fortune will be to fall under the power of commanders of kings ships able to control the mariners and not into the hands of licentious privateers who can without the utmost horror conceive the miseries from the latter when your persons fortunes wives and daughters shall be subject to the wanton and unbridled rage rapine and lust of negroes mulattoes and others the vilest and most abandoned of mankind  a dreadful scene which     some may represent as exaggerated i think it my duty to warn you judge for yourselves it is true with very little notice the rich may shift for themselves the means of speedy flight are ready in their hands and with some previous care to lodge money and effects in distant and secure places though they should lose much yet enough may be left them and to spare but most unhappily circumstanced indeed are we the middling people the tradesmen shopkeepers and farmers of the province and city we cannot all fly with our families and if we could how shall we subsist no we and they and what little we have gained by hard labor and industry must bear the brunt the weight of contributions extorted by the enemy as it is of taxes among ourselves must be surely borne by us nor can it be avoided as we stand at present for though we are numerous we are quite defenceless having neither forts arms union nor discipline and though it were true that our trade might be protected at no great expense and our country and our city easily defended if proper measures were but taken yet who shall take these measures who shall pay that expense on whom may we fix our eyes with the least expectation that they will do any thing for our security should we address that wealthy and powerful body of people who have ever     since the war governed our elections and filled almost every seat in our assembly—should we entreat them to consider if not as friends at least as legislators that protection is as truly due from the government to the people as obedience from the people to the government and that if on account of their religious scruples they themselves could do no act for our defence yet they might retire relinquish their power for a season quit the helm to freer hands during the present tempest—to hands chosen by their own interest too whose prudence and moderation with regard to them they might safely confide in secure from their own native strength of resuming again their present station whenever it shall please them—should we remind them that the public money raised from all belongs to all that since they have for their own ease and to secure themselves in the quiet enjoyment of their religious principles and may they long enjoy them expended such large sums to oppose petitions and engage favorable representations of their conduct if they themselves could by no means be free to appropriate any part of the public money for our defence yet it would be no more than justice to spare us a reasonable sum for that purpose which they might easily give to the kings use as heretofore leaving all the appropriation to others who would faithfully apply it as we desired—should we tell them that though the treasury be at present empty it may soon be filled by the outstanding public debts collected or at least credit might be had for such a sum on a single vote of the assembly that though they themselves     may be resigned and easy under this naked defenceless state of the country it is far otherwise with a very great part of the people—with us who can have no confidence that god will protect those that neglect the use of rational means for their security nor have any reason to hope that our losses if we should suffer any may be made up by collections in our favor at home—should we conjure them by all the ties of neighbourhood friendship justice and humanity to consider these things and what distraction misery and confusion what desolation and distress may possibly be the effect of their unseasonable predominancy and perseverance—yet all would be in vain for they have already been by great numbers of the people petitioned in vain our late governor did for years solicit request and even threaten them in vain the council have since twice remonstrated to them in vain their religious prepossessions are unchangeable their obstinacy invincible is there then the least hope remaining that from that quarter any thing should arise for our security and is our prospect better if we turn our eyes to the strength of the opposite party those great and rich men merchants and others who are ever railing at quakers for doing what their principles seem to require and what in charity we ought to believe they think their duty but take no one step themselves for the public safety they have so much wealth and influence if they would use it that they might easily by their endeavours and example raise a military spirit among us make us fond studious of     and expert in martial discipline and effect every thing that is necessary under god for our protection but envy seems to have taken possession of their hearts and to have eaten out and destroyed every generous noble publicspirited sentiment rage at the disappointment of their little schemes for power gnaws their souls and fills them with such cordial hatred to their opponents that every proposal by the execution of which those may receive benefit as well as themselves is rejected with indignation what they say shall we lay out our money to protect the trade of quakers shall we fight to defend quakers no let the trade perish and the city burn let what will happen we shall never lift a finger to prevent it yet the quakers have conscience to plead for their resolution not to fight which these gentlemen have not conscience with you gentlemen is on the other side of the question conscience enjoins it as a duty on you and indeed i think it such on every man to defend your country your friends your aged parents your wives and helpless children and yet you resolve not to perform this duty but act contrary to your own consciences because the quakers act according to theirs till of late i could scarce believe the story of him who refused to pump in a sinking ship because one on board whom he hated would be saved by it as well as himself but such it seems is the unhappiness of human nature that our passions when violent often are too hard for the united force of reason duty and religion thus unfortunately are we circumstanced at this     time my dear countrymen and fellowcitizens we i mean the middling people the farmers shopkeepers and tradesmen of this city and country through the dissensions of our leaders through mistaken principles of religion joined with a love of worldly power on the one hand through pride envy and implacable resentment on the other our lives our families and little fortunes dear to us as any great mans can be to him are to remain continually exposed to destruction from an enterprising cruel now wellinformed and by success encouraged enemy it seems as if heaven justly displeased at our growing wickedness and determined to punish  this oncefavored land had suffered our chiefs to engage in these foolish and mischievous contentions for little posts and paltry distinctions that our hands might be bound up our understandings darkened and misled and every means of our security neglected it seems as if our greatest men our cives nobilissimi  of both parties had sworn the ruin of the country and invited the french our most inveterate enemy to destroy it where then shall we seek for succour and protection the government we are immediately under denies it to us and if the enemy     comes we are far from zidon and there is no deliverer near our case is dangerously bad but perhaps there is yet a remedy if we have but the prudence and the spirit to apply it if this new flourishing city and greatly improving colony is destroyed and ruined it will not be for want of numbers of inhabitants able to bear arms in its defence it is computed that we have at least exclusive of the quakers sixty thousand fighting men acquainted with firearms many of them hunters and marksmen hardy and bold all we want is order discipline and a few cannon at present we are like the separate filaments of flax before the thread is formed without strength because without connexion but union would make us strong and even formidable though the great should neither help nor join us though they should even oppose our uniting from some mean views of their own yet if we resolve upon it and it pleases god to inspire us with the necessary prudence and vigor it may be effected great numbers of our people are of british race and though the fierce fighting animals of those happy islands are said to abate their native fire and intrepidity when removed to a foreign clime yet with the people it is not so our neighbours of new england afford the world a convincing proof that britons though a hundred years transplanted and to the remotest part of the earth may yet retain even to the third and fourth descent that zeal for the public good that military prowess and that undaunted spirit which has in every age distinguished their nation what numbers have we likewise of those     brave people whose fathers in the last age made so glorious a stand for our religion and liberties when invaded by a powerful french army joined by irish catholics under a bigoted popish king let the memorable siege of londonderry and the signal actions of the iniskillingers by which the heart of that princes schemes were broken be perpetual testimonies of the courage and conduct of those noble warriors nor are there wanting amongst us thousands of that warlike nation whose sons have ever since the time of cæsar maintained the character he gave their fathers of joining the most obstinate courage to all the other military virtues—i mean the brave and steady germans numbers of whom have actually borne arms in the service of their respective princes and if they fought well for their tyrants and oppressors would they refuse to unite with us in defence of their newly acquired and most precious liberty and property were this union formed were we once united thoroughly armed and disciplined was every thing in our power done for our security as far as human means and foresight could provide we might then with more propriety humbly ask the assistance of heaven and a blessing on our lawful endeavours the very fame of our strength and readiness would be a means of discouraging our enemies for it is a wise and true saying that one sword often keeps another in the scabbard the way to secure peace is to be prepared for war they that are on their guard and appear ready to receive their adversaries are in much less danger of being attacked than the supine secure and   0 negligent we have yet a winter before us which may afford a good and almost sufficient opportunity for this if we seize and improve it with a becoming vigor and if the hints contained in this paper are so happy as to meet with a suitable disposition of mind in his countrymen and fellowcitizens the writer of it will in a few days lay before them a form of association for the purposes herein mentioned together with a practicable scheme for raising the money necessary for the defence of our trade city and country without laying a burthen on any man may the god of wisdom strength and power the lord of the armies of israel inspire us with prudence in this time of danger take away from us all the seeds of contention and division and unite the hearts and counsels of all of us of whatever sect or nation in one bond of peace brotherly love and generous public spirit may he give us strength and resolution to amend our lives and remove from among us every thing that is displeasing to him afford us his most gracious protection confound the designs of our enemies and give peace in all our borders is the sincere prayer of a tradesman of philadelphia benjamin franklin    march      philadelphia peter collinson xliii to peter collinson philadelphia    march      sir— your kind present of an electric tube with directions for using it has put several of us on making     electrical experiments in which we have observed some particular phenomena that we look upon to be new i shall therefore communicate them to you in my next though possibly they may not be new to you as among the numbers daily employed in those experiments on your side of the water it is probable some one or other has hit upon the same observations for my own part i never was before engaged in any study that so totally engrossed my attention and my time as this has lately done for what with making experiments when i can be alone and repeating them to my friends and acquaintance who from the novelty of the thing come continually in crowds to see them i have during some months past had little leisure for any thing else i am c b franklin while on a visit to boston in      franklin witnessed some electrical experiments performed by a mr spence recently arrived from scotland shortly after his return to philadelphia the library company received from mr collinson of london and a member of the royal society a glass tube with instructions for making experiments with it with this tube franklin began a course of experiments which resulted in discoveries which humanly speaking seem to be exerting a larger material influence upon the industries of the world than any other discovery of the human intellect dr stuber then a resident of philadelphia and author of the first continuation of franklins life who seems to have enjoyed peculiar opportunities of obtaining full and authentic information upon the subject gives us the following account of the     observations which this letter brought for the first time to the notice of the world through mr collinson his observations says dr stuber he communicated in a series of letters to his friend collinson the first of which is dated march   th      in these he shows the power of points in drawing and throwing off the electrical matter which had hitherto escaped the notice of electricians he also made the grand discovery of a plus and minus or of a positive and negative state of electricity we give him the honor of this without hesitation although the english have claimed it for their countryman dr watson watsons paper is dated january   st      franklins july   th      several months prior shortly after franklin from his principles of the plus and minus state explained in a satisfactory manner the phenomena of the leyden phial first observed by mr cuneus or by professor muschenbroeck of leyden which had much perplexed philosophers he showed clearly that when charged the bottle contained no more electricity than before but that as much was taken from one side as was thrown on the other and that to discharge it nothing was necessary but to produce a communication between the two sides by which the equilibrium might be restored and that then no signs of electricity would remain he afterwards demonstrated by experiments that the electricity did not reside in the coating as had been supposed but in the pores of the glass itself after a phial was charged he removed the coating and found that upon applying a new coating the shock might still be received in the year      he first suggested his idea of explaining the phenomena of thundergusts and of the aurora borealis upon electrical principles he points out many particulars in which lightning and electricity agree and he adduces many     facts and reasonings from facts in support of his positions in the same year he conceived the astonishingly bold and grand idea of ascertaining the truth of his doctrine by actually drawing down the lightning by means of sharppointed iron rods raised into the region of the clouds even in this uncertain state his passion to be useful to mankind displayed itself in a powerful manner admitting the identity of electricity and lightning and knowing the power of points in repelling bodies charged with electricity and in conducting their fires silently and imperceptibly he suggested the idea of securing houses ships etc from being damaged by lightning by erecting pointed rods that should rise some feet above the most elevated part and descend some feet into the ground or the water the effect of these he concluded would be either to prevent a stroke by repelling the cloud beyond the striking distance or by drawing off the electrical fire which it contained or if they could not effect this they would at least conduct the electric matter to the earth without any injury to the building it was not until the summer of      that he was enabled to complete his grand and unparalleled discovery by experiment the plan which he had originally proposed was to erect on some high tower or other elevated place a sentrybox from which should rise a pointed iron rod insulated by being fixed in a cake of resin electrified clouds passing over this would he conceived impart to it a portion of their electricity which would be rendered evident to the senses by sparks being emitted when a key the knuckle or other conductor was presented to it philadelphia at this time afforded no opportunity of trying an experiment of this kind while franklin was waiting for the erection of a spire it occurred to him that     he might have more ready access to the region of clouds by means of a common kite he prepared one by fastening two cross sticks to a silk handkerchief which would not suffer so much from the rain as paper to the upright stick was affixed an iron point the string was as usual of hemp except the lower end which was silk where the hempen string terminated a key was fastened with this apparatus on the appearance of a thundergust approaching he went out into the commons accompanied by his son to whom alone he communicated his intentions well knowing the ridicule which too generally for the interest of science awaits unsuccessful experiments in philosophy he placed himself under a shed to avoid the rain his kite was raised a thundercloud passed over it no sign of electricity appeared he almost despaired of success when suddenly he observed the loose fibres of his string to move towards an erect position he now presented his knuckle to the key and received a strong spark how exquisite must his sensations have been at this moment on this experiment depended the fate of his theory if he succeeded his name would rank high among those who had improved science if he failed he must inevitably be subjected to the derision of mankind or what is worse their pity as a wellmeaning man but a weak silly projector the anxiety with which he looked for the result of his experiment may be easily conceived doubts and despair had begun to prevail when the fact was ascertained in so clear a manner that even the most incredulous could no longer withhold their assent repeated sparks were drawn from the key a phial was charged a shock given and all the experiments made which are usually performed with electricity about a month before this period some ingenious frenchman had completed the discovery in the manner     originally proposed by dr franklin the letters which he sent to mr collinson it is said were refused a place in the transactions of the royal society of london however this may be collinson published them in a separate volume under the title of new experiments and observations on electricity made at philadelphia in america they were read with avidity and soon translated into different languages a very incorrect french translation fell into the hands of the celebrated buffon who notwithstanding the disadvantages under which the work labored was much pleased with it and repeated the experiments with success he prevailed on his friend m dalibard to give his countrymen a more correct translation of the works of the american electrician this contributed much towards spreading a knowledge of franklins principles in france the king louis the fifteenth hearing of these experiments expressed a wish to be a spectator of them a course of experiments was given at the seat of the duc dayen at st germain by m de lor the applauses which the king bestowed upon franklin excited in buffon dalibard and de lor an earnest desire of ascertaining the truth of his theory of thundergusts buffon erected his apparatus on the tower of montbar m dalibard at marlylaville and de lor at his house in the estrapade at paris some of the highest ground in that capital dalibards machine first showed signs of electricity on the  0th of may      a thundercloud passed over it in the absence of m dalibard and a number of sparks were drawn from it by coiffier joiner with whom dalibard had left directions how to proceed and by m raulet the prior of marlylaville an account of this experiment was given to the royal academy of sciences by m dalibard in a memoir dated     may   th      on the   th of may m de lor proved equally successful with the apparatus erected at his own house these philosophers soon excited those of other parts of europe to repeat the experiment amongst whom none signalized themselves more than father beccaria of turin to whose observations science is much indebted even the cold regions of russia were penetrated by the ardor for discovery professor richmann bade fair to add much to the stock of knowledge on this subject when an unfortunate flash from his conductor put a period to his existence by these experiments franklins theory was established in the most convincing manner besides these great principles franklins letters on electricity contain a number of facts and hints which have contributed greatly towards reducing this branch of knowledge to a science his friend mr kinnersley communicated to him a discovery of the different kinds of electricity excited by rubbing glass and sulphur this we have said was first observed by m du faye but it was for many years neglected the philosophers were disposed to account for the phenomena rather from a difference in the quantity of electricity collected and even du faye himself seems at last to have adopted this doctrine franklin at first entertained the same idea but upon repeating the experiments he perceived that mr kinnersley was right and that the vitreous and resinous electricity of du faye were nothing more than the positive and negative states which he had before observed and that the glass globe charged positively or increased the quantity of electricity on the prime conductor while the globe of sulphur diminished its natural quantity or charged negatively these experiments and observations opened a new field for investigation upon which electricians     entered with avidity and their labors have added much to the stock of our knowledge franklins letters have been translated into most of the european languages and into latin in proportion as they have become known his principles have been adopted in speaking of the first publication of his papers on electricity franklin himself says obliged as we were to mr collinson for the present of the tube c i thought it right he should be informed of our success in using it and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments he got them read in the royal society where they were not at first thought worth so much notice as to be printed in their transactions one paper which i wrote to mr kinnersley on the sameness of lightning with electricity i sent to mr mitchel an acquaintance of mine and one of the members also of that society who wrote me word that it had been read but was laughed at by the connoisseurs the papers however being shown to dr fothergill he thought them of too much value to be stifled and advised the printing of them mr collinson then gave them to cave for publication in his gentlemans magazine but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet and dr fothergill wrote the preface cave it seems judged rightly for his profession for by the additions that arrived afterwards they swelled to a quarto volume which has had five editions and cost him nothing for copymoney the following is an extract from the preface to the first edition of the pamphlet published by cave as above mentioned it may be necessary to acquaint the reader that the following observations and experiments were not drawn up with a view to their being made public but were     communicated at different times and most of them in letters written on various topics as matter only of private amusement but some persons to whom they were read and who had themselves been conversant in electrical disquisitions were of opinion they contained so many curious and interesting particulars relative to this affair that it would be doing a kind of injustice to the public to confine them solely to the limits of a private acquaintance the editor was therefore prevailed upon to commit such extracts of letters and other detached pieces as were in his hands to the press without waiting for the ingenious authors permission so to do and this was done with the less hesitation as it was apprehended the authors engagements in other affairs would scarce afford him leisure to give the public his reflections and experiments on the subject finished with that care and precision of which the treatise before us shows he is alike studious and capable dr priestley in his history of electricity published in the year      gives a full account of franklins experiments and discoveries nothing was ever written upon the subject of electricity he says which was more generally read and admired in all parts of europe than these letters there is hardly any european language into which they have not been translated and as if this were not sufficient to make them properly known a translation of them has lately been made into latin it is not easy to say whether we are most pleased with the simplicity and perspicuity with which these letters are written the modesty with which the author proposes every hypothesis of his own or the noble frankness with which he relates his mistakes when they were corrected by subsequent experiments     though the english have not been backward in acknowledging the great merit of this philosopher he has had the singular good fortune to be perhaps even more celebrated abroad than at home so that to form a just idea of the great and deserved reputation of dr franklin we must read the foreign publications on the subject of electricity in many of which the terms franklinism franklinist and the franklinian system occur in almost every page in consequence of this dr franklins principles bid fair to be handed down to posterity as equally expressive of the true principles of electricity as the newtonian philosophy is of the system of nature in general the observations and theories of franklin met with high favor in france where his experiments were repeated and the results verified to the admiration of the scientific world in the year      his friend peter collinson wrote to him from london the king of france strictly commands the abbé mazéas to write a letter in the politest terms to the royal society to return the kings thanks and compliments in an express manner to mr franklin of pennsylvania for his useful discoveries in electricity and the application of pointed rods to prevent the terrible effect of thunderstorms and the same mr collinson wrote as follows to the reverend jared eliot of connecticut in a letter dated london november   d      our friend franklin will be honored on st andrews day the  0th instant the anniversary of the royal soicety when the right honorable the earl of macclesfield will make an oration on mr franklins new discoveries in electricity and as a reward and encouragement will bestow on him a gold medal this ceremony accordingly took place and the medal was conferred   0 benjamin franklin    july      philadelphia peter collinson xliv to peter collinson philadelphia    july      sir— in my last i informed you that in pursuing our electrical inquiries we had observed some particular phenomena which we looked upon to be new and of which i promised to give you some account though i apprehended they might not possibly be new to you as so many hands are daily employed in electrical experiments on your side the water some or other of which would probably hit on the same observations the first is the wonderful effect of pointed bodies both in drawing off and throwing off the electrical fire for example place an iron shot of three or four inches diameter on the mouth of a clean dry glass bottle by a fine silken thread from the ceiling right over the mouth of the bottle suspend a small cork ball about the bigness of a marble the thread of such a length as that the cork ball may rest against the side of the shot electrify the shot and the ball will be repelled to the distance of four or five inches more or less according to the quantity of electricity when in this state if you present to the shot the point of a long slender sharp bodkin at six or eight inches distance the repellency is instantly destroyed and the cork flies to the shot a blunt body must be brought within an inch and draw a spark to produce the same effect to prove that the electrical fire is drawn off by the point if you take the blade of the     bodkin out of the wooden handle and fix it in a stick of sealingwax and then present it at the distance aforesaid or if you bring it very near no such effect follows but sliding one finger along the wax till you touch the blade and the ball flies to the shot immediately if you present the point in the dark you will see sometimes at a foot distance and more a light gather upon it like that of a firefly or glowworm the less sharp the point the nearer you must bring it to observe the light and at whatever distance you see the light you may draw off the electrical fire and destroy the repellency if a cork ball so suspended be repelled by the tube and a point be presented quick to it though at a considerable distance it is surprising to see how suddenly it flies back to the tube points of wood will do near as well as those of iron provided the wood is not dry for perfectly dry wood will no more conduct electricity than sealingwax to show that points will throw off  as well as draw off the electrical fire lay a long sharp needle upon the shot and you cannot electrize the shot so as to make it repel the cork ball or fix a needle to the end of a suspended gunbarrel or iron rod so as to point beyond it like a little bayonet  and while it     remains there the gunbarrel or rod cannot by applying the tube to the other end be electrized so as to give a spark the fire continually running out silently at the point in the dark you may see it make the same appearance as it does in the case before mentioned the repellency between the cork ball and the shot is likewise destroyed  st by sifting fine sand on it—this does it gradually  dly by breathing on it  dly by making a smoke about it from burning wood   thly by candlelight even though the candle is at a foot distance—these do it suddenly the light of a bright coal from a wood fire and the light of a redhot iron do it likewise but not at so great a distance smoke from dry rosin dropped on hot iron does not destroy the repellency but is attracted by both shot and cork ball forming proportionable atmospheres round them making them look beautifully somewhat like some of the figures in burnets or whistons theory of the earth n b—this experiment should be made in a closet where the air is very still or it will be apt to fail the light of the sun thrown strongly on both cork and shot by a lookingglass for a long time together     does not impair the repellency in the least this difference between firelight and sunlight is another thing that seems new and extraordinary to us  we had for some time been of opinion that the electrical fire was not created by friction but collected being really an element diffused among and attracted by other matter particularly by water and metals we had even discovered and demonstrated its afflux to the electrical sphere as well as its efflux by means of little light windmillwheels made of stiff paper vanes fixed obliquely and turning freely on fine wire axes also by little wheels of the same matter but formed like waterwheels of the disposition and application of which wheels and the various phenomena resulting i could if i had time fill you a sheet  the impossibility of electrizing ones self though standing on wax by rubbing the tube and drawing the fire from it and the manner of doing it by passing the tube near a person or thing standing on the floor c had also occurred to us some months before mr watsons ingenious sequel came to hand and these were some of the new things i intended to have communicated to you but now i need only mention some particulars not     hinted in that piece with our reasonings thereupon though perhaps the latter might well enough be spared   a person standing on wax and rubbing the tube and another person on wax drawing the fire they will both of them provided they do not stand so as to touch one another appear to be electrized to a person standing on the floor that is he will perceive a spark on approaching each of them with his knuckle   but if the persons on wax touch one another during the exciting of the tube neither of them will appear to be electrized   if they touch one another after exciting the tube and drawing the fire as aforesaid there will be a stronger spark between them than was between either of them and the person on the floor   after such strong spark neither of them discover any electricity these appearances we attempt to account for thus we suppose as aforesaid that electrical fire is a common element of which every one of the three persons above mentioned has his equal share before any operation is begun with the tube a who stands on wax and rubs the tube collects the electrical fire from himself into the glass and his communication with the common stock being cut off by the wax his body is not again immediately supplied b who stands on wax likewise passing his knuckle along near the tube receives the fire which was collected by the glass from a and his communication with the common stock being likewise cut off he retains     the additional quantity received to c standing on the floor both appear to be electrized for he having only the middle quantity of electrical fire receives a spark upon approaching b who has an over quantity but gives one to a who has an under quantity if a and b approach to touch each other the spark is stronger because the difference between them is greater after such touch there is no spark between either of them and c because the electrical fire in all is reduced to the original equality if they touch while electrizing the equality is never destroyed the fire only circulating hence have arisen some new terms among us we say b and bodies like circumstanced is electrized positively a negatively or rather b is electrized plus a minus and we daily in our experiments electrize bodies plus or minus as we think proper to electrize plus or minus no more needs to be known than this that the parts of the tube or sphere that are rubbed do in the instant of the friction attract the electrical fire and therefore take it from the thing rubbing the same parts immediately as the friction upon them ceases are disposed to give the fire they have received to any body that has less thus you may circulate it as mr watson has shown you may also accumulate or subtract it upon or from any body as you connect that body with the rubber or with the receiver the communication with the common stock being cut off we think that ingenious gentleman was deceived when he imagined in his sequel that the electrical fire came down the wire from the ceiling to the gunbarrel thence to the     sphere and so electrized the machine and the man turning the wheel c we suppose it was driven off and not brought on through that wire and that the machine and man c were electrized minus—that is had less electrical fire in them than things in common as the vessel is just upon sailing i cannot give you so large an account of american electricity as i intended i shall only mention a few particulars more we find granulated lead better to fill the phial with than water being easily warmed and keeping warm and dry in damp air we fire spirits with the wire of the phial we light candles just blown out by drawing a spark among the smoke between the wire and snuffers we represent lightning by passing the wire in the dark over a china plate that has gilt flowers or applying it to gilt frames of looking glasses c we electrize a person twenty or more times running with a touch of the finger on the wire thus he stands on wax give him the electrized bottle in his hand touch the wire with your finger and then touch his hand or face there are sparks every time  we increase the force of the electrical kiss vastly thus let a and b stand on wax or a on wax and b on the floor give one of them the electrized phial in hand let the other take hold of the wire there will be a small spark but when their lips approach they will be struck and shocked the     same if another gentleman and lady c and d standing also on wax and joining hands with a and b salute or shake hands we suspend by fine silk thread a counterfeit spider made of a small piece of burnt cork with legs of linen thread and a grain or two of lead stuck in him to give him more weight upon the table over which he hangs we stick a wire upright as high as the phial and wire four or five inches from the spider then we animate him by setting the electrified phial at the same distance on the other side of him he will immediately fly to the wire of the phial bend his legs in touching it then spring off and fly to the wire in the table thence again to the wire of the phial playing with his legs against both in a very entertaining manner appearing perfectly alive to persons unacquainted he will continue this motion an hour or more in dry weather we electrify upon wax in the dark a book that has a double line of gold round upon the covers and then apply a knuckle to the gilding the fire appears everywhere upon the gold like a flash of lightning not upon the leather nor if you touch the leather instead of the gold we rub our tubes with buckskin and observe always to keep the same side to the tube and never to sully the tube by handling thus they work readily and easily without the least fatigue especially if kept in tight pasteboard cases lined with flannel and sitting close to the tube  this i mention because the european papers on electricity frequently speak of rubbing the tubes as     a fatiguing exercise our spheres are fixed on iron axes which pass through them at one end of the axis there is a small handle with which you turn the sphere like a common grindstone this we find very commodious as the machine takes up but little room is portable and may be enclosed in a tight box when not in use it is true the sphere does not turn so swift as when the great wheel is used but swiftness we think of little importance since a few turns will charge the phial c sufficiently  i am c b franklin benjamin franklin july         philadelphia jared eliot xlv to jared eliot  philadelphia july         dear sir— i received your favor of the  th instant i ought before this time to have acknowledged the receipt of the book which came very safe and in good order to hand we have many oilmills in this province it being a great country for flax linseed oil may now be bought for three shillings per gallon sometimes for two shillings and six pence but at new york i have been told it generally holds up at about eight shillings of this you     can easily be satisfied it being your neighbor government in your last you inquired about the kind of land from which our hemp is raised i am told it must be very rich land sometimes they use drained swamps and banked meadows but the greater part of our hemp is brought from conestago which is a large and very rich tract of land on the banks of the susquehanna a large freshwater river it is brought down in wagons if you should send any of your steel saws here for sale i should not be wanting where my recommendation might be of service we have had as wet a summer as has been known here these thirty years so that it was with difficulty our people got in their harvest in some parts of the country a great deal of hay has been lost and some corn mildewed but in general the harvest has been very great the two preceding summers particularly the last were excessively dry i think with you it might be of advantage to know what the seasons are in the several parts of the country ones curiosity in some philosophical points might also be gratified by it we have frequently along this north american coast storms from the northeast which blow violently sometimes three or four days of these i have had a very singular opinion some years viz that though the course of the wind is from northeast to southwest yet the course of the storm is from southwest to northeast that is the air is in violent motion in virginia before it moves in   0 connecticut and in connecticut before it moves at cape sable c my reasons for this opinion if the like have not occurred to you i will give in my next i thank you for the curious facts you have communicated to me relating to springs i think with you that most springs arise from rains dews or ponds on higher ground yet possibly some that break out near the tops of high hollow mountains may proceed from the abyss or from water in the caverns of the earth rarefied by its internal heat and raised in vapor till the cold region near the tops of such mountains condenses the vapor into water again which comes forth in springs and runs down on the outside of the mountains as it ascended on the inside there is said to be a large spring near the top of teneriffe and that mountain was formerly a volcano consequently hollow within such springs if such there be may properly be called springs of distilled water now i mention mountains it occurs to tell you that the great appalachian mountains which run from york river back of these colonies to the bay of mexico show in many places near the highest parts of them strata of sea shells in some places the marks of them are in the solid rocks it is certainly the wreck of a world we live on we have specimens of these seashell rocks broken off near the tops of these mountains brought and deposited in our library as curiosities if you have not seen the like i will send you a piece farther about mountains for ideas will string themselves like ropes of onions when i was once riding in your country     mr walker showed me at a distance the bluff side or end of a mountain which appeared striped from top to bottom and told me the stone or rock of that mountain was divided by nature into pillars of this i should be glad to have a particular account from you i think i was somewhere near new haven when i saw it you made some mistake when you intended to favor me with some of the new valuable grass seed i think you called it herdseed for what you gave me is grown up and proves mere timothy so i suppose you took it out of a wrong paper or parcel i wish your new law may have the good effect expected from it in extricating your government from the heavy debt this war has obliged them to contract i am too little acquainted with your particular circumstances to judge of the prudence of such a law for your colony with any degree of exactness but to a friend one may hazard ones notions right or wrong and as you are pleased to desire my thoughts you shall have them and welcome i wish they were better first i imagine that the five per cent duty on goods imported from your neighboring governments though paid at first hand by the importer will not upon the whole come out of his pocket but be paid in fact by the consumer for the importer will be sure to sell his goods as much dearer to reimburse himself so that it is only another mode of taxing your own people though perhaps meant to raise money on your neighbours yet if you can make some of the goods heretofore imported among     yourselves the advanced price of five per cent may encourage your own manufacture and in time make the importation of such articles unnecessary which will be an advantage secondly i imagine the law will be difficult to execute and require many officers to prevent smuggling in so extended a coast as yours and the charge considerable and if smuggling is not prevented the fair trader will be undersold and ruined if the officers are many and busy there will arise numbers of vexatious lawsuits and dissensions among your people quære whether the advantages will overbalance thirdly if there is any part of your produce that you can well spare and would desire to have taken off by your neighbours in exchange for something you more want perhaps they taking offence at your selfish law may in return lay such heavy duties or discouragements on that article as to leave it a drug on your hands as to the duty on transporting lumber unless in connecticut bottoms to the west indies i suppose the design is to raise the price of such lumber on your neighbours and throw that advanced price into your treasury but may not your neighbours supply themselves elsewhere or if numbers of your people have lumber to dispose of and want goods from or have debts to pay to your neighbours will they not unless you employ numbers of officers to watch all your creeks and landings run their lumber and so defeat the law or if the law is strictly executed and the duty discourage the transportation to your neighbours will not all your     people that want to dispose of lumber be laid at the mercy of those few merchants that send it to the west indies who will buy it at their own price and make such pay for it as they think proper if i had seen the law and heard the reasons that are given for making it i might have judged and talked of it more to the purpose at present i shoot my bolt pretty much in the dark but you can excuse and make proper allowance my best respects to good mrs eliot and your sons and if it falls in your way my service to the kind hospitable people near the river whose name i am sorry i have forgot i am dear sir with the utmost regard your obliged and humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin jared eliot xlvi to jared eliot sir— i have perused your two essays on field husbandry and think the public may be much benefited by them but if the farmers in your neighborhood are as unwilling to leave the beaten road of their ancestors as they are near me it will be difficult to persuade them to attempt any improvement where the cash is to be laid out on a probability of a return they are very averse to the running any risk at all or even expending freely where a gentleman of a more public spirit has given them ocular demonstration of the success about eighteen months ago i made a purchase of     about three hundred acres of land near burlington and resolved to improve it in the best and speediest manner that i might be enabled to indulge myself in that kind of life which was most agreeable my fortune thank god is such that i can enjoy all the necessaries and many of the indulgences of life but i think that in duty to my children i ought so to manage that the profits of my farm may balance the loss my income will suffer by my retreat to it in order to this i began with the meadow on which there had never been much timber but it was always overflowed the soil is very fine and black about three feet then it comes to a bluish clay of this deep meadow i have about eighty acres forty of which had been ditched and mowed the grass which comes in first after ditching is speargrass and white clover but the weeds are to be mowed four or five years before they will be subdued as the vegetation is very luxuriant this meadow had been ditched and planted with indian corn of which it produced above sixty bushels per acre i first scoured up my ditches and drains and took off all the weeds then i ploughed it and sowed it with oats in the last of may in july i mowed them down together with the weeds which grew plentifully among them and they made good fodder i immediately ploughed it again and kept harrowing till there was an appearance of rain and on the   d of august i sowed near thirty acres with red clover and herdgrass allowing six quarts of herdgrass and four pounds of red clover to an acre in most parts of it in other parts four quarts     of herdgrass and three pounds of red clover the red clover came up in four days and the herdgrass in six days and i now find that where i allowed the most seed it protects itself the best against the frost i also sowed an acre with twelve pounds of red clover and it does well i sowed an acre more with two bushels of ryegrass seed and five pounds of red clover the ryegrass seed failed and the red clover heaves out much for want of being thicker however in march next i intend to throw in six pounds more of red clover as the ground is open and loose as these grasses are represented not durable i have sown two bushels of the sweeping of haylofts where the best hay was used well riddled per acre supposing that the speargrass and white clover seed would be more equally scattered when the other shall fail what surprised me was to find that the herdgrass whose roots are small and spread near the surface should be less affected by the frost than the red clover whose roots i measured in the last of october and found that many of their tap roots penetrated five inches and from its sides threw out near thirty horizontal roots some of which were six inches long and branched from the figure of this root i flattered myself that it would endure the heaving of the frost but i now see that wherever it is thin sown it is generally hove so far out that but a few of the horizontal and a small part of the tap roots remain covered and i fear will not recover take the whole together it is well matted and looks like a green cornfield     i have about ten acres more of this ground ready for seed in the spring but expect to combat with the weeds a year or two that sown in august i believe will rise so soon in the spring as to suppress them in a great measure my next undertaking was a round pond of twelve acres ditching round it with a large drain through the middle and other smaller drains laid it perfectly dry this having first taken up all the rubbish i ploughed up and harrowed it many times over till it was smooth its soil is blackish but in about a foot or ten inches you come to a sand of the same color with the upland from the birch that grew upon it i took it to be of a cold nature and therefore i procured a grass which would best suit that kind of ground intermixed with many others that i might thereby see which suited it best on the  th of september i laid it down with rye which being harrowed in i threw in the following grass seed a bushel of salem grass or feathergrass half a bushel of timothy or herdgrass half a bushel of ryegrass a peck of burdengrass or blue bent and two pints of red clover per acre all the seed in the chaff except the clover and bushed them in i could wish they had been clean as they would have come up sooner and been better grown before the frost and i have found by experiment that a bushel of clean chaff of timothy or salem grass will yield five quarts of seed the rye looks well and there is abundance of timothy or salem grass come up amongst it but it is yet small and in that state there is scarce any knowing those grasses apart i     expect from the sand lying so near the surface that it will suffer much in dry weather b franklin benjamin franklin   september      philadelphia peter collinson xlvii to peter collinson philadelphia   september      sir— the necessary trouble of copying long letters which perhaps when they come to your hands may contain nothing new or worth your reading so quick is the progress made with you in electricity half discourages me of writing any more on that subject yet i cannot forbear adding a few observations on m muschenbroeks wonderful bottle   the nonelectric contained in the bottle differs when electrized from a nonelectric electrized out of the bottle in this that the electrical fire of the latter is accumulated on its surface and forms an electrical atmosphere round it of considerable extent but the electrical fire is crowded into the substance of the former the glass confining it    at the same time that the wire and the top of the bottle c is electrized positively or plus the bottom of the bottle is electrized negatively or minus in exact proportion that is whatever quantity of electrical fire is thrown in at the top an equal quantity goes out of the bottom  to understand this     suppose the common quantity of electricity in each part of the bottle before the operation begins is equal to twenty and at every stroke of the tube suppose a quantity equal to one is thrown in then after the first stroke the quantity contained in the wire and upper part of the bottle will be twentyone in the bottom nineteen after the second the upper part will have twentytwo the lower eighteen and so on till after twenty strokes the upper part will have a quantity of electrical fire equal to forty the lower part none and then the operation ends for no more can be thrown into the upper part when no more can be driven out of the lower part if you attempt to throw more in it is spewed back through the wire or flies out in loud cracks through the sides of the bottle   the equilibrium cannot be restored in the bottle by inward communication or contact of the parts but it must be done by a communication formed without the bottle between the top and bottom by some nonelectric touching or approaching both at the same time in which case it is restored with a violence and quickness inexpressible or touching each alternately in which case the equilibrium is restored by degrees   as no more electrical fire can be thrown into the top of the bottle when all is driven out of the bottom so in a bottle not yet electrized none can be thrown into the top when none can get out at the bottom which happens either when the bottom is too thick or when the bottle is placed on an electric per se again when the bottle is electrized but     little of the electrical fire can be drawn out from the top by touching the wire unless an equal quantity can at the same time get in at the bottom  thus place an electrized bottle on clean glass or dry wax and you will not by touching the wire get out the fire from the top place it on a nonelectric and touch the wire you will get it out in a short time—but soonest when you form a direct communication as above so wonderfully are these two states of electricity the plus and minus combined and balanced in this miraculous bottle situated and related to each other in a manner that i can by no means comprehend if it were possible that a bottle should in one part contain a quantity of air strongly compressed and in another part a perfect vacuum we know the equilibrium would be instantly restored within but here we have a bottle containing at the same time a plenum of electrical fire and a vacuum of the same fire and yet the equilibrium cannot be restored between them but by a communication without though the plenum presses violently to expand and the hungry vacuum seems to attract as violently in order to be filled   the shock to the nerves or convulsion rather is occasioned by the sudden passing of the fire through the body in its way from the top to the bottom of the bottle the fire takes the shortest  course as mr watson justly observes but it does not appear from experiment that in order for a person to be  00 shocked a communication with the floor is necessary for he that holds the bottle with one hand and touches the wire with the other will be shocked as much though his shoes be dry or even standing on wax as otherwise and on the touch of the wire or of the gunbarrel which is the same thing the fire does not proceed from the touching finger to the wire as is supposed but from the wire to the finger and passes through the body to the other hand and so into the bottom of the bottle experiments confirming the above experiment i place an electrized phial on wax a small cork ball suspended by a dry silk thread held in your hand and brought near to the wire will first be attracted and then repelled when in this state of repellency sink your hand that the ball may be brought towards the bottom of the bottle it will be there instantly and strongly attracted till it has parted with its fire if the bottle had a positive electrical atmosphere as well as the wire an electrified cork would be repelled from one as well as from the other experiment ii plate iii fig  —from a bent wire a sticking in the table let a small linen thread b hang down within half an inch of the electrized phial c touch the wire or the phial repeatedly with your finger and at every touch you will see the thread instantly h  0  attracted by the bottle this is best done by a vinegarcruet or some such bellied bottle as soon as you draw any fire out from the upper part by touching the wire the lower part of the bottle draws an equal quantity in by the thread  experiment iii fig  —fix a wire in the lead with which the bottom of the bottle is armed d so as that bending upwards its ringend may be level with the top or ringend of the wire in the cork e and at three or four inches distance then electrize the bottle and place it on wax if a cork suspended by a silk thread f hang between these two wires it will play incessantly from one to the other till the bottle is no longer electrized that is it fetches and carries fire from the top to the bottom  of the bottle till the equilibrium is restored experiment iv fig  —place an electrized phial on wax take a wire g in form of a c the ends at such a distance when bent as that the upper may touch the wire of the bottle when the lower touches the bottom stick the outer part on a stick of sealingwax h which will serve as a handle then apply the lower end to the bottom of the bottle and gradually bring the upper end near the wire in the cork the consequence is spark follows spark till the equilibrium is restored touch the top first and on approaching  0  the bottom with the other end you have a constant stream of fire from the wire entering the bottle touch the top and bottom together and the equilibrium will instantly be restored the crooked wire forming the communication experiment v fig  —let a ring of thin lead or paper surround a bottle i even at some distance from or above the bottom from that ring let a wire proceed up till it touch the wire of the cork k a bottle so fixed cannot by any means be electrized the equilibrium is never destroyed for while the communication between the upper and lower parts of the bottle is continued by the outside wire the fire only circulates what is driven out at bottom is constantly supplied from the top  hence a bottle cannot be electrized that is foul or moist on the outside if such moisture continue up to the cork or wire experiment vi place a man on a cake of wax and present him the wire of the electrified phial to touch you standing on the floor and holding it in your hand as often as he touches it he will be electrified plus and any one standing on the floor may draw a spark from him the fire in this experiment passes out of the wire into him and at the same time out of your hand into the bottom of the bottle  0  experiment vii give him the electrical phial to hold and do you touch the wire as often as you touch it he will be electrified minus and may draw a spark from any one standing on the floor the fire now passes from the wire to you and from him into the bottom of the bottle experiment viii lay two books on two glasses back towards back two or three inches distant set the electrified phial on one and then touch the wire that book will be electrified minus the electrical fire being drawn out of it by the bottom of the bottle take off the bottle and holding it in your hand touch the other with the wire that book will be electrified plus the fire passing into it from the wire and the bottle at the same time supplied from your hand a suspended small cork ball will play between these books till the equilibrium is restored experiment ix when a body is electrized plus it will repel a positively electrified feather or small cork ball when minus or when in the common state it will attract them but stronger when minus than when in the common state the difference being greater experiment x though as in experiment vi a man standing on wax may be electrized a number of times by repeatedly touching the wire of an electrized bottle  0  held in the hand of one standing on the floor he receiving the fire from the wire each time yet holding it in his own hand and touching the wire though he draws a strong spark and is violently shocked no electricity remains in him the fire only passing through him from the upper to the lower part of the bottle observe before the shock to let some one on the floor touch him to restore the equilibrium of his body for in taking hold of the bottom of the bottle he sometimes becomes a little electrized minus which will continue after the shock as would also any plus electricity which he might have given him before the shock for restoring the equilibrium in the bottle does not at all affect the electricity in the man through whom the fire passes that electricity is neither increased nor diminished experiment xi the passing of the electrical fire from the upper to the lower part  of the bottle to restore the equilibrium is rendered strongly visible by the following pretty experiment take a book whose covering is filleted with gold bend a wire of eight or ten inches long in the form of m fig   slip it on the end of the cover of the book over the gold line so as that the shoulder of it may press upon one end of the gold line the ring up but leaning towards the other end of the book lay the book on a glass or wax  and  0  on the other end of the gold line set the bottle electrized then bend the springing wire by pressing it with a stick of wax till its ring approaches the ring of the bottle wire instantly there is a strong spark and stroke and the whole line of gold which completes the communication between the top and bottom of the bottle will appear a vivid flame like the sharpest lightning the closer the contact between the shoulder of the wire and the gold at one end of the line and between the bottom of the bottle and the gold at the other end the better the experiment succeeds the room should be darkened if you would have the whole filleting round the cover appear in fire at once let the bottle and wire touch the gold in the diagonally opposite corners i am c b franklin benjamin franklin   october      philadelphia cadwallader colden xlviii to cadwallader colden philadelphia   october      sir— i send you herewith the history of the five nations you will perceive that osborne to puff up the book has inserted the charters c of his province all under the title of history of the five nations which i think was not fair but it is a common trick of booksellers mr james read to whom mr osborne has sent a parcel of books by recommendation of mr collinson  0  being engaged in business of another kind talks of declining to act in disposing of them and perhaps may put them into my hands if he should i will endeavour to do mr osborne justice in disposing of them to the best advantage as also of any other parcel he may send me from your recommendation mr armit is returned well from new england as he has your power of attorney and somewhat more leisure at present than i have i think to put your letter to mr hughes into his hands and desire him to manage the affair of your servant i shall write a line besides to hughes that he would assist in obliging the servant to do you justice which may be of some service as he owns himself obliged to me for recovering a servant for him that had been gone above a twelvemonth i am sir c b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia cadwallader colden xlix to cadwallader colden philadelphia    november      sir— the violent party spirit that appears in all the votes c of your assembly seems to me extremely unseasonable as well as unjust and to threaten mischief not only to yourselves but to your neighbours it begins to be plain that the french may reap great advantages from your divisions god grant they may be as blind to their own interest and as negligent of it as the english are of theirs it  0  must be inconvenient to you to remove your family but more so to you and them to live under continual apprehensions and alarms i shall be glad to hear you are all in a place of safety though plain truth  bore somewhat hard on both parties here it has had the happiness not to give much offence to either it has wonderfully spirited us up to defend ourselves and country to which end great numbers are entering into an association of which i send you a copy enclosed we are likewise setting on foot a lottery to raise three thousand pounds for erecting a battery of cannon below the city we have petitioned the proprietor to send us some from england and have ordered our correspondents to send us over a parcel if the application to the proprietor fails but lest by any accident they should miscarry i am desired to write to you and ask your opinion whether if our government should apply to governor clinton to borrow a few of your spare cannon till we could be supplied such application might probably meet with success pray excuse the effects of haste on this letter i am sir with the greatest respect your most obliged humble servant b franklin  0  benjamin franklin   december      james logan l to james logan  monday noon   december      sir— i am heartily glad you approve of our proceedings we shall have arms for the poor in the spring and a number of battering cannon the  0  place for the batteries is not yet fixed but it is generally thought that near red bank will be most suitable as the enemy must there have natural difficulties to struggle with besides the channel being narrow the dutch are as hearty as the english plain truth and the association are in their   0 language and their parsons encouraged them it is proposed to breed gunners by forming an artillery club to go down weekly to the battery and exercise the great guns the best engineers against cape     breton were of such a club tradesmen and shopkeepers of boston i was with them at the castle  at their exercise in      i have not time to write longer nor to wait on you till next week in general all goes well and there is a surprising unanimity in all ranks near eight hundred have signed the association and more are signing hourly one company of dutch is complete i am with great respect sir c b franklin benjamin franklin      philadelphia thomas hopkinson li to thomas hopkinson  philadelphia      according to my promise i send you in writing     my observations on your book  you will be the better able to consider them which i desire you to do at your leisure and to set me right where i am wrong i stumble at the threshold of the building and therefore have not read further the authors vis inertiæ essential to matter upon which the whole work is founded i have not been able to comprehend and i do not think he demonstrates at all clearly at least to me he does not that there is really such a property in matter he says in no   let a given body or mass of matter be called a and let any given celerity be called c that celerity doubled tripled c or     halved thirded c will be  c  c c or ½c ⅓c c respectively also the body doubled tripled or halved thirded will be  a  a or ½a ⅓a respectively thus far is clear but he adds now to move the body a with the celerity c requires a certain force to be impressed upon it and to move it with a celerity as  c requires twice that force to be impressed upon it c here i suspect some mistake creeps in by the authors not distinguishing between a great force applied at once and a small one continually applied to a mass of matter in order to move it i think it is generally allowed by the philosophers and for aught we know is certainly true that there is no mass of matter how great soever but may be moved by any force how small soever taking friction out of the question and this small force continued will in time bring the mass to move with any velocity whatsoever our author himself seems to allow this towards the end of the same no   when he is subdividing his celerities and forces for as in continuing the division to eternity by his method of ½c ⅓c ¼c ⅕c c you can never come to a fraction of velocity that is equal to 0c or no celerity at all so dividing the force in the same manner you can never come to a fraction of force that will not produce an equal fraction of celerity where then is the mighty vis inertiæ and what is its strength when the greatest assignable mass of matter will give way to or be moved by the least assignable force suppose two globes equal to the sun and to one another exactly equipoised in joves balance suppose no friction in the centre of motion     in the beam or elsewhere if a musqueto then were to light on one of them would he not give motion to them both causing one to descend and the other to rise if it is objected that the force of gravity helps one globe to descend i answer the same force opposes the others rising here is an equality that leaves the whole motion to be produced by the musqueto without whom those globes would not be moved at all what then does vis inertiæ do in this case and what other effect could we expect if there were no such thing surely if it were any thing more than a phantom there might be enough of it in such vast bodies to annihilate by its opposition to motion so trifling a force our author would have reasoned more clearly i think if as he has used the letter a for a certain quantity of matter and c for a certain quantity of celerity he had employed one letter more and put f perhaps for a certain quantity of force this let us suppose to be done and then as it is a maxim that the force of bodies in motion is equal to the quantity of matter multiplied by the celerity or f  c × a and as the force received by and subsisting in matter when it is put in motion can never exceed the force given so if f moves a with c there must needs be required  f to move a with  c for a moving with  c would have a force equal to  f which it could not receive from  f and this not because there is such a thing as vis inertiæ for the case would be the same if that had no existence but because nothing can give more than it has and now again if a thing can give what it has if  f can to  a give  c     which is the same thing as giving it  f that is if force applied to matter at rest can put it in motion and give it equal force where then is vis inertiæ if it existed at all in matter should we not find the quantity of its resistance subtracted from the force given in no   our author goes on and says the body a requires a certain force to be impressed on it to be moved with a celerity as c or such a force is necessary and therefore it makes a certain resistance c a body as  a requires twice that force to be moved with the same celerity or it makes twice that resistance and so on this i think is not true but that the body  a moved by the force  f though the eye may judge otherwise of it does really move with the same celerity as it did when impelled by the same force for  a is compounded of  a   a and if each of the  as or each part of the compound were made to move with  c as they might be by  f then the whole would move with  c and not with  c as our author supposes but  f applied to  a makes each a move with ½c and so the whole moves with  c exactly the same as  a was made to do by  f before what is equal celerity but a measuring the same space by moving bodies in the same time now if  a impelled by  f measures one hundred yards in a minute and in  a impelled by  f each a measures fifty yards in a minute which added make one hundred are not the celerities as the forces equal and since force and celerity in the same quantity of matter are always in proportion to each other why should we when the quantity of matter is     doubled allow the force to continue unimpaired and yet suppose one half of the celerity to be lost  i wonder the more at our authors mistake in this point since in the same number i find him observing we may easily conceive that a body as  a  a c would make three or four bodies equal to once a each of which would require once the first force to be moved with the celerity c if then in  a each a requires once the first force f to be moved with the celerity c would not each move with the force f and celerity c and consequently the whole be  a moving with  f and  c after so distinct an observation how could he miss of the consequence and imagine that  c and  c were the same thus as our authors abatement of celerity in the case of  a moved by  f is imaginary so must be his additional     resistance and here again i am at a loss to discover any effect of the vis inertiæ in no   he tells us that all this is likewise certain when taken the contrary way viz from motion to rest for the body a moving with a certain velocity as c requires a certain degree of force or resistance to stop that motion c c that is in other words equal force is necessary to destroy force it may be so but how does that discover a vis inertiæ would not the effect be the same if there were no such thing a force  f strikes a body  a and moves it with the celerity  c—that is with the force  f it requires even according to our author only an opposing  f to stop it but ought it not if there were a vis inertiæ to have not only the force  f but an additional force equal to the force of vis inertiæ that obstinate power by which a body endeavours with all its might to continue in its present state whether of motion or rest i say ought there not to be an opposing force equal to the sum of these the truth however is that there is no body how large soever moving with any velocity how great soever but may be stopped by any opposing force how small soever continually applied at least all our modern philosophers agree to tell us so let me turn the thing in what light i please i cannot discover the vis inertiæ nor any effect of it it is allowed by all that a body  a moving with a velocity  c and a force  f striking another body  a at rest they will afterwards move on together each with ½c and ½f which as i said before is equal in the whole to  c and  f if vis inertiæ as in this case     neither abates the force nor the velocity of bodies what does it or how does it discover itself i imagine i may venture to conclude my observations on this piece almost in the words of the author that if the doctrines of the immateriality of the soul and the existence of god and of divine providence are demonstrable from no plainer principles the deist that is theist has a desperate cause in hand i oppose my theist to his atheist because i think they are diametrically opposite and not near of kin as mr whitefield seems to suppose where in his journal he tells us m b was a deist i had almost said an atheist—that is chalk i had almost said charcoal the din of the market  increases upon me and that with frequent interruptions has i find made me say some things twice over and i suppose forget some others i intended to say it has however one good effect as it obliges me to come to the relief of your patience with your humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   august      philadelphia cadwallader colden lii to cadwallader colden philadelphia   august      sir— the observations i sent you on baxters book were wrote on a sheet or two of paper in folio he builds his whole argument on the vis inertiæ of     matter i boldly denied the being of such a property and endeavoured to demonstrate the contrary if i succeeded all his edifice falls of course unless some other way supported i desired your sentiments of my argument you left the book for me at new york with a few lines containing a short censure upon the author and that your time had been much taken up in town with business but you were now about to retire into the country where you should have leisure to peruse my papers since which i have heard nothing from you relating to them i hope you will easily find them because i have lost my rough draft but do not give yourself much trouble about them for if they are lost it is really no great matter i am glad to hear that some gentlemen with you are inclined to go on with electrical experiments i am satisfied we have workmen here who can make the apparatus as well to the full as that from london and they will do it reasonably by the next post i will send you their computation of the expense if you shall conclude to have it done here i will oversee the work and take care that every part be done to perfection as far as the nature of the thing admits instead of the remainder of my rough minutes on electricity which are indeed too rough for your view i send you enclosed copies of two letters i lately wrote to mr collinson on that subject when you have perused them please to leave them with mr nichols whom i shall desire to forward them per next post to a friend in connecticut   0 i am glad your philosophical treatise meets with so good reception in england mr collinson writes the same things to mr logan and mr rose of virginia writes me that he had received accounts from his correspondents to the same purpose i perceive by the papers that they have also lately reprinted in london your history of the five nations in octavo if it come to your hands i should be glad to have a sight of it mr logan on a second reading of your piece on fluxions lately is satisfied that some of the faults he formerly objected to it were his own and owing to his too little attention at that time he desires me to tell you so and that he asks your pardon upon what mr collinson wrote he again undertook to read and consider your philosophical treatise  i have not seen him since but shall soon and will send you his sentiments i am sir with great respect your most humble servant b franklin     liii a conjecture as to the cause of the heat of the blood in health and of the cold and hot fits of some fevers  the parts of fluids are so smooth and roll among one another with so little friction that they will not by any mechanical agitation grow warmer a phial half full of water shook with violence and long continued the water neither heats itself nor warms the phial therefore the blood does not acquire its heat either from the motion and friction of its own parts or its friction against the sides of its vessels but the parts of solids by reason of their closer adhesion cannot move among themselves without friction and that produces heat thus bend a plummet to and fro and in the place of bending it shall soon grow hot friction on any part of our flesh heats it clapping of the hands warms them exercise warms the whole body the heart is a thick muscle continually contracting and dilating nearly eighty times in a minute by this motion there must be a constant interfrication of its constituent solid parts that friction must produce a heat and that heat must consequently be continually communicated to the perfluent blood to this may be added that every propulsion of the blood by the contraction of the heart distends     the arteries which contract again in the intermission and this distension and contraction of the arteries may occasion heat in them which they must likewise communicate to the blood that flows through them that these causes of the heat of the blood are sufficient to produce the effect may appear probable if we consider that a fluid once warm requires no more heat to be applied to it in any part of time to keep it warm than what it shall lose in an equal part of time a smaller force will keep a pendulum going than what first set it in motion the blood thus warmed in the heart carries warmth with it to the very extremities of the body and communicates to them but as by this means its heat is gradually diminished it is returned again to the heart by the veins for a fresh calefaction the blood communicates its heat not only to the solids of our body but to our clothes and to a portion of the circumambient air every breath though drawn in cold is expired warm and every particle of the materia perspirabilis carries off with it a portion of heat while the blood retains a due fluidity it passes freely through the minutest vessels and communicates a proper warmth to the extremities of the body but when by any means it becomes so viscid as not to be capable of passing those minute vessels the extremities as the blood can bring no more heat to them grow cold the same viscidity in the blood and juices checks or stops the perspiration by clogging the perspiratory duct or perhaps by not admitting the perspirable     parts to separate paper wet with size and water will not dry so soon as if wet with water only a vessel of hot water if the vapor can freely pass from it soon cools if there be just fire enough under it to add continually the heat it loses it retains the same degree if the vessel be closed so that the vapor may be retained there will from the same fire be a continual accession of heat to the water till it rises to a great degree or if no fire be under it it will retain the heat it first had for a long time i have experienced that a bottle of hot water stopped and put in my bed at night has retained so much heat seven or eight hours that i could not in the morning bear my foot against it without some of the bedclothes intervening during the cold fit then perspiration being stopped great part of the heat of the blood that used to be dissipated is confined and retained in the body the heart continues its motion and creates a constant accession to that heat the inward parts grow very hot and by contact with the extremities communicate that heat to them the glue of the blood is by this heat dissolved and the blood afterwards flows freely as before the disorder benjamin franklin    january      philadelphia cadwallader colden liv to cadwallader colden philadelphia    january      dear sir— i received your favor relating to the cannon we have petitioned our proprietors for     some and have besides wrote absolutely to london for a quantity in case the application to the proprietors should not succeed so that accidents excepted we are sure of being supplied some time next summer but as we are extremely desirous of having some mounted early in the spring and perhaps if your engineer should propose to use all you have the works he may intend will not very soon be ready to receive them we should think ourselves exceedingly obliged to your government if you would lend us a few for one year only when you return to new york i hope a great deal from your interest and influence mr read to whom osborne consigned your books  did not open or offer them for sale till within these two weeks being about to remove when he received them and having till now no conveniency of shelves c in our two last papers he has advertised generally that he has a parcel of books to sell—greek latin french and english—but makes no particular mention of the indian history it is therefore no wonder that he has sold none of them as he told me a few days since i had one of them from london which i sent you before any of my friends saw it so as no one here has read it but myself i can only tell you my own opinion that it is a wellwritten entertaining and instructive piece and must be exceedingly useful to all those colonies which have any thing to do with indian affairs     you have reason to be pleased with the mathematicians envious expression about your tract on gravitation i long to see from europe some of the deliberate and mature thoughts of their philosophers upon it to obtain some leisure i have taken a partner  into the printinghouse but though i am thereby a good deal disengaged from private business i find myself still fully occupied the association lottery and batteries fill up at present a great part of my time      i thank you for communicating the sheet on the first principles of morality the continuation of which i shall be glad to see i am c b franklin benjamin franklin    january      philadelphia james logan lv to james logan philadelphia    january      sir— i have not yet found the book but suppose i shall tomorrow the post goes out today which allows me no time to look for it we have a particular account from boston of the guns there they     are in all thirtynine spanish make and new fifteen of them are twentyeight pounders and twentyfour are fourteen pounders we offer by this post £  00 this currency for them all and suppose we shall get them the insurers in consideration of the premium of twenty per cent engage thus that if the prizes arising against the tickets insured do not one with another make in the whole a sum equal to the first cost of the tickets they will make up the deficiency they now think it a disadvantageous agreement and have left off insuring for though they would gain as you observe £ 000 if they insured the whole at that rate in one lot yet it will not be so when they     insure a number of separate lots as ten twenty or one hundred tickets in a lot because the prizes falling in one lot do not help to make up the deficiencies in another the person that insured your one hundred and twentyfive did the next day give the whole premium to another with six and a quarter per cent more to be reinsured two thirds of them i have not insured for anybody so i shall neither lose nor gain that way i will send the policy that you may see it with the book i am sir c b franklin benjamin franklin  0 january      philadelphia james logan lvi to james logan philadelphia  0 january      sir— i send you herewith the book and enclosed is the policy here is no news but what is bad namely the taking of mesnard an account of which we have by way of lisbon he was carried into st malo and just now we have advice from new york that an express was arrived there from new england to inform the government that two prisoners who had escaped from different parts of canada and arrived in new england agreed in declaring that three thousand men were getting ready to march against albany which they intended to besiege and take and that they were to be joined by a great body of indians they write from new york that the advice is credited there i wish it may not prove     too true the wretched divisions and misunderstandings among the principal men in that government giving the enemy too much encouragement and advantage i hope you and your good family continue well being with sincere respect and affection c b franklin benjamin franklin   april      philadelphia james logan lvii to james logan philadelphia   april      sir— i have a letter from mr samuel laurens of new york who undertook to ship the guns for us informing me that two small vessels had been agreed with to bring them round but a sloop arriving there on sunday last that had been chased in latitude thirtysix by a ship and brigantine which were supposed to be the don pedro with a consort coming on this coast the governor and council thought it more advisable to send them to brunswick which we since hear is done captain wallace a discreet old sea commander of this place goes today or tomorrow to receive them there and provide carriages to bring them to philadelphia the postmaster at new york and another correspondent there write me that the ship seen was certainly the don pedro the captain of the vessel chased knowing her well having often seen her at the havana where he has been several voyages with a flag of truce he was very   0 near being taken but escaped by favor of the night we are glad to hear the don is come out with one consort only as by some accounts we apprehended he intended to bring a small fleet with him it now looks as if his design was more against our trade than our city with this i send you a packet from london and a pamphlet from sweden both left with me for you by the new swedish missionary mr sandin you must have heard that mr james hamilton is appointed our governor an event that gives us the more pleasure as we esteem him a benevolent and upright as well as a sensible man i hope he will arrive here early in the summer and bring with him some cannon from the proprietors i am sir c b franklin benjamin franklin    september      philadelphia cadwallader colden lviii to cadwallader colden philadelphia    september      sir— i received your favor of the   th instant which gave me the greater pleasure as it was so long since i had heard from you i congratulate you on your return to your beloved retirement i too am taking the proper measures for obtaining leisure to enjoy life and my friends more than heretofore having put my printinghouse under the care of my partner david hall absolutely left off bookselling and removed to a more quiet part of the town where i am settling my old accounts and hope soon to be     quite master of my own time and no longer as the song has it at every ones call but my own if health continue i hope to be able in another year to visit the most distant friend i have without inconvenience with the same views i have refused engaging further in public affairs the share i had in the late association c having given me a little present run of popularity there was a pretty general intention of choosing me a representative of the city at the next election of assembly men but i have desired all my friends who spoke to me about it to discourage it declaring that i should not serve if chosen thus you see i am in a fair way of having no other tasks than such as i shall like to give myself and of enjoying what i look upon as a great happiness leisure to read study make experiments and converse at large with such ingenious and worthy men as are pleased to honor me with their friendship or acquaintance on such points as may produce something for the common benefit of mankind uninterrupted by the little cares and fatigues of business among other pleasures i promise myself that of corresponding more frequently and fully with dr colden is none of the least i shall only wish that what must be so agreeable to me may not prove troublesome to you i thank you for your kind recommending of me to mr osborne mr read would readily have put the books into my hands but it being now out of my way to dispose of them i propose to mr hall the taking of them into his shop but he having looked over the invoice says they are charged so     extravagantly high that he cannot sell them for any profit to himself without hurting the character of his shop he will however at my request take the copies of the indian history and put them on sale but the rest of the cargo must lie i believe for mr osbornes further orders i shall write to him by our next vessels i am glad you have had an opportunity of gaining the friendship of governor shirley with whom though i have not the honor of being particularly acquainted i take him to be a wise good and worthy man he is now a fellow sufferer with you in being made the subject of some public virulent and senseless libels i hope they give him as little pain mr bartram continues well here is a swedish gentleman  a professor of botany lately arrived and i suppose will soon be your way as he intends for canada mr collinson and dr mitchell recommend him to me as an ingenious man perhaps the enclosed left at the postoffice for you may be from him i have not seen him since the first day he came i delivered yours to mr evans and when i next see mr bartram i shall acquaint him with what you say i am with great esteem and respect dear sir c b franklin     benjamin franklin  0 october      philadelphia james logan lix to james logan philadelphia  0 october      sir— i received your favor of the   th with the piece on the generation of plants for which i thank you mr sandin the swedish missionary who gave me wahlbooms oration to send you as he passed through this town from new york where he just arrived to racoon creek where he was to be settled i have never seen since mr kalm came to see me the day he arrived and brought me letters from mr collinson and dr mitchell both recommending him i invited him to lodge at my house and offered him any service in my power but i never saw him afterwards till yesterday when he told me that he had been much in the country and at new york since his arrival but was now come to settle in town for the winter today he dined with me and as i had received yours in the morning i took occasion to ask him if he had not yet seen mr logan he said no that he had once been out with his countryman mr kock proposing to wait on you as they returned but it proved later in the evening than they had expected and he thought a visit then would be unseasonable but proposed soon to pay his respects to you possibly he might at that time have the packet for you at naglees i did not ask him about that inquiring of him what was become of mr sandin he told me that soon after he got to racoon creek he was taken with the fever and ague which was followed by several other disorders     that constantly harassed him and at length carried him off just as kalm arrived here who hearing that he was dangerously ill hurried down to see him but found him dead sandin had a family with him and when here was in haste to get to his settlement but might intend to wait on you when he should come again to philadelphia kalm i suppose might be in haste to see as much of the country as he could and make his journey to new york before cold weather came on i mention these things so particularly that you may see you have not been purposely avoided by both these gentlemen as you seem to imagine i did not let kalm know that you had mentioned him to me in your letter i shall write to mr hugh jones as you desire i am sir c b franklin benjamin franklin lx advice to a young tradesman to my friend a b as you have desired it of me i write the following hints which have been of service to me and may if observed be so to you remember that time is money he that can earn ten shillings a day by his labor and goes abroad or sits idle one half of that day though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness ought not to reckon that the only expense he has really spent or rather thrown away five shillings besides     remember that credit is money if a man lets his money lie in my hands after it is due he gives me the interest or so much as i can make of it during that time this amounts to a considerable sum where a man has good and large credit and makes good use of it remember that money is of the prolific generating nature money can beget money and its offspring can beget more and so on five shillings turned is six turned again it is seven and threepence and so on till it becomes an hundred pounds the more there is of it the more it produces every turning so that the profits rise quicker and quicker he that kills a breeding sow destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation he that murders a crown destroys all that it might have produced even scores of pounds remember that six pounds a year is but a groat a day for this little sum which may be daily wasted either in time or expense unperceived a man of credit may on his own security have the constant possession and use of an hundred pounds so much in stock briskly turned by an industrious man produces great advantage remember this saying the good paymaster is lord of another mans purse he that is known to pay punctually and exactly to the time he promises may at any time and on any occasion raise all the money his friends can spare this is sometimes of great use after industry and frugality nothing contributes more to the raising of a young man in the world than punctuality and justice in all his dealings     therefore never keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time you promised lest a disappointment shut up your friends purse for ever the most trifling actions that affect a mans credit are to be regarded the sound of your hammer at five in the morning or nine at night heard by a creditor makes him easy six months longer but if he sees you at a billiardtable or hears your voice at a tavern when you should be at work he sends for his money the next day demands it before he can receive it in a lump it shows besides that you are mindful of what you owe it makes you appear a careful as well as an honest man and that still increases your credit beware of thinking all your own that you possess and of living accordingly it is a mistake that many people who have credit fall into to prevent this keep an exact account for some time both of your expenses and your income if you take the pains at first to mention particulars it will have this good effect you will discover how wonderfully small trifling expenses mount up to large sums and will discern what might have been and may for the future be saved without occasioning any great inconvenience in short the way to wealth if you desire it is as plain as the way to market it depends chiefly on two words industry and frugality—that is waste neither time nor money but make the best use of both without industry and frugality nothing will do and with them every thing he that gets all he can honestly and saves all he gets necessary expenses     excepted will certainly become rich if that being who governs the world to whom all should look for a blessing on their honest endeavours doth not in his wise providence otherwise determine an old tradesman benjamin franklin      philadelphia peter collinson lxi to peter collinson philadelphia ——      sir §   there will be the same explosion and shock if the electrified phial is held in one hand by the hook and the coating touched with the other as when held by the coating and touched at the hook   to take the charged phial safely by the hook and not at the same time diminish its force it must first be set down on an electric per se   the phial will be electrified as strongly if held by the hook and the coating applied to the globe or tube as when held by the coating and the hook applied    but the direction of the electrical fire being different in the charging will also be different in the explosion the bottle charged through the hook will be discharged through the hook the bottle charged through the coating will be discharged through the coating and not otherways for the fire must come out the same way it went in       to prove this take two bottles that were equally charged through the hooks one in each hand bring their hooks near each other and no spark or shock will follow because each hook is disposed to give fire and neither to receive it set one of the bottles down on glass take it up by the hook and apply its coating to the hook of the other then there will be an explosion and shock and both bottles will be discharged   vary the experiment by charging two phials equally one through the hook the other through the coating hold that by the coating which was charged through the hook and that by the hook which was charged through the coating apply the hook of the first to the coating of the other and there will be no shock or spark set that down on glass which you held by the hook take it up by the coating and bring the two hooks together a spark and shock will follow and both phials be discharged in this experiment the bottles are totally discharged or the equilibrium within them restored the abounding of fire in one of the hooks or rather in the internal surface of one bottle being exactly equal to the wanting of the other and therefore as each bottle has in itself the abounding as well as the wanting the wanting and abounding must be equal in each bottle see §      0    but if a man holds in his hands two bottles one fully electrified the other not at all and brings their hooks together he has but half a shock and the bottles will both remain half electrified the one being half discharged and the other half charged       place two phials equally charged on a table at five or six inches distance let a cork ball suspended by a silk thread hang between them if the phials were both charged through their hooks the cork when it has been attracted and repelled by the one will not be attracted but equally repelled by the other but if the phials were charged the one through the hook and the other through the coating  the ball when it is repelled from one hook will be as strongly attracted by the other and play vigorously between them fetching the electric fluid from the one and delivering it to the other till both phials are nearly discharged   when we use the terms of charging and discharging the phial it is in compliance with custom and for want of others more suitable since we are of opinion that there is really no more electrical fire in the phial after what is called its charging than before nor less after its discharging excepting only the small spark that might be given to and taken from the nonelectric matter if separated from the bottle which spark may not be equal to a fivehundredth part of what is called the explosion for if on the explosion the electrical fire came out of the bottle by one part and did not enter in again by another then if a man standing on wax holding the bottle in one hand takes the spark by touching the wire hook with the other the bottle   0 being thereby discharged the man would be charged or whatever fire was lost by one would be found in the other since there was no way for its escape but the contrary is true   besides the phial will not suffer what is called a charging unless as much fire can go out of it one way as is thrown in by another a phial cannot be charged standing on wax or glass or hanging on the prime conductor unless a communication be formed between its coating and the floor  0 but suspend two or more phials on the prime conductor one hanging on the tail of the other and a wire from the last to the floor an equal number of turns of the wheel shall charge them all equally and every one as much as one alone would have been what is driven out at the tail of the first serving to charge the second what is driven out of the second charging the third and so on by this means a great number of bottles might be charged with the same labor and equally high with one alone were it not that every bottle receives new fire and loses its old with some reluctance or rather gives some small resistance to the charging which in a number of bottles becomes more equal to the charging power and so repels the fire back again on the globe sooner in proportion than a single bottle would do    when a bottle is charged in the common way its inside and outside surfaces stand ready the one to give fire by the hook the other to receive it by the coating the one is full and ready to throw out the other empty and extremely hungry yet as the first will not give out unless the other can at the same     instant receive in so neither will the latter receive in unless the first can at the same instant give out when both can be done at once it is done with inconceivable quickness and violence    so a straight spring though the comparison does not agree in every particular when forcibly bent must to restore itself contract that side which in the bending was extended and extend that which was contracted if either of these two operations be hindered the other cannot be done but the spring is not said to be charged with elasticity when bent and discharged when unbent its quantity of elasticity is always the same    glass in like manner has within its substance always the same quantity of electrical fire and that a very great quantity in proportion to the mass of glass as shall be shown hereafter    this quantity proportioned to the glass it strongly and obstinately retains and will have neither more nor less though it will suffer a change to be made in its parts and situation that is we may take away part of it from one of the sides provided we throw an equal quantity into the other    yet when the situation of the electrical fire is thus altered in the glass when some has been taken from one side and some added to the other it will not be at rest or in its natural state till it is restored to its original equality and this restitution cannot be made through the substance of the glass but must be done by a nonelectric communication formed without from surface to surface    thus the whole force of the bottle and power     of giving a shock is in the glass itself the nonelectrics in contact with the two surfaces serving only to give and receive to and from the several parts of the glass that is to give on one side and take away from the other    this was discovered here in the following manner purposing to analyze the electrified bottle in order to find wherein its strength lay we placed it on glass and drew out the cork and wire which for that purpose had been loosely put in then taking the bottle in one hand and bringing a finger of the other near its mouth a strong spark came from the water and the shock was as violent as if the wire had remained in it which showed that the force did not lie in the wire then to find if it resided in the water being crowded into and condensed in it as confined by the glass which had been our former opinion we electrified the bottle again and placing it on glass drew out the wire and cork as before then taking up the bottle we decanted all its water into an empty bottle which likewise stood on glass and taking up that other bottle we expected if the force resided in the water to find a shock from it but there was none we judged then that it must either be lost in decanting or remain in the first bottle the latter we found to be true for that bottle on trial gave the shock though filled up as it stood with fresh unelectrified water from a teapot to find then whether glass had this property merely as glass or whether the form contributed any thing to it we took a pane of sashglass and laying it on the hand placed a plate of lead on its upper surface     then electrified that plate and bringing a finger to it there was a spark and shock we then took two plates of lead of equal dimensions but less than the glass by two inches every way and electrified the glass between them by electrifying the uppermost lead then separated the glass from the lead in doing which what little fire might be in the lead was taken out and the glass being touched in the electrified parts with a finger afforded only very small pricking sparks but a great number of them might be taken from different places then dexterously placing it again between the leaden plates and completing a circle between the two surfaces a violent shock ensued which demonstrated the power to reside in glass as glass and that the nonelectrics in contact served only like the armature of a loadstone to unite the force of the several parts and bring them at once to any point desired it being the property of a nonelectric that the whole body instantly receives or gives what electrical fire is given to or taken from any one of its parts    upon this we made what we called an electrical battery consisting of eleven panes of large sashglass armed with thin leaden plates pasted on each side placed vertically and supported at two inches distance on silk cords with thick hooks of leaden wire one from each side standing upright distant from each other and convenient communications of wire and chain from the giving side of one pane to the receiving side of the other that so the whole might be charged together and with the same labor as one single pane and another contrivance to bring the     giving sides after charging in contact with one long wire and the receivers with another which two long wires would give the force of all the plates of glass at once through the body of any animal forming the circle with them the plates may also be discharged separately or any number together that is required but this machine is not much used as not perfectly answering our intention with regard to the ease of charging for the reason given §  0 we made also of large glass panes magical pictures and selfmoving animated wheels presently to be described    i perceive by the ingenious mr watsons last book lately received that dr bevis had used before we had panes of glass to give a shock  though till that book came to hand i thought to have communicated it to you as a novelty the excuse for mentioning it here is that we tried the experiment differently drew different consequences from it for mr watson still seems to think the fire accumulated on the nonelectric that is in contact with the glass p     and as far as we hitherto know have carried it farther  0 the magical picture  is made thus having a large mezzotinto with a frame and glass suppose of the king god preserve him take out the print and cut a pannel out of it near two inches distant from the frame all round if the cut is through the picture it is not the worse with thin paste or gumwater fix the border that is cut off on the inside the glass     pressing it smooth and close then fill up the vacancy by gilding the glass well with leafgold or brass gild likewise the inner edge of the back of the frame all round except the top part and form a communication between that gilding and the gilding behind the glass then put in the board and that side is finished turn up the glass and gild the fore side exactly over the back gilding and when it is dry cover it by pasting on the pannel of the picture that hath been cut out observing to bring the correspondent parts of the border and picture together by which the picture will appear of a piece as at first only part is behind the glass and part before hold the picture horizontally by the top and place a little movable gilt crown on the kings head if now the picture be moderately electrified and another person take hold of the frame with one hand so that his fingers touch its inside gilding and with the other hand endeavour to take off the crown he will receive a terrible blow and fail in the attempt if the picture were highly charged the consequence might perhaps be as fatal  as that of high treason for when the spark is taken through a quire of paper laid on the picture by means of a wire communication it makes a fair hole through every sheet that is through fortyeight leaves though a quire of paper is thought good armour against the push of a sword or even against a pistol bullet and the crack is exceedingly loud the operator who holds the picture by the upper end where the inside of the frame is     not gilt to prevent its falling feels nothing of the shock and may touch the face of the picture without danger which he pretends is a test of his loyalty if a ring of persons take the shock among them the experiment is called the conspirators    on the principle in §   that hooks of bottles differently charged will attract and repel differently is made an electrical wheel that turns with considerable strength a small upright shaft of wood passes at right angles through a thin round board of about twelve inches diameter and turns on a sharp point of iron fixed in the lower end while a strong wire in the upper end passing through a small hole in a thin brass plate keeps the shaft truly vertical about thirty radii of equal length made of sashglass cut in narrow strips issue horizontally from the circumference of the board the ends most distant from the centre being about four inches apart on the end of every one a brass thimble is fixed if now the wire of a bottle electrified in the common way be brought near the circumference of this wheel it will attract the nearest thimble and so put the wheel in motion that thimble in passing by receives a spark and thereby being electrified is repelled and so driven forwards while a second being attracted approaches the wire receives a spark and is driven after the first and so on till the wheel has gone once round when the thimbles before electrified approaching the wire instead of being attracted as they were at first are repelled and the motion presently ceases but if another bottle which has been charged through the coating be placed near the same wheel its wire will     attract the thimble repelled by the first and thereby double the force that carries the wheel round and not only taking out the fire that had been communicated to the thimbles by the first bottle but even robbing them of their natural quantity instead of being repelled when they come again towards the first bottle they are more strongly attracted so that the wheel mends its pace till it goes with great rapidity twelve or fifteen rounds in a minute and with such strength as that the weight of one hundred spanish dollars with which we once loaded it did not seem in the least to retard its motion this is called an electrical jack and if a large fowl were spitted on the upright shaft it would be carried round before a fire with a motion fit for roasting    but this wheel like those driven by wind water or weights moves by a foreign force to wit that of the bottles the selfmoving wheel though constructed on the same principles appears more surprising it is made of a thin round plate of windowglass seventeen inches diameter well gilt on both sides all but two inches next the edge two small hemispheres of wood are then fixed with cement to the middle of the upper and under sides centrally opposite and in each of them a thick strong wire eight or ten inches long which together make the axis of the wheel it turns horizontally on a point at the lower end of its axis which rests on a bit of brass cemented with a glass saltcellar the upper end of its axis passes through a hole in a thin brass plate cemented to a long strong piece of glass which keeps it six or eight inches distant from any nonelectric     and has a small ball of wax or metal on its top to keep in the fire in a circle on the table which supports the wheel are fixed twelve small pillars of glass at about four inches distance with a thimble on the top of each on the edge of the wheel is a small leaden bullet communicating by a wire with the gilding of the upper surface of the wheel and about six inches from it is another bullet communicating in like manner with the under surface when the wheel is to be charged by the upper surface a communication must be made from the under surface to the table when it is well charged it begins to move the bullet nearest to a pillar moves towards the thimble on that pillar and passing by electrifies it and then pushes itself from it the succeeding bullet which communicates with the other surface of the glass more strongly attracts that thimble on account of its being before electrified by the other bullet and thus the wheel increases its motion till it comes to such a height that the resistance of the air regulates it it will go half an hour and make one minute with another twenty turns in a minute which is six hundred turns in the whole the bullet of the upper surface giving in each turn twelve sparks to the thimbles which makes seven thousand two hundred sparks and the bullet of the under surface receiving as many from the thimbles those bullets moving in the time near two thousand five hundred feet the thimbles are well fixed and in so exact a circle that the bullets may pass within a very small distance of each of them if instead of two bullets you put eight four communicating with the upper surface and four with the     under surface placed alternately which eight at about six inches distance completes the circumference the force and swiftness will be greatly increased the wheel making fifty turns in a minute but then it will not continue moving so long these wheels may be applied perhaps to the ringing of chimes  and moving of lightmade orreries    a small wire bent circularly with a loop at each end let one end rest against the under surface of the wheel and bring the other end near the upper surface it will give a terrible crack and the force will be discharged    every spark in that manner drawn from the surface of the wheel makes a round hole in the gilding tearing off a part of it in coming out which shows that the fire is not accumulated on the gilding but is in the glass itself    the gilding being varnished over with turpentine varnish the varnish though dry and hard is burnt by the spark drawn through it and gives a strong smell and visible smoke and when the spark is drawn through paper all round the hole made by it the paper will be blacked by the smoke which sometimes penetrates several of the leaves part of the gilding torn off is also found forcibly driven into the hole made in the paper by the stroke    it is amazing to observe in how small a portion of glass a great electrical force may lie a thin glass bubble about an inch diameter weighing only six grains being half filled with water partly gilt on the   0 outside and furnished with a wire hook gives when electrified as great a shock as a man can well bear as the glass is thickest near the orifice i suppose the lower half which being gilt was electrified and gave the shock did not exceed two grains for it appeared when broken much thinner than the upper half if one of these thin bottles be electrified by the coating and the spark taken out through the gilding it will break the glass inwards at the same time that it breaks the gilding outwards    and allowing for the reasons before given §      0 that there is no more electrical fire in a bottle after charging than before how great must be the quantity in this small portion of glass it seems as if it were of its very substance and essence perhaps if that due quantity of electrical fire so obstinately retained by glass could be separated from it it would no longer be glass it might lose its transparency or its brittleness or its elasticity experiments may possibly be invented hereafter to discover this    we were surprised at the account given in mr watsons book of a shock communicated through a great space of dry ground and suspect there must be some metalline quality in the gravel of that ground having found that simply dry earth rammed in a glass tube open at both ends and a wire hook inserted in the earth at each end the earth and wires making part of a circuit would not conduct the least perceptible shock and indeed when one wire was electrified the other hardly showed any signs of its being in connexion with it  even a thoroughly wet     packthread sometimes fails of conducting a shock though it otherwise conducts electricity very well a dry cake of ice or an icicle held between two in a circle likewise prevents the shock which one would not expect as water conducts it so perfectly well gilding on a new book though at first it conducts the shock extremely well yet fails after ten or a dozen experiments though it appears otherwise in all respects the same which we cannot account for     there is one experiment more which surprises us and is not hitherto satisfactorily accounted for it is this place an iron shot on a glass stand and let a ball of damp cork suspended by a silk thread hang in contact with the shot take a bottle in each hand one that is electrified through the hook the other through the coating apply the giving wire to the shot which will electrify it positively and the cork shall be repelled then apply the requiring wire which will take out the spark given by the other when the cork will return to the shot apply the same again and take out another spark so will the shot be electrified negatively and the cork in that case shall be repelled equally as before then apply the giving wire to the shot and give the spark it wanted so will the cork return give it another which will be an addition to its natural quantity so will the cork     be repelled again and so may the experiment be repeated as long as there is any charge in the bottles which shows that bodies having less than the common quantity of electricity repel each other as well as those that have more chagrined a little that we have been hitherto able to produce nothing in this way of use to mankind and the hot weather coming on when the electrical experiments are not so agreeable it is proposed to put an end to them for this season somewhat humorously in a party of pleasure on the banks of the skuylkill  spirits at the same time are to be fired by a spark sent from side to side through the river without any other conductor than the water an experiment which we some time since performed to the amazement of many  a turkey is to be killed for     our dinner by electrical shock and roasted by the electrical jack before a fire kindled by the electrified bottle when the healths of all the famous electricians in england holland france and germany are to be drank in electrified bumpers  under the discharge of guns from the electrical battery benjamin franklin peter collinson lxii to peter collinson sir— nonelectric bodies that have electric fire thrown into them will retain it till other electrics that have less approach and then it is communicated by a snap and becomes equally divided   electrical fire loves water is strongly attracted by it and they can subsist together   air is an electric per se and when dry will not conduct the electrical fire it will neither receive it nor give it to other bodies otherwise no body surrounded by air could be electrified positively and negatively for should it be attempted positively the air would immediately take away the overplus or negatively the air would supply what was wanting   water being electrified the vapors arising from it will be equally electrified and floating in the air     in the form of clouds or otherwise will retain that quantity of electrical fire till they meet with other clouds or bodies not so much electrified and then will communicate as before mentioned   every particle of matter electrified is repelled by every other particle equally electrified thus the stream of a fountain naturally dense and continual when electrified will separate and spread in the form of a brush every drop endeavouring to recede from every other drop but on taking out the electrical fire they close again   water being strongly electrified as well as when heated by common fire rises in vapors more copiously the attraction of cohesion among its particles being greatly weakened by the opposite power of repulsion introduced with the electrical fire and when any particle is by any means disengaged it is immediately repelled and so flies into the air   particles happening to be situated as a and b pl iii fig   representing the profile of a vessel of water are more easily disengaged than c and d as each is held by contact with three only whereas c and d are each in contact with nine when the surface of the water has the least motion particles are continually pushed into the situation represented by a and b   friction between a nonelectric and an electric per se will produce electrical fire not by creating but collecting it for it is equally diffused in our walls floors earth and the whole mass of common matter thus the whirling glass globe during its friction against the cushion draws fire from the cushion     the cushion is supplied from the frame of the machine that from the floor on which it stands cut off the communication by thick glass or wax placed under the cushion and no fire can be produced because it cannot be collected   the ocean is a compound of water—a nonelectric and salt—an electric per se  0 when there is a friction among the parts near its surface the electrical fire is collected from the parts below it is then plainly visible in the night it appears in the stern and in the wake of every sailing vessel every dash of an oar shows it and every surf and spray in storms the whole sea seems on fire the detached particles of water then repelled from the electrified surface continually carry off the fire as it is collected they arise and form clouds and those clouds are highly electrified and retain the fire till they have an opportunity of communicating it    the particles of water rising in vapors attach themselves to particles of air    the particles of air are said to be hard round separate and distant from each other every particle strongly repelling every other particle whereby they recede from each other as far as common gravity will permit    the space between any three particles equally repelling each other will be an equilateral triangle    in air compressed these triangles are smaller in rarified air they are larger    common fire joined with air increases the repulsion enlarges the triangles and thereby makes     the air specifically lighter such air among denser air will rise    common fire as well as electrical fire gives repulsion to the particles of water and destroys their attraction of cohesion hence common fire as well as electrical fire assists in raising vapors    particles of water having no fire in them mutually attract each other three particles of water then being attached to the three particles of a triangle of air would by their mutual attraction operating against the airs repulsion shorten the sides and lessen the triangle whereby that portion of air made denser would sink to the earth with its water and not rise to the formation of a cloud    but if every particle of water attaching itself to air brings with it a particle of common fire the repulsion of the air being assisted and strengthened by the fire more than obstructed by the mutual attraction of the particles of water the triangle dilates and that portion of air becoming rarer and specifically lighter rises    if the particles of water bring electrical fire when they attach themselves to air the repulsion between the particles of water electrified joins with the natural repulsion of the air to force its particles to a greater distance whereby the triangles are dilated and the air rises carrying up with it the water  0 if the particles of water bring with them portions of both sorts of fire the repulsion of the particles of air is still more strengthened and increased and the triangles farther enlarged    one particle of air may be surrounded by     twelve particles of water of equal size with itself all in contact with it and by more added to those    particles of air thus loaded would be drawn nearer together by the mutual attraction of the particles of water did not the fire common or electrical assist their repulsion    if air thus loaded be compressed by adverse winds or by being driven against mountains c or condensed by taking away the fire that assisted it in expanding the triangles contract the air with its water will descend as a dew or if the water surrounding one particle of air comes in contact with the water surrounding another they coalesce and form a drop and we have rain    the sun supplies or seems to supply common fire to vapors whether raised from earth or sea    those vapors which have both common and electrical fire in them are better supported than those which have only common fire in them for when vapors rise into the coldest region above the earth the cold will not diminish the electrical fire if it doth the common    hence clouds formed by vapors raised from fresh waters within land from growing vegetables moist earth c more speedily and easily deposit their water having but little electrical fire to repel and keep the particles separate so that the greatest part of the water raised from the land is let fall on the land again and winds blowing from the land to the sea are dry there being little use for rain on the sea and to rob the land of its moisture in order to rain on the sea would not appear reasonable        but clouds formed by vapors raised from the sea having both fires and particularly a great quantity of the electrical support their water strongly raise it high and being moved by winds may bring it over the middle of the broadest continent from the middle of the widest ocean    how these ocean clouds so strongly supporting their water are made to deposit it on the land where it is wanted is next to be considered    if they are driven by winds against mountains those mountains being less electrified attract them and on contact take away their electrical fire and being cold the common fire also hence the particles close towards the mountains and towards each other if the air was not much loaded it only falls in dews on the mountain tops and sides forms springs and descends to the vales in rivulets which united make larger streams and rivers if much loaded the electrical fire is at once taken from the whole cloud and in leaving it flashes brightly and cracks loudly the particles instantly coalescing for want of that fire and falling in a heavy shower  0 when a ridge of mountains thus dams the clouds and draws the electrical fire from the cloud first approaching it that which next follows when it comes near the first cloud now deprived of its fire flashes into it and begins to deposit its own water the first cloud again flashing into the mountains the third approaching cloud and all succeeding ones acting in the same manner as far back as they extend which may be over many hundred miles of country    hence the continual storms of rain thunder     and lightning on the east side of the andes which running north and south and being vastly high intercept all the clouds brought against them from the atlantic ocean by the trade winds and oblige them to deposit their waters by which the vast rivers amazons la plata and oroonoko are formed which return the water into the same sea after having fertilized a country of very great extent    if a country be plain having no mountains to intercept the electrified clouds yet it is not without means to make them deposit their water for if an electrified cloud coming from the sea meets in the air a cloud raised from the land and therefore not electrified the first will flash its fire into the latter and thereby both clouds shall be made suddenly to deposit water    the electrified particles of the first cloud close when they lose their fire the particles of the other clouds close in receiving it in both they have thereby an opportunity of coalescing into drops the concussion or jerk given to the air contributes also to shake down the water not only from those two clouds but from others near them hence the sudden fall of rain immediately after flashes of lightning    to show this by an easy experiment take two round pieces of pasteboard two inches diameter from the centre and circumference of each of them suspend by fine silk threads eighteen inches long seven small balls of wood or seven peas equal in goodness so with the balls appending to each pasteboard form equal equilateral triangles one ball being in the centre and six at equal distances from that and   0 from each other and thus they represent particles of air dip both sets in water and some adhering to each ball they will represent air loaded dexterously electrify one set and its balls will repel each other to a greater distance enlarging the triangles could the water supported by seven balls come into contact it would form a drop or drops so heavy as to break the cohesion it had with the balls and so fall let the two sets then represent two clouds the one a sea cloud electrified the other a land cloud bring them within the sphere of attraction and they will draw towards each other and you will see the separated balls close thus the first electrified ball that comes near an unelectrified ball by attraction joins it and gives it fire instantly they separate and each flies to another ball of its own party one to give the other to receive fire and so it proceeds through both sets but so quick as to be in a manner instantaneous in the cohesion they shake off and drop their water which represents rain    thus when the sea and land clouds would pass at too great a distance for the flash they are attracted towards each other till within that distance for the sphere of electrical attraction is far beyond the distance of flashing    when a great number of clouds from the sea meet a number of clouds raised from the land the electrical flashes appear to strike in different parts and as the clouds are jostled and mixed by the winds or brought near by the electrical attraction they continue to give and receive flash after flash till the electrical fire is equally diffused        when the gunbarrel in electrical experiments has but little electrical fire in it you must approach it very near with your knuckle before you can draw a spark give it more fire and it will give a spark at a greater distance two gunbarrels united and as highly electrified will give a spark at a still greater distance but if two gunbarrels electrified will strike at two inches distance and make a loud snap to what a great distance may ten thousand acres of electrified cloud strike and give its fire and how loud must be that crack    it is a common thing to see clouds at different heights passing different ways which shows different currents of air one under the other as the air between the tropics is rarefied by the sun it rises the denser northern and southern air pressing into its place the air so rarefied and forced up passes northward and southward and must descend into the polar regions if it has no opportunity before that the circulation may be carried on    as currents of air with the clouds therein pass different ways it is easy to conceive how the clouds passing over each other may attract each other and so come near enough for the electrical stroke and also how electrical clouds may be carried within land very far from the sea before they have an opportunity to strike  0 when the air with its vapors raised from the ocean between the tropics comes to descend in the polar regions and to be in contact with the vapors arising there the electrical fire they brought begins to be communicated and is seen in clear nights being     first visible where it is first in motion—that is where the contact begins or in the most northern part from thence the streams of light seem to shoot southerly even up to the zenith of northern countries but though the light seems to shoot from the north southerly the progress of the fire is really from the south northerly its motion beginning in the north being the reason that it is there seen first for the electrical fire is never visible but when in motion and leaping from body to body or from particle to particle through the air when it passes through dense bodies it is unseen when a wire makes part of the circle in the explosion of the electrical phial the fire though in great quantity passes in the wire invisibly but in passing along a chain it becomes visible as it leaps from link to link in passing along leaf gilding it is visible for the leaf gold is full of pores hold a leaf to the light and it appears like a net and the fire is seen in its leaping over the vacancies and as when a long canal filled with still water is opened at one end in order to be discharged the motion of the water begins first near the opened end and proceeds towards the close end though the water itself moves from the close toward the opened end so the electrical fire discharged into the polar regions perhaps from a thousand leagues length of vaporized air appears first where it is first in motion—that is in the most northern part and the appearance proceeds southward though the fire really moves northward this is supposed to account for the aurora borealis    when there is great heat on the land in a particular     region the sun having shone on it perhaps several days while the surrounding countries have been screened by clouds the lower air is rarefied and rises the cooler denser air above descends the clouds in that air meet from all sides and join over the heated place and if some are electrified others not lightning and thunder succeed and showers fall hence thundergusts after heats and cool air after gusts the water and the clouds that bring it coming from a higher and therefore a cooler region    an electrical spark drawn from an irregular body at some distance is scarcely ever straight but shows crooked and waving in the air so do the flashes of lightning the clouds being very irregular bodies    as electrified clouds pass over a country high hills and high trees lofty towers spires masts of ships chimneys c as so many prominences and points draw the electrical fire and the whole cloud discharges there    dangerous therefore is it to take shelter under a tree during a thundergust it has been fatal to many both men and beasts    it is safer to be in the open field for another reason when the clothes are wet if a flash in its way to the ground should strike your head it may run in the water over the surface of your body whereas if your clothes were dry it would go through the body because the blood and other humors containing so much water are more ready conductors hence a wet rat cannot be killed by the exploding electrical bottle when a dry rat may         common fire is in all bodies more or less as well as electrical fire perhaps they may be different modifications of the same element or they may be different elements the latter is by some suspected    if they are different things yet they may and do subsist together in the same body    when electrical fire strikes through a body it acts upon the common fire contained in it and puts that fire in motion and if there be a sufficient quantity of each kind of fire the body will be inflamed    when the quantity of common fire in the body is small the quantity of the electrical fire or the electrical stroke should be greater if the quantity of common fire be great less electrical fire suffices to produce the effect  0 thus spirits must be heated before we can fire them by the electrical spark  if they are much heated a small spark will do if not the spark must be greater    till lately we could only fire warm vapors but now we can burn hard dry rosin and when we can procure greater electrical sparks we may be able to fire not only unwarmed spirits as lightning does but even wood by giving sufficient agitation to the common fire contained in it as friction we know will do    sulphureous and inflammable vapors arising from the earth are easily kindled by lightning besides     what arise from the earth such vapors are sent out by stacks of moist hay corn or other vegetables which heat and reek wood rotting in old trees or buildings does the same such are therefore easily and often fired    metals are often melted by lightning though perhaps not from heat in the lightning nor altogether from agitated fire in the metals for as whatever body can insinuate itself between the particles of metal and overcome the attraction by which they cohere as sundry menstrua can will make the solid become a fluid as well as fire yet without heating it so the electrical fire or lightning creating a violent repulsion between the particles of the metal it passes through the metal is fused    if you would by a violent fire melt off the end of a nail which is half driven into a door the heat given the whole nail before a part would melt must burn the board it sticks in and the melted part would burn the floor it dropped on but if a sword can be melted in the scabbard and money in a mans pocket by lightning without burning either it must be a cold fusion     lightning rends some bodies the electrical spark will strike a hole through a quire of strong paper    if the source of lightning assigned in this paper     be the true one there should be little thunder heard at sea far from land and accordingly some old seacaptains of whom inquiry has been made do affirm that the fact agrees perfectly with the hypothesis for that in crossing the great ocean they seldom meet with thunder till they come into soundings and that the islands far from the continent have very little of it and a curious observer who lived thirteen years at bermudas says there was less thunder there in that time than he has sometimes heard in a month

the building remains in statu quo there having been no new application to the assembly about it or any thing done in consequence of the former i have received no money on your account from mr thanklin or from boston mrs read  and your other friends here in general are well and will rejoice to see you again i am glad to hear that you have frequent opportunities     of preaching among the great if you can gain them to a good and exemplary life wonderful changes will follow in the manners of the lower ranks for ad exemplum regis etc on this principle confucius the famous eastern reformer

franklin at boston philadelphia   september      honored mother we received your kind letter by this post and are glad you still continue to enjoy such a share of     health cousin josiah and his spouse arrived hearty and well last saturday noon i met them the evening before at trenton thirty miles off and accompanied them to town they went into their own house on monday and i believe will do very well for he seems bent on industry and she appears a discreet notable young woman my wife has been to see them every day calling in as she passes by and i suspect has fallen in love with our new cousin for she entertains me a deal when she comes home with what cousin sally does and what cousin sally says what a good contriver she is and the like i believe it might be of service to me in the matter of getting in my debts if i were to make a voyage to london but i have not yet determined on it in my own mind and think i am grown almost too lazy to undertake it the indians are gone homewards loaded with presents in a week or two the treaty with them will be printed and i will send you one my love to brother and sister mecom and to all inquiring friends i am your dutiful son b franklin benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia abiah franklin lxv to mrs abiah franklin philadelphia    october      honored mother this has been a busy day with your daughter and she is gone to bed much fatigued and cannot write i send you enclosed one of our new almanacs     we print them early because we send them to many places far distant i send you also a moidore enclosed which please to accept towards chaise hire that you may ride warm to meetings this winter pray tell us what kind of a sickness you have had in boston this summer besides the measles and flux which have carried off many children we have lost some grown persons by what we call the yellow fever though that is almost if not quite over thanks to god who has preserved all our family in perfect health here are cousins coleman and two folgers all well your granddaughter is the greatest lover of her book and school of any child i ever knew and is very dutiful to her mistress as well as to us i doubt not but brother mecom will send the collar as soon as he can conveniently my love to him sister and all the children i am your dutiful son b franklin benjamin franklin abiah franklin lxvi to mrs abiah franklin date uncertain honored mother we received your kind letter of the  d instant by which we are glad to hear you still enjoy such a measure of health notwithstanding your great age we read your writing very easily i never met with a word in your letters but what i could easily understand for though the hand is not always the best   0 the sense makes every thing plain my leg which you inquire after is now quite well i shall keep these servants but the man not in my own house i have hired him out to the man that takes care of my dutch printingoffice who agrees to keep him in victuals and clothes and to pay me a dollar a week for his work the wife since that affair behaves exceeding well but we conclude to sell them both the first good opportunity for we do not like negro servants we got again about half what we lost as to your grandchildren will is now nineteen years of age a tall proper youth and much of a beau he acquired a habit of idleness on the expedition  but begins of late to apply himself to business and i hope will become an industrious man he imagined his father had got enough for him but i have assured him that i intend to spend what little i have myself if it please god that i live long enough and as he by no means wants acuteness he can see by my going on that i mean to be as good as my word sally grows a fine girl and is extremely industrious with her needle and delights in her work she is of a most affectionate temper and perfectly dutiful and obliging to her parents and to all perhaps i flatter myself too much but i have hopes that she will prove an ingenious sensible notable and worthy woman like her aunt jenny she goes now to the dancingschool for my own part at present i pass my time agreeably enough i enjoy through mercy a tolerable     share of health i read a great deal ride a little do a little business for myself now and then for others retire when i can and go into company when i please so the years roll round and the last will come when i would rather have it said he lived usefully than he died rich cousins josiah and sally are well and i believe will do well for they are an industrious loving young couple but they want a little more stock to go on smoothly with their business my love to brother and sister mecom and their children and to all my relations in general i am your dutiful son b franklin benjamin franklin peter collinson lxvii to peter collinson  sir— according to your request i now send you the arithmetical curiosity of which this is the history being one day in the country at the house of our common friend the late learned mr logan he showed me a folio french book filled with magic squares wrote if i forget not by one m frenicle in which he said the author had discovered great ingenuity and dexterity in the management of numbers     and though several other foreigners had distinguished themselves in the same way he did not recollect that any one englishman had done any thing of the kind remarkable i said it was perhaps a mark of the good sense of our english mathematicians that they would not spend their time in things that were merely difficiles nugæ incapable of any useful application he answered that many of the arithmetical or mathematical questions publicly proposed and answered in england were equally trifling and useless perhaps the considering and answering such questions i replied may not be altogether useless if it produces by practice an habitual readiness and exactness in mathematical disquisitions which readiness may on many occasions be of real use in the same way says he may the making of these squares be of use i then confessed to him that in my younger days having once some leisure which i still think i might have employed more usefully i had amused myself in making this kind of magic squares and at length had acquired such a knack at it that i could fill the cells of any magic square of reasonable size with a series of numbers as fast as i could write them disposed in such a manner as that the sums of every row horizontal perpendicular or diagonal should be equal but not being satisfied with these which i looked on as common and easy things i had imposed on myself more difficult tasks and succeeded in making other magic squares with a variety of properties and much more curious he then showed me several in the same book of an uncommon i     and more curious kind but as i thought none of them equal to some i remembered to have made he desired me to let him see them and accordingly the next time i visited him i carried him a square of eight which i found among my old papers and which i will now give you with an account of its properties see plate iv fig    magical squares the properties are   that every straight row horizontal or vertical of eight numbers added together makes   0 and half each row half   0   that the bent row of eight numbers ascending and descending diagonally viz from    ascending to  0 and from    descending to    and every one of its parallel bent rows of eight numbers make   0 also the bent row from    descending to    and from    ascending to    and every one of its parallel bent rows of eight numbers make   0 also the bent row from    to    descending to the left and from    to    descending to the right and every one of its parallel bent rows of eight numbers make   0 also the bent row from    to    descending to the right and from  0 to    descending to the left and every one of its parallel bent rows of eight numbers make   0 also the parallel bent rows next to the abovementioned which are shortened to three numbers ascending and three descending c as from    to   ascending and from    to    descending make with the two corner numbers   0 also the two numbers       ascending and       descending with the lower four numbers situated like them viz  0   descending and           ascending make   0 and lastly the four corner numbers with the four middle numbers make   0 so this magical square seems perfect in its kind but these are not all its properties there are five other curious ones which at some other time i will explain to you mr logan then showed me an old arithmetical book in quarto wrote i think by one stifelius which contained a square of sixteen that he said he should imagine must have been a work of great labor but if i forget not it had only the common properties of making the same sum viz  0   in every row horizontal vertical and diagonal not willing to be outdone by mr stifelius even in the size of my square i went home and made that evening the following magical square of sixteen which besides having all the properties of the foregoing square of eight—that is it would make the  0   in all the same rows and diagonals had this added that a foursquare hole being cut in a piece of paper of such a size as to take in and show through it just sixteen of the little squares when laid on the greater square the sum of the sixteen numbers so appearing through the hole wherever it was placed on the greater square should likewise make  0   this i sent to our friend the next morning who after some days sent it back in a letter with these words i return to thee thy astonishing or most stupendous piece of the magical square in which—but the compliment is too extravagant and therefore for his sake as well as my own i ought not to repeat it j     nor is it necessary for i make no question but you will readily allow this square of sixteen to be the most magically magical of any magic square ever made by any magician see plate iv fig    magic circle of circles i did not however end with squares but composed also a magic circle consisting of eight concentric circles and eight radial rows filled with a series of numbers from    to    inclusive so disposed as that the numbers of each circle or each radial row being added to the central number    they make exactly   0 the number of degrees in a circle and this circle had moreover all the properties of the square of eight if you desire it i will send it but at present i believe you have enough on this subject i am c b franklin benjamin franklin peter collinson lxviii to peter collinson magical circle sir— i am glad the perusal of the magical squares afforded you any amusement i now send you the magical circle see plate v its properties besides those mentioned in my former are these half the numbers in any radial row added with half the central number make   0 equal to the number of degrees in a semicircle also half the numbers in any one of the concentric circles taken either above or below the horizontal double line with half the central number make   0     and if any four adjoining numbers standing nearly in a square be taken from any part and added with half the central number they make   0 there are moreover included four other sets of circular spaces eccentric with respect to the first each of these sets containing five spaces the centres of the circles that bound them are at a b c and d each set for the more easy distinguishing them from the first are drawn with a different colored ink red blue green and yellow  these sets of eccentric circular spaces intersect those of the concentric and each other and yet the number contained in each of the twenty eccentric spaces taken all around make with the central number the same sum as those in each of the eight concentric viz   0 the halves also of those drawn from the centres a and c taken above or below the double horizontal line and of those drawn from centres b and d taken to the right or left of the vertical line do with half the central number make just   0 it may be observed that there is not one of the numbers but what belongs at least to two of the different circular spaces some to three some to four some to five and yet they are all so placed as never to break the required number   0 in any of the twentyeight circular spaces within the primitive circle these interwoven circles make so perplexed an appearance that it is not easy for the eye to trace     every circle of numbers one would examine through all the maze of circles intersected by it but if you fix one foot of the compasses in either of the centres and extend the other to any number in the circle you would examine belonging to that centre the moving foot will point the others out by passing round over all the numbers of that circle successively i am c b franklin benjamin franklin    february    0 philadelphia jared eliot lxix to jared eliot philadelphia    february    0 dear sir you desire to know my thoughts about the northeast storms beginning to leeward some years since there was an eclipse of the moon at nine oclock in the evening which i intended to observe but before night a storm blew up at northeast and continued violent all night and all next day the sky thickclouded dark and rainy so that neither moon nor stars could be seen the storm did a great deal of damage all along the coast for we had accounts of it in the newspapers from boston newport new york maryland and viriginia but what surprised me was to find in the boston newspapers an account of an observation of that eclipse made there for i thought as the storm came from the northeast it must have begun sooner at boston than with us and consequently have prevented such observation i wrote to my brother about it and he informed me     that the eclipse was over there an hour before the storm began since which i have made inquiries from time to time of travellers and of my correspondents northeastward and southwestward and observed the accounts in the newspapers from new england new york maryland virginia and south carolina and i find it to be a constant fact that northeast storms begin to leeward and are often more violent there than farther to windward thus the last october storm which with you was on the  th began on the  th in virginia and north carolina and was most violent there  as to the reason of this i can only give you my conjectures suppose a great tract of country land and sea to wit florida and the bay of mexico to have clear weather for several days and to be heated by the sun and its air thereby exceedingly rarefied suppose the country northeastward as pennsylvania new england nova scotia and newfoundland to be at the same time covered with clouds and its air chilled and condensed the rarefied air being lighter must rise and the denser air next to it will press into its place that will be followed by the next denser air that by the next and so on thus when i have a fire in my chimney there is a current of air constantly flowing from the     door to the chimney but the beginning of the motion was at the chimney where the air being rarefied by the fire rising its place was supplied by the cooler air that was next to it and the place of that by the next and so on to the door so the water in a long sluice or millrace being stopped by a gate is at rest like the air in a calm but as soon as you open the gate at one end to let it out the water next the gate begins first to move that which is next to it follows and so though the water proceeds forward to the gate the motion which began there runs backwards if one may so speak to the upper end of the race where the water is last in motion we have on this continent a long ridge of mountains running from northeast to southwest and the coast runs the same course these may perhaps contribute towards the direction of the winds or at least influence them in some degree if these conjectures do not satisfy you i wish to have yours on the subject i doubt not but those mountains which you mention contain valuable mines which time will discover i know of but one valuable copper mine in this country which is that of schuylers in the jerseys this yields good copper and has turned out vast wealth to the owners i was at it last fall but they were not then at work the water is grown too hard for them and they waited for a fireengine from england to drain their pits i suppose they will have that at work next summer it costs them one thousand pounds sterling colonel john schuyler one of the owners has a deer park five miles round fenced with cedar logs five logs high with blocks of wood between it   0 contains a variety of land high and low woodland and clear there are a great many deer in it and he expects in a few years to kill two hundred head a year which will be a very profitable thing he has likewise six hundred acres of meadow all within bank the mine is not far from passaic falls which i went also to see they are very curious the water falls seventy feet perpendicularly as we are told but we had nothing to measure with it will be agreeable to you to hear that our subscription goes on with great success and we suppose will exceed five thousand pounds of our currency we have bought for the academy the house that was built for itinerant preaching which stands on a large lot of ground capable of receiving more buildings to lodge the scholars if it should come to be a regular college the house is one hundred feet long and seventy wide built of brick very strong and sufficiently high for three lofty stories i suppose the building did not cost less than two thousand pounds but we bought it for seven hundred and seventyfive pounds eighteen shillings eleven pence and three farthings though it will cost us three and perhaps four hundred more to make the partitions and floors and fit up the rooms i send you enclosed a copy of our present constitution but we expect a charter from our proprietaries this summer when they may probably receive considerable alterations the paper admonishes me that it is time to conclude i am sir your obliged humble servant b franklin     benjamin franklin    june    0 philadelphia cadwallader colden lxx to cadwallader colden philadelphia    june    0 sir— i wrote a line to you last post and sent you some electrical observations and experiments you formerly had those papers of mine out of which something has been taken by mr watson and inserted in the transactions if you have forgot the contents of those papers i am afraid some things in that i last sent you will hardly be understood as they depend on what went before i send you herewith my essay towards a new hypothesis of the cause and effects of lightning c of which you may remember some hints in my first electrical minutes i sent this essay above a twelvemonth since to dr mitchell in london and have since heard nothing of it which makes me doubt of its getting to hand in some late experiments i have not only frequently fired unwarmed spirits by the electrical stroke but have even melted small quantities of copper silver and gold and not only melted but vitrified them so as to incorporate them with common glass and this without any sensible heat which strengthens my supposition that the melting of metals by lightning may be a cold fusion of these experiments i shall shortly write a particular account i wrote to mr collinson on reading in the transactions the accounts from italy and germany of giving purges transferring odors c with the electrical effluvia that i was persuaded they were not true he since informs me that abbé nollet of paris who had tried the experiments without success was lately at     the pains to make a journey to turin bologna and venice to inquire into the facts and see the experiments repeated imagining they had there some knacks of operating that he was unacquainted with but to his great disappointment found little or no satisfaction the gentleman there having been premature in publishing their imaginations and expectations for real experiments please to return me the papers when you have perused them my good old friend mr logan being about three months since struck with a palsy continues speechless though he knows people and seems in some degree to retain his memory and understanding i fear he will not recover mr kalm  is gone towards canada again and mr evans  is about to take a journey to lake erie which he intends next week mr bartram continues well and hearty i thank you for what you write concerning celestial observations we are going on with our building for the academy and propose to have an observatory on the top and as we shall have a mathematical professor i doubt not but we shall soon be able to send you some observations accurately made i am with great esteem and respect c b franklin     p s—if you think it would be agreeable to mr alexander or any other friend in new york to peruse these electrical papers you may return them to me through his hands benjamin franklin    july    0 philadelphia peter collinson lxxi to peter collinson philadelphia    july    0 sir— mr watson i believe wrote his observations on my last paper in haste without having first well considered the experiments related in §    which still appear to me decisive in the question whether the accumulation of the electrical fire be in the electrified glass or in the nonelectric matter connected with the glass and to demonstrate that it is really in the glass as to the experiment that ingenious gentleman mentions and which he thinks conculsive on the other side i persuade myself he will change his opinion of it when he considers that as one person applying the wire of the charged bottle to warm spirits in a spoon held by another person both standing on the floor will fire the spirits and yet such firing will not determine whether the accumulation was in the glass or the nonelectric so the placing another person between them standing on wax with a basin in his hand into which the water from the phial is poured while he at the instant of pouring presents a finger of his other hand to the spirits does not at all     alter the case the stream from the phial the side of the basin with the arms and body of the person on the wax being altogether but as one long wire reaching from the internal surface of the phial to the spirits june   th      in captain waddells account of the effects of lightning on his ship i could not but take notice of the large comazants as he calls them that settled on the spintles at the topmast heads and burned like very large torches before the stroke according to my opinion the electrical fire was then drawing off as by points from the cloud the largeness of the flame betokening the great quantity of electricity in the cloud and had there been a good wire communication from the spintle heads to the sea that could have conducted more freely than tarred ropes or masts of turpentine wood i imagine there would either have been no stroke or if a stroke the wire would have conducted it all into the sea without damage to the ship his compasses lost the virtue of the loadstone or the poles were reversed the north point turning to the south by electricity we have here at philadelphia frequently given polarity to needles and reversed it at pleasure mr wilson at london tried it on too large masses and with too small force a shock from four large glass jars sent through a fine sewingneedle gives it polarity and it will traverse when laid on water if the needle when struck lies east and west the end entered by the electric blast points north if it lies north and south the end that lay towards the north will continue     to point north when placed on water whether the fire entered at that end or at the contrary end the polarity given is strongest when the needle is struck lying north and south weakest when lying east and west perhaps if the force was still greater the south end entered by the fire when the needle lies north and south might become the north otherwise it puzzles us to account for the inverting of compasses by lightning since their needles must always be found in that situation and by our little experiments whether the blast entered the north and went out at the south end of the needle or the contrary still the end that lay to the north should continue to point north in these experiments the ends of the needle are sometimes finely blued like a watchspring by the electric flame this color given by the flash from two jars only will wipe off but four jars fix it and frequently melt the needles i send you some that have had their heads and points melted off by our mimic lightning and a pin that had its point melted off and some part of its head and neck run sometimes the surface on the body of the needle is also run and appears blistered when examined by a magnifyingglass the jars i make use of hold seven or eight gallons and are coated and lined with tinfoil each of them takes a thousand turns  of a globe nine inches diameter to charge it     i send you two specimens of tinfoil melted between glass by the force of two jars only i have not heard that any of your european electricians have ever been able to fire gunpowder by the electric flame we do it here in this manner a small cartridge is filled with dry powder hard rammed so as to bruise some of the grains two pointed wires are then thrust in one at each end the points approaching each other in the middle of the cartridge till within the distance of half an inch then the cartridge being placed in the circuit when the four jars are discharged the electric flame leaping from the point of one wire to the point of the other within the cartridge amongst the powder fires it and the explosion of the powder is at the same instant with the crack of the discharge yours c b franklin benjamin franklin    july    0 philadelphia peter collinson lxxii to peter collinson philadelphia    july    0 sir— as you first put us on electrical experiments by sending to our library company a tube with directions how to use it and as our honorable proprietary enabled us to carry those experiments to a greater height by his generous present of a complete electrical apparatus it is fit that both should know from time to time what progress we make it was in this view i wrote and sent you my former papers     on this subject desiring that as i had not the honor of a direct correspondence with that bountiful benefactor to our library they might be communicated to him through your hands in the same view i write and send you this additional paper if it happens to bring you nothing new which may well be considering the number of ingenious men in europe continually engaged in the same researches at least it will show that the instruments put into our hands are not neglected and that if no valuable discoveries are made by us whatever the cause may be it is not want of industry and application i am sir your much obliged humble servant b franklin opinions and conjectures concerning the properties and effects of the electrical matter and the means of preserving buildings ships c from lightning arising from experiments and observations made at philadelphia      §   the electrical matter consists of particles extremely subtile since it can permeate common matter even the densest metals with such ease and freedom as not to receive any perceptible resistance   if any one should doubt whether the electrical matter passes through the substance of bodies or only over and along their surfaces a shock from an electrified large glass jar taken through his own body will probably convince him   electrical matter differs from common matter     in this that the parts of the latter mutually attract those of the former mutually repel each other hence the appearing divergency in a stream of electrified effluvia   but though the particles of electrical matter do repel each other they are strongly attracted by all other matter    from these three things the extreme subtility of the electrical matter the mutual repulsion of its parts and the strong attraction between them and other matter arises this effect that when a quantity of electrical matter is applied to a mass of common matter of any bigness or length within our observation which hath not already got its quantity it is immediately and equally diffused through the whole   thus common matter is a kind of sponge to the electrical fluid and as a sponge would receive no water if the parts of water were not smaller than the pores of the sponge and even then but slowly if there were not a mutual attraction between those parts and the parts of the sponge and would still imbibe it faster if the mutual attraction among the parts of the water did not impede some force being required to separate them and fastest if instead of attraction there were a mutual repulsion among those parts which would act in conjunction with the attraction of the sponge so is the case between the electrical and common matter   but in common matter there is generally     as much of the electrical as it will contain within its substance if more is added it lies without upon the surface and forms what we call an electrical atmosphere and then the body is said to be electrified   it is supposed that all kinds of common matter do not attract and retain the electrical with equal strength and force for reasons to be given hereafter and that those called electrics per se as glass c attract and retain it strongest and contain the greatest quantity   we know that the electrical fluid is in common matter because we can pump it out by the globe or tube we know that common matter has near as much as it can contain because when we add a little more to any portion of it the additional quantity does not enter but forms an electrical atmosphere and we know that common matter has not generally more than it can contain otherwise all loose portions of it would repel each other as they constantly do when they have electric atmospheres  0 the beneficial uses of this electric fluid in the creation we are not yet well acquainted with though doubtless such there are and those very considerable but we may see some pernicious consequences that would attend a much greater proportion of it for had this globe we live on as much of it in proportion as we can give to a globe of iron wood or the like the particles of dust and other light matters that get loose from it would by virtue of their separate electrical atmospheres not only repel each other but be repelled from the earth and not easily be   0 brought to unite with it again whence our air would continually be more and more clogged with foreign matter and grow unfit for respiration this affords another occasion of adoring that wisdom which has made all things by weight and measure    if a piece of common matter be supposed entirely free from electrical matter and a single particle of the latter be brought nigh it will be attracted and enter the body and take place in the centre or where the attraction is every way equal if more particles enter they take their places where the balance is equal between the attraction of the common matter and their own mutual repulsion it is supposed they form triangles whose sides shorten as their number increases till the common matter has drawn in so many that its whole power of compressing those triangles by attraction is equal to their whole power of expanding themselves by repulsion and then will such a piece of matter receive no more    when part of this natural proportion of electrical fluid is taken out of a piece of common matter the triangles formed by the remainder are supposed to widen by the mutual repulsion of the parts until they occupy the whole piece    when the quantity of electrical fluid taken from a piece of common matter is restored again it enters the expanded triangles being again compressed till there is room for the whole    to explain this take two apples or two balls of wood or other matter each having its own natural quantity of the electrical fluid suspend     them by silk lines from the ceiling apply the wire of a wellcharged phial held in your hand to one of them a plate iii fig   and it will receive from the wire a quantity of the electrical fluid but will not imbibe it being already full the fluid therefore will flow round its surface and form an electrical atmosphere bring a into contact with b and half the electrical fluid is communicated so that each has now an electrical atmosphere and therefore they repel each other take away these atmospheres by touching the balls and leave them in their natural state then having fixed a stick of sealingwax to the middle of the phial to hold it by apply the wire to a at the same time the coating touches b thus will a quantity of the electrical fluid be drawn out of b and thrown on a so that a will have a redundance of this fluid which forms an atmosphere round and b an exactly equal deficiency now bring these balls again into contact and the electrical atmosphere will not be divided between a and b into two smaller atmospheres as before for b will drink up the whole atmosphere of a and both will be found again in their natural state    the form of the electrical atmosphere is that of the body it surrounds this shape may be rendered visible in a still air by raising a smoke from dry rosin dropt into a hot teaspoon under the electrified body which will be attracted and spread itself equally on all sides covering and concealing the body  and this form it takes because it is     attracted by all parts of the surface of the body though it cannot enter the substance already replete without this attraction it would not remain round the body but dissipate in the air    the atmosphere of electrical particles surrounding an electrified sphere is not more disposed to leave it or more easily drawn off from any one part of the sphere than another because it is equally attracted by every part but that is not the case with bodies of any other figure from a cube it is more easily drawn at the corners than at the plane sides and so from the angles of a body of any other form and still most easily from the angle that is most acute thus if a body shaped as a b c d e in plate iii fig   be electrified or have an electrical atmosphere communicated to it and we consider every side as a base on which the particles rest and by which they are attracted one may see by imagining a line from a to f and another from e to g that the portion of the atmosphere included in f a e g has the line a e for its basis so the portion of atmosphere included in h a b i has the line a b for its basis and likewise the portion included in k b c l has b c to rest on and so on the other side of the figure now if you will draw off this atmosphere with any blunt smooth body and approach the middle of the side a b you must come very near before the force of your attractor exceeds the force or power with which that side holds the atmosphere but there is a small portion between i b k that has less of the surface to rest on and to be attracted by than the neighbouring     portions while at the same time there is a mutual repulsion between its particles and the particles of those portions therefore here you can get it with more ease or at a greater distance between f a h there is a larger portion that has yet a less surface to rest on and to attract it here therefore you can get it away still more easily but easiest of all between l c m where the quantity is largest and the surface to attract and keep it back the least when you have drawn away one of these angular portions of the fluid another succeeds in its place from the nature of fluidity and the mutual repulsion before mentioned and so the atmosphere continues flowing off at such angle like a stream till no more is remaining the extremities of the portions of atmosphere over these angular parts are likewise at a greater distance from the electrified body as may be seen by the inspection of the above figure the point of the atmosphere of the angle c being much farther from c than any other part of the atmosphere over the lines c b or b a and besides the distance arising from the nature of the figure where the attraction is less the particles will naturally expand to a greater distance by their mutual repulsion on these accounts we suppose electrified bodies discharge their atmospheres upon unelectrified bodies more easily and at a greater distance from their angles and points than from their smooth sides those points will also discharge into the air when the body has too great an electrical atmosphere without bringing any nonelectric near to receive what is thrown off for the air though an electric     per se yet has always more or less water and other nonelectric matters mixed with it and these attract and receive what is so discharged    but points have a property by which they draw on as well as throw off the electrical fluid at greater distances than blunt bodies can that is as the pointed part of an electrified body will discharge the atmosphere of that body or communicate it farthest to another body so the point of an unelectrified body will draw off the electrical atmosphere from an electrified body farther than a blunter part of the same unelectrified body will do thus a pin held by the head and the point presented to an electrified body will draw off its atmosphere at a foot distance where if the head were presented instead of the point no such effect would follow to understand this we may consider that if a person standing on the floor would draw off the electrical atmosphere from an electrified body an iron crow and a blunt knittingneedle held alternately in his hand and presented for that purpose do not draw with different forces in proportion to their different masses for the man and what he holds in his hand be it large or small are connected with the common mass of unelectrified matter and the force with which he draws is the same in both cases it consisting in the different proportion of electricity in the electrified body and that common mass but the force with which the electrified body retains its atmosphere by attracting it is proportioned to the surface over which the particles are placed that is four square inches of that surface retain their atmosphere     with four times the force that one square inch retains its atmosphere and as in plucking the hairs from a horses tail a degree of strength not sufficient to pull away a handful at once could yet easily strip it hair by hair so a blunt body presented cannot draw off a number of particles at once but a pointed one with no greater force takes them away easily particle by particle    these explanations of the power and operation of points when they first occurred to me and while they first floated in my mind appeared perfectly satisfactory but now i have written them and considered them more closely i must own i have some doubts about them yet as i have at present nothing better to offer in their stead i do not cross them out for even a bad solution read and its faults discovered has often given rise to a good one in the mind of an ingenious reader    nor is it of much importance to us to know the manner in which nature executes her laws it is enough if we know the laws themselves it is of real use to know that china left in the air unsupported will fall and break but how it comes to fall and why it breaks are matters of speculation it is a pleasure indeed to know them but we can preserve our china without it  0 thus in the present case to know this power of points may possibly be of some use to mankind though we should never be able to explain it the following experiments as well as those in my first paper show this power i have a large prime conductor made of several thin sheets of clothiers     pasteboard formed into a tube near ten feet long and a foot diameter it is covered with dutch embossed paper almost totally gilt this large metallic surface supports a much greater electrical atmosphere than a rod or iron of fifty times the weight would do it is suspended by silk lines and when charged will strike at near two inches distance a pretty hard stroke so as to make ones knuckle ache let a person standing on the floor present the point of a needle at twelve or more inches distance form it and while the needle is so presented the conductor cannot be charged the point drawing off the fire as fast as it is thrown on by the electrical globe let it be charged and then present the point at the same distance and it will suddenly be discharged in the dark you may see the light on the point when the experiment is made and if the person holding the point stands upon wax he will be electrified by receiving the fire at that distance attempt to draw off the electricity with a blunt body as a bolt of iron round at the end and smooth a silversmiths iron punch inch thick is what i use and you must bring it within the distance of three inches before you can do it and then it is done with a stroke and crack as the pasteboard tube hangs loose on silk lines when you approach it with the punchiron it likewise will move towards the punch being attracted while it is charged but if at the same instant a point be presented as before it retires again for the point discharges it take a pair of large brass scales of two or more feet beam the cords of the scales being silk suspend the beam     by a packthread from the ceiling so that the bottom of the scales may be about a foot from the floor the scales will move round in a circle by the untwisting of the packthread set the iron punch on the end upon the floor in such a place as that the scales may pass over it in making their circle then electrify one scale by applying the wire of a charged phial to it as they move round you see that scale draw nigher to the floor and dip more when it comes over the punch and if that be placed at a proper distance the scale will snap and discharge its fire into it but if a needle be stuck on the end of the punch its point upward the scale instead of drawing nigh to the punch and snapping discharges its fire silently through the point and rises higher from the punch nay even if the needle be placed upon the floor near the punch its point upwards the end of the punch though so much higher than the needle will not attract the scale and receive its fire for the needle will get it and convey it away before it comes nigh enough for the punch to act and this is constantly observable in these experiments that the greater quantity of electricity on the pasteboard tube the farther it strikes or discharges its fire and the point likewise will draw it off at a still greater distance now if the fire of electricity and that of lightning be the same as i have endeavoured to show at large in a former paper this pasteboard tube and these scales may represent electrified clouds if a tube of only ten feet long will strike and discharge its fire on the punch at two or three inches distance an     electrified cloud of perhaps ten thousand acres may strike and discharge on the earth at a proportionably greater distance the horizontal motion of the scales over the floor may represent the motion of the clouds over the earth and the erect iron punch a hill or high building and then we see how electrified clouds passing over hills or high buildings at too great a height to strike may be attracted lower till within their striking distance and lastly if a needle fixed on the punch with its point upright or even on the floor below the punch will draw the fire from the scale silently at a much greater than the striking distance and so prevent its descending towards the punch or if in its course it would have come nigh enough to strike yet being first deprived of its fire it cannot and the punch is thereby secured from the stroke i say if these things are so may not the knowledge of this power of points be of use to mankind in preserving houses churches ships c from the stroke of lightning by directing us to fix on the highest parts of those edifices upright rods of iron made sharp as a needle and gilt to prevent rusting and from the foot of those rods a wire down the outside of the building into the ground or down round one of the shrouds of a ship and down her side till it reaches the water would not these pointed rods probably draw the electrical fire silently out of a cloud before it came nigh enough to strike and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible mischief    to determine the question whether the clouds that contain lightning are electrified or not i would     propose an experiment to be tried where it may be done conveniently on the top of some high tower or steeple place a kind of sentrybox as in plate i fig   big enough to contain a man and an electrical stand from the middle of the stand let an iron rod rise and pass bending out of the door and then upright twenty or thirty feet pointed very sharp at the end if the electrical stand be kept clean and dry a man standing on it when such clouds are passing low might be electrified and afford sparks the rod drawing fire to him from a cloud if any danger to the man should be apprehended though i think there would be none let him stand on the floor of his box and now and then bring near to the rod the loop of a wire that has one end fastened to the leads he holding it by a wax handle so the sparks if the rod is electrified will strike from the rod to the wire and not affect him    before i leave this subject of lightning i may mention some other similarities between the effects of that and those of electricity lightning has often been known to strike people blind a pigeon that we struck dead to appearance by the electrical shock recovering life drooped about the yard several days ate nothing though crumbs were thrown to it but declined and died we did not think of its being deprived of sight but afterwards a pullet struck dead in like manner being recovered by repeatedly blowing into its lungs when set down on the floor ran headlong against the wall and on examination appeared perfectly blind hence we concluded that the pigeon also had been absolutely  00 blinded by the shock the biggest animal we have yet killed or tried to kill with the electrical stroke was a wellgrown pullet    reading in the ingenious dr miless account of the thunderstorm at stretham the effect of the lightning in stripping off all the paint that had covered a gilt moulding of a pannel of wainscot without hurting the rest of the paint i had a mind to lay a coat of paint over the filleting of gold on the cover of a book and try the effect of a strong electrical flash sent through that gold from a charged sheet of glass but having no paint at hand i pasted a narrow strip of paper over it and when dry sent the flash through the gilding by which the paper was torn off from end to end with such force that it was broken in several places and in others brought away part of the grain of the turkeyleather in which it was bound and convinced me that had it been painted the paint would have been stripped off in the same manner with that on the wainscot at stretham    lightning melts metals and i hinted in my paper on that subject that i suspected it to be a cold fusion i do not mean a fusion by force of cold but a fusion without heat we have also melted gold silver and copper in small quantities by the electrical flash the manner is this take leafgold leafsilver or leafgilt copper commonly called leafbrass or dutch gold cut off from the leaf long narrow strips the breadth of a straw place one of these strips between two strips of smooth glass that are about the width of your finger if one strip of  0  gold the length of the leaf be not long enough for the glass add another to the end of it so that you may have a little part hanging out loose at each end of the glass bind the pieces of glass together from end to end with strong silk thread then place it so as to be part of an electrical circuit the ends of gold hanging out being of use to join with the other parts of the circuit and send the flash through it from a large electrified jar or sheet of glass then if your strips of glass remain whole you will see that the gold is missing in several places and instead of it a metallic stain on both the glasses the stains on the upper and under glass exactly similar in the minutest stroke as may be seen by holding them to the light the metal appeared to have been not only melted but even vitrified or otherwise so driven into the pores of the glass as to be protected by it from the action of the strongest aqua fortis or aqua regia i send you enclosed two little pieces of glass with these metallic stains upon them which cannot be removed without taking part of the glass with them sometimes the stain spreads a little wider than the breadth of the leaf and looks brighter at the edge as by inspecting closely you may observe in these sometimes the glass breaks to pieces once the upper glass broke into a thousand pieces looking like coarse salt the pieces i send you were stained with dutch gold true gold makes a darker stain somewhat reddish silver a greenish stain we once took two pieces of thick lookingglass as broad as a gunters scale and six inches long and placing goldleaf between them put them between two  0  smoothlyplained pieces of wood and fixed them tight in a bookbinders small press yet though they were so closely confined the force of the electrical shock shivered the glass into many pieces the gold was melted and stained into the glass as usual the circumstances of the breaking of the glass differ much in making the experiment and sometimes it does not break at all but this is constant that the stains in the upper and under pieces are exact counterparts of each other and though i have taken up the pieces of glass between my fingers immediately after this melting i never could perceive the least warmth in them    in one of my former papers i mentioned that gilding on a book though at first it communicated the shock perfectly well yet failed after a few experiments which we could not account for we have since found that one strong shock breaks the continuity of the gold in the filleting and makes it look rather like dust of gold abundance of its parts being broken and driven off and it will seldom conduct above one strong shock perhaps this may be the reason when there is not a perfect continuity in the circuit the fire must leap over the vacancies there is a certain distance which it is able to leap over according to its strength if a number of small vacancies though each be very minute taken together exceed that distance it cannot leap over them and so the shock is prevented    from the beforementioned law of electricity that points as they are more or less acute draw on and throw off the electrical fluid with more  0  or less power and at greater or less distances and in larger or smaller quantities in the same time we may see how to account for the situation of the leaf of gold suspended between two plates the upper one continually electrified the under one in a persons hand standing on the floor when the upper plate is electrified the leaf is attracted and raised towards it and would fly to that plate were it not for its own points the corner that happens to be uppermost when the leaf is rising being a sharp point from the extreme thinness of the gold draws and receives at a distance a sufficient quantity of the electric fluid to give itself an electric atmosphere by which its progress to the upper plate is stopped and it begins to be repelled from that plate and would be driven back to the under plate but that its lowest corner is likewise a point and throws off or discharges the overplus of the leafs atmosphere as fast as the upper corner draws it on were these two points perfectly equal in acuteness the leaf would take place exactly in the middle space for its weight is a trifle compared to the power acting on it but it is generally nearest the unelectrified plate because when the leaf is offered to the electrified plate at a distance the sharpest point is commonly first affected and raised towards it so that point from its greater acuteness receiving the fluid faster than its opposite can discharge it at equal distances it retires from the electrified plate and draws nearer to the unelectrified plate till it comes to a distance where the discharge can be exactly equal to the receipt the latter being lessened and the former  0  increased and there it remains as long as the globe continues to supply fresh electrical matter this will appear plain when the difference of acuteness in the corners is made very great cut a piece of dutch gold which is fittest for these experiments on account of its great strength into the form of figure  0 the upper corner a right angle the two next obtuse angles and the lowest a very acute one and bring this on your plate under the electrified plate in such a manner as that the rightangled part may be first raised which is done by covering the acute part with the hollow of your hand and you will see this leaf take place much nearer to the upper than the under plate because without being nearer it cannot receive so fast at its rightangled point as it can discharge at its acute one turn this leaf with the acute part uppermost and then it takes place nearest the unelectrified plate because otherwise it receives faster at its acute point than it can discharge at its rightangled one thus the difference of distance is always proportioned to the difference of acuteness take care in cutting your leaf to leave no little ragged particles on the edges which sometimes form points where you would not have them you may make this figure so acute below and blunt above as to need no under plate it discharging fast enough into the air when it is made narrower as the figure between the pricked lines we call it the golden fish from its manner of acting for if you take it by the tail and hold it at a foot or greater horizontal distance from the prime conductor it will when let go fly to it with a brisk  0  but wavering motion like that of an eel through the water it will then take place under the prime conductor at perhaps a quarter or half an inch distance and keep a continual shaking of the tail like a fish so that it seems animated turn its tail towards the prime conductor and then it flies to your finger and seems to nibble it and if you hold a plate under it at six or eight inches distance and cease turning the globe when the electrical atmosphere of the conductor grows small it will descend to the plate and swim back again several times with the same fishlike motion greatly to the entertainment of spectators by a little practice in blunting or sharpening the heads or tails of these figures you may make them take place as desired nearer or farther from the electrified plate    it is said in section eighth of this paper that all kinds of common matter are supposed not to attract the electrical fluid with equal strength and that those called electrics per se as glass c attract and retain it strongest and contain the greatest quantity this latter position may seem a paradox to some being contrary to the hitherto received opinion and therefore i shall now endeavour to explain it    in order to this let it first be considered that we cannot by any means we are yet acquainted with force the electrical fluid through glass i know it is commonly thought that it easily pervades glass and the experiment of a feather suspended by a thread in a bottle hermetically sealed yet moved by bringing a rubber tube near the outside of the  0  bottle is alleged to prove it but if the electrical fluid so easily pervades glass how does the phial become charged as we term it when we hold it in our hands would not the fire thrown in by the wire pass through to our hands and so escape into the floor would not the bottle in that case be left just as we found it uncharged as we know a metal bottle so attempted to be charged would be indeed if there be the least crack the minutest solution of continuity in the glass though it remains so tight that nothing else we know of will pass yet the extremely subtile electric fluid flies through such a crack with the greatest freedom and such a bottle we know can never be charged what then makes the difference between such a bottle and one that is sound but this that the fluid can pass through the one and not through the other     it is true there is an experiment that at first sight would be apt to satisfy a slight observer that the fire thrown into the bottle by the wire does really pass through the glass it is this place the bottle on a glass stand under the prime conductor suspend a bullet by a chain from the prime conductor till it comes within a quarter of an inch right over the wire of the bottle place your knuckle on the glass stand at just the same distance from the coating of the bottle as the bullet is from its wire now let the globe be turned and you see a spark strike from the bullet to the wire of the bottle and the same instant you see and feel an exactly equal spark striking from the coating on your knuckle and so on spark for  0  spark this looks as if the whole received by the bottle was again discharged from it and yet the bottle by this means is charged  and therefore the fire that thus leaves the bottle though the same in quantity cannot be the very same fire that entered at the wire for if it were the bottle would remain uncharged  0 if the fire that so leaves the bottle be not the same that is thrown in through the wire it must be fire that subsisted in the bottle that is in the glass of the bottle before the operation began    if so there must be a great quantity in glass because a great quantity is thus discharged even from very thin glass    that this electrical fluid or fire is strongly attracted by glass we know from the quickness and violence with which it is resumed by the part that had been deprived of it when there is an opportunity and by this that we cannot from a mass of glass draw a quantity of electric fire or electrify the whole mass minus as we can a mass of metal we cannot lessen or increase its whole quantity for the quantity it has it holds and it has as much as it can hold its pores are filled with it as full as the mutual repellency of the particles will admit and what is already in refuses or strongly repels any additional quantity nor have we any way of moving the electrical fluid in glass but one that is by covering part of the two surfaces of thin glass with nonelectrics and then throwing an additional quantity of this fluid on one surface which spreading  0  in the nonelectric and being bound by it to that surface acts by its repelling force on the particles of the electrical fluid contained in the other surface and drives them out of the glass into the nonelectric on that side from whence they are discharged and then those added on the charged side can enter but when this is done there is no more in the glass nor less than before just as much having left it on one side as it received on the other    i feel a want of terms here and doubt much whether i shall be able to make this part intelligible by the word surface in this case i do not mean mere length and breadth without thickness but when i speak of the upper or under surface of a piece of glass the outer or inner surface of the phial i mean length breadth and half the thickness and beg the favor of being so understood now i suppose that glass in its first principles and in the furnace has no more of this electrical fluid than other common matter that when it is blown as it cools and the particles of common fire leave it its pores become a vacuum that the component parts of glass are extremely small and fine i guess from its never showing a rough face when it breaks but always a polish and from the smallness of its particles i suppose the pores between them must be exceedingly small which is the reason that aqua fortis nor any other menstruum we have can enter to separate them and dissolve the substance nor is any fluid we know of fine enough to enter except common fire and the electric fluid now the departing fire leaving a vacuum as aforesaid between these pores  0  which air nor water are fine enough to enter and fill the electric fluid which is everywhere ready in what we call the nonelectrics and in the nonelectric mixtures that are in the air is attracted in yet does not become fixed with the substance of the glass but subsists there as water in a porous stone retained only by the attraction of the fixed parts itself still loose and a fluid but i suppose farther that in the cooling of the glass its texture becomes closest in the middle and forms a kind of partition in which the pores are so narrow that the particles of the electrical fluid which enter both surfaces at the same time cannot go through or pass and repass from one surface to the other and so mix together yet though the particles of electric fluid imbibed by each surface cannot themselves pass through to those of the other their repellency can and by this means they act on one another the particles of the electric fluid have a mutual repellency but by the power of attraction in the glass they are condensed or forced near to each other when the glass has received and by its attraction forced closer together so much of this electric fluid as that the power of attracting and condensing in the one is equal to the power of expansion in the other it can imbibe no more and that remains its constant whole quantity but each surface would receive more if the repellency of what is in the opposite surface did not resist its entrance the quantities of this fluid in each surface being equal their repelling action on each other is equal and therefore those of one surface cannot drive out those   0 of the other but if a greater quantity is forced into one surface than the glass would naturally draw in this increases the repelling power on that side and overpowering the attraction on the other drives out part of the fluid that had been imbibed by that surface if there be any nonelectric ready to receive it such there is in all cases where glass is electrified to give a shock the surface that has been thus emptied by having its electrical fluid driven out resumes again an equal quantity with violence as soon as the glass has an opportunity to discharge that over quantity more than it could retain by attraction in its other surface by the additional repellency of which the vacuum had been occasioned for experiments favoring if i may not say confirming this hypothesis i must to avoid repetition beg leave to refer you back to what is said of the electrical phial in my former papers    let us now see how it will account for several other appearances glass a body extremely elastic and perhaps its elasticity may be owing in some degree to the subsisting of so great a quantity of this repelling fluid in its pores must when rubbed have its rubbed surface somewhat stretched or its solid parts drawn a little farther asunder so that the vacancies in which the electrical fluid resides become larger affording room for more of that fluid which is immediately attracted into it from the cushion or handrubbing they being supplied from the common stock but the instant the parts of the glass so opened and filled have passed the friction they close again and force the additional quantity     out upon the surface where it must rest till that part comes round to the cushion again unless some nonelectric as the prime conductor first presents to receive it  but if the inside of the globe be lined with a nonelectric the additional repellency of the electrical fluid thus collected by friction on the rubbed part of the globes outer surface drives an equal quantity out of the inner surface into that nonelectric lining which receiving it and carrying it away from the rubbed part into the common mass through the axis of the globe and frame of the machine the newcollected electrical fluid can enter and remain in the outer surface and none of it or a very little will be received by the prime conductor as this charged part of the globe comes round to the cushion again the outer surface delivers its overplus fire into the cushion the opposite inner surface receiving at the same time an equal quantity from the floor every electrician knows that a globe wet within will afford little or no fire but the reason has not before been attempted to be given that i know of    so if a tube lined with a nonelectric be rubbed  little or no fire is obtained from it what is collected from the hand in the downward rubbing stroke entering the pores of the glass and driving an     equal quantity out of the inner surface into the nonelectric lining and the hand in passing up to take a second stroke takes out again what had been thrown into the outer surface and then the inner surface receives back again what it had given to the nonelectric lining thus the particles of electrical fluid belonging to the inside surface go in and out of their pores every stroke given to the tube put a wire into the tube the inward end in contact with the nonelectric lining so it will represent the leyden bottle let a second person touch the wire while you rub and the fire driven out of the inward surface when you give the stroke will pass through him into the common mass and return through him when the inner surface resumes its quantity and therefore this new kind of leyden bottle cannot be so charged but thus it may after every stroke before you pass your hand up to make another let a second person apply his finger to the wire take the spark and then withdraw his finger and so on till he has drawn a number of sparks thus will the inner surface be exhausted and the outer surface charged then wrap a sheet of gilt paper close round the outer surface and grasping it in your hand you may receive a shock by applying the finger of the other hand to the wire for now the vacant pores in the inner surface resume their quantity and the overcharged pores in the outer surface discharge their overplus the equilibrium being restored through your body which could not be restored through the glass  if the tube be     exhausted of air a nonelectric lining in contact with the wire is not necessary for in vacuo the electrical fire will fly freely from the inner surface without a nonelectric conductor but air resists its motion for being itself an electric per se it does not attract it having already its quantity so the air never draws off an electric atmosphere from any body but in proportion to the nonelectrics mixed with it it rather keeps such an atmosphere confined which from the mutual repulsion of its particles tends to dissipation and would immediately dissipate in vacuo and thus the experiment of the feather enclosed in a glass vessel hermetically sealed but moving on the approach of the rubbed tube is explained when an additional quantity of the electrical fluid is applied to the side of the vessel by the atmosphere of the tube a quantity is repelled and driven out of the inner surface of that side into the vessel and there affects the feather returning again into its pores when the tube with its atmosphere is withdrawn not that the particles of that atmosphere did themselves pass through the glass to the feather and every other appearance i have yet seen in which glass and electricity are concerned are i think explained with equal ease by the same hypothesis yet perhaps it may not be a true one and i shall be obliged to him that affords me a better    thus i take the difference between nonelectrics and glass an electric per se to consist in these two particulars  st that a nonelectric easily suffers a change in the quantity of the electric fluid it contains you may lessen its whole quantity by     drawing out a part which the whole body will again resume but of glass you can only lessen the quantity contained in one of its surfaces and not that but by supplying an equal quantity at the same time to the other surface so that the whole glass may always have the same quantity in the two surfaces their two different quantities being added together and this can only be done in glass that is thin beyond a certain thickness we have yet no power that can make this change and  dly that the electric fire freely moves from place to place in and through the substance of a nonelectric but not so through the substance of glass if you offer a quantity to one end of a long rod of metal it receives it and when it enters every particle that was before in the rod pushes its neighbour quite to the farther end where the overplus is discharged and this instantaneously where the rod is part of the circle in the experiment of the shock but glass from the smallness of its pores or stronger attraction of what it contains refuses to admit so free a motion a glass rod will not conduct a shock nor will the thinnest glass suffer any particle entering one of its surfaces to pass through to the other    hence we see the impossibility of success in the experiments proposed to draw out the effluvial virtues of a nonelectric as cinnamon for instance and mixing them with the electric fluid to convey them with that into the body by including it in the globe and then applying friction c for though the effluvia of cinnamon and the electric fluid should mix within the globe they would never come out     together through the pores of the glass and so go to the prime conductor for the electric fluid itself cannot come through and the prime conductor is always supplied from the cushion and that from the floor and besides when the globe is filled with cinnamon or other nonelectric no electric fluid can be obtained from its outer surface for the reason before mentioned i have tried another way which i thought more likely to obtain a mixture of the electric and other effluvia together if such a mixture had been possible i placed a glass plate under my cushion to cut off the communication between the cushion and the floor then brought a small chain from the cushion into a glass of oil of turpentine and carried another chain from the oil of turpentine to the floor taking care that the chain from the cushion to the glass should touch no part of the frame of the machine another chain was fixed to the prime conductor and held in the hand of a person to be electrified the ends of the two chains in the glass were near an inch distant from each other the oil of turpentine between now the globe being turned could draw no fire from the floor through the machine the communication that way being cut off by the thick glass plate under the cushion it must then draw it through the chains whose ends were dipped in the oil of turpentine and as the oil of turpentine being an electric per se would not conduct what came up from the floor was obliged to jump from the end of one chain to the end of the other through the substance of that oil which we could see in large sparks and so it had a fair opportunity     of seizing some of the finest particles of the oil in its passage and carrying them off with it but no such effect followed nor could i perceive the least difference in the smell of the electric effluvia thus collected from what it has when collected otherwise nor does it otherwise affect the body of a person electrized i likewise put into a phial instead of water a strong purgative liquid and then charged the phial and took repeated shocks from it in which case every particle of the electrical fluid must before it went through my body have first gone through the liquid when the phial is charging and returned through it when discharging yet no other effect followed than if it had been charged with water i have also smelled the electric fire when drawn through gold silver copper lead iron wood and the human body and could perceive no difference the odor is always the same where the spark does not burn what it strikes and therefore i imagine it does not take that smell from any quality of the bodies it passes through and indeed as that smell so readily leaves the electric matter and adheres to the knuckle receiving the sparks and to other things i suspect that it never was connected with it but arises instantaneously from something in the air acted upon by it for if it was fine enough to come with the electric fluid through the body of one person why should it stop on the skin of another but i shall never have done if i tell you all my conjectures thoughts and imaginations on the nature and operations of this electric fluid and relate     the variety of little experiments we have tried i have already made this paper too long for which i must crave pardon not having now time to abridge it i shall only add that as it has been observed here that spirits will fire by the electric spark in the summertime without heating them when fahrenheits thermometer is above seventy so when colder if the operator puts a small flat bottle of spirits in his bosom or a close pocket with the spoon some little time before he uses them the heat of his body will communicate warmth more than sufficient for the purpose additional experiments proving that the leyden bottle has no more electrical fire in it when charged than before nor less when discharged that in discharging the fire does not issue from the wire and the coating at the same time as some have thought but that the coating always receives what is discharged by the wire or an equal quantity the outer surface being always in a negative state of electricity when the inner surface is in a positive state place a thick plate of glass under the rubbing cushion to cut off the communication of electrical fire from the floor to the cushion then if there be no fine points or hairy threads sticking out from the cushion or from the parts of the machine opposite to the cushion of which you must be careful you can     get but a few sparks from the prime conductor which are all the cushion will part with hang a phial then on the prime conductor and it will not charge though you hold it by the coating but— form a communication by a chain from the coating to the cushion and the phial will charge for the globe then draws the electric fire out of the outside surface of the phial and forces it through the prime conductor and wire of the phial into the inside surface thus the bottle is charged with its own fire no other being to be had while the glass plate is under the cushion hang two cork balls by flaxen threads to the prime conductor then touch the coating of the bottle and they will be electrified and recede from each other for just as much fire as you give the coating so much is discharged through the wire upon the prime conductor whence the cork balls receive an electrical atmosphere but— take a wire bent in the form of a c with a stick of wax fixed to the outside of the curve to hold it by and apply one end of this wire to the coating and the other at the same time to the prime conductor the phial will be discharged and if the balls are not electrified before the discharge neither will they appear to be so after the discharge for they will not repel each other if the phial really exploded at both ends and discharged fire from both coating and wire the balls would be more electrified and recede farther     for none of the fire can escape the wax handle preventing but if the fire with which the inside surface is surcharged be so much precisely as is wanted by the outside surface it will pass round through the wire fixed to the wax handle restore the equilibrium in the glass and make no alteration in the state of the prime conductor accordingly we find that if the prime conductor be electrified and the cork balls in a state of repellency before the bottle is discharged they continue so afterwards if not they are not electrified by that discharge benjamin franklin    august    0 philadelphia samuel johnson lxxiii to samuel johnson  philadelphia    august    0 dear sir— we received your favor of the   th instant mr peters will hardly have time to write to you by this post and i must be short mr francis spent the last evening with me and we were all glad to hear that you seriously meditate a visit after the middle of next month and that you will inform us by a line when to expect you we drank your health and mrs johnsons remembering your kind entertainment of us at stratford   0 i think with you that nothing is of more importance for the public weal than to form and train up youth in wisdom and virtue wise and good men are in my opinion the strength of a state much more so than riches or arms which under the management of ignorance and wickedness often draw on destruction instead of providing for the safety of the people and though the culture bestowed on many should be successful only with a few yet the influence of those few and the service in their power may be very great even a single woman that was wise by her wisdom saved the city i think also that general virtue is more probably to be expected and obtained from the education of youth than from the exhortation of adult persons bad habits and vices of the mind being like diseases of the body more easily prevented than cured i think moreover that talents for the education of youth are the gift of god and that he on whom they are bestowed whenever a way is opened for the use of them is as strongly called as if he heard a voice from heaven nothing more surely pointing out duty in a public service than ability and opportunity of performing it i have not yet discoursed with dr jenney concerning your removal hither you have reason i own to doubt whether your coming on the foot i proposed would not be disagreeable to him though i think it ought not for should his particular interest be somewhat affected by it that ought not to stand in competition with the general good especially as it cannot be much affected he being old and rich and     without children i will however learn his sentiments before the next post but whatever influence they might have on your determination about removing they need have none on your intention of visiting and if you favor us with the visit it is not necessary that you should previously write to him to learn his disposition about your removal since you will see him and when we are all together those things may be better settled in conversation than by letters at a distance your tenderness of the churchs peace is truly laudable but methinks to build a new church in a growing place is not properly dividing but multiplying and will really be the means of increasing the number of those who worship god in that way many who cannot now be accommodated in the church go to other places or stay at home and if we had another church many who go to other places or stay at home would go to church i suppose the interest of the church has been far from suffering in boston by the building of two churches there in my memory i had for several years nailed against the wall of my house a pigeonbox that would hold six pair and though they bred as fast as my neighbours pigeons i never had more than six pair the old and strong driving out the young and weak and obliging them to seek new habitations at length i put up an additional box with apartments for entertaining twelve pair more and it was soon filled with inhabitants by the overflowing of my first box and of others in the neighbourhood this i take to be a parallel case with the building a new church here     your years i think are not so many as to be an objection of any weight especially considering the vigor of your constitution for the smallpox if it should spread here you might inoculate with great probability and safety and i think that distemper generally more favorable here than farther northward your objection about the politeness of philadelphia and your imagined rusticity is mere compliment and your diffidence of yourself absolutely groundless my humble respects if you please to your brethren at the commencement i hope they will advise you to what is most for the good of the whole and then i think they will advise you to remove hither please to tender my best respects and service to mrs johnson and your son i am dear sir your obliged and affectionate humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    october    0 philadelphia james bowdoin lxxiv to james bowdoin  at boston philadelphia    october    0 sir— enclosed with this i send you all my electrical papers fairly transcribed and i have as you desired examined the copy and find it correct i shall be glad to have your observations on them and if in any part i have not made myself well understood     i will on notice endeavour to explain the obscure passages by letter my compliments to mr cooper and the other gentlemen who were with you here i hope you all got safe home i am sir your most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    october    0 philadelphia jared eliot lxxv to jared eliot philadelphia    october    0 dear sir— i ought to have informed you sooner that we got well home and should have inquired after your health as we left you in the hands of a fever i beg you will excuse the delay and desire you will remember in my favor the old saying they who have much business must have much pardon whenever mr francis and i meet of an evening we drink your health among our other new england friends and he desires to be always respectfully remembered to you i am glad to hear you are got well again but i cannot have the pleasure of seeing you again this year i will write to colonel schuyler and obtain for you a particular account of his manner of improving his banked grounds and will also procure for you a specimen of our alum earth with mr syngs observations on it in return for you know there is no trade without returns i request you to procure for me a particular account of the manner of making a new kind of fence we saw at southhold on long island which consists of a bank and hedge i would     know every particular relating to the matter as the best thickness height and slope of the bank the manner of erecting it the best time for the work the best way of planting the hedge the price of the work to laborers per rod or perch and whatever may be of use for our information here who begin in many places to be at a loss for wood to make fence with we were told at southhold that this kind of fencing had been long practised with success at southampton and other places on the south side of the island but was new among them i hear the minister at southhold is esteemed an ingenious man perhaps you may know him and he will at your request favor me with an explicit account of these fences the fore part of the summer here was extremely dry and the grass in many places was burnt up but we had a good crop of wheat and rains coming on about the end of july we had in august a new spring the grass sprouting again wonderfully thick and fast in fields where we thought the very roots had been destroyed our gravediggers said they found the earth hot sensibly at three feet depth even after these rains perhaps the great heat below and the moisture above occasioned this sudden and profuse vegetation the whole country being as it were one great hotbed i am with esteem and affection dear sir your obliged humble servant b franklin     benjamin franklin    december    0 philadelphia lxxvi to a friend in boston  philadelphia    december    0 i have lately made an experiment in electricity that i desire never to repeat two nights ago being about to kill a turkey by the shock from two large glass jars containing as much electrical fire as forty common phials i inadvertently took the whole through my own arms and body by receiving the fire from the united top wires with one hand while the other held a chain connected with the outsides of both jars the company present whose talking to me and to one another i suppose occasioned my inattention to what i was about say that the flash was very great and the crack as loud as a pistol yet my senses being instantly gone i neither saw the one nor heard the other nor did i feel the stroke on my hand though i afterwards found it raised a round swelling where the fire entered as big as half a pistolbullet by which you may judge of the quickness of the electrical fire which by this instance seems to be greater than that of sound light or animal sensation what i can remember of the matter is that i was about to try whether the bottles or jars were fully charged by the strength and length of the stream issuing to my hand as i commonly used to do and which i might safely enough have done if i had not     held the chain in the other hand i then felt what i know not how well to describe—a universal blow throughout my whole body from head to foot which seemed within as well as without after which the first thing i took notice of was a violent quick shaking of my body which gradually remitting my sense as gradually returned and then i thought the bottles must be discharged but could not conceive how till at last i perceived the chain in my hand and recollected what i had been about to do that part of my hand and fingers which held the chain was left white as though the blood had been driven out and remained so eight or ten minutes after feeling like dead flesh and i had a numbness in my arms and the back of my neck which continued till the next morning but wore off nothing remains now of this shock but a soreness in my breastbone which feels as if it had been bruised i did not fall but suppose i should have been knocked down if i had received the stroke in my head the whole was over in less than a minute you may communicate this to mr bowdoin as a caution to him but do not make it more public for i am ashamed to have been guilty of so notorious a blunder a match for that of the irishman whom my sister told me of who to divert his wife poured the bottle of gunpowder on the live coal or of that other who being about to steal powder made a hole in the cask with a hot iron i am yours c b franklin p s—the jars hold six gallons each     benjamin franklin      philadelphia cadwallader colden lxxvii to cadwallader colden at new york philadelphia ——      sir— i enclose you answers such as my present hurry of business will permit me to make to the principal queries contained in yours of the   th instant and beg leave to refer you to the latter piece in the printed collection of my papers for further explanation of the difference between what are called electrics per se and nonelectrics when you have time to read and consider these papers i will endeavour to make any new experiments you shall propose that you think may afford farther light or satisfaction to either of us and shall be much obliged to you for such remarks objections c as may occur to you i forget whether i wrote to you that i have melted brass pins and steel needles inverted the poles of the magnetic needle given a magnetism and polarity to needles that had none and fired dry gunpowder by the electric spark i have five bottles that contain eight or nine gallons each two of which charged are sufficient for those purposes but i can charge and discharge them altogether there are no bounds but what expense and labor give to the force man may raise and use in the electrical way for bottle may be added to bottle ad infinitum and all united and discharged together as one the force and effect proportioned to their number and size the greatest known effects of common lightning may i think without much difficulty be exceeded in this     way which a few years since could not have been believed and even now may seem to many a little extravagant to suppose so we are got beyond the skill of rabelaiss devils of two years old who he humorously says had only learned to thunder and lighten a little round the head of a cabbage i am with sincere respect your most obliged humble servant b franklin queries and answers referred to in the foregoing letter query wherein consists the difference between an electric and a nonelectric body answer the terms electric per se and nonelectric were first used to distinguish bodies on a mistaken supposition that those called electrics per se alone contained electric matter in their substance which was capable of being excited by friction and of being produced or drawn from them and communicated to those called nonelectrics supposed to be destitute of it for the glass c being rubbed discovered signs of having it by snapping to the finger attracting repelling c and could communicate those signs to metals and water afterwards it was found that rubbing of glass would not produce the electric matter unless a communication was preserved between the rubber and the floor and subsequent experiments proved that the electric matter was really drawn from those bodies that at first were thought to     have none in them then it was doubted whether glass and other bodies called electrics per se had really any electric matter in them since they apparently afforded none but what they first extracted from those which had been called nonelectrics but some of my experiments show that glass contains it in great quantity and i now suspect it to be pretty equally diffused in all the matter of this terraqueous globe if so the terms electric per se and nonelectric should be laid aside as improper and the only difference being this that some bodies will conduct electric matter and others will not the terms conductor and nonconductor may supply their place if any portion of electric matter is applied to a piece of conducting matter it penetrates and flows through it or spreads equally on its surafce if applied to a piece of nonconducting matter it will do neither perfect conductors of electric matter are only metals and water other bodies conducting only as they contain a mixture of those without more or less of which they will not conduct at all  this by the way shows a new relation between metals and water heretofore unknown to illustrate this by a comparison which however can only give a faint resemblance electric matter passes through conductors as water passes through a porous stone or spreads on their surfaces as water spreads on a wet stone but when applied to nonconductors it is like water dropped on a greasy stone it neither penetrates passes through nor spreads on   0 the surface but remains in drops where it falls see farther on this head in my last printed piece entitled opinions and conjectures c      query what are the effects of air in electrical experiments answer all i have hitherto observed are these moist air receives and conducts the electrical matter in proportion to its moisture quite dry air not at all air is therefore to be classed with the nonconductors dry air assists in confining the electrical atmosphere to the body it surrounds and prevents its dissipating for in vacuo it quits easily and points operate stronger—that is they throw off or attract the electrical matter more freely and at greater distances so that air intervening obstructs its passage from body to body in some degree a clean electrical phial and wire containing air instead of water will not be charged nor give a shock any more than if it was filled with powder of glass but exhausted of air it operates as well as if filled with water yet an electric atmosphere and air do not seem to exclude each other for we breathe freely in such an atmosphere and dry air will blow through it without displacing or driving it away i question whether the strongest dry northwester would dissipate it i once electrified a large cork ball at the end of a silk thread three feet long the other end of which i held in my fingers and whirled it round like a sling one hundred times in the air with the swiftest motion i could possibly give it yet it retained its electric atmosphere though it must have passed through eight hundred yards of air allowing my arm in giving     the motion to add a foot to the semidiameter of the circle by quite dry air i mean the dryest we have for perhaps we never have any perfectly free from moisture an electrical atmosphere raised round a thick wire inserted in a phial of air drives out none of the air nor on withdrawing that atmosphere will any air rush in as i have found by a curious experiment  accurately made whence we concluded that the airs elasticity was not affected thereby an experiment towards discovering more of the qualities of the electric fluid from the prime conductor hang a bullet by a wire hook under the bullet at half an inch distance place a bright piece of silver to receive the sparks then let the wheel be turned and in a few minutes if the repeated sparks continually strike in the same spot     the silver will receive a blue stain nearly the color of a watchspring a bright piece of iron will also be spotted but not with that color it rather seems corroded on gold brass or tin i have not perceived it makes any impression but the spots on the silver or iron will be the same whether the bullet be lead brass gold or silver on a silver bullet there will also appear a small spot as well as on the plate below it benjamin franklin march  0      philadelphia james parker lxxviii importance of gaining and preserving the friendship of the indians  the author of the foregoing essay having desired the printer to communicate the manuscript to some of the most judicious of his friends it produced the following letter from one of them the publishing whereof we think needs no other apology viz philadelphia march  0      dear mr parker i have as you desire read the manuscript you sent me and am of opinion with the publickspirited author that securing the friendship of the indians is of     the greatest consequence to these colonies and that the surest means of doing it are to regulate the indian trade so as to convince them by experience that they may have the best and cheapest goods and the fairest dealings from the english and to unite the several governments so as to form a strength that the indians may depend on for protection in case of a rupture with the french or apprehend great danger from if they should break with us this union of the colonies however necessary i apprehend is not to be brought about by the means that have hitherto been used for that purpose a governor of one colony who happens from some circumstances in his own government to see the necessity of such an union writes his sentiments of the matter to the other governors and desires them to recommend it to their respective assemblies they accordingly lay the letters before those assemblies and perhaps recommend the proposal in general words but governors are often on ill terms with their assemblies and seldom are the men that have the most influence among them and perhaps some governors though they openly recommend the scheme may privately throw cold water on it as     thinking additional publick charges will make their people less able or less willing to give to them or perhaps they do not clearly see the necessity of it and therefore do not very earnestly press the consideration of it and no one being present that has the affair at heart to back it to answer and remove objections c it is easily droppd and nothing is done such an union is certainly necessary to us all but more immediately so to our government now if you were to pick out half a dozen men of good understanding and address and furnish them with a reasonable scheme and proper instructions and send them in the nature of ambassadors to the other colonies where they might apply particularly to all the leading men and by proper management get them to engage in promoting the scheme where by being present they would have the opportunity of pressing the affair both in publick and private obviating difficulties as they arise answering objections as soon as they are made before they spread and gather strength in the minds of the people c c i imagine such an union might thereby be made and established for reasonable sensible men can always make a reasonable scheme appear such to other reasonable men if they take pains and have time and opportunity for it unless from some circumstances their honesty and good intentions are suspected a voluntary union entered into by the colonies themselves i think would be preferable to one imposed by parliament for it would be perhaps not much more difficult to procure and more easy to alter and improve as circumstances should require and experience     direct it would be a very strange thing if six nations of ignorant savages should be capable of forming a scheme for such an union and be able to execute it in such a manner as that it has subsisted ages and appears indissoluble and yet that a like union should be impracticable for ten or a dozen english colonies to whom it is more necessary and must be more advantageous and who cannot be supposed to want an equal understanding of their interests were there a general council formd by all the colonies and a general governor appointed by the crown to preside in that council or in some manner to concur with and confirm their acts and take care of the execution every thing relating to indian affairs and the defence of the colonies might be properly put under their management each colony should be represented by as many members as it pays sums of hundred pounds in the common treasury for the common expence which treasury would perhaps be best and most equitably supplyd by an equal excise on strong liquors in all the colonies the produce never to be applyd to the private use of any colony but to the general service perhaps if the council were to meet successively at the capitals of the several colonies they might thereby become better acquainted with the circumstances interests strength or weakness c of all and thence be able to judge better of measures proposed from time to time at least it might be more satisfactory to the colonies if this were proposed as a part of the scheme for a preference might create jealousy and dislike     i believe the place mentioned is a very suitable one to build a fort on in times of peace parties of the garrisons of all frontier forts might be allowed to go out on hunting expeditions with or without indians and have the profit to themselves of the skins they got by this means a number of woodrunners would be formed well acquainted with the country and of great use in the war time as guides of parties and scouts c every indian is a hunter and as their manner of making war viz by skulking surprising and killing particular persons and families is just the same as their hunting only changing the object every indian is a disciplined soldier soldiers of this kind are always wanted in the colonies in an indian war for the european military discipline is of little use in these woods publick trading houses would certainly have a good effect towards regulating the private trade and preventing the impositions of the private traders and therefore such should be established in suitable places all along the frontiers and the superintendent of the trade proposed by the author would i think be a useful officer the observation concerning the importation of germans in too great numbers into pennsylvania is i believe a very just one this will in a few years become a german colony instead of their learning our language we must learn theirs or live as in a foreign country already the english begin to quit particular neighborhoods surrounded by dutch being made uneasy by the disagreeableness of disonant manners and in time numbers will probably     quit the province for the same reason besides the dutch underlive and are thereby enabled to underwork and undersell the english who are thereby extremely incommoded and consequently disgusted so that there can be no cordial affection or unity between the two nations how good subjects they may make and how faithful to the british interest is a question worth considering and in my opinion equal numbers might have been spared from the british islands without being missed there and on proper encouragement would have come over i say without being missed perhaps i might say without lessening the number of people at home i question indeed whether there be a man the less in britain for the establishment of the colonies an island can support but a certain number of people when all employments are full multitudes refrain from marriage till they can see how to maintain a family the number of englishmen in england cannot by their present common increase be doubled in a thousand years but if half of them were taken away and planted in america where there is room for them to increase and sufficient employment and subsistence the number of englishmen would be doubled in a hundred years for those left at home would multiply in that time so as to fill up the vacancy and those here would at least keep pace with them every one must approve the proposal of encouraging a number of sober discreet smiths to reside among the indians they would doubtless be of great service the whole subsistence of indians     depends on keeping their guns in order and if they are obliged to make a journey of two or three hundred miles to an english settlement to get a lock mended it may besides the trouble occasion the loss of their hunting season they are people that think much of their temporal but little of their spiritual interests and therefore as he would be a most useful and necessary man to them a smith is more likely to influence them than a jesuit provided he has a good common understanding and is from time to time well instructed i wish i could offer any thing for the improvement of the authors piece but i have little knowledge and less experience in these matters i think it ought to be printed and should be glad to see there were a more general communication of the sentiments of judicious men on subjects so generally interesting it would certainly produce good effects please to present my respects to the gentleman and thank him for the perusal of the manuscript i am yours affectionately lxxix observations concerning the increase of mankind and the peopling of countries   tables of the proportion of marriages to births of deaths to births of marriages to the number     of inhabitants c formed on observations made upon the bills of mortality christenings c of populous cities will not suit countries nor will tables formed on observations made on fullsettled old countries as europe suit new countries as america    for people increase in proportion to the number of marriages and that is greater in proportion to the ease and convenience of supporting a family when families can be easily supported more persons marry and earlier in life   in cities where all trades occupations and offices are full many delay marrying till they can see how to bear the charges of a family which charges are greater in cities as luxury is more common many live single during life and continue servants to families journeymen to trades hence cities do not by natural generation supply themselves with inhabitants the deaths are more than the births   in countries full settled the case must be nearly the same all lands being occupied and improved to the height those who cannot get land must labor for others that have it when laborers are plenty their wages will be low by low wages a family is supported with difficulty this difficulty deters many from marriage who therefore long continue servants and single only as the cities take   0 supplies of people from the country and thereby make a little more room in the country marriage is a little more encouraged there and the births exceed the deaths   europe is generally full settled with husbandmen manufacturers c and therefore cannot now much increase in people america is chiefly occupied by indians who subsist mostly by hunting the hunter of all men requires the greatest quantity of land from whence to draw his subsistence the husbandman subsisting on much less the gardener on still less and the manufacturer requiring least of all the europeans found america as fully settled as it well could be by hunters yet these having large tracts were easily prevailed on to part with portions of territory to the new comers who did not much interfere with the natives in hunting and furnished them with many things they wanted   land being thus plenty in america and so cheap as that a laboring man that understands husbandry can in a short time save money enough to purchase a piece of new land sufficient for a plantation whereon he may subsist a family such are not afraid to marry for if they even look far enough forward to consider how their children when grown up are to be provided for they see that more land is to be had at rates equally easy all circumstances considered   hence marriages in america are more general and more generally early than in europe and if it is reckoned there that there is but one marriage     per annum among one hundred persons perhaps we may here reckon two and if in europe they have but four births to a marriage many of their marriages being late we may here reckon eight of which if one half grow up and our marriages are made reckoning one with another at twenty years of age our people must at least be doubled every twenty years   but notwithstanding this increase so vast is the territory of north america that it will require many ages to settle it fully and till it is fully settled labor will never be cheap here where no man continues long a laborer for others but gets a plantation of his own no man continues long a journeyman to a trade but goes among those new settlers and sets up for himself c hence labor is no cheaper now in pennsylvania than it was thirty years ago though so many thousand laboring people have been imported   the danger therefore of these colonies interfering with their mother country in trades that depend on labor manufactures c is too remote to require the attention of great britain  0 but in proportion to the increase of the colonies a vast demand is growing for british manufactures a glorious market wholly in the power of britain in which foreigners cannot interfere which will increase in a short time even beyond her power of supplying though her whole trade should be to her colonies therefore britain should not too much restrain manufactures in her colonies a wise and good mother will not do it to distress is to weaken     and weakening the children weakens the whole family    besides if the manufactures of britain by reason of the american demands should rise too high in price foreigners who can sell cheaper will drive her merchants out of foreign markets foreign manufactures will thereby be encouraged and increased and consequently foreign nations perhaps her rivals in power grow more populous and more powerful while her own colonies kept too low are unable to assist her or add to her strength    it is an illgrounded opinion that by the labor of slaves america may possibly vie in cheapness of manufactures with britain the labor of slaves can never be so cheap here as the labor of workingmen is in britain any one may compute it interest of money is in the colonies from six to ten per cent slaves one with another cost thirty pounds sterling per head reckon then the interest of the first purchase of a slave the insurance or risk on his life his clothing and diet expenses in his sickness and loss of time loss by his neglect of business neglect is natural to the man who is not to be benefited by his own care or diligence expense of a driver to keep him at work and his pilfering from time to time almost every slave being by nature a thief and compare the whole amount with the wages of a manufacturer of iron or wool in england you will see that labor is much cheaper there than it ever can be by negroes here why then will americans purchase slaves because slaves may be kept as long as a man pleases or has occasion for their     labor while hired men are continually leaving their masters often in the midst of his business and setting up for themselves sec      as the increase of people depends on the encouragement of marriages the following things must diminish a nation viz   the being conquered for the conquerors will engross as many offices and exact as much tribute or profit on the labor of the conquered as will maintain them in their new establishment and this diminishing the subsistence of the natives discourages their marriages and so gradually diminishes them while the foreigners increase   loss of territory thus the britons being driven into wales and crowded together in a barren country insufficient to support such great numbers diminished till the people bore a proportion to the produce while the saxons increased on their abandoned lands till the island became full of english and were the english now driven into wales by some foreign nation there would in a few years be no more englishmen in britain than there are now people in wales   loss of trade manufactures exported draw subsistence from foreign countries for numbers who are thereby enabled to marry and raise families if the nation be deprived of any branch of trade and no new employment is found for the people occupied in that branch it will also be soon deprived of so many people   loss of food suppose a nation has a fishery which not only employs great numbers but makes the food and subsistence of the people cheaper if another nation becomes master of the seas and prevents the     fishery the people will diminish in proportion as the loss of employ and dearness of provision make it more difficult to subsist a family   bad government and insecurity of property people not only leave such a country and settling abroad incorporate with other nations lose their native language and become foreigners but the industry of those that remain being discouraged the quantity of subsistence in the country is lessened and the support of a family becomes more difficult so heavy taxes tend to diminish a people   the introduction of slaves the negroes brought into the english sugar islands have greatly diminished the whites there the poor are by this means deprived of employment while a few families acquire vast estates which they spend on foreign luxuries and in educating their children in the habit of those luxuries the same income is needed for the support of one that might have maintained one hundred the whites who have slaves not laboring are enfeebled and therefore not so generally prolific the slaves being worked too hard and ill fed their constitutions are broken and the deaths among them are more than the births so that a continual supply is needed from africa the northern colonies having few slaves increase in whites slaves also pejorate the families that use them the white children become proud disgusted with labor and being educated in idleness are rendered unfit to get a living by industry    hence the prince that acquires new territory if he finds it vacant or removes the natives to give his own people room the legislator that makes     effectual laws for promoting of trade increasing employment improving of land by more or better tillage providing more food by fisheries securing property c and the man that invents new trades arts or manufactures or new improvements in husbandry may be properly called fathers of their nation as they are the cause of the generation of multitudes by the encouragement they afford to marriage    as to privileges granted to the married such as the jus trium liberorum among the romans they may hasten the filling of a country that has been thinned by war or pestilence or that has otherwise vacant territory but cannot increase a people beyond the means provided for their subsistence    foreign luxuries and needless manufactures imported and used in a nation do by the same reasoning increase the people of the nation that furnishes them and diminish the people of the nation that uses them laws therefore that prevent such importations and on the contrary promote the exportation of manufactures to be consumed in foreign countries may be called with respect to the people that make them generative laws as by increasing subsistence they encourage marriage such laws likewise strengthen a country doubly by increasing its own people and diminishing its neighbours    some european nations prudently refuse to consume the manufactures of east india they should likewise forbid them to their colonies for the gain to the merchant is not to be compared with the loss by this means of people to the nation        home luxury in the great increases the nations manufacturers employed by it who are many and only tends to diminish the families that indulge in it who are few the greater the common fashionable expense of any rank of people the more cautious they are of marriage therefore luxury should never be suffered to become common    the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves and their marrying early is encouraged from the prospect of good subsistence  0 if there be a sect therefore in our nation that regard frugality and industry as religious duties and educate their children therein more than others commonly do such sect must consequently increase more by natural generation than any other sect in britain    the importation of foreigners into a country that has as many inhabitants as the present employments and provisions for subsistence will bear will be in the end no increase of people unless the new comers have more industry and frugality than the natives and then they will provide more subsistence and increase in the country but they will gradually eat the natives out nor is it necessary to bring in foreigners to fill up any occasional vacancy in a country for such vacancy if the laws are good sec       will soon be filled by natural generation who can now find the vacancy made in sweden     france or other warlike nations by a plague of heroism forty years ago in france by the expulsion of the protestants in england by the settlement of her colonies or in guinea by one hundred years exportation of slaves that has blackened half america the thinness of inhabitants in spain is owing to national pride and idleness and other causes rather than to the expulsion of the moors or to the making of new settlements    there is in short no bound to the prolific nature of plants or animals but what is made by their crowding and interfering with each others means of subsistence were the face of the earth vacant of other plants it might be gradually sowed and overspread with one kind only as for instance with fennel and were it empty of other inhabitants it might in a few ages be replenished from one nation only as for instance with englishmen thus there are supposed to be now upwards of one million english souls in north america though it is thought scarce eighty thousand has been brought over sea and yet perhaps there is not one the fewer in britain but rather many more on account of the employment the colonies afford to manufacturers at home this million doubling suppose but once in twentyfive years will in another century be more than the people of england and the greatest number of englishmen will be on this side the water  what an     accession of power to the british empire by sea as well as land what increase of trade and navigation what numbers of ships and seamen we have been here but little more than one hundred years and yet the force of our privateers in the late war united was greater both in men and guns than that of the whole british navy in queen elizabeths time how important an affair then to britain is the present treaty for settling the bounds between her colonies and the french and how careful should she be to secure room enough since on     the room depends so much the increase of her people    in fine a nation well regulated is like a polypus take away a limb its place is soon supplied cut it in two and each deficient part shall speedily grow out of the part remaining thus if you have room and substance enough as you may by dividing make ten polypuses out of one you may of one make ten nations equally populous and powerful or rather increase a nation ten fold in numbers and strength and since detachments of english from britain sent to america will have their places at home so soon supplied and increase so largely here why should the palatine boors be suffered to swarm into our settlements and by herding together establish their language and manners to the exclusion of ours why should pennsylvania founded by the english become a colony of aliens who will shortly be so numerous as to germanize us instead of our anglifying them and will never adopt our language or customs any more than they can acquire our complexion    which leads me to add one remark that the number of purely white people in the world is proportionably very small all africa is black or tawny asia chiefly tawny america exclusive of the new comers wholly so and in europe the spaniards italians french russians and swedes are generally of what we call a swarthy complexion as are the germans also the saxons only excepted who with the english make the principal body of   0 white people on the face of the earth i could wish their numbers were increased and while we are as i may call it scouring our planet by clearing america of woods and so making this side of our globe reflect a brighter light to the eyes of inhabitants in mars or venus why should we in the sight of superior beings darken its people why increase the sons of africa by planting them in america where we have so fair an opportunity by excluding all blacks and tawnys of increasing the lovely white and red but perhaps i am partial to the complexion of my country for such kind of partiality is natural to mankind benjamin franklin    september      philadelphia jared eliot lxxx to jared eliot philadelphia    september      dear sir— i received your favor of last month with the twelve essays the collinson you mention is the same gentleman i correspond with he is a most benevolent worthy man very curious in botany and other branches of natural history and fond of improvements in agriculture etc he will be pleased with your acquaintance in the late philosophical transactions you may see frequently papers of his or letters that were directed to him on various subjects he is a member of the royal society an ingenious acquaintance of mine here mr hugh roberts one of our most eminent farmers tells me that it appears by your writings that your people     are yet far behind us in the improvement of swamps and meadows i am persuading him to send you such hints as he thinks may give you farther insight into that matter but in other respects he greatly esteems your pieces he says they are preferable to any thing of late years published on that subject in england the late writers there chiefly copy from one another and afford very little new or useful but you have collected experiences and facts and make propositions that are reasonable and serviceable you have taught him he says to clear his meadows of elder a thing very pernicious to banks which was before beyond the art of all our farmers and given him several other useful informations i am exceedingly obliged to you for the plan and directions concerning ditching it is very satisfactory and i hope will be useful here our academy flourishes beyond expectation we have now above one hundred scholars and the number is daily increasing we have excellent masters at present and as we give pretty good salaries i hope we shall always be able to procure such we pay the rector who teaches latin and greek per annum £ 00 the english master £  0 the mathematical professor £    three assistant tutors each £ 0  £  0 total per annum £    our currency is something better than that of new york the scholars pay each £  per annum     the changes of the barometer are most sensible in high latitudes in the west india islands the mercury continues at the same height with very little variation the year round in these latitudes the alterations are not frequently so great as in england thermometers are often badly made i had three that differed widely from each other though hung in the same place as to hygrometers there is no good one yet invented the cord is as good as any but like the rest it grows continually less sensible by time so that the observations of one year cannot be compared with those of another by the same instrument i will think of what you hint concerning the hydrostatic balance what you mention concerning the love of praise is indeed very true it reigns more or less in every heart though we are generally hypocrites in that respect and pretend to disregard praise and our nice modest ears are offended forsooth with what one of the ancients calls the sweetest kind of music this hypocrisy is only a sacrifice to the pride of others or to their envy both which i think ought rather to be mortified the same sacrifice we make when we forbear to praise ourselves which naturally we are all inclined to and i suppose it was formerly the fashion or virgil that courtly writer would not have put a speech into the mouth of his hero which nowadays we should esteem so great an indecency   sum pius æneas                  famâ super æthera notus one of the romans i forget who justified speaking     in his own praise by saying every freeman had a right to speak what he thought of himself as well as of others that this is a natural inclination appears in that all children show it and say freely i am a good boy am i not a good girl and the like till they have been frequently chid and told their trumpeter is dead and that it is unbecoming to sound their own praise c but naturam expellas furcâ tamen usque recurret being forbid to praise themselves they learn instead of it to censure others which is only a roundabout way of praising themselves for condemning the conduct of another in any particular amounts to as much as saying i am so honest or wise or good or prudent that i could not do or approve of such an action this fondness for ourselves rather than malevolence to others i take to be the general source of censure and backbiting and i wish men had not been taught to dam up natural currents to the overflowing and damage of their neighbours grounds another advantage methinks would arise from freely speaking our good thoughts of ourselves viz if we were wrong in them somebody or other would readily set us right but now while we conceal so carefully our vain erroneous selfopinions we may carry them to our grave for who would offer physic to a man that seems to be in health and the privilege of recounting freely our own good actions might be an inducement to the doing of them that we might be enabled to speak of them without being subject to be justly contradicted or charged with falsehood whereas now as we are not allowed to     mention them and it is an uncertainty whether others will take due notice of them or not we are perhaps the more indifferent about them so that upon the whole i wish the outoffashion practice of praising ourselves would like other old fashions come round into fashion again but this i fear will not be in our time so we must even be contented with what little praise we can get from one another and i will endeavour to make you some amends for the trouble of reading this long scrawl by telling you that i have the sincerest esteem for you as an ingenious man and a good one which together make the valuable member of society as such i am with great respect and affection dear sir your obliged humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia jane mecom lxxxi to mrs jane mecom philadelphia    october      dear sister— my son waits upon you with this whom i heartily recommend to your motherly care and advice he is indeed a sober and discreet lad of his years but he is young and unacquainted with the ways of your place my compliments to my new niece miss abiah and pray her to accept the enclosed piece of gold to cut her teeth it may afterwards buy nuts for them to crack some time since i sent a letter to your care for our cousin at casco bay have you had an opportunity     to forward it my love to brother mecom and your children and to brother and sister davenport and children and respects to mrs billings and her daughter and all other friends from dear sister your affectionate brother b franklin benjamin franklin  0 december      philadelphia jared eliot lxxxii to jared eliot philadelphia  0 december      dear sir— the rector of our academy mr martin came over to this country on a scheme for making potash in the russian method he promised me some written directions for you which expecting daily i delayed writing and now he lies dangerously ill of a kind of quinsy the surgeons have been obliged to open his windpipe and introduce a leaden pipe for him to breathe through i fear he will not recover i thank you for the merino wool it is a curiosity mr roberts promises me some observations on husbandry for you it is one mr masters that makes manure of leaves and not mr roberts i hope to get the particulars from him soon i have a letter from mr collinson of july   th in which he says pray has mr eliot published any addition to his work i have nos   and   if i can get ready i will send some improvements made in the sandy parts of the county of norfolk by the way it is a great secret but it is mr jacksons     own drawing up being experiments made on some of his fathers estates in that county but his name must not be mentioned i thank you for the foul meadow grass i sowed it june  th as soon as i received it but none is yet come up i dont know how it is but i never could raise any of your native grasses and i have had a variety from j bartram of curious species in another of september   th he says i am much obliged to thee for mr eliots third essay i have sent maxwells select transactions in husbandry if mr eliot has not seen them they may be very useful to him i have prevailed on our worthy learned and ingenious friend mr jackson to give some dissertations on the husbandry of norfolk believing it may be very serviceable to the colonies he has great opportunities of doing this being a gentleman of leisure and fortune being the only son whose father has great riches and possessions and resides every year all the long vacation at his fathers seat in norfolk after j bartram has perused it i shall submit how it may be further disposed of only our friend eliot should see it soon for jackson admires his little tracts of husbandry as well as myself and it may be of greater service to him and his colony than to yours the foul meadow grass has at last made its appearance another year we shall judge better of it thus far friend collinson you may expect the papers in a post or two if you make any use of them you will take care not to mention any thing of the author the bearer is my son who desired an opportunity     of paying his respects to you in his return from boston he went by sea they have printed all my electrical papers in england and sent me a few copies of which i design to send you one per next post after having corrected a few errata i am dear sir your most humble servant b franklin p s—mr martin is dead benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia jared eliot lxxxiii to jared eliot philadelphia    december      dear sir— i wrote you at large by my son in answer to your former favors and sent you an extract from mr collinsons letter who much admires your tracts on husbandry herewith you will receive a manuscript of a friend of mr collinsons and a printed book which you may keep till spring and then return it to me i believe they will afford you pleasure i send you also enclosed a letter from my friend john bartram whose journal you have read he corresponds with several of the greatest naturalists in europe and will be proud of an acquaintance with you i make no apologies for introducing him to you for though a plain and illiterate man you will find he has merit and since for want of skill in agriculture i cannot converse with you pertinently on that valuable subject i am pleased that i have procured you two correspondents who can     i am glad you have introduced english declamation into your college it will be of great service to the youth especially if care is taken to form their pronounciation on the best models mr whittlesey who was lately here will tell you that we have little boys under seven who can deliver an oration with more propriety than most preachers it is a matter that has been too much neglected i am dear sir yours affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    january      philadelphia james bowdoin lxxxiv to james bowdoin read at the royal society may         philadelphia    january      sir— i am glad to learn by your favor of the   st past that mr kinnersleys lectures have been acceptable to the gentlemen of boston and are like to prove serviceable to himself i thank you for the countenance and encouragement you have so kindly afforded my fellowcitizen i send you enclosed an extract of a letter containing the substance of what i observed concerning the communication of magnetism to needles by electricity the minutes i took at the time of the experiments are mislaid i am very little acquainted with the nature of magnetism dr gawin knight inventor of the steel magnets has wrote largely on that subject but i have not yet had leisure to     peruse his writings with the attention necessary to become master of his doctrine your explication of the crooked direction of lightning  appears to me both ingenious and solid when we can account as satisfactorily for the electrification of clouds i think that branch of natural philosophy will be nearly complete the air undoubtedly obstructs the motion of the electric fluid dry air prevents the dissipation of an electric atmosphere the denser the more as in cold weather i question whether such an atmosphere can be retained by a body in vacuo a common electrical phial requires a nonelectric   0 communication from the wire to every part of the charged glass otherwise being dry and clean and filled with air only it charges slowly and discharges gradually by sparks without a shock but exhausted of air the communication is so open and free between the inserted wire and surface of the glass that it charges as readily and shocks as smartly as if filled with water and i doubt not but that in the experiment you propose the sparks would not only be near straight in vacuo but strike at a greater distance than in the open air though perhaps there would not be a loud explosion as soon as i have a little leisure i will make the experiment and send you the result my supposition that the sea might possibly be the grand source of lightning arose from the common observation of its luminous appearance in the night on the least motion an appearance never observed in fresh water then i knew that the electric fluid may be pumped up out of the earth by the friction of a glass globe on a nonelectric cushion and that notwithstanding the surprising activity and swiftness of that fluid and the nonelectric communication between all parts of the cushion and the earth yet quantities would be snatched up by the revolving surface of the globe thrown on the prime conductor and dissipated in air how this was done and why that subtile active spirit did not immediately return again from the globe into some part or other of the cushion and so into the earth was difficult to conceive but whether from its being opposed by a current setting upwards to the cushion     or from whatever other cause that it did not so return was an evident fact then i considered the separate particles of water as so many hard spherules capable of touching the salt only in points and imagined a particle of salt could therefore no more be wet by a particle of water than a globe by a cushion that there might therefore be such a friction between these originally constituent particles of salt and water as in a sea of globes and cushions that each particle of water on the surface might obtain from the common mass some particles of the universally diffused much finer and more subtile electric fluid and forming to itself an atmosphere of those particles be repelled from the then generally electrified surface of the sea and fly away with them into the air i thought too that possibly the great mixture of particles electric per se in the ocean water might in some degree impede the swift motion and dissipation of the electric fluid through it to the shores c but having since found that salt in the water of an electric phial does not lessen the shock and having endeavoured in vain to produce that luminous appearance from a mixture of salt and water agitated and observed that even the seawater will not produce it after some hours standing in a bottle i suspect it to proceed from some principle yet unknown to us which i would gladly make some experiments to discover if i lived near the sea and i grow more doubtful of my former supposition and more ready to allow weight to that objection drawn from the activity of the electric fluid and the readiness of     water to conduct which you have indeed stated with great strength and clearness in the mean time before we part with this hypothesis let us think what to substitute in its place i have sometimes queried whether the friction of the air an electric per se in violent winds among trees and against the surface of the earth might not pump up as so many glass globes quantities of the electric fluid which the rising vapors might receive from the air and retain in the clouds they form on which i should be glad to have your sentiments an ingenious friend of mine supposes the land clouds more likely to be electrified than the sea clouds i send his letter for your perusal which please to return to me i have wrote nothing lately on electricity nor observed any thing new that is material my time being much taken up with other affairs yesterday i discharged four jars through a fine wire tied up between two strips of glass the wire was in part melted and the rest broke into small pieces from half an inch long to half a quarter of an inch my globe raises the electric fire with greater ease in much greater quantities by the means of a wire extended from the cushion to the iron pin of a pumphandle behind my house which communicates by the pumpspear with the water in the well by this post i send to dr perkins who is curious in that way some meteorological observations and conjectures and desire him to communicate them to you as they may afford you some amusement and i know you will look over them with a candid eye     by throwing our occasional thoughts on paper we more readily discover the defects of our opinions or we digest them better and find new arguments to support them this i sometimes practise but such pieces are fit only to be seen by friends i am with great respect c b franklin benjamin franklin   march      philadelphia ebenezer kinnersley lxxxv to e kinnersley at boston  philadelphia   march      sir— i thank you for the experiments communicated  i sent immediately for your brimstone globe in order to make the trials you desired but found it wanted centres which i have not time now     to supply but the first leisure i will get it fitted for use try the experiments and acquaint you with the result in the mean time i suspect that the different attractions and repulsions you observed proceeded rather from the greater or smaller quantities of the fire you obtained from different bodies than from its being of a different kind or having a different direction in haste i am c b franklin     benjamin franklin    march      philadelphia ebenezer kinnersley lxxxvi to e kinnersley at boston philadelphia    march      sir— having brought your brimstone globe to work i tried one of the experiments you proposed and was agreeably surprised to find that the glass globe being at one end of the conductor and the sulphur globe at the other end both globes in motion no spark could be obtained from the conductor unless when one globe turned slower or was not in so good order as the other and then the spark was only in proportion to the difference so that turning equally or turning that slowest which worked best would again bring the conductor to afford no spark i found also that the wire of a phial charged by the glass globe attracted a cork ball that had touched the wire of a phial charged by the brimstone globe and vice versâ so that the cork continued to play between the two phials just as when one phial was charged through the wire the other through the coating by the glass globe alone and two phials charged the one by the brimstone globe the other by the glass globe would be both discharged by bringing their wires together and shock the person holding the phials from these experiments one may be certain that your second third and fourth proposed experiments would succeed exactly as you suppose though i have not tried them wanting time i imagine it is the glass globe that charges positively and the     sulphur negatively for these reasons   though the sulphur globe seems to work equally well with the glass one yet it can never occasion so large and distant a spark between my knuckle and the conductor when the sulphur one is working as when the glass one is used which i suppose is occasioned by this that bodies of a certain bigness cannot so easily part with a quantity of electrical fluid they have and hold attracted within their substance as they can receive an additional quantity upon their surface by way of atmosphere therefore so much cannot be drawn out of the conductor as can be thrown on it   i observe that the stream or brush of fire appearing at the end of a wire connected with the conductor is long large and much diverging when the glass globe is used and makes a snapping or rattling noise but when the sulphur one is used it is short small and makes a hissing noise and just the reverse of both happens when you hold the same wire in your hand and the globes are worked alternately the brush is large long diverging and snapping or rattling when the sulphur globe is turned short small and hissing when the glass globe is turned when the brush is long large and much diverging the body to which it joins seems to me to be throwing the fire out and when the contrary appears it seems to be drinking in   i observe that when i hold my knuckle before the sulphur globe while turning the stream of fire between my knuckle and the globe seems to spread on its surface as if it flowed from the finger on the glass globe it is otherwise the cool wind or     what was called so that we used to feel as coming from an electrified point is i think more sensible when the glass globe is used than when the sulphur one but these are hasty thoughts as to your fifth paradox it must likewise be true if the globes are alternately worked but if worked together the fire will neither come up nor go down by the chain because one globe will drink it as fast as the other produces it i should be glad to know whether the effects would be contrary if the glass globe is solid and the sulphur globe is hollow but i have no means at present of trying in your journeys your glass globes meet with accidents and sulphur ones are heavy and inconvenient query would not a thin plane of brimstone cast on a board serve on occasion as a cushion while a globe of leather stuffed properly mounted might receive the fire from the sulphur and charge the conductor positively such a globe would be in no danger of breaking  i think i can conceive how it may be done but have not time to add more than that i am yours c b franklin     benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia cadwallader colden lxxxvii to cadwallader colden read at the royal society november         philadelphia    april      sir— in considering your favor of the   th past i recollected my having wrote you answers to some queries concerning the difference between electrics per se and nonelectrics and the effects of air in electrical experiments which i apprehend you may not have received the date i have forgotten we have been used to call those bodies electrics per se which would not conduct the electric fluid we once imagined that only such bodies contained that fluid afterwards that they had none of it and only educed it from other bodies but further experiments showed our mistake it is to be found in all matter we know of and the distinction of electrics per se and nonelectrics should now be dropped as improper and that of conductors and nonconductors assumed in its place as i mentioned in those answers i do not remember any experiment by which it appeared that highrectified spirit will not conduct perhaps you have made such this i know that wax rosin brimstone and even glass commonly reputed electrics per se will when in a fluid state conduct pretty well glass will do it when only redhot so that my former position that only metals and water were conductors and other bodies more or less such as they partook of metal or moisture was too general     your conception of the electric fluid that it is incomparably more subtile than air is undoubtedly just it pervades dense matter with the greatest ease but it does not seem to mix or incorporate willingly with mere air as it does with other matter it will not quit common matter to join with air air obstructs in some degree its motion an electric atmosphere cannot be communicated at so great a distance by far through intervening air as through a vacuum who knows then but there may be as the ancients thought a region of this fire above our atmosphere prevented by our air and its own too great distance for attraction from joining our earth perhaps where the atmosphere is rarest this fluid may be densest and nearer the earth where the atmosphere grows denser this fluid may be rarer yet some of it be low enough to attach itself to our highest clouds and thence they becoming electrified may be attracted by and descend towards the earth and discharge their watery contents together with that ethereal fire perhaps the auroræ boreales are currents of this fluid in its own region above our atmosphere becoming from their motion visible there is no end to conjectures as yet we are but novices in this branch of natural knowledge you mention several differences of salts in electrical experiments were they all equally dry salt is apt to acquire moisture from a moist air and some sorts more than others when perfectly dried by lying before a fire or on a stove none that i have tried will conduct any better than so much glass new flannel if dry and warm will draw the   0 electric fluid from nonelectrics as well as that which has been worn i wish you had the convenience of trying the experiments you seem to have such expectations from upon various kinds of spirits salts earth c frequently in a variety of experiments though we miss what we expected to find yet something valuable turns out something surprising and instructing though unthought of i thank you for communicating the illustration of the theorem concerning light it is very curious but i must own i am much in the dark about light i am not satisfied with the doctrine that supposes particles of matter called light continually driven off from the suns surface with a swiftness so prodigious must not the smallest particle conceivable have with such a motion a force exceeding that of a twentyfour pounder discharged from a cannon must not the sun diminish exceedingly by such a waste of matter and the planets instead of drawing nearer to him as some have feared recede to greater distances through the lessened attraction yet these particles with this amazing motion will not drive before them or remove the least and lightest dust they meet with and the sun for aught we know continues of his ancient dimensions and his attendants move in their ancient orbits may not all the phenomena of light be more conveniently solved by supposing universal space filled with a subtile elastic fluid which when at rest is not visible but whose vibrations affect that fine sense in the eye as those of air do the grosser organs     of the ear we do not in the case of sound imagine that any sonorous particles are thrown off from a bell for instance and fly in straight lines to the ear why must we believe that luminous particles leave the sun and proceed to the eye some diamonds if rubbed shine in the dark without losing any part of their matter i can make an electrical spark as big as the flame of a candle much brighter and therefore visible farther yet this is without fuel and i am persuaded no part of the electric fluid flies off in such case to distant places but all goes directly and is to be found in the place to which i destine it may not different degrees of the vibration of the abovementioned universal medium occasion the appearances of different colors i think the electric fluid is always the same yet i find that weaker and stronger sparks differ in apparent color some white blue purple red the strongest white weak ones red thus different degrees of vibration given to the air produce the seven different sounds in music analogous to the seven colors yet the medium air is the same if the sun is not wasted by expense of light i can easily conceive that he shall otherwise always retain the same quantity of matter though we should suppose him made of sulphur constantly flaming the action of fire only separates the particles of matter it does not annihilate them water by heat raised in vapor returns to the earth in rain and if we could collect all the particles of burning matter that go off in smoke perhaps they might with the ashes weigh as much as the body before it     was fired and if we could put them into the same position with regard to each other the mass would be the same as before and might be burnt over again the chemists have analyzed sulphur and find it composed in certain proportions of oil salt and earth and having by the analysis discovered those proportions they can of those ingredients make sulphur so we have only to suppose that the parts of the suns sulphur separated by fire rise into his atmosphere and there being freed from the immediate action of the fire they collect into cloudy masses and growing by degrees too heavy to be longer supported they descend to the sun and are burnt over again hence the spots appearing on his face which are observed to diminish daily in size their consuming edges being of particular brightness it is well we are not as poor galileo was subject to the inquisition for philosophical heresy my whispers against the orthodox doctrine in private letters would be dangerous but your writing and printing would be highly criminal as it is you must expect some censure but one heretic will surely excuse another i am heartily glad to hear more instances of the success of the pokeweed in the cure of that horrible evil to the human body a cancer you will deserve highly of mankind for the communication but i find in boston they are at a loss to know the right plant some asserting it is what they call mechoachan others other things in one of their late papers it is publicly requested that a perfect description may     be given of the plant its places of growth c i have mislaid the paper or would send it to you i thought you had described it pretty fully i am sir c b franklin

brought him into a great deal of trouble i cannot conceive how he was prevailed on to do it as i know him to be a thorough believer himself and averse to every thing that is commonly called freethinking he is now much in his penitentials and requests me to intercede with you to procure from the governor a nol pros in his favor promising to be very circumspect and careful for the future not to give offence either in religion or politics to you or any of your friends in which i believe he is very sincere i have let him know that i pretend to no interest with you and i fear he has behaved to the governor and to you in such a manner as not to deserve your favor therefore i only beg leave to recommend the poor mans case to your consideration and if you could without inconvenience to your own character interest yourself a little in his behalf i shall as i am much concerned for him esteem it a very great obligation     as to the cause of religion i really think it will be best served by stopping the prosecution for if there be any evil tendency apprehended from the publication of that piece the trial and punishment of the printer will certainly make it a thousand times more public—such is the curiosity of mankind in these cases it is besides an old thing has been printed before both in england and by andrew bradford here but no public notice being taken of it it died and was forgotten as i believe it would now be if treated with the same indifference i am with great respect c b franklin benjamin franklin    may      philadelphia edward eggleston jane mecom lxxxix to

old age and sickness our distance made it impracticable for us to attend her but you have supplied all she has lived a good life as well as a long one and is happy since i sent you the order on mr huske i have received his account and find he thinks he has money to receive and though i endeavour by this post to convince him he is mistaken yet possibly he may not be immediately satisfied so as to pay that order therefore lest the delay should be inconvenient     to you i send the six pistoles enclosed but if the order is paid give those to brother john and desire him to credit my account with them your affectionate brother b franklin benjamin franklin    august      philadelphia john perkins xc to john perkins  philadelphia    august      sir— i received your favor of the  d instant some time last winter i procured from one of our physicians an account of the number of persons inoculated during the five visitations of the smallpox we have had in twentytwo years which account i sent to mr w v of your town and have no copy if i remember rightly the number exceeded eight hundred and the deaths were but four i suppose mr v will show you the account if he ever received it these four were all that our doctors allow to have died of the smallpox by inoculation though i think there were two more of the inoculated who died of the distemper but the eruptions appearing soon after the operation it is supposed they had taken the infection before in the common way i shall be glad to see what dr douglass may write on the subject i have a french piece printed at paris      entitled observations sur la saignée du     pied et sur la purgation au commencement de la petite vérole et raisons de doubte contre linoculation a letter of the doctors is mentioned in it if he or you have it not and desire to see it i will send it please to favor me with the particulars of your purging method to prevent the secondary fever i am indebted for your preceding letter but business sometimes obliges one to postpone philosophical amusements whatever i have wrote of that kind are really as they are entitled but conjectures and suppositions which ought always to give place when careful observation militates against them i own i have too strong a penchant to the building of hypotheses they indulge my natural indolence i wish i had more of your patience and accuracy in making observations on which alone true philosophy can be founded and i assure you nothing can be more obliging to me than your kind communication of those you make however they may disagree with my preconceived notions i am sorry to hear that the number of your inhabitants decreases i some time since wrote a small paper of thoughts on the peopling of countries  which if i can find i will send you to obtain your sentiments the favorable opinion you express of my writings may you see occasion you more trouble than you expected from sir yours c b franklin     benjamin franklin    september      philadelphia cadwallader colden xci to cadwallader colden philadelphia    september      dear sir— when i had read your favor of may the  0th i resolved to read and consider more carefully sir isaac newtons optics which i have not looked at these many years i delayed answering till i should have an opportunity of doing this but one thing or other has hitherto hindered in the winter i may possibly have more leisure in the mean time i would just mention that the interposition of a hill between a bell and the ear does interrupt a great part of the sound though not all and we cannot be certain that an opaque body placed between the eye and a luminous object intercepts all the light since as you observe it does not follow that where we see no light there is therefore none existing what you say of the separation of the distinct parts of light which once separated remain always the same has more weight with me and indeed seems conclusive at least i see at present nothing to object i congratulate you on the prospect you have of passing the remainder of life in philosophical retirement i wish for the same but it seems too distant i might then more punctually perform my part in the correspondence you honor me with than which i have none more instructive or agreeable send me if you please the translation of your piece into high dutch i understand a little of the german language and will peruse and return it at     present i cannot guess the meaning of the passage you mention unless perhaps as your twentieth section speaks of a power that neither resists nor moves and exerts no kind of action of itself without the concurrence of some other power so that in the absence of other powers it must be in a perfect inaction c it may be some kind of dutch wit and intended to joke that quietism which in germany is supposed to be very prevalent in pennsylvania many of their quietists  having removed hither i see by caves magazine for may that they have translated my electrical papers into french and printed them in paris i hope our friend collinson will procure and send me a copy of the translation such things should be done by men skilled in the subject as well as in the language otherwise great mistakes are easily made and the clearest matters rendered obscure and unintelligible benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia peter collinson xcii to peter collinson read at the royal society december         philadelphia    october      sir— as frequent mention is made in publick papers from europe of the success of the philadelphia experiment for drawing the electric fire from clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected on high buildings c it may be agreeable to the curious to     be informed that the same experiment has succeeded in philadelphia though made in a different and more easy manner which is as follows make a small cross of two light strips of cedar the arms so long as to reach to the four corners of a large thin silk handkerchief when extended tie the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities of the cross so you have the body of a kite which being properly accommodated with a tail loop and string will rise in the air like those made of paper but this being of silk is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thundergust without tearing to the top of the upright stick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharppointed wire rising a foot or more above the wood to the end of the twine next the hand is to be tied a silk ribbon and where the silk and twine join a key may be fastened this kite is to be raised when a thundergust appears to be coming on and the person who holds the string most stand within a door or window or under some cover so that the silk ribbon may not be wet and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or window as soon as any of the thunderclouds come over the kite the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them and the kite with all the twine will be electrified and the loose filaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by an approaching finger and when the rain has wetted the kite and twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely you will find it stream out plentifully from the key on the approach of your knuckle at this key the phial may be charged and from   0 electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled and all the other electric experiments be performed which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube and thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning completely demonstrated b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia edward eggleston jane mecom xciii to edward and jane mecom philadelphia    november      dear brother and sister benny sailed from hence this day two weeks and left our capes the sunday following they are seldom above three weeks on the voyage to antigua that island is reckoned one of the healthiest in the west indies my late partner there enjoyed perfect health for four years till he grew careless and got to sitting up late in taverns which i have cautioned benny to avoid and have given him all other necessary advice i could think of relating both to his health and conduct and i hope for the best he will find the business settled to his hand a newspaper established no other printinghouse to interfere with him or beat down his prices which are much higher than we get on the continent he has the place on the same terms with his predecessor who i understand cleared from five to six hundred pistoles during the four years he lived there i have recommended him to some gentlemen of note for their patronage and advice mr parker though he looked on benny as one of     his best hands readily consented to his going on the first mention of it i told him benny must make him satisfaction for his time he would leave that to be settled by me and benny as readily agreed with me to pay mr parker as much as would hire a good journeyman in his room he came handsomely provided with apparel and i believe mr parker has in every respect done his duty by him and in this affair has really acted a generous part therefore i hope if benny succeeds in the world he will make mr parker a return beyond what he has promised i suppose you will not think it amiss to write mr and mrs parker a line or two of thanks for notwithstanding some little differences they have on the whole been very kind to benny we have vessels going very frequently from this port to antigua you have some too from your port what letters you send this way i will take care to forward antigua is the seat of government for all the leeward islands to wit st christophers nevis and montserrat benny will have the business of all those islands there being no other printer after all having taken care to do what appears to be for the best we must submit to gods providence which orders all things really for the best while benny was here and since our assembly was sitting which took up my time and i could not before write you so fully with love to your children i am dear brother and sister your affectionate brother b franklin     benjamin franklin   january      philadelphia cadwallader colden xciv to cadwallader colden philadelphia   january      dear sir— i have your favor of the third past with your sons remarks on the abbé nollets letters i think the experiments and observations are judiciously made and so well expressed that with your and his leave i would transmit them to mr collinson for publication i have repeated all the abbés experiments in vacuo and find them answer exactly as they should do on my principles and in the material part quite contrary to what he has related of them so that he has laid himself extremely open by attempting to impose false accounts of experiments on the world to support his doctrine m dalibard wrote to me that he was preparing an answer that would be published the beginning of this winter but as he seems to have been imposed on by the abbés confident assertion that a charged bottle set down on an electric per se is deprived of its electricity and in his letter to me attempts to account for it i doubt he is not yet quite master of the subject to do the business effectually so i conclude to write a civil letter to the abbé myself in which without resenting any thing in his letters i shall endeavour to set the disputed matters in so clear a light as to satisfy every one who will take the trouble of reading it before i send it home i shall communicate it to you and take your friendly advice on it i set out tomorrow on a journey to maryland where i expect to be some weeks but     shall have some leisure when i return at present i can only add my thanks to your ingenious son and my hearty wishes of a happy new year to you and him and all yours i am sir c b franklin p s—i wrote to you last post and sent my paper on the increase of mankind i send the supplemental electrical experiments in several fragments of letters of which cave  has made the most by printing some of them twice over benjamin franklin   february      philadelphia john perkins xcv to john perkins read at the royal society june         philadelphia   february      sir— i ought to have written to you long since in answer to yours of october   th concerning the waterspout but business partly and partly a desire of procuring further information by inquiry among my seafaring acquaintance induced me to postpone writing from time to time till i am now almost ashamed to resume the subject not knowing but you may have forgot what has been said upon it nothing certainly can be more improving to a searcher into nature than objections judiciously made to his opinion taken up perhaps too hastily for such objections oblige him to restudy the point     consider every circumstance carefully compare facts make experiments weigh arguments and be slow in drawing conclusions and hence a sure advantage results for he either confirms a truth before too slightly supported or discovers an error and receives instruction from the objector in this view i consider the objections and remarks you sent me and thank you for them sincerely but how much soever my inclinations lead me to philosophical inquiries i am so engaged in business public and private that those more pleasing pursuits are frequently interrupted and the chain of thought necessary to be closely continued in such disquisitions is so broken and disjointed that it is with difficulty i satisfy myself in any of them and i am now not much nearer a conclusion in this matter of the spout than when i first read your letter yet hoping we may in time sift out the truth between us i will send you my present thoughts with some observations on your reasons on the accounts in the transactions and on other relations i have met with perhaps while i am writing some new light may strike me for i shall now be obliged to consider the subject with a little more attention i agree with you that by means of a vacuum in a whirlwind water cannot be supposed to rise in large masses to the region of the clouds for the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere could not force it up in a continued body or column to a much greater height than thirty feet but if there really is a vacuum in the centre or near the axis of whirlwinds then i think water may rise in such vacuum to that     height or to a less height as the vacuum may be less perfect i had not read stuarts account in the transactions for many years before the receipt of your letter and had quite forgot it but now on viewing his drafts and considering his descriptions i think they seem to favor my hypothesis for he describes and draws columns of water of various heights terminating abruptly at the top exactly as water would do when forced up by the pressure of the atmosphere into an exhausted tube i must however no longer call it my hypothesis since i find stuart had the same thought though some what obscurely expressed where he says he imagines this phenomenon may be solved by suction improperly so called or rather pulsion as in the application of a cuppingglass to the flesh the air being first voided by the kindled flax in my paper i supposed a whirlwind and a spout to be the same thing and to proceed from the same cause the only difference between them being that the one passes over land the other over water i find also in the transactions that m de la pryme was of the same opinion for he there describes two spouts as he calls them which were seen at different times at hatfield in yorkshire whose appearances in the air were the same with those of the spouts at sea and effects the same with those of real whirlwinds whirlwinds have generally a progressive as well as a circular motion so had what is called the spout at topsham see the account of it in the     transactions which also appears by its effects described to have been a real whirlwind waterspouts have also a progressive motion this is sometimes greater and sometimes less in some violent in others barely perceivable the whirlwind at warrington continued long in acrement close whirlwinds generally arise after calms and great heats the same is observed of waterspouts which are therefore most frequent in the warm latitudes the spout that happened in cold weather in the downs described by mr gordon in the transactions was for that reason thought extraordinary but he remarks withal that the weather though cold when the spout appeared was soon after much colder as we find it commonly less warm after a whirlwind you agree that the wind blows every way towards a whirlwind from a large space round an intelligent whaleman of nantucket informed me that three of their vessels which were out in search of whales happening to be becalmed lay in sight of each other at about a league distance if i remember right nearly forming a triangle after some time a waterspout appeared near the middle of the triangle when a brisk breeze of wind sprung up and every vessel made sail and then it appeared to them all by the setting of the sails and the course each vessel stood that the spout was to the leeward of every one of them and they all declared it to have been so when they happened afterwards in company and came to confer about it so that in this     particular likewise whirlwinds and waterspouts agree but if that which appears a waterspout at sea does sometimes in its progressive motion meet with and pass over land and there produce all the phenomena and effects of a whirlwind it should thence seem still more evident that a whirlwind and a spout are the same i send you herewith a letter from an ingenious physician of my acquaintance which gives one instance of this that fell within his observation a fluid moving from all points horizontally toward a centre must at that centre either ascend or descend water being in a tub if a hole be opened in the middle of the bottom will flow from all sides to the centre and there descend in a whirl but air flowing on and near the surface of land or water from all sides towards the centre must at the centre ascend the land or water hindering its descent if these concentring currents of air be in the upper region they may indeed descend in the spout or whirlwind but then when the united current reached the earth or water it would spread and probably blow every way from the centre there may be whirlwinds of both kinds but from the commonly observed effects i suspect the rising one to be the most common when the upper air descends it is perhaps in a greater body extended wider as in our thundergusts and without much whirling and when air descends in a spout or whirlwind i should rather expect it would press the roof of a house inwards or force in the tiles shingles     or thatch force a boat down into the water or a piece of timber into the earth than that it would lift them up and carry them away it has so happened that i have not met with any accounts of spouts that certainly descended i suspect they are not frequent please to communicate those you mention the apparent dropping of a pipe from the clouds towards the earth or sea i will endeavour to explain hereafter the augmentation of the cloud which as i am informed is generally if not always the case during a spout seems to show an ascent rather than a descent of the matter of which such cloud is composed for a descending spout one would expect should diminish a cloud i own however that cold air descending may by condensing the vapors in a lower region form and increase clouds which i think is generally the case in our common thundergusts and therefore do not lay great stress on this argument whirlwinds and spouts are not always though most commonly in the day time the terrible whirlwind which damaged a great part of rome june         happened in the night of that day the same was supposed to have been first a spout for it is said to be beyond doubt that it gathered in the neighbouring sea as it could be tracked from ostia to rome i find this in père boscovichs account of it as abridged in the monthly review for december    0 in that account the whirlwind is said to have appeared as a very black long and lofty cloud discoverable     notwithstanding the darkness of the night by its continually lightning or emitting flashes on all sides pushing along with a surprising swiftness and within three or four feet of the ground its general effects on houses were stripping off the roofs blowing away chimneys breaking doors and windows forcing up the floors and unpaving the rooms some of these effects seem to agree well with a supposed vacuum in the centre of the whirlwind and the very rafters of the houses were broken and dispersed and even hurled against houses at a considerable distance c it seems by an expression of père boscovichs as if the wind blew from all sides towards the whirlwind for having carefully observed its effects he concludes of all whirlwinds that their motion is circular and their action attractive he observes on a number of histories of whirlwinds c that a common effect of them is to carry up into the air tiles stones and animals themselves which happened to be in their course and all kinds of bodies unexceptionably throwing them to a considerable distance with great impetuosity such effects seem to show a rising current of air i will endeavour to explain my conceptions of this matter by figures representing a plan and an elevation of a spout or whirlwind i would only first beg to be allowed two or three positions mentioned in my former paper   that the lower region of air is often more heated and so more rarefied than the upper consequently specifically lighter the coldness of the   0 upper region is manifested by the hail which sometimes falls from it in a hot day   that heated air may be very moist and yet the moisture so equally diffused and rarefied as not to be visible till colder air mixes with it when it condenses and becomes visible thus our breath invisible in summer becomes visible in winter now let us suppose a tract of land or sea of perhaps sixty miles square unscreened by clouds and unfanned by winds during great part of a summers day or it may be for several days successively till it is violently heated together with the lower region of air in contact with it so that the said lower air becomes specifically lighter than the superincumbent higher region of the atmosphere in which the clouds commonly float let us suppose also that the air surrounding this tract has not been so much heated during those days and therefore remains heavier the consequence of this should be as i conceive that the heated lighter air being pressed on all sides must ascend and the heavier descend and as this rising cannot be in all parts or the whole area of the tract at once for that would leave too extensive a vacuum the rising will begin precisely in that column that happens to be the lightest or most rarefied and the warm air will flow horizontally from all points to this column where the several currents meeting and joining to rise a whirl is naturally formed in the same manner as a whirl is formed in the tub of water by the descending fluid flowing from all sides of the tub to the hole in the centre and as the several currents arrive at this central     rising column with a considerable degree of horizontal motion they cannot suddenly change it to a vertical motion therefore as they gradually in approaching the whirl decline from right to curve or circular lines so having joined the whirl they ascend by a spiral motion in the same manner as the water descends spirally through the hole in the tub beforementioned lastly as the lower air and nearest the surface is most rarefied by the heat of the sun that air is most acted on by the pressure of the surrounding cold and heavy air which is to take its place consequently its motion towards the whirl is swiftest and so the force of the lower part of the whirl or trump strongest and the centrifugal force of its particles greatest and hence the vacuum round the axis of the whirl should be greatest near the earth or sea and be gradually diminished as it approaches the region of the clouds till it ends in a point as at p in figure   plate vi forming a long and sharp cone in figure   which is a plan or groundplat of a whirlwind the circle v represents the central vacuum between a a a a and b b b b i suppose a body of air condensed strongly by the pressure of the currents moving towards it from all sides without and by its centrifugal force from within moving round with prodigious swiftness having as it were the momenta of all the currents —— —— —— —— united in itself and with a power equal to its swiftness and density     it is this whirling body of air between a a a a and b b b b that rises spirally by its force it tears buildings to pieces twists up great trees by the roots c and by its spiral motion raises the fragments so high till the pressure of the surrounding and approaching currents diminishing can no longer confine them to the circle or their own centrifugal force increasing grows too strong for such pressure when they fly off in tangent lines as stones out of a sling and fall on all sides and at great distances if it happens at sea the water under and between a a a a and b b b b will be violently agitated and driven about and parts of it raised with the spiral current and thrown about so as to form a bushlike appearance this circle is of various diameters sometimes very large if the vacuum passes over water the water may rise in it in a body or column to near the height of thirtytwo feet if it passes over houses it may burst their windows or walls outwards pluck off the roofs and pluck up the floors by the sudden rarefaction of the air contained within such buildings the outward pressure of the atmosphere being suddenly taken off so the stopped bottle of air bursts under the exhausted receiver of the airpump figure   is to represent the elevation of a waterspout wherein i suppose p p p to be the cone at first a vacuum till w w the rising column of water has filled so much of it s s s s the spiral whirl of k     air surrounding the vacuum and continued higher in a close column after the vacuum ends in the point p till it reaches the cool region of the air b b the bush described by stuart surrounding the foot of the column of water  water spout now i suppose this whirl of air will at first be as invisible as the air itself though reaching in reality from the water to the region of cool air in which our low summer thunderclouds commonly float but presently it will become visible at its extremities at its lower end by the agitation of the water under the whirling part of the circle between p and s forming stuarts bush and by the welling and rising of the water in the beginning vacuum which is at first a small low broad cone whose top gradually rises and sharpens as the force of the whirl increases at its upper end it becomes visible by the warm air brought up to the cooler region where its moisture begins to be condensed into thick vapor by the cold and is seen first at a the highest part which being now cooled condenses what rises next at b which condenses that at c and that condenses what is rising at d the cold operating by the contact of the vapors faster in a right line downwards than the vapors themselves can climb in a spiral line upwards they climb however and as by continual addition they grow denser and consequently their centrifugal force greater and being risen above the concentrating currents that compose the whirl fly off spread and form a cloud it seems easy to conceive how by this successive     condensation from above the spout appears to drop or descend from the cloud though the materials of which it is composed are all the while ascending the condensation of the moisture contained in so great a quantity of warm air as may be supposed to rise in a short time in this prodigiously rapid whirl is perhaps sufficient to form a great extent of cloud though the spout should be over land as those at hatfield and if the land appears not to be very dusty perhaps the lower part of the spout will scarce become visible at all though the upper or what is commonly called the descending part be very distinctly seen the same may happen at sea in case the whirl is not violent enough to make a high vacuum and raise the column c in such case the upper part a b c d only will be visible and the bush perhaps below but if the whirl be strong and there be much dust on the land and the column w w be raised from the water then the lower part becomes visible and sometimes even united to the upper part for the dust may be carried up in the spiral whirl till it reach the region where the vapor is condensed and rise with that even to the clouds and the friction of the whirling air on the sides of the column w w may detach great quantities of its water break it into drops and carry them up in the spiral whirl mixed with the air the heavier drops may indeed fly off and fall in a shower round the spout but much of it will be broken into vapor yet visible     and thus in both cases by dust at land and by water at sea the whole tube may be darkened and rendered visible as the whirl weakens the tube may in appearance separate in the middle the column of water subsiding and the superior condensed part drawing up to the cloud yet still the tube or whirl of air may remain entire the middle only becoming invisible as not containing visible matter dr stuart says it was observable of all the spouts he saw but more perceptible of the great one that towards the end it began to appear like a hollow canal only black in the borders but white in the middle and though at first it was altogether black and opake yet now one could very distinctly perceive the sea water to fly up along the middle of this canal as smoke up a chimney and dr mather describing a whirlwind says a thick dark small cloud arose with a pillar of light in it of about eight or ten feet diameter and passed along the ground in a tract not wider than a street horribly tearing up trees by the roots blowing them up in the air like feathers and throwing up stones of great weight to a considerable height in the air c these accounts the one of waterspouts the other of a whirlwind seem in this particular to agree what one gentleman describes as a tube black in the borders and white in the middle the other calls a black cloud with a pillar of light in it the latter expression has only a little more of the marvellous but the thing is the same and it seems not very     difficult to understand when dr stuarts spouts were full charged—that is when the whirling pipe of air was filled between a a a a and b b b b figure   with quantities of drops and vapor torn off from the column w w figure   the whole was rendered so dark as that it could not be seen through nor the spiral ascending motion discovered but when the quantity ascending lessened the pipe became more transparent and the ascending motion visible for by inspection of the figure fig   representing a section of our spout with the vacuum in the middle it is plain that if we look at such a hollow pipe in the direction of the arrows and suppose opake particles to be equally mixed in the space between the two circular lines both the part between the arrows a and b and that between the arrows c and d will appear much darker than that between b and c as there must be many more of those opake particles in the line of vision across the sides than across the middle it is thus that a hair in a microscope evidently appears to be a pipe the sides showing darker than the middle dr mathers whirl was probably filled with dust the sides were very dark but the vacuum within rendering the middle more transparent he calls it a pillar of light it was in this more transparent part between b and c that stuart could see the spiral motion of the vapors whose lines on the nearest and farthest side of the transparent part crossing each other represented smoke ascending in a chimney for the quantity being still too great in the line of sight through the sides of the tube the motion could not be discovered     there and so they represented the solid sides of the chimney when the vapors reach in the pipe from the clouds near to the earth it is no wonder now to those who understand electricity that flashes of lightning should descend by the spout as in that of rome but you object if water may be thus carried into the clouds why have we not salt rains the objection is strong and reasonable and i know not whether i can answer it to your satisfaction i never heard but of one salt rain and that was where a spout passed pretty near a ship so i suppose it to be only the drops thrown off from the spout by the centrifugal force as the birds were at hatfield when they had been carried so high as to be above or to be too strongly centrifugal for the pressure of the concurring winds surrounding it and indeed i believe there can be no other kind of salt rain for it has pleased the goodness of god so to order it that the particles of air will not attract the particles of salt though they strongly attract water hence though all metals even gold may be united with air and rendered volatile salt remains fixed in the fire and no heat can force it up to any considerable height or oblige the air to hold it hence when salt rises as it will a little way into air with water there is instantly a separation made the particles of water adhere to the air and the particles of salt fall down again as if repelled and forced off from the water by some power in the air or as some metals dissolved in a proper menstruum will quit the solvent when other matter approaches     and adhere to that so the water quits the salt and embraces the air but air will not embrace the salt and quit the water otherwise our rains would indeed be salt and every tree and plant on the face of the earth be destroyed with all the animals that depend on them for subsistence he who hath proportioned and given proper qualities to all things was not unmindful of this let us adore him with praise and thanksgiving by some accounts of seamen it seems the column of water w w sometimes falls suddenly and if it be as some say fifteen or twenty yards diameter it must fall with great force and they may well fear for their ships by one account in the transactions of a spout that fell at colne in lancashire one would think the column is sometimes lifted off from the water and carried over land and there let fall in a body but this i suppose happens rarely stuart describes his spouts as appearing no bigger than a mast and sometimes less but they were seen at a league and a half distance i think i formerly read in dampier or some other voyager that a spout in its progressive motion went over a ship becalmed on the coast of guinea and first threw her down on one side carrying away her foremast then suddenly whipped her up and threw her down on the other side carrying away her mizenmast and the whole was over in an instant i suppose the first mischief was done by the fore side of the whirl the latter by the hinder side their motion being contrary i suppose a whirlwind or spout may be stationary     when the concurring winds are equal but if unequal the whirl acquires a progressive motion in the direction of the strongest pressure when the wind that gives the progressive motion becomes stronger below than above or above than below the spout will be bent and the cause ceasing straighten again your queries towards the end of your paper appear judicious and worth considering at present i am not furnished with facts sufficient to make any pertinent answer to them and this paper has already a sufficient quantity of conjecture your manner of accommodating the accounts to your hypothesis of descending spouts is i own ingenious and perhaps that hypothesis may be true i will consider it farther but as yet i am not satisfied with it though hereafter i may be here you have my method of accounting for the principal phenomena which i submit to your candid examination and as i now seem to have almost written a book instead of a letter you will think it high time i should conclude which i beg leave to do with assuring you that i am sir c b franklin benjamin franklin    february      philadelphia james bowdoin xcvi to james bowdoin philadelphia    february      dear sir— the enclosed is a copy of a letter and some papers i received lately from a friend of  00 which i have struck off fifty copies by the press to distribute among my ingenious acquaintance in north america hoping some of them will make the observations proposed the improvement of geography and astronomy is the common concern of all polite nations and i trust our country will not miss the opportunity of sharing in the honor to be got on this occasion the french originals are despatched by express overland to quebec i doubt not but you will do what may lie in your power to promote the making these observations in new england and that we may not be excelled by the american french either in diligence or accuracy we have here a threefoot reflecting telescope and other proper instruments and intend to observe at our academy if the weather permit you will see by our almanac that we have had this transit under consideration before the arrival of these french letters  dr coldens book was printed in england last summer but not to be published till the meeting of parliament i have one copy however which i purpose shortly to send you with great esteem and respect i am sir your most humble servant b franklin  0  benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia jared eliot xcvii to jared eliot philadelphia    april      dear sir— i received your favor of march   th and thank you for communicating to me the very ingenious letter from your friend mr todd with whom if it may be agreeable to him i would gladly entertain a correspondence i shall consider his objections till next post i thank you for your hint concerning the word adhesion which should be defined when i speak of particles of water adhering to particles of air i mean not a firm adhesion but a loose one like that of a drop of water to the end of an icicle before freezing the firm adhesion is after it is frozen i conceive that the original constituent particles of water are perfectly hard round and smooth if so there must be interstices and yet the mass incompressible a box filled with small shot has many interstices and the shot may be compressed because they are not perfectly hard if they were the interstices would remain the same notwithstanding the greatest pressure and would admit sand as water admits salt our vessel named the argo is gone for the northwest passage and the captain has borrowed my journals of the last voyage except one volume of a broken set which i send you i enclose a letter from our friend mr collinson and am promised some speltz which i shall send per next post the tatler tells us of a girl who was observed to  0  grow suddenly proud and none could guess the reason till it came to be known that she had got on a pair of new silk garters lest you should be puzzled to guess the cause when you observe any thing of the kind in me i think i will not hide my new garters under my petticoats but take the freedom to show them to you in a paragraph of our friend collinsons last letter viz—but i ought to mortify and not indulge this vanity i will not transcribe the paragraph yet i cannot forbear if any of thy friends says peter should take notice that thy head is held a little higher up than formerly let them know when the grand monarch of france strictly commands the abbé mazéas to write a letter in the politest terms to the royal society to return the kings thanks and compliments in an express manner to mr franklin of pennsylvania for his useful discoveries in electricity and application of the pointed rods to prevent the terrible effects of thunderstorms i say after all this is not some allowance to be made if thy crest is a little elevated there are four letters containing very curious experiments on thy doctrine of points and its verification which will be printed in the new transactions i think now i have stuck a feather in thy cap i may be allowed to conclude in wishing thee long to wear it thine p collinson on reconsidering this paragraph i fear i have not so much reason to be proud as the girl had for a feather in the cap is not so useful a thing or so serviceable to the wearer as a pair of good silk garters the pride of man is very differently gratified and  0  had his majesty sent me a marshals staff i think i could scarce have been so proud of it as i am of your esteem and of subscribing myself with sincerity dear sir your affectionate friend and humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia james bowdoin xcviii to james bowdoin philadelphia    april      sir— i have shipped eighteen glass jars in casks well packed on board captain branscombe for boston six of them are for you the rest i understand are for the college leaf tin such as they use in silvering lookingglasses is best to coat them with they should be coated to within about four or five inches of the brim cut the tin into pieces of the form here represented and they will comply better with the bellying of the glass one piece only should be round to cover the bottom the same shapes will serve the inside i had not conveniency to coat them for you and feared to trust anybody else mr kinnersley being abroad in the west indies to make the pieces comply the better they may be cut in two where the cross lines are they reach from the top to the edge of the round piece which covers the bottom i place them in loose rims of scabboard something like a small sieve in which they stand very well if you charge more than one or two together pray take  0  care how you expose your head to an accidental stroke for i can assure you from experience one is sufficient to knock a stout man down and i believe a stroke from two or three in the head would kill him  has dr coldens new book reached you in boston if not i will send it to you with great respect i am sir your most humble servant b franklin p s—the glassmaker being from home i cannot now get the account the tin is laid on with common paste made of flour and water boiled together and the pieces may lap over each other a little benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia william smith xcix to william smith  philadelphia    april      sir— i received your favor of the   th instant with your new piece on education  which i shall  0  carefully peruse and give you my sentiments of it as you desire by next post i believe the young gentlemen your pupils may be entertained and instructed here in mathematics and philosophy to satisfaction mr alison  who was educated at glasgow has been long accustomed to teach the latter and mr grew  the former and i think their pupils make great progress mr alison has the care of the latin and greek school but as he has now three good assistants  he can very well afford some hours every day for the instruction of those who are engaged in higher studies the mathematical school is pretty well furnished with instruments the english library is a good one and we have belonging to it a middling apparatus for experimental philosophy and purpose speedily to complete it the loganian library one of the best collections in america will shortly be opened so that neither books nor instruments will be wanting and as we are determined always to give good salaries we have reason to believe we may have always an opportunity of choosing good masters upon which indeed the success of the whole depends we are obliged to you for your kind offers in this respect and when you are settled in england we may occasionally make use of your friendship and judgment  0  if it suits your convenience to visit philadelphia before your return to europe i shall be extremely glad to see and converse with you here as well as to correspond with you after your settlement in england for an acquaintance and communication with men of learning virtue and public spirit is one of my greatest enjoyments i do not know whether you ever happened to see the first proposals i made for erecting this academy i send them enclosed they had however imperfect the desired success being followed by a subscription of four thousand pounds towards carrying them into execution and as we are fond of receiving advice and are daily improving by experience i am in hopes we shall in a few years see a perfect institution i am very respectfully c b franklin benjamin franklin   may      philadelphia william smith c to william smith philadelphia   may      sir— mr peters has just now been with me and we have compared notes on your new piece we find nothing in the scheme of education however excellent but what is in our opinion very practicable the great difficulty will be to find the aratus   0  and other suitable persons to carry it into execution but such may be had if proper encouragement be given we have both received great pleasure in the perusal of it for my part i know not when i have read a piece that has more affected me so noble and just are the sentiments so warm and animated the language yet as censure from your friends may be of more use as well as more agreeable to you than praise i ought to mention that i wish you had omitted not only the quotation from the review  which you are now justly dissatisfied with but those expressions of resentment against your adversaries in pages    and    in such cases the noblest victory is obtained by neglect and by shining on mr allen has been out of town these ten days but before he went he directed me to procure him six copies of your piece mr peters has taken ten he purposed to have written to you but omits it as he expects so soon to have the pleasure of seeing you here he desires me to present his affectionate compliments to you and to assure you that you will be very welcome to him i shall only say that you may depend on my doing all in my power to make your visit to philadelphia agreeable to you i am c b franklin  0  benjamin franklin   may      philadelphia peter collinson ci to peter collinson philadelphia   may      sir— i thank you for the kind and judicious remarks you have made on my little piece i have often observed with wonder that temper of the poorer english laborers which you mention and acknowledge it to be pretty general when any of them happen to come here where labor is much better paid than in england their industry seems to diminish in equal proportion but it is not so with the german laborers they retain the habitual industry and frugality they bring with them and receiving higher wages an accumulation arises that makes them all rich when i consider that the english are the offspring of germans that the climate they live in is much of the same temperature and when i see nothing in nature that should create this difference i am tempted to suspect it must arise from the constitution and i have sometimes doubted whether the laws peculiar to england which compel the rich to maintain the poor have not given the latter a dependence that very much lessens the care of providing against the wants of old age i have heard it remarked that the poor in protestant countries on the continent of europe are generally more industrious than those of popish countries may not the more numerous foundations in the latter for relief of the poor have some effect towards rendering them less provident to relieve the misfortunes of our fellow creatures is concurring  0  with the deity it is godlike but if we provide encouragement for laziness and support for folly may we not be found fighting against the order of god and nature which perhaps has appointed want and misery as the proper punishments for and cautions against as well as necessary consequences of idleness and extravagance whenever we attempt to amend the scheme of providence and to interfere with the government of the world we had need be very circumspect lest we do more harm than good in new england they once thought blackbirds useless and mischievous to the corn they made efforts to destroy them the consequence was the blackbirds were diminished but a kind of worm which devoured their grass and which the blackbirds used to feed on increased prodigiously then finding their loss in grass much greater than their saving in corn they wished again for their blackbirds we had here some years since a transylvanian tartar who had travelled much in the east and came hither merely to see the west intending to go home through the spanish west indies china c he asked me one day what i thought might be the reason that so many and such numerous nations as the tartars in europe and asia the indians in america and the negroes in africa continued a wandering careless life and refused to live in cities and cultivate the arts they saw practised by the civilized parts of mankind while i was considering what answer to make him he said in his broken english god make man for paradise he make him for live lazy man make god angry god turn   0 him out of paradise and bid workee man no love workee he want to go to paradise again he want to live lazy so all mankind love lazy however this may be it seems certain that the hope of becoming at some time of life free from the necessity of care and labor together with fear of penury are the main springs of most peoples industry to those indeed who have been educated in elegant plenty even the provision made for the poor may appear misery but to those who have scarce ever been better provided for such provision may seem quite good and sufficient these latter then have nothing to fear worse than their present condition and scarce hope for any thing better than a parish maintenance so that there is only the difficulty of getting that maintenance allowed while they are able to work or a little shame they suppose attending it that can induce them to work at all and what they do will only be from hand to mouth the proneness of human nature to a life of ease of freedom from care and labor appears strongly in the little success that has hitherto attended every attempt to civilize our american indians in their present way of living almost all their wants are supplied by the spontaneous productions of nature with the addition of very little labor if hunting and fishing may indeed be called labor where game is so plenty they visit us frequently and see the advantages that arts sciences and compact societies procure us they are not deficient in natural understanding and yet they have never shown any inclination to change their manner of life for ours or     to learn any of our arts when an indian child has been brought up among us taught our language and habituated to our customs yet if he goes to see his relatives and makes one indian ramble with them there is no persuading him ever to return and that this is not natural to them merely as indians but as men is plain from this that when white persons of either sex have been taken prisoners by the indians and lived awhile with them though ransomed by their friends and treated with all imaginable tenderness to prevail with them to stay among the english yet in a short time they become disgusted with our manner of life and the care and pains that are necessary to support it and take the first opportunity of escaping again into the woods from whence there is no redeeming them one instance i remember to have heard where the person was brought home to possess a good estate but finding some care necessary to keep it together he relinquished it to a younger brother reserving to himself nothing but a gun and a matchcoat with which he took his way again into the wilderness so that i am apt to imagine that close societies subsisting by labor and art arose first not from choice but from necessity when numbers being driven by war from their hunting grounds and prevented by seas or by other nations from obtaining other hunting grounds were crowded together into some narrow territories which without labor could not afford them food however as matters now stand with us care and industry seem absolutely necessary to our wellbeing they should therefore     have every encouragement we can invent and not one motive to diligence be subtracted and the support of the poor should not be by maintaining them in idleness but by employing them in some kind of labor suited to their abilities of body as i am informed begins to be of late the practice in many parts of england where workhouses are erected for that purpose if these were general i should think the poor would be more careful and work voluntarily to lay up something for themselves against a rainy day rather than run the risk of being obliged to work at the pleasure of others for a bare subsistence and that too under confinement the little value indians set on what we prize so highly under the name of learning appears from a pleasant passage that happened some years since at a treaty between some colonies and the six nations when every thing had been settled to the satisfaction of both sides and nothing remained but a mutual exchange of civilities the english commissioners told the indians that they had in their country a college for the instruction of youth who were there taught various languages arts and sciences that there was a particular foundation in favor of the indians to defray the expense of the education of any of their sons who should desire to take the benefit of it and said if the indians would accept the offer the english would take half a dozen of their brightest lads and bring them up in the best manner the indians after consulting on the proposals replied that it was remembered that some of their youths had formerly been educated at that college but that it had been     observed that for a long time after they returned to their friends they were absolutely good for nothing being neither acquainted with the true method of killing deer catching beavers or surprising an enemy the proposition they looked on however as a mark of kindness and good will of the english to the indian nations which merited a grateful return and therefore if the english gentlemen would send a dozen or two of their children to onondaga the great council would take care of their education bring them up in what was really the best manner and make men of them i am perfectly of your mind that measures of great temper are necessary with the germans and am not without apprehensions that through their indiscretion or ours or both great disorders may one day arise among us those who come hither are generally the most stupid of their own nation and as ignorance is often attended with credulity when knavery would mislead it and with suspicion when honesty would set it right and as few of the english understand the german language and so cannot address them either from the press or the pulpit it is almost impossible to remove any prejudices they may entertain their clergy have very little influence on the people who seem to take a pleasure in abusing and discharging the minister on every trivial occasion not being used to liberty they know not how to make a modest use of it and as kolben says of the young hottentots that they are not esteemed men until they have shown their manhood by beating their mothers so these seem not     to think themselves free till they can feel their liberty in abusing and insulting their teachers thus they are under no restraint from ecclesiastical government they behave however submissively enough at present to the civil government which i wish they may continue to do for i remember when they modestly declined intermeddling in our elections but now they come in droves and carry all before them except in one or two counties few of their children in the country know english they import many books from germany and of the six printinghouses in the province two are entirely german two half german half english and but two entirely english they have one german newspaper and one halfgerman advertisements intended to be general are now printed in dutch and english the signs in our streets have inscriptions in both languages and in some places only german they begin of late to make all their bonds and other legal instruments in their own language which though i think it ought not to be are allowed good in our courts where the german business so increases that there is continued need of interpreters and i suppose in a few years they will also be necessary in the assembly to tell one half of our legislators what the other half say in short unless the stream of their importation could be turned from this to other colonies as you very judiciously propose they will soon so outnumber us that all the advantages we have will in my opinion be not able to preserve our language and even our government will become precarious the     french who watch all advantages are now themselves making a german settlement back of us in the illinois country and by means of these germans they may in time come to an understanding with ours and indeed in the last war our germans showed a general disposition that seemed to bode us no good for when the english who were not quakers alarmed by the danger arising from the defenceless state of our country entered unanimously into an association and within this government and the lower counties raised armed and disciplined near ten thousand men the germans except a very few in proportion to their number refused to engage in it giving out one amongst another and even in print that if they were quiet the french should they take the country would not molest them at the same time abusing the philadelphians for fitting out privateers against the enemy and representing the trouble hazard and expense of defending the province as a greater inconvenience than any that might be expected from a change of government yet i am not for refusing to admit them entirely into our colonies all that seems to me necessary is to distribute them more equally mix them with the english establish english schools where they are now too thick settled and take some care to prevent the practice lately fallen into by some of the shipowners of sweeping the german gaols to make up the number of their passengers i say i am not against the admission of germans in general for they have their virtues their industry and frugality are exemplary they are excellent     husbandmen and contribute greatly to the improvement of a country i pray god to preserve long to great britain the english laws manners liberties and religion notwithstanding the complaints so frequent in your public papers of the prevailing corruption and degeneracy of the people i know you have a great deal of virtue still subsisting among you and i hope the constitution is not so near a dissolution as some seem to apprehend i do not think you are generally become such slaves to your vices as to draw down the justice milton speaks of when he says that——  benjamin franklin september      philadelphia peter collinson cii to peter collinson the sea and lightning philadelphia — september      sir— in my former paper on this subject written first in      enlarged and sent to england in      i considered the sea as the grand source of lightning     imagining its luminous appearance to be owing to electric fire produced by friction between the particles of water and those of salt living far from the sea i had then no opportunity of making experiments on the sea water and so embraced this opinion too hastily for in    0 and      being occasionally on the seacoast i found by experiments that sea water in a bottle though at first it would by agitation appear luminous yet in a few hours it lost that virtue hence and from this that i could not by agitating a solution of sea salt in water produce any light i first began to doubt of my former hypothesis and to suspect that the luminous appearance in sea water must be owing to some other principles i then considered whether it were not possible that the particles of air being electrics per se might in hard gales of wind by their friction against trees hills buildings c as so many minute electric globes rubbing against nonelectric cushions draw the electric fire from the earth and that the rising vapors might receive that power from the air and by such means the clouds become electrified if this were so i imagined that by forcing a constant violent stream of air against my prime conductor by bellows i should electrify it negatively the rubbing particles of air drawing from it part of its natural quantity of the electric fluid i accordingly made the experiment but it did not succeed in september      i erected an iron rod to draw the lightning down into my house in order to make some experiments on it with two bells to give notice     when the rod should be electrified a contrivance obvious to every electrician i found the bells rang sometimes when there was no lightning or thunder but only a dark cloud over the rod that sometimes after a flash of lightning they would suddenly stop and at other times when they had not rung before they would after a flash suddenly begin to ring that the electricity was sometimes very faint so that when a small spark was obtained another could not be got for some time after at other times the sparks would follow extremely quick and once i had a continual stream from bell to bell the size of a crowquill even during the same gust there were considerable variations in the winter following i conceived an experiment to try whether the clouds were electrified positively or negatively but my pointed rod with its apparatus becoming out of order i did not refit it till towards the spring when i expected the warm weather would bring on more frequent thunderclouds the experiment was this to take two phials charge one of them with lightning from the iron rod and give the other an equal charge by the electric glass globe through the prime conductor when charged to place them on a table within three or four inches of each other a small cork ball being suspended by a fine silk thread from the ceiling so as it might play between the wires if both bottles then were electrified positively the ball being attracted and repelled by one must be also repelled by the other if the one positively and the other negatively then the ball would be attracted and     repelled alternately by each and continue to play between them as long as any considerable charge remained being very intent on making this experiment it was no small mortification to me that i happened to be abroad during two of the greatest thunderstorms we had early in the spring and though i had given orders in the family that if the bells rang when i was from home they should catch some of the lightning for me in electrical phials and they did so yet it was mostly dissipated before my return and in some of the other gusts the quantity of lightning i was able to obtain was so small and the charge so weak that i could not satisfy myself yet i sometimes saw what heightened my suspicions and inflamed my curiosity at last on the   th of april      there being a smart gust of some continuance i charged one phial pretty well with lightning and the other equally as near as i could judge with electricity from my glass globe and having placed them properly i beheld with great surprise and pleasure the cork ball play briskly between them and was convinced that one bottle was electrized negatively i repeated this experiment several times during the gust and in eight succeeding gusts always with the same success and being of opinion for reasons i formerly gave in my letter to mr kinnersley since printed in london that the glass globe electrizes positively i concluded that the clouds are always electrized negatively or have always in them less than their natural quantity of the electric fluid   0 yet notwithstanding so many experiments it seems i concluded too soon for at last june the  th in a gust which continued from five oclock pm to seven i met with one cloud that was electrized positively though several that passed over my rod before during the same gust were in the negative state this was thus discovered i had another concurring experiment which i often repeated to prove the negative state of the clouds viz while the bells were ringing i took the phial charged from the glass globe and applied its wire to the erected rod considering that if the clouds were electrized positively the rod which received its electricity from them must be so too and then the additional positive electricity of the phial would make the bells ring faster but if the clouds were in a negative state they must exhaust the electric fluid from my rod and bring that into the same negative state with themselves and then the wire of a positively charged phial supplying the rod with what is wanted which it was obliged otherwise to draw from the earth by means of the pendulous brass ball playing between the two bells the ringing would cease till the bottle was discharged in this manner i quite discharged into the rod several phials that were charged from the glass globe the electric fluid streaming from the wire to the rod till the wire would receive no spark from the finger and during this supply to the rod from the phial the bells stopped ringing but by continuing the application of the phial wire to the rod i exhausted the natural quantity from the inside     surface of the same phials or as i call it charged them negatively at length while i was charging a phial by my glass globe to repeat the experiment my bells of themselves stopped ringing and after some pause began to ring again but now when i approached the wire of the charged phial to the rod instead of the usual stream that i expected from the wire to the rod there was no spark—not even when i brought the wire and the rod to touch yet the bells continued ringing vigorously which proved to me that the rod was then positively electrified as well as the wire of the phial and equally so and consequently that the particular cloud then over the rod was in the same positive state this was near the end of the gust but this was a single experiment which however destroys my first too general conclusion and reduces me to this that the clouds of a thundergust are most commonly in a negative state of electricity but sometimes in a positive state the latter i believe is rare for though i soon after the last experiment set out on a journey to boston and was from home most part of the summer which prevented my making further trials and observations yet mr kinnersley returning from the islands just as i left home pursued the experiments during my absence and informs me that he always found the clouds in the negative state so that for the most part in thunderstrokes it is the earth that strikes into the clouds and not the clouds that strike into the earth     those who are versed in electric experiments will easily conceive that the effects and appearances must be nearly the same in either case the same explosion and the same flash between one cloud and another and between the clouds and mountains c the same rending of trees walls c which the electric fluid meets with in its passage and the same fatal shock to animal bodies and that pointed rods fixed on buildings or masts of ships and communicating with the earth or sea must be of the same service in restoring the equilibrium silently between the earth and clouds or in conducting a flash or stroke if one should be so as to save harmless the house or vessel for points have equal power to throw off as to draw on the electric fire and rods will conduct up as well as down but though the light gained from these experiments makes no alteration in the practice it makes a considerable one in the theory and now we as much need an hypothesis to explain by what means the clouds become negatively as before to show how they become positively electrified i cannot forbear venturing some few conjectures on this occasion they are what occur to me at present and though future discoveries should prove them not wholly right yet they may in the meantime be of some use by stirring up the curious to make more experiments and occasion more exact disquisitions i conceive then that this globe of earth and water with its plants animals and buildings have diffused throughout their substance a quantity of     the electric fluid just as much as they can contain which i call the natural quantity that this natural quantity is not the same in all kinds of common matter under the same dimensions nor in the same kind of common matter in all circumstances but a solid foot for instance of one kind of common matter may contain more of the electric fluid than a solid foot of some other kind of common matter and a pound weight of the same kind of common matter may when in a rarer state contain more of the electric fluid than when in a denser state for the electric fluid being attracted by any portion of common matter the parts of that fluid which have among themselves a mutual repulsion are brought so near to each other by the attraction of the common matter that absorbs them as that their repulsion is equal to the condensing power of attraction in common matter and then such portion of common matter will absorb no more bodies of different kinds having thus attracted and absorbed what i call their natural quantity that is just as much of the electric fluid as is suited to their circumstances of density rarity and power of attracting do not then show any signs of electricity among each other and if more electric fluid be added to one of these bodies it does not enter but spreads on the surface forming an atmosphere and then such body shows signs of electricity i have in a former paper compared common matter to a sponge and the electric fluid to water i beg leave once more to make use of the same     comparison to illustrate farther my meaning in this particular when a sponge is somewhat condensed by being squeezed between the fingers it will not receive and retain so much water as when in its more loose and open state if more squeezed and condensed some of the water will come out of its inner parts and flow on the surface if the pressure of the fingers be entirely removed the sponge will not only resume what was lately forced out but attract an additional quantity as the sponge in its rarer state will naturally attract and absorb more water and in its denser state will naturally attract and absorb less water we may call the quantity it attracts and absorbs in either state its natural quantity the state being considered now what the sponge is to water the same is water to the electric fluid when a portion of water is in its common dense state it can hold no more electric fluid than it has if any be added it spreads on the surface when the same portion of water is rarefied into vapor and forms a cloud it is then capable of receiving and absorbing a much greater quantity there is room for each particle to have an electric atmosphere thus water in its rarefied state or in the form of a cloud will be in a negative state of electricity it will have less than its natural quantity—that is less than it is naturally capable of attracting and absorbing in that state     such a cloud then coming so near the earth as to be within the striking distance will receive from the earth a flash of the electric fluid which flash to supply a great extent of cloud must sometimes contain a very great quantity of that fluid or such a cloud passing over woods of tall trees may from the points and sharp edges of their moist top leaves receive silently some supply a cloud being by any means supplied from the earth may strike into other clouds that have not been supplied or not so much supplied and those to others till an equilibrium is produced among all the clouds that are within striking distance of each other the cloud thus supplied having parted with much of what it first received may require and receive a fresh supply from the earth or from some other cloud which by the wind is brought into such a situation as to receive it more readily from the earth hence repeated and continual strokes and flashes till the clouds have all got nearly their natural quantity as clouds or till they have descended in showers and are united again with this terraqueous globe their original thus thunderclouds are generally in a negative state of electricity compared with the earth agreeable to most of our experiments yet as by one experiment we found a cloud electrized positively i conjecture that in that case such cloud after having received what was in its rare state only its natural quantity became compressed by the driving winds or some other means so that part of what it     had absorbed was forced out and formed an electric atmosphere around it in its denser state hence it was capable of communicating positive electricity to my rod to show that a body in different circumstances of dilatation and contraction is capable of receiving and retaining more or less of the electric fluid on its surface i would relate the following experiment i placed a clean wineglass on the floor and on it a small silver can in the can i put about three yards of brass chain to one end of which i fastened a silk thread which went right up to the ceiling where it passed over a pulley and came down again to my hand that i might at pleasure draw the chain up out of the can extending it till within a foot of the ceiling and let it gradually sink into the can again from the ceiling by another thread of fine raw silk i suspended a small light lock of cotton so as that when it hung perpendicularly it came in contact with the side of the can then approaching the wire of a charged phial to the can i gave it a spark which flowed round in an electric atmosphere and the lock of cotton was repelled from the side of the can to the distance of about nine or ten inches the can would not then receive another spark from the wire of the phial but as i gradually drew up the chain the atmosphere of the can diminished by flowing over the rising chain and the lock of cotton accordingly drew nearer and nearer to the can and then if i again brought the phial wire near the can it would receive another spark and the cotton fly off again to its first distance and thus as the chain     was drawn higher the can would receive more sparks because the can and extended chain were capable of supporting a greater atmosphere than the can with the chain gathered up into its belly and that the atmosphere round the can was diminished by raising the chain and increased again by lowering is not only agreeable to reason since the atmosphere of the chain must be drawn from that of the can when it rose and returned to it again when it fell but was also evident to the eye the lock of cotton always approaching the can when the chain was drawn up and receding when it was let down again thus we see that increase of surface makes a body capable of receiving a greater electric atmosphere but this experiment does not i own fully demonstrate my new hypothesis for the brass and silver still continue in their solid state and are not rarefied into vapor as the water is in clouds perhaps some future experiments on vaporized water may set this matter in a clearer light one seemingly material objection arises to the new hypothesis and it is this if water in its rarefied state as a cloud requires and will absorb more of the electric fluid than when in its dense state as water why does it not require from the earth all its wants at the instant of its leaving the surface while it is yet near and but just rising in vapor to this difficulty i own i cannot at present give a solution satisfactory to myself i thought however that i ought to state it in its full force as i have done and submit the whole to examination and i would beg leave to recommend it to the     curious in this branch of natural philosophy to repeat with care and accurate observation the experiments i have reported in this and former papers relating to positive and negative electricity with such other relative ones as shall occur to them that it may be certainly known whether the electricity communicated by a glass globe be really positive and also i would request all who may have the opportunity of observing the recent effects of lightning on buildings trees c that they would consider them particularly with a view to discover the direction but in these examinations this one thing is always to be understood viz that a stream of the electric fluid passing through wood brick metal c while such fluid passes in small quantity the mutually repulsive power of its parts is confined and overcome by the cohesion of the parts of the body it passes through so as to prevent an explosion but when the fluid comes in a quantity too great to be confined by such cohesion it explodes and rends or fuses the body that endeavoured to confine it if it be wood brick stone or the like the splinters will fly off on that side where there is least resistance and thus when a hole is struck through pasteboard by the electrified jar if the surfaces of the pasteboard are not confined or compressed there will be a bur raised all round the hole on both sides the pasteboard but if one side be confined so that the bur cannot be raised on that side it will be all raised on the other which way soever the fluid was directed for the bur round the outside of the hole is the effect of the explosion every way from     the centre of the stream and not an effect of the direction in every stroke of lightning i am of opinion that the stream of the electric fluid moving to restore the equilibrium between the cloud and the earth does always previously find its passage and mark out as i may say its own course taking in its way all the conductors it can find such as metals damp walls moist wood c and will go considerably out of a direct course for the sake of the assistance of good conductors and that in this course it is actually moving though silently and imperceptibly before the explosion in and among the conductors which explosion happens only when the conductors cannot discharge it as fast as they receive it by reason of their being incomplete disunited too small or not of the best materials for conducting metalline rods therefore of sufficient thickness and extending from the highest part of an edifice to the ground being of the best materials and complete conductors will i think secure the building from damage either by restoring the equilibrium so fast as to prevent a stroke or by conducting it in the substance of the rod as far as the rod goes so that there shall be no explosion but what is above its point between that and the clouds if it be asked what thickness of a metalline rod may be supposed sufficient in answer i would remark that five large glass jars such as i have described in my former papers discharge a very great quantity of electricity which nevertheless will be all conducted round the corner of a book by the fine   0 filleting of gold on the cover it following the gold the farthest way about rather than take the shorter course through the cover that not being so good a conductor now in this line of gold the metal is so extremely thin as to be little more than the color of gold and on an octavo book is not in the whole an inch square and therefore not the thirtysixth part of a grain according to m réaumur yet it is sufficient to conduct the charge of five large jars and how many more i know not now i suppose a wire of a quarter of an inch diameter to contain about five thousand times as much metal as there is in that gold line and if so it will conduct the charge of twentyfive thousand such glass jars which is a quantity i imagine far beyond what was ever contained in any one stroke of natural lightning but a rod of half an inch diameter would conduct four times as much as one of a quarter and with regard to conducting though a certain thickness of metal be required to conduct a great quantity of electricity and at the same time keep its own substance firm and unseparated and a less quantity as a very small wire for instance will be destroyed by the explosion yet such small wire will have answered the end of conducting that stroke though it become incapable of conducting another and considering the extreme rapidity with which the electric fluid moves without exploding when it has a free passage or complete metal communication i should think a vast quantity would be conducted in a short time either to or from a cloud to restore its equilibrium with the earth by means of a very     small wire and therefore thick rods should seem not so necessary however as the quantity of lightning discharged in one stroke cannot well be measured and in different strokes is certainly very various in some much greater than in others and as iron the best metal for the purpose being least apt to fuse is cheap it may be well enough to provide a larger canal to guide that impetuous blast than we imagine necessary for though one middling wire may be sufficient two or three can do no harm and time with careful observations well compared will at length point out the proper size to greater certainty pointed rods erected on edifices may likewise often prevent a stroke in the following manner an eye so situated as to view horizontally the under side of a thundercloud will see it very ragged with a number of separate fragments or petty clouds one under another the lowest sometimes not far from the earth these as so many steppingstones assist in conducting a stroke between the cloud and a building to represent these by an experiment take two or three locks of fine loose cotton connect one of them with the prime conductor by a fine thread of two inches which may be spun out of the same lock by the fingers another to that and the third to the second by like threads turn the globe and you will see these locks extend themselves towards the table as the lower small clouds do towards the earth being attracted by it but on presenting a sharp point erect under the lowest it will shrink up to the second the second to the first and all     together to the prime conductor where they will continue as long as the point continues under them may not in like manner the small electrized clouds whose equilibrium with the earth is soon restored by the point rise up to the main body and by that means occasion so large a vacancy as that the grand cloud cannot strike in that place these thoughts my dear friend are many of them crude and hasty and if i were merely ambitious of acquiring some reputation in philosophy i ought to keep them by me till corrected and improved by time and farther experience but since even short hints and imperfect experiments in any new branch of science being communicated have oftentimes a good effect in exciting the attention of the ingenious to the subject and so become the occasion of more exact disquisition and more complete discoveries you are at liberty to communicate this paper to whom you please it being of more importance that knowledge should increase than that your friend should be

of the new airpump is in a piece of mr watsons read to the royal society february  0th      where describing     some experiments he made in vacuo he says the more complete the vacuum cæteris paribus the more considerable were the effects and here i should not do justice to real merit were i silent in regard to mr smeaton this gentleman with a genius truly mechanical which enables him to give to such philosophical instruments as he executes a degree of perfection scarce to be found elsewhere this gentleman i say has constructed an airpump by which we are empowered to make boyles vacuum much more perfect than heretofore by a well conducted experiment which admits of no doubt as to its truth i have seen by this pump the air rarefied to one thousand times its natural state whereas commonly we seldom arrive at above one hundred and fifty as the promotion of the mechanic arts is a considerable object of our excellent institution if this gentleman could be prevailed upon to communicate to the royal society that particular construction of his airpump which enables it to execute so much more than those commonly in use it would not fail to be an acceptable present so far mr watson in april following was read a letter from mr smeaton in which he describes his improvement and gives a draft of his pump the whole too long to transcribe but it appears to me that the machine being rather simplified than made more complex can scarce cost more than one of the old sort though the price is not mentioned by only turning a cock it is at pleasure made a condensing engine an advantage the others have not i have seen nothing of your searchers mr parker     has received bower but writes me that he is at a loss how to send it and desires you would order somebody to call for it i shall send the dollars for mr mix per next post for i fancy you will not now buy this apparatus here but choose the new airpump from england with my respects to all friends i am c b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia peter collinson cvi to peter collinson philadelphia    november      dear friend— in my last via virginia i promised to send you per next ship a small philosophical packet but now having got the materials old letters and rough drafts before me i fear you will find it a great one nevertheless as i am like to have a few days leisure before this ship sails which i may not have again in a long time i shall transcribe the whole and send it for you will be under no necessity of reading it all at once but may take it a little at a time now and then of a winter evening when you happen to have nothing else to do if that ever happens it may afford you some amusement b franklin proposal of an experiment to measure the time taken up by an electric spark in moving through any given space by james alexander of new york read at the royal society december         if i remember right the royal society made one experiment to discover the velocity of the electric fire by a     wire of about four miles in length supported by silk and by turning it forwards and backwards in a field so that the beginning and end of the wire were at only the distance of two people the one holding the leyden bottle and the beginning of the wire and the other holding the end of the wire and touching the ring of the bottle but by this experiment no discovery was made except that the velocity was extremely quick as water is a conductor as well as metals it is to be considered whether the velocity of the electric fire might not be discovered by means of water whether a river or lake or sea may not be made part of the circuit through which the electric fire passes instead of the circuit all of wire as in the above experiment whether in a river lake or sea the electric fire will not dissipate and not return to the bottle or will it proceed in straight lines through the water the shortest course possible back to the bottle if the last then suppose one brook that falls into delaware doth head very near to a brook that falls into schuylkill and let a wire be stretched and supported as before from the head of one brook to the head of the other and let the one end communicate with the water and let one person stand in the other brook holding the leyden bottle and let another person hold that end of the wire not in the water and touch the ring of the bottle if the electric fire will go as in the last question then will it go down the one brook to delaware or schuylkill and down one of them to their meeting and up the other and the other brook the time of its doing this may possibly be observable and the farther upwards the brooks are chosen the more observable it would be should this be not observable then suppose the two brooks falling into susquehanna and delaware and proceeding as before the electric fire may by that means     make a circuit round the north cape of virginia and go many hundreds of miles and in doing that it would seem it must take some observable time if still no observable time is found in that experiment then suppose the brooks falling the one into the ohio and the other into susquehanna or potomac in that the electric fire would have a circuit of some thousands of miles to go down ohio to mississippi to the bay of mexico round florida and round the south cape of virginia which i think would give some observable time and discover exactly the velocity but if the electric fire dissipates or weakens in the water as i fear it does these experiments will not answer answer to the foregoing read at the royal society december         suppose a tube of any length open at both ends and containing a movable wire of just the same length that fills its bore if i attempt to introduce the end of another wire into the same tube it must be done by pushing forward the wire it already contains and the instant i press and move one end of that wire the other end is also moved and in introducing one inch of the same wire i extrude at the same time an inch of the first from the other end of the tube if the tube be filled with water and i inject an additional inch of water at one end i force out an equal quantity at the other in the very same instant and the water forced out at one end of the tube is   0 not the very same water that was forced in at the other end at the same time it was only in motion at the same time the long wire made use of in the experiment to discover the velocity of the electric fluid is itself filled with what we call its natural quantity of that fluid before the hook of the leyden bottle is applied to one end of it the outside of the bottle being at the time of such application in contact with the other end of the wire the whole quantity of electric fluid contained in the wire is probably put in motion at once for at the instant the hook connected with the inside of the bottle gives out the coating or outside of the bottle draws in a portion of that fluid if such long wire contains precisely the quantity that the outside of the bottle demands the whole will move out of the wire to the outside of the bottle and the over quantity which the inside of the bottle contained being exactly equal will flow into the wire and remain there in the place of the quantity the wire had just parted with to the outside of the bottle but if the wire be so long as that one tenth suppose of its natural quantity is sufficient to supply what the outside of the bottle demands in such case the outside will only receive what is contained in one tenth of the wires length from the end next to it though the whole will move so as to make room at the other end for an equal quantity issuing at the same time from the inside of the bottle so that this experiment only shows the extreme     facility with which the electric fluid moves in metal it can never determine the velocity and therefore the proposed experiment though well imagined and very ingenious of sending the spark round through a vast length of space by the waters of susquehanna or potomac and ohio would not afford the satisfaction desired though we could be sure that the motion of the electric fluid would be in that tract and not under ground in the wet earth by the shortest way b franklin physical and meteorological observations conjectures and suppositions read at the royal society june        the particles of air are kept at a distance from each other by their mutual repulsion every three particles mutually and equally repelling each other must form an equilateral triangle all the particles of air gravitate towards the earth which gravitation compresses them and shortens the sides of the triangles otherwise their mutual repellency would force them to greater distances from each other whatever particles of other matter not endued with that repellency are supported in air must adhere to the particles of air and be supported by them for in the vacancies there is nothing they can rest on     air and water mutually attract each other hence water will dissolve in air as salt in water the specific gravity of matter is not altered by dividing the matter though the superficies be increased sixteen leaden bullets of an ounce each weigh as much in water as one of a pound whose superficies is less therefore the supporting of salt in water is not owing to its superficies being increased a lump of salt though laid at rest at the bottom of a vessel of water will dissolve therein and its parts move every way till equally diffused in the water therefore there is a mutual attraction between water and salt every particle of water assumes as many of salt as can adhere to it when more is added it precipitates and will not remain suspended water in the same manner will dissolve in air every particle of air assuming one or more particles of water when too much is added it precipitates in rain but there not being the same contiguity between the particles of air as of water the solution of water in air is not carried on without a motion of the air so as to cause a fresh accession of dry particles part of a fluid having more of what it dissolves will communicate to other parts that have less thus very salt water coming in contact with fresh communicates its saltness till all is equal and the sooner if there is a little motion of the water even earth will dissolve or mix with air a stroke of a horses hoof on the ground in a hot dusty     road will raise a cloud of dust that shall if there be a light breeze expand every way till perhaps near as big as a common house it is not by mechanical motion communicated to the particles of dust by the hoof that they fly so far nor by the wind that they spread so wide but the air near the ground more heated by the hot dust struck into it is rarefied and rises and in rising mixes with the cooler air and communicates of its dust to it and it is at length so diffused as to become invisible quantities of dust are thus carried up in dry seasons showers wash it from the air and bring it down again for water attracting it stronger it quits the air and adheres to the water air suffering continual changes in the degrees of its heat from various causes and circumstances and consequently changes in its specific gravity must therefore be in continual motion a small quantity of fire mixed with water or degree of heat therein so weakens the cohesion of its particles that those on the surface easily quit it and adhere to the particles of air a greater degree of heat is required to break the cohesion between water and air air moderately heated will support a greater quantity of water invisibly than cold air for its particles being by heat repelled to a greater distance from each other thereby more easily keep the particles of water that are annexed to them from running into cohesions that would obstruct refract or reflect the light hence when we breathe in warm air though the     same quantity of moisture may be taken up from the lungs as when we breathe in cold air yet that moisture is not so visible water being extremely heated that is to the degree of boiling its particles in quitting it so repel each other as to take up vastly more space than before and by that repellency support themselves expelling the air from the space they occupy that degree of heat being lessened they again mutually attract and having no air particles mixed to adhere to by which they might be supported and kept at a distance they instantly fall coalesce and become water again the water commonly diffused in our atmosphere never receives such a degree of heat from the sun or other cause as water has when boiling it is not therefore supported by such heat but by adhering to air water being dissolved in and adhering to air that air will not readily take up oil because of the mutual repellency between water and oil hence cold oils evaporate but slowly the air having generally a quantity of dissolved water oil being heated extremely the air that approaches its surface will be also heated extremely the water then quitting it it will attract and carry off oil which can now adhere to it hence the quick evaporation of oil heated to a great degree oil being dissolved in air the particles to which it adheres will not take up water hence the suffocating nature of air impregnated with burnt grease as from snuffs of candles and the like a certain quantity of moisture should be     every moment discharged and taken away from the lungs air that has been frequently breathed is already overloaded and for that reason can take no more so will not answer the end greasy air refuses to touch it in both cases suffocation for want of the discharge air will attract and support many other substances a particle of air loaded with adhering water or any other matter is heavier than before and would descend the atmosphere supposed at rest a loaded descending particle must act with a force on the particles it passes between or meets with sufficient to overcome in some degree their mutual repellency and push them nearer to each other  thus supposing the particles a b c d and the other near them to be at the distance caused by their mutual repellency confined by their common gravity if a would descend to e it must pass between b and c when it comes between b and c it will be nearer to them than before and must either have pushed them nearer to f and g contrary to their mutual repellency or pass through by a force exceeding its repellency with them it then approaches d and to move it out of the way must act on it with a force sufficient to overcome its repellency with the two next lower particles by which it is kept in its present situation     every particle of air therefore will bear any load inferior to the force of these repulsions hence the support of fogs mists clouds very warm air clear though supporting a very great quantity of moisture will grow turbid and cloudy on the mixture of a colder air as foggy turbid air will grow clear by warming thus the sun shining on a morning fog dissipates it clouds are seen to waste in a sunshiny day but cold condenses and renders visible the vapor a tankard or decanter filled with cold water will condense the moisture of warm clear air on its outside where it becomes visible as dew coalesces into drops descends in little streams the sun heats the air of our atmosphere most near the surface of the earth for there besides the direct rays there are many reflections moreover the earth itself being heated communicates of its heat to the neighbouring air the higher regions having only the direct rays of the sun passing through them are comparatively very cold hence the cold air on the tops of mountains and snow on some of them all the year even in the torrid zone hence hail in summer if the atmosphere were all of it both above and below always of the same temper as to cold or heat then the upper air would always be rarer than the lower because the pressure on it is less consequently lighter and therefore would keep its place but the upper air may be more condensed by cold than the lower air by pressure the lower more     expanded by heat than the upper for want of pressure in such case the upper air will become the heavier the lower the lighter the lower region of air being heated and expanded heaves up and supports for some time the colder heavier air above and will continue to support it while the equilibrium is kept thus water is supported in an inverted open glass while the equilibrium is maintained by the equal pressure upwards of the air below but the equilibrium by any means breaking the water descends on the heavier side and the air rises into its place the lifted heavy cold air over a heated country becoming by any means unequally supported or unequal in its weight the heaviest part descends first and the rest follows impetuously hence gusts after heats and hurricanes in hot climates hence the air of gusts and hurricanes cold though in hot climates and seasons it coming from above the cold air descending from above as it penetrates our warm region full of watery particles condenses them renders them visible forms a cloud thick and dark overcasting sometimes at once large and extensive sometimes when seen at a distance small at first gradually increasing the cold edge or surface of the cloud condensing the vapors next it which form smaller clouds that join it increase its bulk it descends with the wind and its acquired weight draws nearer the earth grows denser with continual additions of water and discharges heavy showers small black clouds thus appearing in a clear sky     in hot climates portend storms and warn seamen to hand their sails the earth turning on its axis in about twentyfour hours the equatorial parts must move about fifteen miles in each minute in northern and southern latitudes this motion is gradually less to the poles and there nothing if there was a general calm over the face of the globe it must be by the airs moving in every part as fast as the earth or sea it covers he that sails or rides has insensibly the same degree of motion as the ship or coach with which he is connected if the ship strikes the shore or the coach stops suddenly the motion continuing in the man he is thrown forward if a man were to jump from the land into a swiftsailing ship he would be thrown backward or towards the stern not having at first the motion of the ship he that travels by sea or land towards the equinoctial gradually acquires motion from it loses but if a man were taken up from latitude  0 where suppose the earths surface to move twelve miles per minute and immediately set down at the equinoctial without changing the motion he had his heels would be struck up he would fall westward if taken up from the equinoctial and set down in latitude  0 he would fall eastward the air under the equator and between the tropics being constantly heated and rarefied by the sun rises its place is supplied by air from northern and southern latitudes which coming from parts where the earth and air had less motion and not     suddenly acquiring the quicker motion of the equatorial earth  appears an east wind blowing westward the earth moving from west to east and slipping under the air thus when we ride in a calm it seems a wind against us if we ride with the wind and faster even that will seem a small wind against us the air rarefied between the tropics and rising must flow in the higher region north and south before it rose it had acquired the greatest motion the earths rotation could give it it retains some degree of this motion and descending in higher latitudes where the earths motion is less will appear a westerly wind yet tending towards the equatorial parts to supply the vacancy occasioned by the air of the lower regions flowing thitherwards hence our general cold winds are about northwest our summer cold gusts the same the air in sultry weather though not cloudy has a kind of haziness in it which makes objects at a distance appear dull and indistinct this haziness is occasioned by the great quantity of moisture equally diffused in that air when by the cold wind blowing down among it it is condensed into clouds and falls in rain the air becomes purer and clearer hence after gusts distant objects appear distinct their figures sharply terminated extreme cold winds congeal the surface of the earth by carrying off its fire warm winds afterwards   0 blowing over that frozen surface will be chilled by it could that frozen surface be turned under and a warmer turned up from beneath it those warm winds would not be chilled so much the surface of the earth is also sometimes much heated by the sun and such heated surface not being changed heats the air that moves over it seas lakes and great bodies of water agitated by the winds continually change surfaces the cold surface in winter is turned under by the rolling of the waves and a warmer turned up in summer the warm is turned under and colder turned up hence the more equal temper of sea water and the air over it hence in winter winds from the sea seem warm winds from the land cold in summer the contrary therefore the lakes northwest of us  as they are not so much frozen nor so apt to freeze as the earth rather moderate than increase the coldness of our winter winds the air over the sea being warmer and therefore lighter in winter than the air over the frozen land may be another cause of our general northwest winds which blow off to sea at right angles from our north american coast the warm light sea air rising the heavy cold land air pressing into its place heavy fluids descending frequently form eddies or whirlpools as is seen in a funnel where the water acquires a circular motion receding every way from a centre and leaving a vacancy in the middle greatest above and lessening downwards like a speakingtrumpet its big end upwards     air descending or ascending may form the same kind of eddies or whirlings the parts of air acquiring a circular motion and receding from the middle of the circle by a centrifugal force and leaving there a vacancy if descending greatest above and lessening downwards if ascending greatest below and lessening upwards like a speakingtrumpet standing its big end on the ground when the air descends with violence in some places it may rise with equal violence in others and form both kinds of whirlwinds the air in its whirling motion receding every way from the centre or axis of the trumpet leaves there a vacuum which cannot be filled through the sides the whirling air as an arch preventing it must then press in at the open ends the greatest pressure inwards must be at the lower end the greatest weight of the surrounding atmosphere being there the air entering rises within and carries up dust leaves and even heavier bodies that happen in its way as the eddy or whirl passes over land if it passes over water the weight of the surrounding atmosphere forces up the water into the vacuity part of which by degrees joins with the whirling air and adding weight and receiving accelerated motion recedes still farther from the centre or axis of the trump as the pressure lessens and at last as the trump widens is broken into small particles and so united with air as to be supported by it and become black clouds at the top of the trump thus these eddies may be whirlwinds at land     waterspouts at sea a body of water so raised may be suddenly let fall when the motion c has not strength to support it or the whirling arch is broken so as to admit the air falling in the sea it is harmless unless ships happen under it but if in the progressive motion of the whirl it has moved from the sea over the land and then breaks sudden violent and mischievous torrents are the consequences b franklin end of vol ii   from the pennsylvania gazette october  0        from the

explained by the following address contained in poor richards almanac for the year      loving readers your kind acceptance of my former labors has encouraged me to continue writing though the general approbation you have been so good as to favor me with has excited the envy of some and drawn upon me the malice of others these illwillers of mine despited at the great reputation i gained by exactly predicting another mans death have endeavoured to deprive me of it all at once in the most effectual manner by reporting that i myself was never alive they say in short that there is no such man as i am and have spread this notion so thoroughly in the country that i have been frequently told it to my face by those that dont know me this is not civil treatment to endeavour to deprive me of my very being and reduce me to a nonentity in the opinion of the public but so long as i know myself to walk about eat drink and sleep i am satisfied that there is really such a man as i am whatever they may say to the contrary and the world may be satisfied likewise for if there were no such man as i am how is it possible i should appear publicly to hundreds of people as i have done for several years past in print i need not indeed have taken any notice of so idle a report if it had not been for the sake of my printer to whom my enemies are pleased to ascribe my productions and who it seems is as unwilling to father my offspring as i am to lose the credit of it therefore to clear him entirely as well as to vindicate my own honor i make this public and serious declaration which i desire may be believed to wit that what i have written heretofore and do now write neither was nor is written by any other man or men person or persons whatsoever those who are not satisfied with this must needs be

but in no previous collection it is taken from the newspaper published by franklin pennsylvania gazette dec         but it is dated several years earlier than any of his other pieces on philosophical

respecting their causes—sparks   this paper appears to contain the first suggestion in any public form for an american philosophical society   this was in reply to an ingenious suggestion which partially anticipated the more modern systems of stereotyping the author of it mr colden was born in scotland on the   th of february      was educated at the university of edinburgh came to

in the eightyninth year of his age soon after taking up his residence in new york he abandoned his profession and entered public life maintaining however meanwhile an extensive correspondence especially with the eminent men of science both at home and abroad he held the offices of surveyorgeneral of the province master in chancery member of the council and lieutenantgovernor which latter dignity he filled for some fifteen years he wrote several treatises on medical mathematical and philosophical subjects and a history of the five indian nations which is still read in his letter he solicits a correspondence with franklin in his reply franklin promises to consider his proposal for a new method of printing very particularly and attentively and in a post or two to send some observations on every article but no such observations have been found nor is it likely that any were written—editor   benjamin mecom a nephew of dr franklin whom he seems to have taken particularly under his charge   for an exposition of franklins motives in writing this pamphlet see supra vol i p       body or matter of any sort is said to be specifically heavier or lighter than other matter when it has more or less substance or weight in the same dimensions   as the writer is neither physician nor philosopher the reader may expect he should justify these opinions by the authority of some that are so m clare frs in his treatise of the motion of fluids says p     c and here it may be remarked that it is more prejudicial to health to sit near a window or door in a room where there are many candles and a fire than in a room without for the consumption of air thereby occasioned will always be very considerable and this must necessarily be replaced by cold air from without down the chimney can enter none the stream of warm air always arising therein absolutely forbids it the supply must therefore come in wherever other openings shall be found if these happen to be small let those who sit near them beware the smaller the floodgate the smarter will be the stream was a man even in a sweat to leap into a cold bath or jump from his warm bed in the intensest cold even in a frost provided he do not continue overlong therein and be in health when he does this we see by experience that he gets no harm if he sits a little while against a window into which a successive current of cold air comes his pores are closed and he gets a fever in the first case the shock the body endures is general uniform and therefore less fierce in the other a single part a neck or ear perchance is attacked and that with the greater violence probably as it is done by a successive stream of cold air and the cannon of a battery pointed against a single part of a bastion will easier make a breach than were they directed to play singly upon the whole face and will admit the enemy much sooner into the town that warm rooms and keeping the body warm in winter are means of preventing such diseases take the opinion of that learned italian physician antonino parcio in the preface to his tract de militis sanitate tuendâ where speaking of a particular wet and cold winter remarkable at venice for its sickliness he says popularis autem pleuritis quæ venetiis sæviit mensibus dec jan feb ex cœli aërisque inclementiâ facta est quod non habeant hypocausta stoverooms et quod non soliciti

absumti dicebant vix unus aut alter illis temporibus pleuritide fuit correptus the great dr boerhaave whose authority alone might be sufficient in his aphorisms mentions as one antecedent cause of pleurisies a cold air driven violently through some narrow passage upon the body overheated by labor or fire the eastern physicians agree with the europeans in this point witness the chinese treatise tschang seng—that is the art of procuring health and long life as translated in père du haldes account of china which has this passage as of all the passions which ruffle us anger doth the most mischief so of all the malignant affections of the air a wind that comes through any narrow passage which is cold and piercing is most dangerous and coming upon us unawares insinuates itself into the body often causing grievous diseases it should therefore be avoided according to the advice of the ancient proverb as carefully as the point of an arrow these mischiefs are avoided by the use of the newinvented fireplaces as will be shown hereafter   the shutter is slid up and down in this manner only in those fireplaces which are so made as that the distance between the top of the arched opening and the bottom plate is the same as the distance between it and the top plate where the arch is higher as it is in the draft annexed which is agreeable to the last improvements the shutter is set by and applied occasionally because if it were made deep enough to close the whole opening when slid down it would hide part of it when up   my lord molesworth in his account of denmark says that few or none of the people there are troubled with coughs catarrhs consumptions or such like diseases of the lungs so that in the midst of winter in the churches which are very much frequented there is no noise to interrupt the attention due to the preacher i am persuaded says he their warm stoves contribute to their freedom from these kinds of maladies   people who have used these fireplaces differ much in their accounts of the wood saved by them some say five sixths others three fourths and others much less this is owing to the great difference there was in their former fires some according to the different circumstances of their rooms and chimneys having been used to make very large others middling and others of a more sparing temper very small ones while in these fireplaces their size and draft being nearly the same the consumption is more equal i suppose taking a number of families together that two thirds or half the wood at least is saved my common room i know is made twice as warm as it used to be with a quarter of the wood i formerly consumed there   mr boyle in his experiments and observations upon cold shaws abridgment vol i p     says it is remarkable that while the cold has strange and tragical effects at moscow and elsewhere the russians and livonians should be exempt from them who accustom themselves to pass immediately from a great degree of heat to as great a one of cold without receiving any visible prejudice thereby i remember being told by a person of unquestionable credit that it was a common practice among them to go from a hot stove into cold water the same was also affirmed to me by another who resided at moscow this tradition is likewise abundantly confirmed by olearius it is a surprising thing says he to see how far the russians can endure heat and how when it makes them ready to faint they can go out of their stoves stark naked both men and women and throw themselves into cold water and even in winter wallow in the snow    see page    where the trapdoor is described that ought to be in this closing   when this pamphlet was first printed a copy of it was sent by mr cadwallader colden to the celebrated gronovius with a letter from which the following is an extract i send with this a curious and new invention for warming a room with a small fire and more effectually than can be done by a large fire in the common method and is free of the inconveniences which attend the dutch and german stoves because by this contrivance there is a continual supply of fresh warm air it may be particularly useful to you and dr linnæus by preserving your health while it keeps you warm at your studies it is the invention of mr benjamin franklin of philadelphia the printer of it a very ingenious man to this passage gronovius replied as follows in a letter dated at leyden july        i am very much obliged to you for mr franklins book which i dont doubt the next letter shall bring to you translated into dutch—sparks   the american philosophical society as afterwards instituted was formed out of two societies of which this was one the other was the society for promoting and propagating useful knowledge the two societies were incorporated into one called the american philosophical society in december      and in january      franklin was elected the first president although he was at that time in england   it does not appear that this scheme was ever carried into execution   dr john mitchell was a learned physician and botanist and fellow of the royal society he was a native of england but came over and established himself in virginia dr miller says that he wrote ably on the yellow fever as it appeared in virginia in      and that his instructive manuscripts on this subject fell into the hands of dr franklin by whom they were communicated to dr rush—millers retrospect vol i p       the father of dr samuel bard of whom an interesting memoir has been published by professor mcvickar   a printer in new york   the expedition against cape breton proved successful by the surrender of louisburg on the   th of june the news arrived in boston on the  d of july   two of the more elaborate of franklins jokes in the pennsylvania gazette says mr parton in his charming biography of franklin have escaped the vigilance of editors hitherto the speech of polly baker is one of these which is not only humorous but well rebukes the cruel immorality which sent a poor miserable drab to the whippingpost and invited her seducer to dinner this speech was a current joke in the colonial press for thirty years and continued to be occasionally reprinted after the revolution it was inserted in the gazette franklin tells us to amuse the town at a time when there was little news stirring   the first edition of this pamphlet seems to be out of print the second at the close of which first appeared the foregoing translation was printed in      the publication was provoked by the defenceless condition of the colony at that time exposed as it was to spain on the south and to france on the west with both of which nations great britain was then at war to say nothing of the indians who like the poor they had always with them the efforts to induce the quaker assembly of pennsylvania to pass a militia law and make other provisions for the security of the province having proved abortive franklin proposed to try what might be done by voluntary subscription of the people to promote this he says in his autobiography i first wrote and published a pamphlet entitled plain truth its success was extraordinary see autobiography vol i p     an answer to it entitled necessary truth and enforcing the quaker doctrine of nonresistance was published in      it came too late to impair if it ever could have impaired the impression left upon the colony by plain truth substituting the words united states for pennsylvania this pamphlet is as timely today      as when it was written though we are at peace with all nations we have many times as many lives and many times as much property exposed while our defences are relatively inferior to those which franklin denounced nearly a century and a half ago as inexcusably deficient   the praying indians   by accounts the ragged crew of the spanish privateer that plundered mr listons and another plantation a little below newcastle was composed of such as these the honor and humanity of their officers may be judged of by the treatment they gave poor captain brown whom they took with martins ship in returning from their cruise because he bravely defended himself and vessel longer than they expected for which every generous enemy would have esteemed him did they after he had struck and submitted barbarously stab and murder him though on his knees begging quarter   when god determined to punish his chosen people the inhabitants of jerusalem who though breakers of his other laws were scrupulous observers of that one which required keeping

in sallust   this power of points to throw off the electrical fire was first communicated to me by my ingenious friend mr thomas hopkinson since deceased whose virtue and integrity in every station of life public and private will ever make his memory dear to those who knew him and knew how to value him—f   this was mr hopkinsons experiment made with an expectation of drawing a more sharp and powerful spark from the point as from a kind of focus and he was surprised to find little or none—f   we suppose every particle of sand moisture or smoke being first attracted and then repelled carries off with it a portion of the electrical fire but that the same still subsists in those particles till they communicate it to something else and that it is never really destroyed so when water is thrown on common fire we do not imagine the element is thereby destroyed or annihilated but only dispersed each particle of water carrying off in vapor its portion of the fire which it had attracted and attached to itself—f   this different effect probably did not arise from any difference in the light but rather from the particles separated from the candle being first attracted and then repelled carrying off the electric matter with them and from the rarefying the air between the glowing coal or redhot iron and the electrized shot through which rarefied air the electric fluid could more readily pass—f   these experiments with the wheels were made and communicated to me by my worthy and ingenious friend mr philip syng but we afterwards discovered that the motion of those wheels was not owing to any afflux or efflux of the electric fluid but to various circumstances of attraction and repulsion    0—f   by taking a spark from the wire the electricity within the bottle is diminished the outside of the bottle then draws some from the person holding it and leaves him in a negative state then when his hand or face is touched an equal quantity is restored to him from the person touching—f   our tubes are made here of green glass twentyseven or thirty inches long as big as can be grasped—f   this simple easilymade machine was a contrivance of mr syngs—f   the reverend jared eliot was a graduate of yale college and for many years was settled as a clergyman at killingworth in connecticut he had a taste for philosophical studies and published essays on agriculture some of which passed through several editions   see this opinion rectified in §    and    p     the fire in the bottle was found by subsequent experiments not to be contained in the nonelectric but in the glass        what is said here and after of the top and bottom of the bottle is true of the inside and outside surfaces and should have been so expressed   see the preceding

been converted to the principles of the quakers he was at the time of his sons birth a teacher in a public school in that society at an early age james logan became imbued with a love of letters and science before he was thirteen years old he had made uncommon proficiency in the latin greek and hebrew languages he soon afterwards acquired a taste for the mathematics in which he became profoundly skilled and which science seems to have been his favorite study through life for a few years he had charge of a large grammar school at bristol in england but he afterwards engaged in commerce becoming acquainted with william penn he was induced by him to give up his plans of life and accompany him as secretary on his second visit to pennsylvania in      having acquired the entire confidence of the proprietor he was left by him in charge of his private estate and in the important offices of provincial secretary commissioner of property and receivergeneral in the course of his life he filled the places of recorder of the city of philadelphia presiding judge of common pleas chief justice of the province and president of the council in which last office he governed the province for two years from      to      he also had the entire management of the intercourse with the indians when william penn left the province in   0  he presented mr logan to the assembled chiefs as his representative and this choice of an agent was justified by his conduct during the whole of his public life the affectionate intercourse commenced by william penn and the confidential reliance inspired by his justice and benevolence were preserved by james logan it is perhaps worthy of being mentioned that the celebrated mingo chief whose eloquent speech is contained in mr jeffersons notes on virginia was named logan by his father shickellemy as a mark of respect and gratitude for the friend and protector of himself and his race a history of james logans public life would be that of pennsylvania during the first forty years of the last century venerating william penn with whose noble and generous nature he was well acquainted he stood up at all times in his defence against the encroachments of the assembly and if he forfeited his popularity and endured calumny and persecution he preserved his fidelity the confidence of his employers and the respect of all good men weary of the burden of public office he retired in      from all his salaried employments remaining only a short time longer a member of the provincial council at his estate called stenton near germantown he passed in retirement the remainder of his days devoted to agriculture and his favorite studies a large collection of mathematical papers in manuscript exhibiting extensive and varied researches in that science are marked on the envelope horœ ante nonam and are doubtless the results of his morning recreations before office hours his correspondence with the literary men of america and europe from the year      proves that there was scarcely a department of learning in which he was not interested history archæology criticism theology ethics natural philosophy anatomy and law are treated of sometimes hebrew or arabic characters and algebraic formulas roughen the pages of his letter books sometimes his letters convey a lively greek ode to a learned friend and often they are written in the

sloane flamsteed jones the mathematician father of the celebrated sir william jones fabricius gronovius and linnæus the last of whom gave the name of logan to a class in botany of his printed writings perhaps the best known is his translation of ciceros cato major or a discourse on old age with explanatory notes which was printed by franklin in      and several times reprinted in england he also wrote experimenta et meletemata de plantarum generatione printed at leyden in      and afterwards translated by dr fothergill and printed in london demonstrationes de radiorum in superficies sphericas ab axe incidentium a primario foco aberrationibus printed at leyden      epistola ad virum clarissimum joannem albertum fabricium printed at amsterdam    0 a translation of catos distichs into english verse printed at philadelphia he furnished contributions to the philosophical transactions and wrote other pieces on various subjects in latin and english some of which were published he also left some curious papers in manuscript particularly part of an ethical treatise entitled the duties of man as they may be deduced from nature this was prepared with great care parts of it were sent to his friends in england and received their high commendation but it seems never to have been completed also fragments of a dissertation on the writings of moses a defence of aristotle and the ancient philosophers essays on languages and on the antiquities of the british isles a translation of maurocordatus περὶ ϰαθηϰόντων and of philo judæus allegory of the essæans his acquaintance with franklin began at an early date and he had the highest opinion of him from the first as an industrious useful and ingenious man giving him every encouragement as a printer and much assistance in his scientific pursuits and public enterprises in the military defence of the city he was prominently active notwithstanding his connection with the friends meeting indeed he at all times vindicated the principle of selfdefence as not only consistent with the christian doctrines but absolutely essential to the existence of society in every other respect though neither austere nor bigoted he was a strict friend his virtues his benevolence his public integrity and services his intimate connection with william penn and the honor which his talents and learning conferred on the society of friends perhaps saved him from the censure which a less eminent man might have incurred in addition to his services as a public man and his high reputation among his contemporaries the valuable library left by him to the city of philadelphia should preserve his name in grateful and honorable remembrance    james logan died on the   st of october      aged seventyseven years and was buried in the friends graveyard at

was six years in a paper thou then printed but i request to be informed as soon as thou hast any leisure what measures are proposed to furnish small arms powder and ball to those in the country and

public services during and after the revolution—editor   it was a book by andrew baxter entitled an inquiry into the nature of the human soul wherein its immateriality is evinced c one of the chief objects of this book was to prove that a resistance to any change is essential to matter consequently inconsistent with active powers in it and that if matter wants active powers an immaterial being is necessary for all those effects c ascribed to its own natural powers after stating the several proofs questioned by dr franklin of a vis inertiæ or force of inertness in matter the author adds if the immateriality of the soul the existence of god and the necessity of a most particular incessant providence in the world are demonstrable from such plain and easy principles the atheist has a desperate cause in hand see the third edition pp    in fact mr baxters doctrine seems to establish rather than disprove an activity in matter and consequently to defeat his own conclusion were not that conclusion to be found from other premises primâ facie it seems better for mr baxters system to suppose matter incapable of force or effort even in the case as he calls it of resisting change which case appears to me no other than the simple one of matter not altering its state without a cause and a cause exactly proportioned to the effect—b v   dr franklins reasoning seems only to prove that where bodies of different masses have equal force they measure equal space in equal times for allowing that  a moves one hundred yards in a minute because it moves two separate fifty yards in that time yet surely that space is not the same with that of the one hundred yards moved by  a in the same time though it may be equal to it for the body  a that is a and a in the first case describes a broad double space and the body  a in the second case describes a long and single space there is a farther consideration which may show the difference of celerity and force for when dr franklin says in his second paragraph there is no mass of matter how great soever but may be moved with any velocity by any continued force how small soever i ask whether the moving body must not have its force rather in the shape of much celerity than of much matter for this purpose since without much celerity it would not move fast enough to apply its force to give the required velocity even though its quantity of matter and consequently of force were infinite equal celerity therefore in moving bodies is their measuring equal space along a continued line in equal time equal space measured along a number of smaller parallel lines suits cases of equal motion indeed but according to this corrected definition not of equal celerity—b v   philadelphia market near which dr franklin lived   the title

the more certain alarming the country on any occasion as soon as the commanderinchief at philadelphia is wellinformed of the approach on our coasts of any considerable force of the enemy letters and orders may be despatched by expresses to the colonels of some or all of the regiments as the occasion may require who may immediately communicate the same to the other officers of the regiments and they to the men of the respective companies who are immediately to meet at their usual place of rendezvous and from thence march to such place as the colonel shall appoint for assembling his regiment and when all the companies are assembled the regiment to march to such place as the commanderinchief shall have directed that in case of any attempt on the inhabitants of the frontiers by small parties as the indian custom is the superior officers of the regiment being wellinformed of the facts may despatch away on horseback suitable bodies of active men well acquainted with the woods to such places or passes among the mountains or near the conflux of rivers by which it is probable the enemy must endeavour to make their retreat and there to take post and lie in wait till their return keeping proper scouts or sentinels at a distance of the body to give notice of their approach by which means they may be cut off and the prisoners they take may be recovered a few instances of which would probably much intimidate those cowardly people and make them afraid of attempting to attack us hereafter and that such places may be known to more people it might be proper for the officers beforehand to make a few journeys to them guided by indian traders or hunters accompanied by such of their men as would be suitable to act on occasion and are disposed that way observing and pointing out all the proper places for ambushes c the expense of which journeys might be defrayed by the managers of the lottery that if there be certain accounts of any large body of the enemy marching towards any part of the frontiers the colonels of the nearest frontier regiments may despatch expresses to the commanderinchief at philadelphia with the vouchers of the intelligence from whom orders may issue to raise such force as may be necessary to march to the assistance of such threatened frontier that the people on the frontiers be advised to pitch on some suitable places at proper distances and there enclose pieces of ground with palisades or stockades so as to make them defensible against indians whereto on occasion their wives children and ancient persons may retire in time

to bowdoin to pave the way for a course of lectures in boston on electricity which mr kinnersley had prepared and delivered in philadelphia the electrical fire passing through the air has the same crooked direction as lightning this appearance i endeavour to account for thus air is an electric per se therefore there must be a mutual repulsion between air and the electrical fire a column or cylinder of air having the diameter of its base equal to the diameter of the electrical spark intervenes between that part of the body which the spark is drawn from and that of the body it aims at the spark acts upon this column and is acted upon by it more strongly than any other neighbouring portion of air the column being thus acted upon becomes more dense and being more dense repels the spark more strongly its repellency being in proportion to its density having acquired by being condensed a degree of repellency greater than its natural it turns the spark out of its straight course the neighbouring air which must be less dense and therefore has a smaller degree of repellency giving it a more ready passage the spark having taken a new direction must now act on or most strongly repel the column of air which lies in that direction and consequently must condense that column in the same manner as the former when the spark must again change its course which course will be repeatedly changed till the spark reaches the body that attracted it—ed   the rev ebenezer kinnersley was a professor in the college of philadelphia—editor   the experiments here referred to were described in the following letter from mr kinnersley to dr franklin ebenezer kinnersley   february      boston benjamin franklin boston   february      sir— i have the following experiments to communicate i held in one hand a wire which was fastened at the other end to the handle of a pump in order to try whether the stroke from the prime conductor through my arms would be any greater than when conveyed only to the surface of the earth but could discover no difference i placed the needle of a compass on the point of a long pin and holding it in the atmosphere of the prime conductor at the distance of about three inches found it to whirl round like the flyers of a jack with great rapidity i suspended with silk a cork ball about the bigness of a pea and presented to it rubbed amber sealingwax and sulphur by each of which it was strongly repelled then i tried rubbed glass and china and found that each of these would attract it until it became electrified again and then it would be repelled as at first and while thus repelled by the rubbed glass or china either of the others when rubbed would attract it then i electrified the ball with the wire of a charged phial and presented to it rubbed glass the stopper of a decanter and a china teacup by which it was as strongly repelled as by the wire but when i presented either of the other rubbed electrics it would be strongly attracted and when i electrified it by either of these till it became repelled it would be attracted by the wire of the phial but be repelled by its coating these experiments surprised me very much and have induced me to infer the following paradoxes   if a glass globe be placed at one end of a prime conductor and a sulphur one at the other end both being equally in good order and in equal motion not a spark of fire can be obtained from the conductor but one globe will draw out as fast as the other gives in   if a phial be suspended on the conductor with a chain from its coating to the table and only one of the globes be made use of at a time twenty turns of the wheel for instance will charge it after which so many turns of the other wheel will discharge it and as many more will charge it again   the globes being both in motion each having a separate conductor with a phial suspended on one of them and the chain of it fastened to the other the phial will become charged one globe charging positively the other negatively   the phial being thus charged hang it in like manner on the other conductor set both wheels a going again and the same number of turns that charged it before will now discharge it and the same number repeated will charge it again   when each globe communicates with the same prime conductor having a chain hanging from it to the table one of them when in motion but which i cannot say will draw fire up through the cushion and discharge it through the chain the other will draw it up through the chain and discharge it through the cushion   the discoveries of the late

a letter dated at boston november   th—our indians formerly as yours now made great complaints of the abuses they suffered from private traders which induced the government to erect truckhouses for them where they have since been supplied with the goods they wanted in a much better manner both in regard of the quality and price of them and with more certainty than the private traders could the government used to put an advance on the goods supplied but now they let the indians have them in the small quantities they want at the same rate they are purchased here in the wholesale way and allow them for their peltry what it sells for here and notwithstanding they are frequently complaining about the prices of the exchanged commodities and say that the french supply them at a cheaper rate and allow them more for their skins than we do but some allowance is to be made for this account of theirs the best method we can go into is to supply them with what they want at the cheapest rate possible which will not only undermine the french trade with them but in proportion thereto bring them into our interest and friendship against the french for trade and commerce between nation and nation especially when carried on to mutual advantage have a natural tendency to beget and confirm a mutual and lasting friendship another good effect of this method is that it prevents the indians from being concerned with private traders for not being able to supply them at so low a rate as the government the indians will not trade with them and it is therefore a more effectual bar against private trade than all the laws that can be invented our truckhouses are built in form of a square each side one hundred and fifty feet or more at each corner a flanker in which is a couple of cannon

two hundred of them stout young fellows at one time in the town the indians have passports from the governor of canada and i therefore conclude that this trade is thought beneficial to the french
