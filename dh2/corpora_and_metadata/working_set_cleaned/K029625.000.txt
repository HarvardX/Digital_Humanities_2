abelard to eloisa  price   s  d  abelard to eloisa a poem  by mr jerningham  london printed for j robson new bondstreet  m dcc xcii  to the earl of carlisle in addressing this poem to your lordship i am endeavoring to obtain for it the sanction of a very skillful judge of a person who has himself adorned the poetical walk and who has exalted the muse of tragedy in that excellent composition the fathers revenge  i have the honor to be with the impression of the greatest regard  your lordships obedient humble servant edw jerningham  advertisement the monastery of cluni from whence abelard is supposed to write the following epistle was founded in the year     near the village of mascon on the river graone the head of this convent in the time of abelard was distinguished for his learning and humanity history elevates him above the vulgar herd of monks by the appellation of the venerable peter he extended his generous protection to the unfortunate abelard when he was under the censure of the court of rome  saint bernard also is connected with the story of paraclete this great man stands eminently forward in the picture of the twelfth century born with a mind too restless and enterprising to be confined within the circle of monastic occupations he rushed into the tumult of active life and took the lead in some of the most important transactions of that period with an undisciplined ardour peculiar to his character he precipitated his country into that ruinous measure the second crusade behold him at another time hastening to the contest that held all europe in suspense which exhibited two contending candidates for the popedom the authority and vehemence of bernard overpowered the pretensions of anacletus and innocent was seated on the papal throne the enemies of this celebrated abbot never impeached his moral character but it must be allowed that in his zeal against the innovation of new opinions he has sometimes left unregarded the superior duty of charity a letter of his to the cardinal guido the popes legate in france contains the most intolerant and sanguinary counsel his persecution however of abelard was prompted according to the opinion of some authors by an impulse of jealousy alarmed at the splendid literary reputation of so young a person  abelard in the following epistle lays a considerable stress upon his sentence of excommunication in the dark ages that spiritual humiliation was felt as the greatest calamity the relation the parent the lover the friend suspended their endearing offices and withdrew from the degraded offender  abelard to eloisa yon midnight bell that frights the peaceful air commands the fathers to their wonted prayer now in long order flows the sable throng like a dark sullen stream that creeps along why joins not abelard the sainted train does torpid sloth his lingering steps detain these walls that pillow steeped in tears attest that sleep is exiled from this tortured breast this lamp proclaims the same whose trembling beam guides while my hand pursues the glowing theme while the dread secret from my soul i tear and unreservd my bosomed feelings bear ah me the passion that my soul misled was checked not conquered buried but not dead now bursting from the grave in evil hour it hastens to its prey with fiercer power and vulturelike with appetite increased it riots on the undiminishd feast daughter of paraclete do thou complain in iron silence that i locked my pain that not to thee soft solacer in woe i bad the troubled waves of anguish flow methought the course of three long years retreat would scarce thy lengthening sacrifice complete methought i should profane the hallowed rite did my laments thy pitying ear affright thus at the altar wrapped in holy dread the youth of macedon in silence bled nor from his tortured and consuming hand dismissed the living closeadhering brand alluding to the boy at athens who while he was assisting at a religious ceremony endured a burning coal that sell on his hand rather than disturb the sacrifice  but now thy slow inaugurations over and thou have reached religions tranquil shore now that stern habit throws without control her chain of adamant around thy soul may not the unhappy abelard disclose to her who pities most his train of woes ye sullen gates within whose bound confined the wretch who enters flings his joys behind emerging from the dome ye crowding spires which sunrobed glitter like ascending fires that funeral spot with many a cypress spread where shriek the spirits of the guilty dead yon moping forest whose extensive sway admits no lucid interval of day no cheering vista with a trail of light flies through the heavy gloom of lasting night ye hermitages deep immersed in wood washed by the passing tributary flood whose easy waves softmurmring as they roll lull the strong goadings of the feeling soul ye towering rocks to wonders eye addressed misshapen piles by terrors hand impressed  ah not these scenes magnificently rude to virtues lore have abelard subdued when late my steps drew near the peopled choir what erring wishes did my heart inspire to the deep mysteries as i advanced still in thy presence was my soul entranced while bending to the earth the choral throng pause ere they usher the emphatic song while kneeling seraphs trembling as they glow veil with their radiant wings their bashful brow while the deep organ as by fear controlled its solemn sound like distant thunder rolled while thickning odours dimmed the dread abode and the altar shudderd at the approaching god  midst these august terrific rites unmoved my guilty thoughts to other altars roved in love enchasd a dearer image blessed that living chapel my impassioned breast where burns a hungry and insatiate flame to that soft deity i blush to name those hours to recollection spring renewed when passion urged us and when pleasure wooed when capturd by desires voluptuous hold involved  combined  embodied  and insould  forbearlet dim oblivion cast behind words that would soil thy purity of mind recall recall that interesting hour when in the flush of youth and beautys flower ah doomed severely doomed to meet no more when from each dearer self our forms we tore how to affections finer touch consigned my face upon thy summer cheek inclined felt as it dropped thy tears celestial dew while sighs not words breathed forth our last adieu intruding fancy raised the veil between and showed futuritys unwelcome scene nights of long absence that expect no dawn divorcing gulphs that must for ever yawn in thy pure soul a purer self i traced our glowing minds with energy embraced whence the intellectual progeny arose which kindred fears and kindred hopes compose endearments tending to one mutual aim the same our sorrow and our joy the same now that thy spirit is divinely wrought to nobler objects flies thy soaring thought for free and unrestrained of human ties thy soul uncaptivd springs into the skies to contemplations height sublime you sail while wings seraphic aid the hallowed gale from man to god perfections dazzling source unwearied you pursue your bright ning course and as through stationd angels you advance send on the throne of heaven a daring glance for me unequal to this dizzy height undisciplined unwingd for mystic flight to speed the lingering step of cloister hours to science i consigned my mental powers fame met me in her path and round my brow engarlanded the wreath of splendors glow then swelled disturbed with envys withering power the serpent bernard hissed within my bower poured the black venom with insidious aim chilled my souls health and dimmed my radiant name still still inventing some malignant plan impetuous turbulent vindictive man behind the simple meek monastic vest ambition blazes in his troubled breast averse amid the pensive shades to dwell he shuns the stillness of the lonely cell embroils the contests that involve the great deepens the storm that darkens over the state and like the bird of jove by vengeance driven bears in his grasp the artillery of heaven see anacletus trembling at his frown to innocent resign the doubtful crown mark at the impulse of his bold command the throng that hastens to the palmy land see to his gaudy levee crowds resort see the gay tinseld oplings of the court there too the hoary sages of the law and military chiefs approach with awe there abbots princes cardinals advance and all the splendour all the pride of france as not unworthy of his sainted rage now meaner objects tread his busy stage he bids thy abelard ascend the scene and pours the torrent of his holy spleen then persecution with resistless sway through her longsounding floodgates burst away her armory the vatican displayed in all its proud magnificence arrayed from whence abrupt the avenging pontiff sprung and at my peace the bolt of terror flung while over her victim to dishonor led her cloud of iron extirpation spread now the pale outcast both of heaven and earth i cursed the day that glimmerd on my birth degraded  shunned  to infamy allied amidst the ruins of my soul i cried no more my image to her thought adjoind shall share the heaven of eloisas mind no more i cried my reprobated name shall from her lips its daily honor claim no longer to the throne of god repair borne on the wings of her triumphant prayer now frenzy urged my wildring steps to rove beneath the night of yon extensive grove now urged along the moutains top to range despair still haunting me through every change to tread the adventurous path that coasts the brow which scowls tremendous over the vale below then to the summit of yon rock i toiled that shoots its crags fantastically wild there rushed upon my view the hallowed cross clothed in the garb of venerable moss this wonted pledge of mercy and delight struck on my fading hope a darkning blight no more the saving allatoning rood the grisly symbol of revenge it stood lost in the extacy of strong despair with maddning hand i tore my rooted hair  twas then the seer of warm compassion came to lull my tortures and dispel my shame desist the priest of charity began and own once more the dignity of man no longer rome and abelard are foes the thunders of the vatican repose the holy church by my remonstrance won takes to her bosom her still darling son hail to the tidings of that chearing voice that bids the humbled abelard rejoice that bids his image to her thought rejoined still share the heaven of eloisas mind yet not thy person that attractive sight diffusing round ineffable delight nor thy discourse illumd with wisdoms ray which with soft rapine steals the sold away that eye where meek dominion holds her throne that voice where music smooths her softest tone by liberal nature prodigally given what words cannot paint that smile of opening heaven these various charms that pass all human praise these charms that once adorned my happier days no more shall i behold  it is folly to complain those days of splendour never must rise again adieu thou mistress of enchanting power thou blissful vision of a transient hour for such appears to fancy still how dear the sloping race of raptures swift career when heaven enforcing its benign decree with lavish bounty gave thy form to me hope now is dead and pleasures knell is rung with sable thoughts my dreary mind is hung twas at the hour when from the sorrowing view the glowing god of day his beams withdrew when vesper all her pageantry displayed fretting the sky with many an awful shade here trees appeared that struggled with the storm there a wan cloud assumed a spectres form a solitary hand here grasped a spear there angry meteors combated in air now riding on the wind with threatening mien the dark terrific phantom death was seen from a thick vapours dread unfolding womb now bodied forth the likeness of a tomb thy form oh eloise i clearly traced thine airy arms the sepulcher embraced that mimic tomb my early fate foreshews while my soul labors with prophetic throes now closes fast my short disastrous day to lifes dark boundary i haste away the virtuous cluni still relieves my pains to thee will he convey my cold remains this kind assurance mitigates my doom thou wilt stand the guardian angel at my tomb closed be this form in eloisas fane she will sight my requiem with a lovers strain often to my grave with sorrowful delight will she repair as glooms the thickningnight burst from thy cloud oh cynthia burst away the holy shadow of her frame display let the soft texture of her lengthening shade repose along the spot where mine is laid were thus her presence to my wishes given death would rejoice my grave would then be heaven forgive this last effusion of a heart which love and nature formed unstained by art which midst the fears that wait on deaths decree with all its wonted ardor darts to thee prepare prepare for that relentless day when the dark hearse this form shall bear away when to the fane of paraclete conveyed my humble bier shall at thy feet be laid prepare prepare  throw back the vestal gate receive the victim of untimely fate receive the youth misfortune held to view till mid his woes invariably true that youth from other strong affections free whose life was one continued hymn to thee that youth whom passion rushing on his breast with torturing and extatic hand impressed repare prepare  yet check the bursting moan hou to compassion exquisitely prone lest glowing sympathy with death at strife should kindle my cold ashes into life and my roused voice invading natures laws breathe in loud accents terrible applause yet will my soul pour forth another claim ah me what sudden langour chills my frame my tremulous and feeble hand denies its functiongathering vapors cloud my eyes of all that passion dictated of mine if now i touch the sad the closing line if ere these words thy pity shall implore this warm and raving heart shall throb no more farewell  be thou with added years still blessed  ah let me live in thy recording breast finis just published price is  d a new edition of the shakspeare gallery a
