an essay on the bite of a mad dog in which the claim to infallibility of the principal preservative remedies against the hydrophobia is examined  by john berkenhout m d  london printed for r baldwin paternoster row  mdcclxxxiii  price one shilling and sixpence  to sir george baker bart frs physician in ordinary to the queen this essay is inscribed by his most obedient servant  winton july         the author  an essay on the bite of a mad dog etc   i know not of any human attempt which bears a better resemblance to the knight of la manchas attack of a windmill than that of combating vulgar errors of reasoning against received opinions the most powerful and pointed arguments generally fall to the ground when opposed by the impenetrable shield of common prejudice nevertheless in the present age when science is hourly making such rapid advances toward the discovery of truth when knowledge is so much more universally diffused than in former times it seems not unreasonable to hope that mankind may be persuaded to bestow a few moments unbiassed attention on a subject confessedly of the highest medical importance    this subject has indeed been amply and learnedly treated by ancient and modern physicians in various countries and languages in this kingdom particularly by the celebrated dr mead and the no less famous dr james the latter of whom published in the year    0 an entire volume on canine madness ancient authors were less diffuse and were generally satisfied with transcribing from each other most of these writers i have considered with attention and acknowledge myself much obliged to them for many important facts i cannot however avoid observing that their labors have a manifest tendency to confirm the fatal prejudice which i most devoutly wish to eradicate i therefore think myself justified in adding a small pamphlet to the voluminous tracts already written on the disease commonly but improperly called the hydrophobia or dread of water i say improperly because this aversion to water or to drink of every kind is only one symptom of the disease in question and that not constantly nor exclusively for there are many examples on record sufficiently authenticated of this symptom this hydrophobia in patients not bitten by a dog or by any other animal    i am even inclined to assert that the hydrophobia is not generally a symptom of the disease produced by the bite of a mad dog it rarely happens that the patient has any aversion to water or other liquid until by experience he finds an insuperable difficulty in swallowing he then dreads the approach of water having already found that the attempt to swallow any liquid produces a violent and painful convulsion so that the symptom in question is rather a real difficulty of swallowing liquids than a dread of water as far as my own experience reaches i can with great truth aver that i have never yet met with a single patient who expressed any aversion to the sight sound or mention of water until he had found by experience that drinking gave him pain    some years ago i was sent for to a young gentleman who about six weeks before had been bit in the arm by one of his fathers hounds a few hours before his death he stepped into a tub of warm water without fear sat down and continued in it half an hour i shall in its proper place relate his case circumstantially i mention it at present only to prove that the hydrophobia is improperly considered as a diagnostic symptom of this disease    i am equally inclined to dispute the propriety of the denomination rabies canina canine madness for though persons thus unhappily afflicted are often violently agitated during a short time previous to their death yet they generally retain their reason to the last moment this disease therefore is improperly considered as a species of madness if by madness we understand a distraction suspension or perversion of the reasoning faculties    writers fond of searching into antiquity for what is not worth finding have taken great pains to discover the most ancient authors that have written on canine madness hippocrates most certainly has not said a single word on the subject whatever some of his wise commentators may have imagined a learned list of ancient authors who have written on the hydrophobia may be collected from various modern writers but we search in vain for useful information on this subject among the remains of high antiquity    but if the disease we are about to investigate be neither a species of rabies nor hydrophobia what shall we call it  it were idle to dispute about a mere name but when a misnomer conveys a false idea it is no longer a matter of indifference the fatal disorder communicated to the human species by the bite of a mad dog is doubtless a spasm of the organs of deglutition and respiration a species of angina convulsiva vel suffocativa the generic term angina is thus defined by the learned boerhaave in his    d aphorism  impedita valde dolens admodum vel et impedita et dolens simul deglutitio atque respiratio quae contingit a causa morbosa agente in parts binis his functionibus inservientes supra pulmones et supra stomachum positas angina vocatur and in aphorism     he says  si convulsionum causa quaecunque musculos pharingis laryngesve occupaverit oritur subita suffocativa angina    as i am here writing particularly to medical readers it is unnecessary to translate the above quotation such readers after comparing these definitions with the symptoms of the hydrophobia as it is called will i believe acknowledge their surprise that boerhaave should not rather have classed it as a species of angina than of mania later nosologists seem equally unfortunate in point of arrangement in the system of the celebrated sauvages we find hydrophobia in the class vesaniae and order morositates his definition of the class is error in imaginatione appetitu vel juditio of the order cupiditates aut aversiones depravatae now i appeal not to systematic writers but to those who have attended patients suffering under this dreadful distemper and i request them to recollect whether erroneous imagination appetite or judgment or depraved desires or aversions were among the symptoms they observed as to the patients refusing to drink it proceeds not from an imaginary aversion to water but from a real a painful convulsion in the organs of deglutition excited by every effort to swallow liquids    linneus divides the disease in question into two distinct genera viz rabies and hydrophobia the first he defines in these words desiderium mordendi lacerandique innocuos the second thus aversatio potulentorum cum rigore et sardiasi adding soepius praecedenti maritata he places them in the class mentales and order pathetici where from what i have said above they must appear to have no business   0 in vogels arrangement under the class of febres and order continuae we find the hydrophobia thus characterized febris cum aversatione liquidorum singultu convulsione et delirio the absurdity of making the hydrophobia a continued fever is so obvious that it requires no comment     dr cullen denominates his second class of diseases neuroses which he defines  sensus et motus laesi sine pyrexia et sine morbo locali spasmi constitute the third order of this class and of this order the last genus is hydrophobia thus defined  potionis cujuslibet ut convulsionem pharyngis dolentem cientis fastidium et horror plerumque e morsu animalis rabidi of this genus he admits two species viz vulgaris and spontanea the first of which is the immediate object of our present consideration     dr cullen with his usual sagacity saw the error of former medical writers who mistook this spasm in the organs of deglutition for a species of madness     but by what name soever we distinguish this dreadful disease previous to our enquiry concerning its symptoms in the human species let us endeavor to ascertain those by which it may be known in the brute where it originates  authors have amused themselves with learned disquisitions concerning the cause of this rabies in dogs wolves foxes etc some accuse worms within the cranium or under the tongue dr cheyne ascribed it to a superabundance of animal salts and dr james was of opinion that extreme heat want of water treat on canine madness p  0 and putrid animal food are generally the cause of this madness in dogs which he calls a fever     the usual symptoms which indicate approaching madness in a dog are first an evident diminution of his natural keen appetite for food he eats indeed and laps his milk or water but with obvious indifference his eyes have lost their usual luster he drops his ears and tail shows no sign of hilarity at the approach of his master and his whole aspect exhibits a picture of melancholy perfectly intelligible to those who are accustomed to observe this animal with attention in a day or two more he refuses both meat and drink shuns the society of other dogs and is equally after a short reconnoitre avoided by them he now quits his habitation runs forward evidently without having any thing in pursuit snaps at every animal that comes in his way and within fortyeight hours dies convulsed     such are the symptoms of this distemper in the brute creation and these symptoms are so constant and unequivocal that all danger might easily be prevented by the smallest degree of attention in the first stage of the disorder the dog has no propensity to bite so that he may be seized and tied up without fear     boerhaave has collected from fracastorius and other writers a catalogue of symptoms more numerous and somewhat different from those above enumerated but as it was not the result of his own observation his description of this as of many other diseases should be read cum grano salis     pliny hist not lib    c   in his chapter de medicina animalium tells us that there is a worm under the tongues of dogs which if extracted when they are whelps prevents their running mad this doubtless was a vulgar error of the times in which he wrote and thus the universal prevalence of this absurd opinion down to the present age is accounted for dr james very justly ridicules this idea of a worm under the tongue on can mad p  0   i take it says the doctor to be a nerve and this contracting when recently taken away the idiots fancy it stirs and believe it a worm towhich it bears no manner of resemblance  he is certainly right in believing it not to be a worm but he is mistaken in supposing it a nerve for a reason which himself has adduced namely its contraction nerves are not elastic he is also wrong in saying it bears no resemblance to a worm de sed and cause morb lib   ess viii art    morgagni probably was nearer the truth in calling it a tendinous ligament be it what it may it is certainly of use to the dog and its extirpation answers no salutary purpose     let us now trace the progress of this fatal disease in those of the human species who have the misfortune to be bit by a mad dog or cat the wound on immediate inspection discovers no signs of malignity if it be so superficial as scarcely to have drawn blood it generally heals without the least inflammation and in that case there is little or no danger on the second day it seems a mere scratch and on the third it is hardly visible but if on the second morning we observe an inflamed circle spreading from the wound resembling that which surrounds the puncture when inoculation for the smallpox has taken effect there is reason to believe that part of the poisonous saliva of the enraged animal is absorbed and the consequent symptoms may be rationally expected     meanwhile the patient takes the ormskirk or some other equally infallible medicine is hurried away to the sea in which he is two or three times dipped and half drowned the wound heals and all his apprehensions vanish unhappily this delusion also vanishes in the space of five or six weeks about which period he feels a this symptom is said to have been first mentioned by salius pain in the part where he was bit gradually extending over the whole limb he now recollects his misfortune the horrible stories he has heard rush upon his mind and the hourly expectation of madness and death fill his whole soul under such apprehensions it is no wonder that he should discover symptoms of impatience anxiety and even of delirium but these symptoms proceed from and are always in proportion to his apprehensions his reasoning faculties continue unimpaired his pulse becomes irregular and quick but there is no preternatural heat foul tongue nor any other febrile symptom he complains of a fullness and prickling in his throat and swallows his spittle with difficulty so far from expressing any aversion to water he calls for drink but in the attempt to swallow it he is convulsed and after two or three painful efforts the approach or even the sight of any liquid produces horror he continues some time longer to swallow solid food without much pain or difficulty at last even that is impossible he now becomes sensible of an irresistible inclination to struggle and wishes to be held he breathes quick and with great difficulty and in a few hours after dies convulsed as if he were strangled with a cord   0 such and such only are the proper diagnostic symptoms of this fatal disorder they are amply sufficient to distinguish it from any other and are therefore all that are necessary to be generally known but as a disease so frequently mortal cannot be too well understood i shall proceed to mention the symptoms above omitted as i find them enumerated by the principal authors that have written on this subject     coelius aurelianus who collected his history of the hydrophobia from eudemus soranus and other writers with whom we are little acquainted tells us that the hydrophobia is immediately preceded by extreme irritability unusual motions of the body disturbed sleep or absolute wakefulness indigestion stretchings yawning nausea imaginary notions of bad weather and no appetite for drink to these symptoms according to the same author succeed when the hydrophobia begins a desire to drink appetentia bibendi which dr james translates a violent and insatiable thirst  treat on can madn p     with terror at the sight sound or name of water the patient is afraid even of fomentations with oil his pulse is dense densus small and irregular sometimes a small degree of fever convulsive motions of the stomach spasms in the precordia numbness of the joints and torpor of the intestinal canal frequent inclination to make water trembling and catchings of the limbs voice hoarse resembling the barking of a dog spiral posture of the body like that of a dog lying on the ground anxiety when any person enters the room as if apprehensive that he should bring water redness of the face and eyes body emaciated the superior parts pale and sweating veretri frequens tensio cum seminis involuntario jactu etc     to the symptoms above mentioned boerhaave adds the following  lassitude aphor      weight and indolence in every muscle of the body disturbed sleep frequent startings frightful dreams convulsions constant inquietude depression sighing and love of solitude if the patient be bled the blood exhibits no morbid appearance he now complains of a squeezing about his heart he is terrified not only at the sight of any fluid but even of any pellucid or reflecting body he vomits viscid bilious phlegm or poraceous bile grows hot and feverish to a gradual exacerbation of these symptoms are now accumulated a dry projected tongue open foaming mouth extreme thirst an irresistible inclination to spit at and bite those that are near him cold sweats complete rabies and on the fourth day the patient dies     dr mead copies boerhaave without any material alteration except in saying that death relieves the patient in two days after the first symptom of hydrophobia  sauvages in his nosologia adds no other symptom to those above related but from dr james we learn the following very curious and material proof of the salutary instinct of dogs namely that they fly from persons actually infected by the bite of a mad animal     such readers as are not acquainted with medical authors and particularly with the writings of the celebrated leyden professor will wonder why he should have exhibited so numerous a catalogue of symptoms if it be true that so few of them really occur in patients afflicted with this malady but his wonder will cease when he is told that boerhaave when he began the study of physic found the science a mere chaos he immediately conceived the idea of reducing it to method and after much reading condensed and arranged his materials in the form of aphorisms constituting a new system of physic which aphorisms he used as the text of his academical lectures all his symptoms very seldom occur in the same patient they were collected from a variety of authors and are to be remembered by physicians rather as possible phenomena than as absolute diagnostics     having thus attended our unfortunate patient to the final period of his life let us proceed to examine the morbid appearances in his body upon dissection     cappivacci an italian was i believe the first anatomist who published an account of any dissection of this kind his observations together with those of zwingerus brechtfeld and other writers were republished in the sepulchretum and thence collected by boerhaave and condensed into a single aphorism which for the sake of the english reader i will translate aph    0  the morbid phenomena discoverable in the body by dissection are generally the organs of deglutition somewhat inflamed bilious gluten in the stomach the gallbladder full of black bile the pericardium dry the lungs incredibly distended with blood the heart full of blood almost dry the arteries full the veins empty blood in the arteries extremely liquid and scarce coagulating in the air all the muscles viscera brain and spinal marrow dryer than usual     zwingerus epb nc dec   a   obs  0  in a body which he dissected found the membraneous interstices between the cartilaginous circles of the aspera arteria intensely red and the stomach and intestines sprinkled with red spots     brechtfeld found the entire tract of the oesophagus narrow sepulc anat and in a state of constriction     m tauvry a french anatomist hist r acad an      found the gula and aspera arteria in a state of inflammation   0 morgagni tells us of an hydrophobic patient whose body de sed et cause morb ep viii art    though dissected sixteen hours after death in a cold season was intolerably putrid black bile was found in the gallbladder the lungs were also black and very offensive the right auricle of the heart was much dilated the left very narrow the blood vessels of the brain were all full the brain was rather dry     the same author relates another history of a man who died about a month after being bit by a mad dog ib art    and whose body which was dissected about twentyfour hours after death in the hottest season of the year was much less offensive than the former his neck had a livid appearance the blood vessels of the stomach were as full as if they had been injected the stomach was distended with air and contained besides a yellow and greenish water part of the liver was livid and the gallbladder was full of brown bile the diaphragm was a little inflamed the lungs on the posterior part were tumid with blood and black the upper part of the oesophagus aspera arteria pharynx and larynx seemed nearly gangrenous in the head the vessels of the meninges were distended with blood and the internal substance of the brain was dotted with red points the internal ventricles contained a reddish serum     in a third dissection the stomach was found to contain a viscid cineritious fluid ib art    and the gallbladder a small quantity of yellow bile the illiac veins were violently distended with blood and their corresponding arteries quite empty lungs stuffed full with crassamentum and in part almost in a gangrenous state the heart contained a small quantity of blood resembling melted pitch the organs of deglutition showed no other signs of inflammation than a slight redness at the top of the pharynx but the membrane which invests the epiglottis was crisp and shrivelled all the vessels of the meninges were immoderably full of black blood neither the cerebrum cerebellum spinal marrow viscera of the thorax and abdomen nor any of the muscles were more dry than they generally are in the ventricles of the brain were about three ounces of yellowish serum     morgagni ib art    after comparing these observations with those of mead plancus fabbri brogiani etc concludes that the bodies after death differ more from each other than when living for says he whilst alive they all drink with great difficulty and most of them not without horror but upon dissection we find no one phenomenon common to every subject as to that dryness of the parts so generally observed it is by no means universal nor does it seem to deserve much consideration because the violent agitations of the patient and the consequent evacuations sensible and insensible the frequent exhibition of alexipharmics and long abstinence from liquids are sufficient to account for it     on the authority therefore of morgagni who was a man of most extensive anatomical reading and experience we must conclude that dissections have not hitherto discovered the part or parts of the human body particularly affected or injured and consequently no curative indication can thence be deduced he is of opinion nevertheless that the seat of the disorder is in the nerves and brain democritus and gajus coel aurel lib iii c    two of the most ancient writers on this subject were of the same opinion as were also the disciples of asclepiades some of the ancients accused the diaphragm some the stomach and intestines and some the heart     boerhaave aph      from the history and comparison of the hydrophobia with other diseases was induced to believe that it is first an affection of the nerves that convulsions of the viscera are thence produced that the blood and humors thence become vitiated but that the primary seat of the disorder is in the region of the stomach in this last part of his theory he followed the opinion of arthemidorus coel aurel lib iii c    artorius and the disciples of asclepiades     dr mead was persuaded mechan acc of poisons essay   that the seat of the disease is in the nervous fluid contaminated by the saliva of the dog acting as a ferment and gradually assimilating the whole to its own degree of morbid acrimony     dr james ridicules these opinions and roundly declares p    that he does not believe one syllable of the modern doctrine of nervous juices and nervous distempers previous to the display of his own theory in order to render it intelligible to readers unacquainted with anatomy he translates from boerhaaves preface to his collection of authors on the venereal disease a minute description of the cellular membrane to which he adds two pages more on the same subject from cheselden the first of these begins thus  this membrane is of a vascular contexture etc this is certainly not true if dr james had ever read so common a book as hallers primae lineae he would not have quoted boerhaave and cheselden on this occasion his theory however is briefly this  the poison contained in the saliva of the mad dog is communicated through the wound made by his teeth to the fat contained in the cellular membrane which fat by fermentation with the saliva is assimilated into a poison now this fat being mixed with the blood and conveyed to the liver by the vena portarum the bile is contaminated and necessarily produces all the symptoms observable in canine madness     to render this theory more intelligible the doctor informs the ignorant reader p    that there is a perpetual intercourse betwixt the blood vessels and the cellular membrane and consequently between the contents of both the blood and fat  it is somewhat singular that this poisoned fat should in its passage to the liver mix with the blood without injuring that fluid which throughout the entire progress of the disease is found to differ in nothing from that of a person in health this obstacle was too obvious to escape the doctor but he tumbles over it very clumsily he supposes notwithstanding appearances that the blood must be ultimately vitiated by the bile so that the blood first vitiates the bile and the bile returns the compliment to the blood     thus then according to dr james the liver is the primary seat and fountain of the hydrophobia which viscus he tells us p    supplies the rest of the body with bile in immense quantities in what physiological school the doctor learnt that the rest of the body is supplied with bile in immense quantities is difficult to imagine i know of no part of the body which is supplied with bile except the duodenum where mixing with the digested aliment issuing from the stomach part of it is converted into chyle and thereby bereft of all its bilious qualities and the remainder carried through the intestinal canal and finally ejected so that no bile quasi bile is absorbed and consequently no part of the body except the intestinal canal is supplied with this fluid   0 but if it be true that the liver is the part of the body chiefly affected in the human species we may i think fairly conclude that this viscus is also the primary seat of the disorder in dogs now it is very certain that the liver of a mad dog supposed to be an infallible remedy against canine madness has been frequently eaten without any bad effect     there is yet another objection to dr jamess hypothesis which the anatomical reader will probably think of some weight  page    of his treatise he tells us that the poisonous saliva adhering to the tooth of a dog is immediately communicated to the fat residing in one or more of the cells of the cellular membrane that a scratch is sufficient if it only raise the cuticle without drawing a drop of blood for continues the doctor this subtle poison as well as the venereal venom is capable of entering the cellular membrane when applied to any part not covered by the cuticula     is it possible that dr james the author of a medical dictionary in three folio volumes should not have known that there is no external part of the human body which is not covered by the cuticle that he was really ignorant of this fact is still more evident from the following passage in his   th page  after relating a case from van swieten who quotes it from palmarius of several children having caught the hydrophobia by kissing their father who had been bit by a mad dog he says  in this case it is very possible that some of the frothy saliva might be conveyed to the lips or the mouth of the children which not being defended by the cuticle might communicate the contagion as it happens with respect to the venereal poison  now it is not only certain that the glans penis the lips and mouth are covered by the cuticle but that it is continued through the fauces oesophagus and intestinal canal     but the doctor assures us that for the saliva of the dog to poison the fat a scratch is sufficient if it only raises the cuticle surely the doctor had forgot that the cellular membrane with which he took so much pains to make his readers acquainted and in which the fat resides adheres to the internal surface of the cutis vera which therefore must necessarily be perforated before the saliva can be brought into contact with the fat     if dr james had been at all acquainted with the absorbent lymphatic vessels whose extremities perforate the cuticle in every part of the surface of the body he would not have deemed those parts only which he supposed destitute of this external shield susceptible of the canine poison though the medical world be much indebted to the minute enquiries of doctors monro and hunter for a more perfect intelligence of the lymphatic system yet the absorption of fluids through the pores of the skin has been generally known even prior to the days of galen who as a proof of this fact gal de usu pulls c   says  si sitiens balneum ineat illi sitis sedabitur innumerable experiments have been made by later writers in order to establish this doctrine particularly by boil bellini and many others phil tr no ii in the philosophical transactions we read of men working in quicksilver mines whose bodies had imbibed so much of that metal that they changed the color of brass by rubbing it with their hands or even by breathing upon it we know that by handling turpentine the urine acquires a violet smell that tobacco will vomit and aloes purge when externally applied but the fact most universally known is the constant effect of mercurial unction     hence it is evident that the cuticula or epidermis as it was called by the greeks is no defense against the canine or any other poison if the application be continued sufficiently to give time for its absorption it is therefore necessary when the saliva of a mad dog touches any part of the skin to wipe it off immediately and wash the spot the examples indeed of persons thus infected without a wound are not numerous because those on whose hand or face the saliva rests naturally wipe it off before it can be absorbed     but in defense of dr james it may be urged that whether the cuticle be pervious or not or in whatsoever manner the canine poison pass the cutis it proves nothing against that part of his hypothesis which establishes the fat as the immediate receptacle of the poison and its future vehicle to the liver     in reply to this defense it will be sufficient to observe that the bibulous lymphatics by which fluids on the surface of the body are absorbed do not discharge their contents into the cellular texture but creeping along its membranes communicate with larger veins which terminate in the receptaculum chyli the thoracic duct or jugular vein so that the canine poison or any other fluid absorbed from the surface of the body cannot remain in a state of extravasation with the fat in the cellular web but must necessarily be thrown into the general mass of circulating fluids i shall avail myself says dr james of but one more argument to illustrate the probability of the canine venom being received and fostered in the membrane which contains the fat or rather in the fat itself and this i draw from the method of cure for that very medicine which cures the venereal disease whose residence is in the fat is also found effectual in preventing and even curing canine madness  unfortunately for this argument the venereal disease does not reside in the fat      dr jamess theory therefore being contradicted by anatomical demonstration necessarily falls to the ground the hypothesis of boerhaave mead and others who supposed the seat of the disease to be in the nervous fluid is equally insupportable because no such fluid circulates in the nerves which are not tubes but solid fibers whose extremities therefore are incapable of absorption     if these theories be false those who read for information will ask where lies the truth if such readers have sufficiently attended to the   th paragraph they will easily conceive that the poisonous saliva of the dog is absorbed by the capillary lymphatic veins whose ramifications expand to every part of the surface of the human body those veins which imbibe the matter communicated by inoculation the venereal virus water and infectious miasmata from the air   0 but if this be true why is it necessary in order to communicate the small pox by inoculation that the cuticle should be raised  i answer it is not necessary but that by this operation the communication of the disease is rendered more certain because the matter being lodged under the cuticle by retaining its moisture continues longer in a fit state for absorption     if it should be further asked why the canine poison thus introduced continues circulating in the body five or six weeks before it produces that disease of a single paroxism called the hydrophobia  i answer that in this it differs from other inoculated diseases only in point of time in all inoculations there is an intervention of some days between the cause and effect but why that of canine madness requires a longer time for assimilation and maturity must remain a mystery until we are better acquainted with natures modus operandi probably there are other contagious diseases whose malignant miasmata may be equally slow in their progress from admission to efficiency     some attempts have been made to discover the nature of this canine poison by the help of microscopes and chemical experiments but to no purpose dr mead supposed it to consist of fiery saline particles dissert med de rab can edinb      dr heysham believes it to be an acid but this is mere conjecture all we know of the matter is that it is a poison sui generis which being absorbed by the lymphatic veins produces certain effects in the human body no mechanical nor chemical theory therefore can assist us in the invention of a remedy against the bite of a mad dog analogy may possibly be of some use chance the great inventor of medicines has not i think been successful in the present case let us however proceed to the most important the therapeutic division of our essay     mithridates king of pontus about two thousand years ago is said to have invented that farrago of more than forty ingredients called by his name historians tell us that believing it to be an universal antidote he took a dose of it every morning in justice however to his pontic majesty i must not suppress what samonicus writes on this subject when pompy says he took the baggage of mithridates he found among his papers the prescript for compounding the famous antidote against all poisons invented by that king he was much surprised to find that it consisted only of twenty leaves of rue two walnuts two figs and a little salt to whose inventive genius we are indebted for the forty ingredients which were afterward added i know not unless to that of damocrates under whose name this celebrated antidote shines conspicuous even in the last edition of the london pharmacopoeia     andromachus a native of crete cotemporary with galen not satisfied with an antidote of fortyfive ingredients composed one of more than sixty which he called  serenitas from its sedative or anodyne effect this impertinent jumble of stuff was afterward called theriaca from the greek word  fera a wild beast being an antidote against the invenomed bite of mad or poisonous animals this notable hodgepodge is also to be found even in the last edition of the london dispensatory and what is more extraordinary there are i am told some physicians who continue to use these theriacas in their prescriptions with what intention is best known to themselves     if the inventors of theriacas had any ideas at all they probably thought that in so great a number of ingredients it was possible some one of them might hit the mark they aimed at for the same reason that sportsmen prefer a number of small shot to a single bullet but i am rather inclined to think them the invention of some arch apothecarys apprentice who had a mind to try what sort of a medicine he could produce by jumbling together every drug in the shop be their origin however what it might they are certainly the oldest antidotes upon record and from the proportion of opium they contain might possibly alleviate the spasmodic symptoms incidental to the bite of a viper or of a mad dog     dioscorides wrote a treatise on the theriaca in the second chapter of which he recommends as a medicine that might be depended on for the bite of a mad dog two spoonfuls of the ashes of the river crab with half the quantity of gentian to be taken in a large glass of wine de simpl med facul galen prescribes the same medicine with the addition of a small quantity of frankincense the crabs he burnt alive in a copper dish after the rising of the star sirius when the sun was in the constellation leo and on the eighteenth day of the moon this invaluable secret he learnt from old aeserion the emperic who being galens master must have lived cotemporary with dioscorides and might probably be the inventor of this infallible medicine for so it was esteemed by these physicians     dr mead is of opinion that this remedy is recommended by the ancients upon rational grounds because it is a diuretic for says he the surest remedies in all ages against this venom have been such as provoke a great discharge by urine reflecting on this circumstance this esculapius of his times conceived the great idea of recommending to the world his infallible pulvis antylissus which at the doctors request was honored with a place in the london pharmacopoeia     whence did dr mead conclude that this powder of calcined river crabs or crawfish for such he supposes them to have been would promote a great discharge of urine he certainly thought that this calcination like the incineration of vegetables would produce an alkaline salt if he had possessed the least degree of chemical knowledge he would have known that the animal itself would burn to a mere earth totally inert and that its shell would be converted into quick lime of which consequently with a very small proportion of earth this specific must consist     dr jamess chemical knowledge appears to have been not much inferior to that of dr mead whom he thinks totally wrong in translating the  of dioscorides and galen river crawfish he is clearly of opinion and takes some pains to prove that these authors meant a species of river crab and not crawfish dr james prudently observes that we ought to be very accurate in our quotations from ancient authors lest the medicine recommended be mistaken for something that may not possess the same virtues this is doubtless a wise observation but any chemists boy would have told him that the virtues whatever they may be of a calcined crawfish crab or oister are exactly the same that all shells are calcarious earth and consequently burn to quick lime in no respect different from that produced by the calcination of chalk limestone or marble but that dr james as well as dr mead supposed that this calcination of river crabs produced an alkaline salt is evident from the following passage speaking of this powder he says  i believe it may have some efficacy in preventing the canine madness p     though none that can be depended upon this opinion is founded on its being an highly alkaline substance and all or most of the pretended specifics for this distemper are alkaline and destroyers of acids as the celebrated pancake made of oistershells mentioned by dessault armenian bole tin and many other these last words put the doctors skill in chemistry quite out of doubt   0 but as we can hardly suppose that dioscorides and galen ventured to give their patients two spoonfuls of quick lime it is probable that they did not calcine these crabs or crawfish sufficiently to convert the shells into lime though long enough to dissipate the volatile parts of the animal on this supposition this specific powder becomes a mere absorbent earth a pulvis e chelis cancrorum possessed of no diuretic virtue yet galen pronounces it infallible de simpl med facul l   c         the next diuretic antidote of the ancients recommended as dr mead thinks upon rational grounds is the spongia cynorrhodi sponge of the dogrose which says the doctor is so celebrated an antidote that p boccone who has written a whole discourse upon its virtues tells us it is called in sicily sanatodos or allheal we also in this country have a common plant dignified with the same name and equally insignificant in its medical capacity these panaceas are generally good for nothing but dr mead ranks this gall of the briar among his animal diuretics because mr ray found it to be the nidus of a fly  now says the doctor all insects abound with a diuretic salt  if the lie direct were admissible in polite conversation i would say this is not true but i marvel exceedingly that he did not observe that this sanatodos of the sicilians is called in england a dogrose because it produces a medicine for a mad dog also that he forgot to inform his readers that this celebrated antidote originated in the dream of an old woman as he must have read in pliny     dr mead after specifying from the ancients other diuretics which certainly are not diuretics proceeds to the recommendation of his infallible pulvis antilyssus which he declared never failed of success though he had used it a thousand times i have often wished adds the doctor that i knew so certain a remedy in any other disease  surely such testimony from so great a physician must be more than sufficient to establish the infallibility of any medicine beyond all suspicion and yet two greater men boerhaave and van swieten aph      are of opinion that it is good for nothing and dr james assures us that it has been given pa     without success to a great number of people and animals in many parts of the kingdom     this infallible pulvis antilyssus is prescribed by dr mead in the following words  take of the herb called in latin lichen cinereus terrestris in english ashcolored groundliverwort cleaned dried and powdered half an ounce of black pepper powdered two drachms mix these together and divide the powder into four doses one of which must be taken every morning fasting for four mornings successively in a pint of cows milk  i have now before me a london dispensatory with manuscript notes by my worthy friend dr longfield a physician deservedly distinguished for his sound judgment and extensive medical knowledge on the blank leaf opposite to the pulvis antilyssus he wrote  this is dr meads famous powder it is most certain that it never cured one person bit by a md dog     a moderate share of experience in the medical powers of plants is sufficient to determine a priori the virtue of this lichen which together with the rest of its tribe discovers no other sensible quality than a slight degree of astringency and therefore can have no other effect than what may be expected from any other medicine astringent in the same degree unless we admit the doctrine of specifies to which dr mead would doubtless have objected being himself a sectator of the mechanical belini pb botan frag meth at mat mid p      insipidae et inodorae vim medicam vix exercent is an aphorism of linnaeus this rule says dr cullen seems to be without exception and it is on this account and not on any proper experience that many plants are expunged from the materia medica as having no taste or odor which should point out in them any active qualities  after such evidence we may i think justly proceed to the condemnation of the infallible pulvis antilyssus     but dr mead in order to convince the world that he had not adopted this medicine without proper scientific investigation informs his readers that he examined the lichen cinereus terrestris by distillation and that the result of his analysis was some acid water some oil and some coal that contained fixed salt a bunch of docks of nettles of thistles or of any other common weed would have yielded the same this sort of analysis can be of no use in discovering the medical virtues of plants the receipt to make this celebrated pulvis antilyssus was first brought to england by captain dampier who called the plant jews ear  tremella auricula of linnaeus a kind of ashcolored fungus which is frequently found on the trunks of old trees but it seems sir hans sloane was of opinion that the captain was mistaken that he certainly meant the ashcolored liverwort which on the authority of so great a naturalist was accordingly adopted is it not probable from this history that in rejecting the original jews ear dr mead seized the ear of the wrong sow     the next infallible medicine i shall examine is that which about thirty years ago was brought from tonquin by sir george cobb when he returned from the east indies it consists of native and factitious cinnabar each twentyfour grains with sixteen grains of musk powdered and mixed well together this dose is to be taken in a glass of arrack once only and repeated after an interval of thirty days the absurdity of making any distinction between native and factitious cinnabar which are precisely the same thing is too obvious to need a commentary it proves however the ignorance of the chinese old woman who probably invented the medicine and of all those who in prescribing this powder have continued to observe the same ridiculous distinction but in the composition of this specific there is another absurdity of more importance all the cinnabars whether native factitious or of cinnabar of antimony are mere powder of post absolutely inert     factitious cinnabar says dr james is made of three parts of mercury to one of sulphur and pa     as i remember a pound of good native cinnabar yields near fourteen ounces of fluid mercury and therefore it seems that the good effects of this medicine ought to be principally if not entirely ascribed to mercury  dr james having resolved to sport a preparation of mercury as the only specific for canine madness was quite satisfied with this sort of reasoning but we must come nearer to the point     native cinnabar is the ore of mercury that is mercury mineralized by sulphur in the proportion of about six seven or eight parts of the former to one of the latter  sulphur possesses the singular property in combination with mercury or antimony of rendering both these violent metallic substances inactive it is particularly well known of antimony that it is more or less mild in proportion as the regulus is combined with more or less sulphur this chemical fact dr james must have known if he had understood the process for making his own feverpowder but mercury before it can exert its stimulant power must not only be completely extricated from the sulphur with which it formed cinnabar but must afterward be divided by trituration or dissolved in a mineral acid now the only means of decomposing cinnabar is by fire in what is called by chemists the dry way in the human body therefore it is impossible but if we could suppose the mercury actually separated from the sulphur not being dissolved by a mineral acid or otherwise divided it would still remain in a state of total inactivity a priori therefore cinnabar may be pronounced inert     but lest the advocates for this tonquin medicine should deem this sort of philosophical argument inconclusive let us take the opinions of a few eminent chemists on the subject pa      dr cullen in his lectures on materia medica speaking of mercurial preparations says  crude mercury and the combination in cinnabar and aethiops mineralis to which may be added aethiops antimonialis in so far as it contains mercury can only by accident or indirectly prove medicines  triturated with sulphur pa     mercury becomes an inert substance this i could determine a priori whether it was in the form of aethiops mineral or native or factitious cinnabar  dr lewis in his dispensatory tells us that cinnabar like aethiops pa     is inactive  cartheuser having given a large quantity to a dog says that it produced no sensible effect but that part of it passed through the intestines unaltered and that the remainder was found in the stomach and bowels  dr longfield whom i have before mentioned wrote the following note on the article cinnabaris factitia in the pharm col reg med londinensis  it is a shame that the cinnabars are not totally exploded they have not the least title to the character of nervous medicines they are both inert  but it were unfair to conceal from the reader that a famous german chemist of the last century was of a different opinion he considered cinnabar as an efficacious medicine and ascribed its virtue to its beautiful color with which archeus is so charmed as to neglect the disease which he was employed in exiting for it seems this archeus this creature of van helmonts distempered brain is wonderfully delighted with the color red   0 in answer to all this reasoning a priori i shall be told that experience is the only test and that the instances upon record of the hydrophobia being cured or prevented by the tonquin powder are innumerable in reply to this answer  first there are examples upon record of persons having died of the hydrophobia after taking it particularly in two cases related in the london medical observation page     and apendix p   secondly many other medicines equally infallible and equally extolled have deservedly sunk into contempt thirdly no attestation of facts will convince a rational being that an effect was produced without a sufficient cause now a substance which is demonstrably inert can produce no effect in an animal body and therefore can cure no disease     cinnabar being thus i think fairly dispatched if there be any antidotal power in the tonquin medicine it must be attributed to to the antispasmodic virtue of the musk dr james ascribes it to its alkaline quality  musk he tells us is an animal substance and consequently of an alkaline nature and as alkalies have in all ages been recommended in this case it seems at least to be not prejudicial  this is damning musk with faint praise but what did the doctor mean by ascribing to it an alkaline quality because it is an animal substance had he forgot that animal matter wants the assistance of fire to produce alkali if every species of animal matter be an alkaline medicine the parings of his own nails would have done as well musk however is doubtless a powerful antispasmodic and for that reason may be of service in the hydrophobia     this tonquin powder is ordered to be taken in a glass of arrack doubtless with no other intention than to cover the taste of the musk this vehicle however suggests an idea which though i may think it extravagant i will communicate suppose when the symptoms of the fatal disease in question first appear previous to the difficulty of swallowing liquids the patient were to drink to intoxication of any strong liquor he may choose who without trying it will pretend to circumscribe the antispasmodic effect of this remedy it is certainly not contraindicated by any febrile or maniacal symptoms in a forlorn hope no attempt can be too extravagant it will at least answer one good purpose i mean that of relieving the patient from several hours of the most horrid anxiety that can possibly be conceived     i now beg leave to call the readers attention to the mercurial preparation so strenuously recommended by dr james in his treatise on canine madness it is called turpith mineral it is a precipitate of mercury from its solution in the vitriolic acid by which it was not only dissolved but calcined whether it be a pure calx of mercury without any adhesion of vitriolic salt is a matter of dispute among chemists of the first reputation monsieur baume declares positively vol ii p  0  que ce precipite est absolument prive de toute acide lorsquil a ete lave a plusieurs reprises dans de leau bouillante  nevertheless from the effect of the medicine i presume he is mistaken it is a very rough mercurial fit only for dogs to which animals dr james seems to have given it with success as to its effect on the human species he produces no more than one single case of a patient bit by a mad dog and cured under his own immediate care by turpith mineral he relates indeed three or four other cases in support of his specific on the authority of persons of his acquaintance but hearsay evidence in this case as in courts of justice is inadmissable  dr raymond med obs append p   physician at marseilles gave seven boluses containing each four grains of turpith mineral to a patient bit by a mad dog the patient died     the ormskirk medicine which in many parts of this kingdom particularly in the north is deemed infallible appears from the report of dr black and dr heysham to consist of med com vol v p  0 powder of chalk half an ounce armenian bole three drachms alum ten grains powder of elecampane root one dram oil of anise six drops  now though the chemical enquiries of these gentlemen may not be admitted as proof positive yet when the result of experiments made by two able chemists at different times is precisely the same when a medicine composed of the supposed ingredients has the same color taste and smell we have the strongest presumptive evidence that our conjectures are well founded especially when there is no discoverable difference between the effect of the real and supposed composition     as to the medical virtues of the ingredients abovementioned they are sufficiently known  chalk is a mere absorbent earth without any other power than that of destroying the acid it may meet with in the primae viae and during the effervescence of producing a little calcarious gas commonly called fixed air  armenian bole such as is generally sold by the druggists is nothing more than a lump of pipeclay colored with a little red ochre or rust of iron this english or dutch armenian bole is in no respect inferior to the true oriental or to any other bole for medical purposes  alum is an astringent and nothing more  elecampaneroot has been generally ranked among the alexipharmics it is said to assist expectoration and in large doses to act as a diuretic and cathartic it is however in no estimation and in so small a dose mixed with the other ingredients can produce no effect  as to the six drops of oil of aniseed i presume their efficacy in the present case will hardly be insisted on     possibly i may be told that though these several ingredients separately taken may possess no extraordinary medical powers yet like other compounds they may when united form a medicine of considerable virtue  i acknowledge that a powerful medicine may be formed by a judicious combination of simple ingredients prescribed on chemical principles but i am very certain that an ignorant jumble of chalk clay alum and elecampane will form nothing but an heterogenerous mass of dirt that may do harm but cannot possibly do good in any disease whatsoever     but say the advocates for the ormskirk powder what signifies reasoning against facts are there not a thousand examples of the hydrophobia prevented by taking this medicine would the sagacious inhabitants of the northern counties have such faith in a mere ignis fatuus  far be it from me to doubt the sagacity of the northern counties they are by no means singular in mistaking shaddows for realities all quackmedicines and more than half the medicines used in regular practice are ignes fatui what are all the vaunted panaceas theriacas antidotes and specifics but ignes fatui deceptions chimeras     the several specifics above considered have all successively had their day of infallibility and have all been equally supported by experience the true test of medical virtue that is a number of people bitten or supposed to be bitten by dogs supposed to be mad have taken the ormskirk or any other infallible powder and have escaped the hydrophobia but in the london medical observations vol v p     etc we have on the authority of dr fothergill an incontestable proof that the ormskirk medicine is not infallible mrs bellamy who was bit by a mad cat took it and conformed to the directions given by the vender in every respect yet died of the hydrophobia about four months after as i make no doubt would all the patients that ever took the ormskirk medicine if they had been really infected by the canine poison     this censure i do not confine to the ormskirk nor yet to any of the medicines abovementioned it comprehends every prophylactic remedy taken internally can any thing be more absurd than to imagine that a disease received into the body by inoculation a poison absorbed by the lymphatic veins and mixed with the general mass of circulating fluids can be destroyed by a medicine taken into the stomach is there any analogy in the history of physic to authorize such expectations will any powder pill or bolus stop the progress of the smallpox by inoculation or prevent it from taking effect was there ever a physician weak enough to attempt to prevent any other infectious disorder after the poisonous liquid or miasmata were actually absorbed   0 having thus i hope not unfairly considered the pretensions to infallibility of the specifics introduced and recommended by particular men we are come at last to that sovereign remedy extolled by every writer on canine madness ancient and modern and used in all countries in every age from the days of celsus to the present moment  i mean bathing in cold water to this part of our subject i beg the readers particular attention because i am very certain that many lives have been lost by a foolish dependence on this broken reed i have said that all writers on canine madness ancient and modern have recommended coldbathing but i must except dr falck the author of the seamans medical instructor and dr fothergill who wrote a paper in the london medical observations vol v p   0 purposely to prove the inefficacy of bathing in the sea     the physician last mentioned was of opinion that the practice of bathing in salt water as a preservative originated in a mistake celsus directs the patient cells lib v c    actually laboring under the hydrophobia to be thrown unexpectedly into a fishpond if he cannot swim he is to be suffered to flounce and drink raising him a little now and then so as to keep him from drowning but if he can swim he is to be frequently ducked that in spite of himself he may be satiated with water thus says celsus his thirst and dread of water will be cured at the same time     celsus was mistaken in supposing that he could force the patient to drink by holding him under water or that after being half drowned he would look on water with less horror or swallow liquids with greater ease the latter part of this discipline is daily practiced by the old women at the watering places on the wretched creatures that are sent by old women male and female from the inland country this practice of drowning the patient in order to cure him of an aversion to water absurd as it is was probably taken from celsus who though a sensible man possibly without experience or much reflection prescribed it on the authority of some greek writer but why the sea was substituted for a fish pond and how it came to pass that what celsus ordered as a cure for the hydrophobia actually present should be applied as a prophylactic a preservative remedy is difficult to conceive     who was the inventor of this immersion in salt water i cannot determine i am inclined to think that it originated in holland or flanders in the days of panaceas charms witches and hobgoblins that it was a common practice in the netherlands in the sixteenth century appears from the following passage from van helmont which as his books are not in every library and i believe were never done into english i shall endeavor to translate literally  there is a fortress on the seacoast about four leagues from ghent called sluice there i saw a ship passing by and in it an old man naked bound and weights fastened to his feet under his arms they had tied a rope the other end of which was fixed to the yardarm of the vessel i asked the meaning of this spectacle and was answered by one of the sailors that the old man had got the hydrophobia having some time ago been bit by a mad dog why i asked is he brought to the sea whether they meant to drown him no no said the sailor he will soon be cured such is the blessing of god upon the sea that it will instantly cure this kind of madness at my request they took me on board we had scarce sailed a mile when the sailors by pulling out a plug in the bottom of the ship let in the water till she sunk almost to the edge of the gunwale this seawater they collected for the purpose of making salt the plug being now readapted two men hauled down the opposite end of the yard and thus hoisted the old man into the air they then let him drop into the sea and he remained under water ad spatium miserere they repeated this operation twice more keeping him each time under water ad spatium salutationis angelicae     some profane readers may possibly be inclined to comment ludicrously on this spatium salutationis angelicae but choosing rather to treat the matter seriously i requested a friend to read over the miserere psalm li and found by my stopwatch that he performed it in one minute and thirtyfive seconds and the salutatio angelica in ten seconds van helmont is not sufficiently explicit in this important part of his narrative whether this was only a method of computing time or whether these psalms were actually repeated during the immersion does not appear i am inclined to think they were if so this capital omission in our old women on the sea coast sufficiently accounts for their fallibility but to proceed with van helmonts story     they then laid him on his back across a barrel and covered him with a watchcoat i concluded he was dead but the sailors ridiculed my apprehensions being now released from his bonds he discharged all the water which he had inspired and presently revived he was a cooper from ghent and being cured of his hydrophobia continued perfectly well     if the poor cooper remained long in that position supino dorso super vas teres i marvel that he ever recovered that the dutch sailors should believe that his lungs were full of water is no great wonder van helmont should have known better there are indeed writers of some reputation who tell us that they have found water in the lungs and stomach of drowned subjects but waving the improbability of the fact later experiments prove incontestably that drowning animals rarely imbibe any water certainly no quantity to do them any injury morgagni drowned guineapigs hedgehogs ep xix art    dormice and other animals and found on dissection little or no water in the lungs or stomach of any of them the opinion that drowned persons are full of water erroneous as it certainly is prevails so universally among the ignorant that i am persuaded many have been prevented from recovering by holding them up by the heels or laying them on the side of a hill with the head downwards     these dutch skippers told van helmont that a salt herring applied immediately to the wound was an infallible cure for the bite of a mad dog and that half drowning in salt water was only necessary when this remedy had been neglected so that we have neither the authority of celsus nor the practice of the netherlands to plead in favor of seabathing as a preservative the case of this cooper if we believe that he was really so mad as to require being fettered affords a singular example of the hydrophobia actually cured by immersion in salt water it is indeed so singular that i can produce but one more on any tolerable authority the instances in which it has failed as a prophylactic remedy and cure for the hydrophobia are innumerable     morgagni epistle viii art    tells us that an hydrophobiac patient was thrown into a cold bath and held some time under water he died the night after  in art    we read of another who died soon after he was taken out of the bath  art    after mentioning van helmonts cooper and the case of a girl recorded in the history of the academy of sciences at paris ann      morgagni writes thus immersion in cold water must have succeeded very differently with others since beside baccius and him whom parry pointed out not only salius has written that he after several times experience had found no advantage from this remedy but also caelius aurelianus expressly discommended it as injurious but palmarius has admonished us that it was certain from the experience of many that this method of treatment had been very unsuccessful     boerhaaves directions for bathing the patient in the sea or in a river aph      are very singular  immediately after infection with great preparation exciting fear and after frequent threatenings at last throw him into the water  he then repeats the orders given by celsus for halfdrowning the patient for he adds the cure is effected by the perturbation of the mind spiritum turbando agitation of the animal spirits and not by the salt water as we learn from the deplorable exit of the man who after being bitten by a mad dog was shipwrecked and swam a long time in the sea frequently covered by the waves yet died of the hydrophobia  this being the case threatening to hang the patient would answer the same purpose here i think seabathing seems to be fairly given up   0 dr mead speaking of seabathing as a preservative says i have known many to have died raving mad who had undergone this treatment  i will not says dr james pretend to determine how much more effectual bathing in the sea may be than in cold fresh water page     it is certain that many that have been almost drowned in the sea have soon after died of the hydrophobia and i knew a gentleman who took thirty couple of foxhounds to the sea and had them dipped with all manner of caution notwithstanding which he lost several hounds every day he took out the pack  in the edinburgh medical essays we read of a boy bit by a mad dog who was ten times dipped in the sea yet died of the hydrophobia some months after  dr fothergill in his additional remarks on the treatment of persons bit by mad animals addressed to the editors of the medical observations etc says i have heard of diverse instances p   0 and i have no doubt but you are as well satisfied as myself and perhaps from your own observation that this process seabathing is by no means a preservative from the fatal consequences of the bite of mad animals  desault a physician at bourdeaux in his treatise sur la rage gives his opinion on this subject in the following words when i am applied to by a person bit by a mad animal i order him to bathe in the sea though i have no dependence on this remedy since the many proofs we have had of its inefficacy in the course of the present year  choisel a jesuit residing at pondicherry in a pamphlet published at paris in      in which he relates many examples of canine madness cured by mercurial friction says bathing in the sea has hitherto been considered as an infallible preservative from this disorder my own experience proves the futility of that opinion not one of those who depended solely on this remedy survived the bite more than thirtythree days     i presume the reader is by this time satisfied as to the efficacy of bathing the reason why it continues in the present age to be used as a prophylactic remedy for the bite of a mad dog is the same which may be assigned for a thousand other foolish customs  our fathers did so before us and their reason was that their fathers did so before them but from what theory the inventor of this remedy deduced his prescription is not easily imagined all medicines must have originated either in reasoning a priori or from some fortuitous event the first i think is in this case out of the question i conclude therefore that some person bit by a dog supposed to be mad accidentally fell into a horsepond he continued well ergo the hydrophobia was prevented by a ducking the reputation of some other medicines in constant use for other diseases is not a whit better supported     aurelianus in his chapter entiled quomodo curandi sunt hydrophobi cap    exhibits the various prescriptions of all the authors he had read upon this subject most of them deserve no notice i shall select a few however which doubtless the reader will think too important to be neglected  let the patients chamber be tolerably warm and lightsome  let the part that was bitten be covered with a piece of clean warm flannel  if it be necessary to bleed him let the blood be received in the hand of the assistant lest the noise of its falling into the basin should affect the patient  talk to him about washing and drinking and if he hears this patiently you may then give him something to drink if not you may let him suck through the spout of a teapot covering his eyes or darkening the room  let his nurses be discrete and not aurelianus did not mean female nurses loquacious  let his head be shaved  let him be exercised in a hammock or a sedan  if he refuses to take any liquid in at his mouth force it into the other end of him but take care that you do not administer too great a quantity lest it squirt in your face this perilous operation being happily accomplished you are then to squeese his or her belly so as to force the contents upwards and thereby quench the patients thirst tullius bassus says our author besides clysters gave his patients a pinch or two of snuff whose friend dr black gave white hellebore of which some physicians order a cataplasm to the patients backside     paracelsus says van helmont affirmed demens idea p     that the hydrophobia might be cured by acrid purgatives his promises however are not justified by the event our good catholics therefore despairing of relief from the faculty repair to st hubert at whose shrine by virtue of certain ceremonies they are cured but it is worthy of remark that if these ceremonies are not strictly observed the latent rabies immediately breaks out and they become irrecoverably hydrophobic there is a vestment of st huberts which is preserved in a chest secured by six locks the keys of which are kept by six different vergers for these fourscore years past they have been continually cutting off pieces from this holy vestment nevertheless it remains to this day perfectly entire now it is impossible there should be any imposture in the case for they have never been able to discover whether this miraculous robe be of linen woollen or of silk consequently it cannot be annually renewed they cut off a piece of the robe and incarnate a thread between the skin of the patients forehead hence another miracle for a person thus cured becomes possessed of a power to postpone the hydrophobia during forty days in any of his acquaintance who after being bitten may not have leisure immediately to visit st hubert on this condition however that if they exceed the forty days ever so little without applying for a prorogation of the term they go mad irrecoverably     those who are conversant with books on this subject will ask why i have taken no notice of the celebrated powder invented by palmerius  i have two reasons first because it deserves no notice secondly because it is never prescribed in this kingdom and therefore can do no mischief i have omitted several other infallible medicines for the same reason an idle display of medical erudition on so trite a subject were ridiculous i sat down solely with a design to convince the less informed part of the community that their opinions concerning the prevention of canine madness or hydrophobia are fatally erroneous inasmuch as that dependence precludes the application of more rational means i determined to employ a few leisure hours on this subject because boerhaave mead and other physicians of high reputation have authorized such irrational dependence     but this is not the sole mischief of which the erroneous opinions of eminent men are productive dr mead fully persuaded of the all sufficiency of his pulvis antilyssus endeavors most irrationally to divert his readers from an attention to the wound these are his words  the ancient physicians p    who are followed in this by the moderns advise where the place will admit of it to enlarge the wound by incision to apply a cuppingglass to burn it with a hot iron and to keep a discharge from the ulcer for many days i cannot but say that i think all this severity useless  it happens in most cases that the wound being small p    is healed up before the patient seeks for help for this reason and because it is of no great consequence whether it be cured or not in the paper which i printed and dispersed some years since entitled a certain cure for the bite of a mad dog i took no notice of any outward application  i will without hesitation venture to pronounce this the most pernicious doctrine that ever was taught by any physician ancient or modern it affords one of the most flagrant examples in the annals of medicine of a sensible man and a scholar sacrificing his reason his common sense to a preconceived hypothesis he imagined that the poison contained in the saliva of the enraged animal contaminated a nervous fluid  which has no existence and that this poison might be carried off by a diuretic medicine  which is certainly neither diuretic nor any thing else he advised cold bathing because on mechanical principles he supposed that the external pressure of the water by constringing the vascular system would determine the segregated poison to the kidneys and so assist the operation of his pulvis antilyssus     before i prescribe that which i conceive to be the only rational means of preventing the fatal effect of the bite of a mad dog it is necessary that i should answer a very natural question  if says the reader the several specifics above condemned are really good for nothing how comes it that so many persons bit by mad dogs are daily cured by the ormskirk medicine bathing in the sea etc  if this were not what is called begging the question i should be distressed for an answer but the truth is that all those who believe themselves cured by these futile preservative remedies were never infected and consequently no harm would have happened whether they had used them or not fortunately for mankind not one in fifty of the dogs supposed to be mad are really mad and of those few that are so their teeth are often wiped clean by the clothing of the person bit and consequently no inoculation takes place it happens also as in all other infectious diseases that the body is frequently not disposed to receive the infection these and these only are the causes of all the transitory reputation which the various infallible medicines have from time to time acquired     nevertheless as the case is always doubtful  as possibly the dog may be actually mad and the poison really imbibed nothing can be more imprudent than to depend on the chance of its being otherwise we are therefore to act as if we were certain that dog was a mad dog the person bit must immediately apply his mouth to the wound and continue to suck it during ten minutes or a quarter of an hour frequently spitting out and washing his mouth after each time with water warm or cold no matter which if the wound be in a part of his body which he cannot reach with his mouth possibly he may prevail on some rational friend to do him this kind office especially when i assure him positively assure him that it may be done without the least danger my own son then about eight years old in returning from school was bit by a dog in the thigh my eldest daughter being informed of the accident without the least hesitation immediately sucked the wound she had heard me say it might be done with safety the dog was certainly not mad but i relate the story in justice to her affectionate intrepidity which in a young girl was somewhat extraordinary     neither ancient nor modern writers if i remember right have advised sucking the wound received by the bite of a mad dog lib iii c   yet galen in his book de temperaments says that the saliva of this animal is not equally dangerous when admitted into the stomach therefore it is probable that in some part of his voluminous writings he may have mentioned this experiment but in the bite of a venomous serpent lib v c    p    celsus and after him dr mead lays great stress on this preservative application it is very extraordinary that in one case the doctor should deem it of so much and in the other of so little importance the first of these authors assures us that the psylli a people who pretended to an hereditary and exclusive power of curing the bite of serpents by suction owed their success solely to their resolution for says he venenum non gustu sed in vulnere nocet adding whoever therefore sucks the wound after the example of these psylli will save his friend and do himself no injury     dr mead was informed by a surgeon who lived in virginia mead p  0 that the indians there cure the bite of the rattlesnake by first sucking the wound this is also a common practice in the highlands of scotland see pennants tour append p      and then swallowing a large quantity of a decoction of the rattlesnake root so as to vomit plentifully now that the decoction contributes nothing toward the cure i presume will be readily admitted sucking the wound therefore is the sole remedy which was certainly dictated by the natural sagacity of this people that this cure is effectual is confirmed by the case of a man in london who being bit by a rattlesnake brought from virginia sucked the wound and recovered as the poison says dr mead of this snake is more quick and deadly than any other that we know mead p    a remedy for this will most certainly prove effectual against that of smaller vipers and all other creatures of this kind  and why not of every other kind was not the analogy sufficiently obvious if the poison of a serpent may be sucked from a wound is there any reason to imagine that the virus in the saliva of a dog may not but then the infallible pulvis antilyssus would have been of no use seriously i believe that if this simple operation were immediately and resolutely performed no other remedy would be required the best medicines are often the most simple and those which are nearest at hand we are too apt superciliously to overlook the simple dictates of nature and common sense to the discredit of our profession and the loss of our patients art chemistry compounds and systems are the hobbyhorses of young physicians and it is not till they have grown old in the profession that they return to nature and hippocrates   00 but though i have great dependence on this simple preservative remedy we cannot be provided with too many weapons offensive and defensive against so formidable an enemy those who want resolution to attack the foe personally will be glad of a substitute that substitute is a cupping glass or any other vessel that will answer the same purpose if no surgeon be present take a pretty large piece of paper twist it gently so that it may easily be thrust into a narrowmouthed jug light the paper well and having put it into the vessel fix it tight over the wound and let it remain in that position till it may be easily taken off repeat this operation three or four times   0  ancient and modern writers on this subject have generally advised searing the wound with a hot iron partly with a design to destroy the poison but particularly with an intention to produce an ulcer this i think not only an unnecessary but a pernicious act of cruelty let us suppose that a particle of the poison sufficient to communicate the disease is absorbed by a lymphatic vein what will be the effect of the application of a red hot iron to the extremity of that vein after such absorption will it not immediately shrink and shrivel and will not the reduction of the poisonous fomes by any external application be thus effectually prevented   0  the wound being now wiped dry with lint or tow let two drachms of mercurial ointment be rubbed into it and let the part be then covered by a blistering plaster somewhat longer than the wound as soon as a bladder is perceived to have risen under the plaster raise the edge of it and let out the lymph and in order to keep it running let it be daily dressed during fourteen days or longer with an ointment composed of equal parts of emplastrum vesicatorium and unguentum coerubeum fortius p l melted together in a very gentle heat let a dram of mercurial ointment be rubbed into the fore part of the legs of the patient every other night and on the nights intervening let him take a bolus composed of three or four grains of calomel six grains of camphore and a dram of conserve of roses if any signs of salivation should appear it must be checked by a day or twos suspension and a dose of glaubers salt   0  it may possibly be asked on what foundation i have differed from so many eminent writers in not advising immediate scarification  i answer because they advised scarification on a groundless supposition they imagined that the canine virus was communicated to the blood therefore they wisely ordered the blood thus contaminated to be drawn away but i conceive the poisonous fomes to be absorbed by the lymphatic vessels and therefore i prefer blistering the part   0  every person who from the bite of a dog really mad has received the fatal poison whose constitution is at that time disposed for such infection and who has ignorantly depended on seabathing or on any specific taken internally will most certainly in the space of a few weeks perceive symptoms of the approaching catastrophy called hydrophobia in this stage of the disease i fear there is very little probability of recovery i have in paragraph    perhaps rather wantonly advised intoxication i am still of opinion that it is an experiment worth trying it can certainly do no harm i remember somewhere to have read of opium in large doses being successfully administered but i do not find this practice confirmed by experience powerful antispasmodics are certainly indicated   0  in the  th paragraph of this essay i mentioned the case of a young gentleman whom i attended in the last stage of this horrible disorder he had been bitten by one of his fathers hounds six or seven weeks before a day or two before i saw him he complained of a pain in the arm which had been bitten gradually extending toward his shoulder he had taken many doses of the expressed juice of ribwort which in that country was universally deemed a specific and had bathed every day in the river i saw him about ten in the morning he complained of nothing but a pain in his arm and some little difficulty in swallowing i ordered a warm bath to be prepared in which he sat half an hour with great composure i rubbed a considerable quantity of mercurial ointment into each arm and gave him a grain of crude opium every hour till nine or ten oclock at night without the least effect about eleven he became extremely restless and died at twelve retaining his senses to the last moment without any symptoms of madness or propensity to bite his attendants   0  this pamphlet inconsiderable as it may appear to some readers was not written stans pede in uno it was nearly finished before the publication of dr cullens third volume of first lines of the practice of physic i saw in that volume with infinite satisfaction my own opinion concerning the cure of the disease in question confirmed by that of my venerable preceptor who concludes his chapter on canine madness with these words  whilst the state of our experience with respect to several remedies now in use is uncertain i cannot venture to assert that any of these is absolutely ineffectual but i can give it as my opinion that the efficacy of mercury given very largely and persisted in for a long time both as a means of preventing the disease and of curing it when it has actually come on is better vouched by experience than that of any other remedy now proposed or commonly employed   0  this essay may possibly be read by persons who live in the country at some distance from an apothecary and consequently in case of an accident it may be many hours before any mercurial ointment can be procured such readers will necessarily ask what then is to be done  whilst the person bit is sucking the wound let a spoonful of lard or tallow or fat of any kind be melted and immediately with the hand rubbed into the part continuing the operation until the fat be entirely absorbed let him then take his horse and ride leisurely to the nearest apothecary who will proceed as above directed   0  on the testimony of dessault and the jesuit choisel particularly the latter mercury appears to be a certain antidote for the poison of a mad dog the first used mercury only in the ointment choisel besides using the ointment gave also a mercurial bolus they both succeeded from dessaults practice we learn that mercury externally applied is sufficient but evidence is wanting to prove that mercury taken internally without the external application of the ointment will prevent the hydrophobia may we not therefore hazard a conjecture that the lard or fat of which the mercurial ointment is made is the real preservative is not this conjecture powerfully supported by the analogy between the canine poison and that of a viper which is effectually destroyed by vipers fat or oil of any kind applied to the part i mention this merely as a conjecture future experiments may possibly discover it to be a fact meanwhile when mercurial ointment can be had doubtless it ought to be preferred  the end
