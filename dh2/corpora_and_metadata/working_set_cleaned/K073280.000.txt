poems on several occasions  by stephen duck  london printed for the author mdccxxxvi  to the queen madam the great honor your majesty has done me in giving me leave to prefix your royal name to the following poems does not encourage me to presume they are worthy to be laid at your feet on any other account but only as they are an humble tribute of duty offered from a thankful heart to a gracious benefactress your majesty has indeed the same right to them as you have to the fruits of a tree which you have transplanted out of a barren soil into a fertile and beautiful garden it was your generosity which brought me out of obscurity and still condescends to protect me like the supreme being who continually supports the meanest creature which his goodness has produced  i have room here to expatiate upon a very inviting subject but your majesty has nobly prevented all panegyric even from the best pens by building your fame on a much more lasting basis than that of praise in dedications your encouragements of arts and sciences your esteem and friendship for all defenders of truth while they are living the regard you pay to their memories when dead and your generous care of their widows and orphans record your virtues in such characters as will ever be legible your christian love to mankind your zealous endeavors to promote religion a soul made tender to feel our misfortunes and a will inclined to redress them are such amiable and heavenly qualities as shine best by their own light and can receive no new luster from the finest description  may heaven long preserve your majesty to practice all these virtues to be a perpetual source of comfort and joy to our glorious monarch a blessing to the nation and a noble pattern of beneficence and generosity to future queens your majestys great goodness to myself draws this prayer from a heart filled with gratitude as there is so little merit in what you now honor with your royal protection i shall endeavor to supply the defects the only way that is in my power by my thanks and prayers for your majesty these i will ever continue and always make it my greatest ambition to show with what profound respect i am  madam your majestys most grateful most devoted and most dutiful servant stephen duck  the preface what i propose in this preface is only to bespeak the readers goodnature and to say something which may incline him to pardon what he cannot commend i have indeed but a poor defense to make for the things i have wrote i dont think them good and better judges will doubtless think worse of them than i do only this i believe i may say of them that if they have nothing to delight those who may chance to read them they have nothing to give modesty a blush if nothing to entertain and improve the mind they have nothing to debauch and corrupt it  another motive that i hope may induce the reader to overlook the defects in this volume is that the oldest poem in it is little more than six years of age and a considerable part of the time since that was writ has been spent in endeavoring to learn a language of which i was then entirely ignorant though i fear the few attempts i have made in translations will too well convince the public to how little purpose i have employed my time i confess myself guilty of a great presumption in publishing imitations of horace when many eminent hands have done it much better before me but when i was only endeavoring to understand him i found it difficult to conquer a temptation i had to imitate some of his thoughts which mightily pleased me if i may be forgiven this experiment i promise to trouble the world with nothing of this nature again at least till i may be able to do my author more justice  i have not myself been so fond of writing as might be imagined from seeing so many things of mine as are got together in this book several of them are on subjects that were given me by persons to whom i have such great obligations that i always thought their desires commands my want of education will be too evident from them for me to mention it here and i hope when the reader weighs my performances he will put that and other disadvantages into the scale  i am afraid the letter relating to myself wrote by a worthy and learned gentleman will be thought an improper thing in a publication made by myself but as i was desired to prefix it by persons whom i think it an honor to obey i hope it will be pardoned and the rather because a very false account had been published before by a person who seems to have had as little regard for truth as he had for honesty when he stole my poems  i would willingly here make known my obligations to those worthy persons who first took notice of me in the midst of poverty and labor were i not afraid my gratitude thus publicly expressed would offend them more than my silence however i must beg leave to return my thanks to a reverend gentleman of wiltshire and to another of winchester the former made my life more comfortable as soon as he knew me the latter after giving me several testimonies of his bounty and goodness presented my first essays to a lady of quality attending on the queen who made my low circumstances known to her majesty  i hope too that all those honorable persons whose names do me so much credit at the beginning of my book will accept my acknowledgments and thanks for so liberal a subscription and as this volume i fear will tell them they have not encouraged a poet i will endeavor to let them see they have been generous to an honest man  an account of the author in a letter to a friend written in the year    0 sir i dont wonder that you should desire so distinct an account how stephen duck came to write verses and how he managed in writing them philosophers find as much subject for their admiration in the minutest bodies as in the largest and a poet from the barn though not so great a man is as great a curiosity as a dictator from the plow i can be particular enough as to his first setting out in poetry and since you seem to desire it shall give you all the circumstances i could learn from a weeks conversation with him in all his simplicity without considering that many of them to a person less curious might appear too trifling to be mentioned even in a letter  my friend stephen had originally no other teaching than what enabled him to read and write english he had never taken a single step toward any other language as arithmetic is generally joined with this degree of learning he had a little share of that too about his fourteenth year he was taken from school and was afterward successively engaged in the several lowest employments of a country life this lasted for some years so long that he had forgot almost all the arithmetic he had learned at school however he read sometimes and thought oftener he had a certain longing after knowledge and when he reflected within himself on his want of education he began to be particularly uneasy that he should have forgot something of what he had learnt even at the little school he had been at he thought of this so often that at last he resolved to try his own strength and if possible to recover his arithmetic again  his first attempt of this kind i take to have been about six years ago considering the difficulties the poor fellow lay under this inclination for knowledge must have been very strong in him he was then married and at service he had little time to spare he had no books and no money to get any but he was resolved to go through with it and accordingly used to work more than other daylabourers and by that means got some little matter added to his pay this overplus was at his own disposal with this he bought first a book of vulgar arithmetic then one of decimal and a third of measuring of land all which by degrees he made himself a tolerable master of in those hours he could steal from his sleep after the labors of the day  where there was such a desire for knowledge there must be good sense at bottom and a soul at least somewhat above the common conversation he must meet with in his poor state of life i have asked him whom he had that he could talk and converse with in the country and was pleased to find him in this particular happier than i expected he said he had one dear friend that he mentioned with uncommon affection they used to talk and read together when they could steal a little time for it this friend had been in a service at london for two or three years he had an inclination to books he had purchased some and brought em down with him into the country and stephen had always the use of his little library which by this time possibly may be increased to two or three dozen of books this friend knew no more out of english than stephen but by talking together they mutually improved each other stephen is all simplicity he says that his friend can talk better than he as having been more used to company but that he himself has been more used to poetry and in that can do better than his friend  had it not been for this stephen must have been placed in the same class with hai ebn yokdhan and the young hermes in mr ramsays cyrus but the story of their improvements without any assistance agrees only with romances and you know what i am writing to you is a true history our retired philosopher had his friend and it seems to have been the greatest happiness of his life that he had one they did not only read but reasoned over points together and i have sometimes thought how agreeable a thing it would have been to have been concealed within hearing of them when they were in the midst of some of their most knotty debates we may imagine em both to have had good natural sense and a few good books in common between em their minds were their own neither improved nor spoiled by laying in a stock of learning they were perhaps equally well inclined to learn both struggling for a little knowledge and like a couple of rowers on the same bottom while they were only striving perhaps which should out do his companion they were really each helping the other and driving the boat on the faster  perhaps you would be willing to know what books their little library consisted of i need not mention those of arithmetic again nor his bible milton the spectators and seneca were his first favorites telemachus with another piece by the same hand and addisons defense of christianity his next they had an english dictionary and a sort of english grammar an ovid of long standing with them and a bysshes art of poetry of later acquisition senecas morals had made the name of lestrange dear to them and as i imagine might occasion their getting his josephus in folio which was the largest purchase in their collection they had one volume of shakespeare with seven of his plays in it beside these stephen had read three or four other plays some of epictetus waller drydens virgil prior hudibras tom brown and the london spy you may see i am a faithful historian by my giving you the bad with the good  with these helps stephen is grown something of a poet and something of a philosopher i find by him that from his infancy he has had a cast in his mind toward poetry he has delighted as far back as he can remember in verses and in singing he speaks of strange emotions that he has felt on the top performances of the little choir of songsters in a country chancel and mentions his first hearing of an organ as a remarkable epoch of his life he seems to be a pretty good judge too of a musical line but i imagine that he does not hear verses in his own mind as he repeats them i dont know whether you understand me i mean that his ideas of the notes in a verse and his manner of repeating the same verse are often different for he points out an harmonious line well enough and yet he generally spoils its harmony by his way of speaking it  what first gave him a higher taste of poetry than he had been used to was miltons paradise lost this came oddly enough into his hands and when i see you i will tell you the history of it stephen read it over twice or thrice with a dictionary before he could understand the language of it thoroughly this and a sort of english grammar they had have been of the greatest use to him of any thing  indeed it seems plain to me that he has got english just as we get latin he studied paradise lost as others study the classics the new beauties in that poem that were continually opening upon his mind made all his labor easy to him he worked all day for his master and after the labor of the day set to his books at night the pains he has taken for the pleasure of improving himself are incredible but it has answered too beyond what one could have expected for he seems to understand some of the great and deeper beauties of that poem tolerably well and points out several particular beauties in it which it requires a good nice eye to discover  twas his friend that helped him to the spectators they read them often together and often by themselves stephen tells me that he has frequently carried them with him to his work when he did so his method was to labor harder than any body else that he might get half an hour to read a spectator without injuring his master by this means he used to sit down all over sweat and heat without regarding his own health and often to the prejudice of it if this affects you as it has me i ought not to pass it over that you may not lose the pleasure of so strong an instance of honesty and industry mixed together  the spectators improved his understanding he says more than any thing the copies of verses scattered in those pieces helped on his natural bent that way and made him willing to try whether he could not do something like em he sometimes turned his own thoughts into verse while he was at work and at last begun to venture those thoughts a little on paper what he did of this kind was very inconsiderable only scattered thoughts and generally not above four or five lines on the same subject which as there was nobody thereabouts that cared for verses nor any body that could tell him whether they were good or bad he generally flung into the fire as soon as he had pleased himself enough in reading them  whatever care he took to burn these little pieces he found it not sufficient to conceal them the thing took air and stephen who had before the name of a scholar among the country people was said now to be able to write verses too this was mentioned accidentally about a year ago before a young gentleman of oxford who sent for stephen and after some talk with him desired him to write him a letter in verse that letter is the epistle which stands the last in his poems but was the first whole copy of verses that ever he wrote this happened to fall into the hands of some clergymen in the neighborhood who were very well pleased with it and upon examining him found the man had a good deal of merit they gave him some presents which as things stood then were a great help to him and encouraged him to go on as much as they could  this made him proceed with more courage and as he had wrote some scattered verses on poverty before this happened he carried those thoughts on and filled it up as it stands at present in the printed collection i send you so that this is his second copy i am very careful in settling the chronology of his poems that you may see how he has gone on step by step if you please  the composition which was next in order is that on his own labors that subject was given him by one of those who first encouraged him and after this was finished he was employed from the same quarter in his shunammite as this exceeded any of the rest i think from hence we may date the era of his rising in his character and circumstances upon this it was that persons of distinction began to send for him different ways in short it got him fame enough to be pretty trouble some to him at first though it is likely to end in a much happier settlement of him and his affairs than could ever have been dreamt of by him at his first setting out  when you have read his poems and consider the manner he has been bred up in i doubt not you will think they have their merit but i assure you they give an imperfect idea of the man and to know how much he deserves one should converse with him and hear on what reasons he omitted such a part and introduced another why he shortens his style in this place and enlarges in that whence he has such a word and whence such an idea i will give you all i can recollect of this kind in relation to what is generally reckoned the best thing he has wrote the shunammite  in the first place i found upon inquiry that he wrote by a plan he thought over all the parts as he intended to use them before he made the verses for a poem of any length no doubt it is as necessary to do this as it is to have a draught of a house before you go to building it and yet i believe the common run of our poets have generally thought themselves above it or not thought of it at all though the shunammite was written on a story given to his hand still something of this kind was convenient enough because in forming it anew he did not make use of all the materials before him and has brought in some of his own he thought the stretching of the prophet in so particular a manner must sound strange the woman introduced to tell her story is a new cast of his own so is her doubting and then confirming herself again by a particular induction of all elishas miracles so the bringing an audience about her and their choruss when they join together in congratulating her happiness the last of which closes the poem in a good proper manner  upon being asked why he introduced a person to tell all the story in the shunammite and why he could not as well tell it himself he said he had read priors solomon and that in reading it solomons speaking every thing touched him particularly he was then asked since it was to be spoken why he did not rather choose the prophet as the person of the greater dignity to speak it he said to this that the woman was to be pitied that there seemed to him to be such as these ver    and she said nay my lord thou man of god do not tie unto thy handmaid ver    did i desire a son of my lord did i not say do not deceive me some expressions of the woman in the history which if not omitted might lessen our regard and compassion for her that if the prophet had related the thing he could not have omitted a word but when the woman did she might well be allowed to soften her own case and to drop when she was cool any thing wrong that she had said in the violence of her grief and passion this is rather fuller in words than he expressed it but nothing i think is added to his meaning  as milton had been his favorite poet you may wonder why none of his pieces are in blank verse i asked him about this too upon which he told me that he had originally written the whole shunammite in blank verse that upon reading it over he found his language was not sublime enough for it and that therefore he was forced to write it all over again and turn it into rhyme  upon reading over the chapter and his poem together you will see how justly he shortens and enlarges some of the particular passages in order to adapt them the more to poetry besides some things already mentioned he drops several little circumstances in it see   kings chap iv verses  0                         and     on the other hand he enlarges on the line    to    contentedness and charities of the woman on the    etc look and attitude of the prophet on her    thanks for bearing a son on     to     the death of the child on the     etc see  0  reasons of her confidence in the prophet in     pointing out the prophet when she comes to him and in     his answer in her     pressing the prophet more earnestly to assist her in     pointing out the dead child his being     freed from death and her thoughts     upon receiving him again into her arms  it is agreeable to see what use he has made of the little reading he can have had and how he has improved the thing by observing some good strokes in the books he has met with upon my telling him that i liked nothing better in it than his altering from line    to    the prophets countenance as he does he said he took that hint from telemachus where the young prince comes to idomeneuss court while they are sacrificing the priest on seeing telemachus breaks off from what he was about assumes a more inspired air and begins speaking of his future fortunes this alteration of the prophets countenance stephen says he took from thence but that at the same time he thought himself obliged to drop the wildness and enthusiasm of it in order to adapt it more to the nature of a true prophet  the chorus in the close of the shunammite he said was brought into his mind by the paradise lost book   line     and  0  general rejoicing of the angels in milton upon gods finishing the creation of the world the first chorus was not in the work originally he inserted it when he newformd it all into rhyme  he had also been very careful as to single words and had authorities to produce in several little particulars where one would not expect it for the shunammite ver   0 flowery carmel he quotes mr pope and the prophets arbor on the top of that mount is covered with     vines on the authority of mr sandys in his travels for the words     and     adust and supernal he refers to milton    fanatic he uses according to the true and not the vulgar sense of the word he had learned the proper meaning of it from his dictionary     dilated heart as spoken of sorrow is certainly a fault but it is a fault that stephen was naturally enough led into by the common notion and expressions in the country of the hearts swelling and being ready to burst with grief  he owns his faults very readily and if he thinks a line of his better than ordinary he will say so without any reserve he seems to be exceedingly open and honest in every thing he says and twould be very difficult for you to be with him a week as i have been without going away very much his friend  though i have been so long in showing you how critically he has proceeded as to his own works i shall add some of his thoughts on the works of others to give you as full an idea of him as i can  it is not yet three years ago that he first met with milton and i believe that was the first poet of real value that he ever studied in earnest he has assured me with all his innocence and simplicity that when he came afterward to read addisons criticisms on milton in the spectators twas a high pleasure to him to find many things mentioned there in the praise of milton exactly as he had before thought in reading him here we must depend on his credit which i need not tell you with me is very good  the name of milton whom he admires and dotes on so particularly has not prevailed on him enough to make him like his paradise regained in speaking of these two poems he said he wondered how milton could write so incomparably well where he had so little to lead him and so very poorly where he had more  the spectators you know he has read with great pleasure and great improvement i remember particularly that on somebodys calling them prose he said it was true they were prose but there was something in em that pleased almost like verse  he mentioned with more regard than usual the critical papers on wit those on milton the justum and tenacem from horace mr popes messiah and the several scattered ones written in the cause of virtue and religion  upon asking him what plays he had read he named particularly julius caesar hamlet cato venice preserved and the orphan venice preserved he said gave him the most horror a word which i took notice he used sometimes for sorrow and sometimes in its proper sense he could not bear the comic parts in it hamlet he liked better than julius caesar and in hamlet pointed out that celebrated speech to be or not to be etc as having been his favorite part merely of his own taste he did not admire shakespeares comedy and said he was too high and too low i read over to him some of hamlet and the celebrated speeches of antony to the people in julius caesar he trembled as i read the ghosts speech and admired the speeches and turns in the mob round caesars body more he said than ever he had done before as i was reading to him i observed that his countenance changed often in the most moving parts his eye was quick and busy all the time and to say the truth i never saw applause or the shifting of proper passions appear so strongly in any face as in his  he had formerly read tom browns letters from the dead and the london spy not without some pleasure but after he had been some time conversant with the spectators he said he did not care much to look into them he spoke of hudibras in another manner he saw a great deal of wit in it and was particularly pleased with the conjurers part in that poem but after all it is not a manner of writing that he can so sincerely delight in as in the moral the passionate or the sublime  indeed what every body seems to admire him for is that he seems to have an excellent moral turn in his thoughts he is as i told you before something of a philosopher and what is better than a philosopher a good honesthearted man he has read and speaks highly of the archbishop of cambrays demonstration of the being of a god and mr addisons defense of the christian religion he said that they touched his mind and that nothing did so well as when ones reason is moved by what is said he had liked the little he had read of epictetus but twas seneca that had made him happy in his own mind he seems as yet not to be hurt at all by any applauses that have been given him and to have been perfectly contented with his condition before when he had only received some presents from gentlemen in the country he was quite easy as to his circumstances the only thing then that he was solicitous about was how he might succeed as to the poetry he should be employed in this was his chief concern but even this seemed to proceed not so much from any desire of fame as from a principle of gratitude or as he expressed it his longing to please those friends that had been so generous to him he was not lifted up with the character some people gave him and talked of fame absolutely like a philosopher after his best fortune many of his friends told him the danger of being vain and if he should once be so that he would be as much despised as he had been applauded he said that he could not well tell what they meant that he did not know what it was to be vain but since so many great men who knew the world so much better than he did were apprehensive for him on that head he began to be terribly alarmed at his danger though he had no settled ideas of what it was he was told upon this that he should never speak too highly in praise of the poems he had written he said if that was all he was safe that was a thing he could never do for he could not think highly of them gentlemen indeed he said might like em because they were made by a poor fellow in a barn but that he knew as well as any body that they were not really good in themselves  thus sir i have obeyed your commands as faithfully as i am able you desired me not to spare paper but to send you a book rather than a letter you see i have taken you at your word and that

exposed my weak production to your view which may i hope have pardon at your hand because produced to light by your command perhaps you might expect some finished ode or sacred song to sound the praise of god a glorious thought and laudable but then think what illitrate poet guides the pen ill suit such tasks with one who holds the plough such lofty subjects with a fate so low sir were your eloquence and learning mine and i like you a favorite of the nine i quickly would parnassus summit climb and find a hero worthy of my rhyme nor should my muse the grecian monarchs trace nor would i celebrate the trojan race nor any of those martial sons of fame pagans unworthy of a christians theme far nobler thoughts my grateful voice should raise in lofty strains to great messiahs praise i would joyfully resound his wondrous birth and paint his godlike virtues whilst on earth then with reluctance horror and surprise i would mournfully relate his agonies i would trace the heavenly hero to the tree sing what he suffered there for you and me next in heroic numbers would i tell how soon he baffled death and vanquished hell subdued the grave and showed the glorious way from realms of darkness to eternal day such noble subjects should my lays excite and you my patron would in such delight grateful to me when you wellpleased should view thaccomplishd sacred song inscribed to you but now i must omit messiahs praise lest i degrade him with unworthy lays my fate compels me silent to remain for want of learning to improve my strain by which no thought though well conceived can rise to full perfection but in embryo dies yet my unpolished genius will produce and bring forth something though of little use thus in the country often have i found through slothful mans neglect a plat of ground waste and uncultivated void of seeds producing nothing but some trifling weeds but why stand i my fate accusing so the field calls me to labor i must go the kine low after meat the hungry steed neighing complains he wants his usual feed then sir adieu accept what you did crave and be propitious to your humble slave on poverty no ill on earth we timorous mortals fly with so much dread as abject poverty o despicable name we thee to shun on every other evil blindly run for fear of thee distrustful niggards go in tattered rags and starve their bodies too and still are poor for fear of being so for fear of thee the cheating trader vows his wares are good although his conscience knows he has employed his utmost skill and care to hide their faults and make their beauties glare the sailor terrified with thoughts of thee boldly attempts the dangers of the sea from east to west over rocks and quicksands steers it is poverty and that alone he fears the soldier too whom naught but thee can scare in hopes of plunder bravely meets the war to fly from poverty he runs on death and shows he prizes riches more than breath strange terror of mankind by thee misled not conscience quicksands rocks or death they dread and yet thou art no formidable foe except to little souls who think thee so who through the glass of prejudice survey thy face a thousand frightful forms display thus men at night in foolish fears grown old who mind the fairy tales their nurses told start at a goblin which their fancy made and for a spectre often take a shade contented povertys no dismal thing free from the cares unwieldy riches bring at distance both alike deceive our view nearer approached they take another hue the poor mans labor relishes his meat his morsels pleasant and his rest is sweet not so the rich who find their wearied taste palled with the prospect of the cumbrous feast for what they have more than they can enjoy instead of satisfying does but cloy but let us state the case another way were poverty so hideous as they say it is nobler cheerfully to bear our fate than murmur and repine beneath its weight that man deserves the praise of human kind who bears ill fortune with a christian mind how does his great heroic soul aspire above that sordid wealth the rest admire his nobler thoughts are fixed on things above his faithful eyes survey the god of love hold forth the heavenly prize which makes him run his mortal race to gain the immortal crown not all the snares a crafty devilish can lay can intercept or daunt him in his way not all the scornful insults of the proud not all the censures of the groveling crowd not poverty in all her terrors dressed can shake the solid quiet of his breast unmoved he stands against the worst of foes and mocks the darts which adverse fortune throws calm and composed amidst or ease or pain and finds content which others seek in vain so stands a steady rock sublimely steep within the confines of the briny deep lashed by the foaming surge on every side yet cannot be shaken by the furious tide then why should phantoms discompose the mind or woes so far from real fright mankind since wealth can never make the vicious blessed nor poverty subdue the virtuous breast since both from heavens unerring hand are sent lord give me either give me but content the threshers labor to the revd mr stanley the grateful tribute of these rural lays which to her patrons hand the muse conveys deign to accept it is just she tribute bring to him whose bounty gives her life to sing to him whose generous favors tune her voice and bid her midst her poverty rejoice inspired by these she dares herself prepare to sing the toils of each revolving year those endless toils which always grow anew and the poor threshers destined to pursue even these with pleasure can the muse rehearse when you and gratitude demand her verse soon as the golden harvest quits the plain and ceres gifts reward the farmers pain what corn each sheaf will yield intent to hear and guess from thence the profits of the year he calls his reapers forth around we stand with deep attention waiting his command to each our task he readily divides and pointing to our different stations guides as he directs to distant barns we go here two for wheat and there for barley two but first to show what he expects to find these words or words like these disclose his mind  so dry the corn was carried from the field  so easily twill thresh so well twill yield  sure large daysworks i well may hope for now  come strip and try let us see what you can do divested of our clothes with flail in hand at proper distance front to front we stand and first the threshals gently swung to prove whether with just exactness it will move that once secure we swiftly whirl them round from the strong planks our crabtree staves rebound and echoing barns return the rattling sound now in the air our knotty weapons fly and now with equal force descend from high down one one up so well they keep the time the cyclops hammers could not truer chime nor with more heavy strokes could aetna groan when vulcan forged the arms for thetis son in briny streams our sweat descends apace drops from our locks or trickles down our face no intermission in our work we know the noisy threshal must for ever go their master absent others safely play the sleeping threshal does itself betray nor yet the tedious labor to beguile and make the passing minutes sweetly smile can we like shepherds tell a merry tale the voice is lost drowned by the louder flail but we may think  alas what pleasing thing here to the mind can the dull fancy bring our eye beholds no pleasing object here no cheerful sound diverts our listening ear the shepherd well may tune his voice to sing inspired with all the beauties of the spring no fountains murmur here no lambkins play no linnets warble and no fields look gay it is all a gloomy melancholy scene fit only to provoke the muses spleen when sooty pease we thresh you scarce can know our native color as from work we go the sweat the dust and suffocating smoke make us so much like ethiopians look we scare our wives when evening brings us home and frighted infants think the bugbear come week after week we this dull task pursue unless when winnwing days produce a new a new indeed but frequently a worse the threshal yields but to the masters curse he counts the bushels counts how much a day then swears we have idled half our time away  why look ye rogues do you think that this will do  your neighbors thresh as much again as you now in our hands we wish our noisy tools to drown the hated names of rogues and fools but wanting these we just like schoolboys look when angry masters view the blotted book they cry their ink was faulty and their pen we the corn threshes bad twas cut too green but soon as winter hides his hoary head and natures face is with new beauty spread the lovely spring appears refreshing showers new cloth the field with grass and blooming flowers next her the ripening summer presses on and sol begins his longest race to run before the door our welcome master stands tells us the ripened grass requires our hands the grateful tidings presently imparts life to our looks and spirits to our hearts we wish the happy season may be fair and joyful long to breathe in opner air this change of labor seems to give such ease with thoughts of happiness ourselves we please but ah how rarelys happiness complete there is always bitter mingled with the sweet when first the lark sings prologue to the day we rise admonished by his early lay this new employ with eager haste to prove this new employ become so much our love alas that human joys should change so soon our morning pleasure turns to pain at noon the birds salute us as to work we go and with new life our bosoms seem to glow on our right shoulder hangs the crooked blade the weapon destined to uncloath the mead our left supports the whetstone scrip and beer this for our scythes and these ourselves to cheer and now the field designed to try our might at length appears and meets our longing sight the grass and ground we view with careful eyes to see which way the best advantage lies and herolike each claims the foremost place at first our labor seems a sportive race with rapid force our sharpened blades we drive strain every nerve and blow for blow we give all strive to vanquish though the victor gains no other glory but the greatest pains but when the scorching sun is mounted high and no kind barns with friendly shade are nigh our weary scythes entangle in the grass while streams of sweat run trickling down apace our sportive labor we too late lament and wish that strength again we vainly spent thus in the morn a courser have i seen with headlong fury scour the level green or mount the hills if hills are in his way as if no labor could his fire allay till phoebus shining with meridian heat has bathed his panting sides in briny sweat the lengthened chase scarce able to sustain he measures back the hills and dales with pain with heat and labor tired our scythes we quit search out a shady tree and down we sit from scrip and bottle hope new strength to gain but scrip and bottle too are tried in vain down our parched throats we scarce the bread can get and quite oerspent with toil but faintly eat nor can the bottle only answer all the bottle and the beer are both too small time flows again we rise from off the grass again each mower takes his proper place not eager now as late our strength to prove but all contented regular to move we often whet and often view the sun as often wish his tedious race was run at length he veils his purple face from sight and bids the weary labourer goodnight homewards we move but spent so much with toil we slowly walk and rest at every style our good expecting wives who think we stay got to the door soon eye us in the way then from the pot the dumplins caught in haste and homely by its side the bacon placed supper and sleep by morn new strength supply and out we set again our work to try but not so early quite nor quite so fast as to our cost we did the morning past soon as the rising sun has drank the dew another scene is open to our view our master comes and at his heels a throng of prattling females armed with rake and prong prepared whilst he is here to make his hay or if he turns his back prepared to play but here or gone sure of this comfort still here is company so they may chat their fill ah were their hands so active as their tongues how nimbly then would move the rakes and prongs the grass again is spread upon the ground till not a vacant place is to be found and while the parching sunbeams on it shine the haymakers have time allowed to dine that soon dispatched they still sit on the ground and the brisk chat renewed afresh goes round all talk at once but seeming all to fear that what they speak the rest will hardly hear till by degrees so high their notes they strain a stander by can naught distinguish plain so louds their speech and so confused their noise scarce puzzled echo can return the voice yet spite of this they bravely all go on each scorns to be or seem to be outdone meanwhile the changing sky begins to lour and hollow winds proclaim a sudden shower the tattling crowd can scarce their garments gain before descends the thick impetuous rain their noisy prattle all at once is done and to the hedge they soon for shelter run thus have i seen on a bright summers day on some green brake a flock of sparrows play from twig to twig from bush to bush they fly and with continued chirping fill the sky but on a sudden if a storm appears their chirping noise no longer dins your ears they fly for shelter to the thickest bush there silent sit and all at once is hush but better fate succeeds this rainy day and little labor serves to make the hay fast as it is cut so kindly shines the sun turned once or twice the pleasing work is done next day the cocks appear in equal rows which the glad master in safe ricks bestows the spacious fields we now no longer range and yet hard fate still work for work we change back to the barns we hastily are sent where lately so much time we pensive spent not pensive now we bless the friendly shade and to avoid the parching sun are glad yet little time we in the shade remain before our master calls us forth again and says for harvest now yourselves prepare  the ripened harvest now demands your care  get all things ready and be quickly dressed  early next morn i shall disturb your rest strict to his word for scarce the dawn appears before his hasty summons fills our ears his hasty summons we obey and rise while yet the stars are glimmering in the skies with him our guide we to the wheatfield go he to appoint and we the work to do ye reapers cast your eyes around the field and view the various scenes its beauties yield then look again with a more tender eye to think how soon it must in ruin lie for once set in wherever our blows we deal there is no resisting of the wellwhet steel but here or there wherever our course we bend sure desolation does our steps attend thus when arabias sons in hopes of prey to some more fertile country take their way how beauteous all things in the morn appear there rural cots and pleasant villas here so many grateful objects meet the sight the ravished eye could willing gaze till night but long ere then wherever their troops have past these pleasing prospects lie a gloomy waste the morning past we sweat beneath the sun and but uneasily our work goes on before us we perplexing thistles find and corn blown adverse with the ruffling wind behind our master waits and if he spies one charitable ear he grudging cries  ye scatter half your wages over the land then scrapes the stubble with his greedy hand let those who feast at ease on dainty fare pity the reapers who their feasts prepare for toils scarce ever ceasing press us now rest never does but on the sabbath show and barely that our masters will allow think what a painful life we daily lead each morning early rise go late to bed nor when asleep are we secure from pain we then perform our labors over again our mimic fancy ever restless seems and what we act awake she acts in dreams hard fate our labors even in sleep dont cease scarce hercules ever felt such toils as these but soon we rise the bearded crop again soon phoebus rays well dry the golden grain pleased with the scene our master glows with joy bids us for carrying all our force employ when strait confusion over the field appears and stunning clamours fill the workmens ears the bells and clashing whips alternate sound and rattling wagons thunder over the ground the wheat when carried pease and other grain we soon secure and leave a fruitless plain in noisy triumph the last load moves on and loud huzzas proclaim the harvest done our master joyful at the pleasing sight invites us all to feast with him at night a table plentifully spread we find and jugs of humming ale to cheer the mind which he too generous pushes round so fast we think no toils to come nor mind the past but the next morning soon reveals the cheat when the same toils we must again repeat to the same barns must back again return to labor there for room for next years corn thus as the years revolving course goes round no respite from our labor can be found like sisyphus our work is never done continually rolls back the restless stone newgrowing labors still succeed the past and growing always new must always last the shunammite to mrs stanley deign heavenly muses to assist my song to heavenly muses heavenly themes belong but chiefly thou o god my soul inspire and touch my lips with thy celestial fire if thou delightst in flowery carmels shade or jordans stream from thence i crave thy aid instruct my tongue and my low accents raise to sing thy wonders and display thy praise thy praise let all the sons of judah hear and to my song the distant tribes repair so prayed the shunammite heaven heard the dame the distant tribes around her listening came to hear thamazing tale while thus her tongue moved by some heavenly power began the song attend ye seed of abram and give ear while i jehovahs glorious acts declare how life from death and joy from sadness spring if he assist the muse the muse shall sing my lord and i to whom allbounteous heaven his blessings with no sparing hand had given like faithful stewards of our wealthy store still lodged the stranger and relieved the poor and as elisha by divine command came preaching virtue to a sinful land he often deigned to lodge within our gate and often received an hospitable treat a decent chamber for him we prepared and he the generous labor to reward honors in camp or court to us proposed which i refused and thus my mind disclosed heavens king has placed us in a fertile land where he showers down his gifts with copious hand already we enjoy an affluent store why should we be solicitous for more give martial camps and kingly courts to them who place their only bliss in fleeting fame there let them live in golden chains of state and be unhappy only to be great but let us in our native soil remain nor barter happiness for sordid gain here may we feed the indigent in peace or cloth the bare with the superfluous fleece and give the weary fainting pilgrim ease this we prefer to pomp and formal show which only serve to varnish over our woe refulgent ornaments which dress the proud objects of wonder to the gazing crowd yet seldom give content or solid rest to the vain man by whom they are possessed all blessings but a child had heaven supplied and only that the almighty had denied which when the holy prescient sage had heard he said and i before him strait appeared and as my feet approached his awful room i saw his face diviner looks assume not such a wildness and fanatic mien with which some say the delphic priests are seen when they for mysteries of fate explain the odd chimeras of a frantic brain but with a grave majestic air he stood while more than human in his aspect glowed celestial grace sat on his radiant look and power diffusive shone before he spoke then thus hail generous soul thy pious cares  are not forgot nor fruitless are thy prayers  propitious heaven thy virtuous deeds to crown  shall make thy barren womb conceive a son so spoke the seer and to complete my joy as he had spoke i bore the promised boy soon to my friends the welcome news was known who crowded in apace to see my son hailing with kind salutes the recent child and with their pious hymns my pain beguiled when all had said i moved my joyful tongue and thus to heaven addressed my grateful song  o god what eloquence can sing thy praise  or who can fathom thy stupendous ways  all things obey at thy divine command  thou make a fruitful field of barren land  obdurate rocks a fertile glebe shall be  and bring forth copious crops if bid by thee  arabian deserts shall with plenty smile  and curling vines adorn the sterile soil as thus she spoke her audience raise their voice and interrupt her song as they rejoice  o god we gladly hear thy mighty power  with joyful heart thy gracious name adore  all nature is subservient to thy word  and shifts her wonted course to please her lord  we for thy servants joy our thanks express  as grows the child so may her bliss increase  and may the guardian angels who preside  over the blessed his future actions guide  make spotless virtue crown his vital date  and hoary honor end his life but late  then safely bear  the dame here waved her hand the people straight obey her mute command all silent stand and all attentive look waiting her words while thus she mournful spoke all pleasures are imperfect here below our sweetest joys are mixed with bitter woe the draught of bliss when in our goblet cast is dashed with grief or spilt before we taste ere twice four years were measured by my son so soon alas the greatest blessings gone in harvesttime he to the reapers goes to view the bearded sheaves erect in rows like an embattled army in the field a new delightful prospect to the child but either there the scorching sun displayed his heat intense and on his vitals preyed or else some sudden apoplectic pain with racking torture seized his tender brain his spirits failed he straight began to faint and to his father vainly made complaint the glowing rose was quickly seen to fade at once his beauty and his life decayed soon at my house the dismal news i heard soon at my house the dying child appeared to embrace him i with fond affection run and o said i what pain afflicts my son he tried to speak but faultring gave a groan no perfect word proceeded from his tongue but on his lips the broken accents hung all means i used that might allay his pain all means i used but used them all in vain yet while he lived my soul would not despair nor till he ceased to breathe i ceased my prayer deluding hope now stopped the falling tears now his increasing pains increased my fears by hope and fear alternate was i tossed till hope in a sad certainty was lost short and more short he drew his panting breath too sure presage of his approaching death till soon the blood congealing ceased to flow he dropped his head with a declining bow thrice from my breast to raise himself he tried and thrice sunk down again then groaning died thus when with care we have nursed a tender vine and taught the docile branches where to twine an eastern gale or some pernicious frost nips the young tree and all our labors lost with horror chilled awhile i speechless stood viewing the child and trembling as i viewed my eyes discharged their humid store apace and tears succeeded tears adown my face scarcely my heart the load of grief sustained at length recovring speech i thus complained o fleeting joys inconstant as the wind which only for a moment please the mind then fly and leave a weight of woes behind but yet in vain i thus lament and mourn the soul once fled shall never more return and the fair body now must be conveyed to earths dark bosom and eternal shade  yet let me not prescribe a bound to heaven twas by a miracle the child was given nor can i think the wonder is more great should the departed soul resume her seat what if i to mount carmel haste away to him who did his mystic birth display his powerful word the barren fruitful made his powerful word perhaps may raise the dead the famous tishbite raised a widows son elisha has as wondrous actions done when he to jordans rapid torrent came and with the mantle smote the impetuous stream obsequious to the stroke the waves divide and raise a liquid wall on either side at jericho long had the barren soil deceived the husbandman and mocked his toil yet at his word it grew a fertile field and poisonous springs did wholesome waters yield nor can he only such great blessings send but curses if invoked his call attend else how at bethel brought he vengeance down as a just scourge on that opprobrious town again when moab peace with israel broke and vainly strove to quit the servile yoke our powerful kings led forth thembattled host through edoms sultry wilds and air adust where the confedrate troops no water found dry were the springs and sterile was the ground the captains wonted strength and courage failed when thirst and foes at once their host assailed the kings to him their joint petitions made and fainting soldiers craved his timely aid nor craved in vain the powerful word he spoke and flowing waters formed a spacious lake the shining streams advanced their humid train till edoms wilds became a liquid plain not in more plenty did the waters run out of the rock when struck by amrams son and who can that amazing deed forget which he performed to pay the widows debt whose quantity of oil one pot contained yet numerous vessels filled before twas drained sure he who such stupendous acts has done if god propitious prove can raise my son so saying up i caught the child with speed and laid him on the sacred prophets bed then called my servant to prepare the steed pensive and sad my mourning husband said it is now in vain to crave elishas aid no god today the prophet does inspire nor can he answer what thou would inquire rather than sink said i attempt to raise my hopes nor talk of ceremonial days his god is present still and hears him when he prays thus said urging my steed with eager haste swift as a mountain roe the plains i passed over hills and dales my journey i pursued nor slackd my pace till carmels mount i viewed on whose delightful brow in cool retreat among the curling vines the prophet sat whose twining arms a verdant arbor made the verdant arbor formed a grateful shade the fanning zephyrs gently played around and shook the trembling leaves and swept the ground down humbly at his feet i prostrate fell submiss and weeping told the mournful tale strive to compose thy anxious soul said he tears cannot revoke jehovahs fixed decree we live and die and both as he thinks fit who may command but mortals must submit this fate the king as well as peasant finds nor is it evil but to evil minds  yet if from heaven i can my suit obtain thy lifeless son shall yet revive again thus said with looks divine his staff he views as if some powerful charm he would infuse then calls his servant hastily and said on the childs face let this be quickly laid o thou said i on whom my hopes depend do not this work to servants care commend if thou thyself with me refuse to go here to the listening vines i will vent my woe still prostrate lie lamenting for my son till every hill prove vocal to my moan more had i said but grief the words suppressed yet sighs and silent tears explained the rest at length he from his verdant seat arose and hastily adown the mountain goes to shunem we with speed our way pursue the city soon appears within our view and the obedient servant at the gate returning sad without success we met the beauteous child by death still vanquished lay still death insulted over the beauteous prey till to the house the sacred seer was come and with supernal power approached the room by the dead child awhile he pensive stood then from the chamber put the mourning crowd that done to god he made his ardent prayer and breathed upon the child with vital air and now the soul resumes her pristine seat and now the heart again begins to beat lifes purple current over the body spreads while death repulsed ingloriously recedes thus when a prowling wolf has stolen a lamb he sternly guards it from the bleating dam but if the keeper comes he quits his prey and lowering with reluctance makes away and now the prophet to my longing arms resigned the child with more than wonted charms the blushing rose shone fresher in his face and beauty smiled with a superior grace so when heavens lamp that rules the genial day behind the sable moon pursues his way affrighted mortals when theclipse is over believe him more illustrious than before here ends the dame and the promiscuous throng with hallelujahs thus conclude the song  holy and good art thou lord god of host  and all thy works are wonderful and just  both life and death are in thy powerful hand  both life and death obey thy great command  by thy great power the heavens and earth are awed  then let the heavens and earth adore their god  thou glorious sun that measurst all our days  rising and setting still advance his praise  thou moon and ye less glittering orbs that dance  round this terrestrial globe his praise advance  ye seas for ever waving to and fro  praise when ye ebb and praise him when ye flow  ye wandering rivers and each purling stream  as ye pursue your course his praise proclaim  ye dews and mists and humid vapors all  praise when ye rise and praise him when ye fall  but chiefly israel who do daily view  his powerful works his daily praise renew gratitude a pastoral menalcas colin menalcas friend colin well oertook i have of late observed thy cheerful mien and airy gait say what auspicious change since the other day when by thy lonely cot i took my way sorrow and sadness then overspread thy brows and every look did gloomy cares disclose now joys diffusive in thy aspect rise and mirth and gladness sparkle in thy eyes  colin where have thou lived menalcas not to know whose generous bounty has removed my woe i thought the gracious carolinas name ere this had filled the sounding trump of fame  menalcas that gracious name the world is bound to bless all grateful swains her generous deeds confess but colin say has she removed thy care i am happy when thy happiness i hear  colin o you menalcas know my abject birth born in a cot and bred to till the earth on rigid worldlings always doomed to wait forced at their frugal hands my bread to get but when my wants to caroline were known she blessed me with a pasture of my own this makes new pleasures in my bosom glow these joyful looks i to her bounty owe  menalcas and may kind heaven reward that gracious queen who to thy wants has so propitious been yet though her bounty has thy wants supplied let not her bounty ever exalt thy pride but keep an humble mind a grateful heart her favors far exceed thy own desert heaven moved the goodness of the royal dame and heaven and she thy gratitude must claim  colin when me she first into her favor took i cut this oaken staff it is now my crook and engraved her royal bounty in the rind but engraved it deeper in my grateful mind the letters in the staff may wear away those written in my soul shall never decay  menalcas so may thy little flock increase their tale so may thy field of pasture never fail may heaven and she in just proportion still or smile or frown as thou art good or ill  colin may hungry foxes kill my tender lambs may poisonous serpents suck their bleating dams and may my cows distended udders fail elude my hopes and never fill the pail in short to make my curse the more complete though it is the only thing i dread and hate may heaven and heavenly caroline remove their smiles if colin ever ungrateful prove  menalcas thy thanks and prayers her generous soul will please a tribute justly due and paid with ease sometimes a song perhaps she may require and thou to sing but lately did aspire when in an abject low laborious state sunk deep in cares and pressed beneath their weight then so at least it is said among our swains in sonnets colin charmed away his pains much sooner now thou may a song rehearse whenever she condescends to hear thy verse  colin o friend too well you know my simple strains are far inferior to each rural swains yet since great carolina thinks no scorn to patronize a shepherd meanly born henceforth i will strive to raise my voice sublime and with her royal name adorn my rhyme i will on each verdant mountain sing her praise and vocal groves shall echo to my lays to every swain her godlike worth proclaim nor ever drop the pleasing glorious theme  menalcas then since we are met where friendly branches spread and trembling leaves diffuse a cooling shade since on the sprays the thrush and finch rejoice invoke thy muse and tune thy rural voice  colin another day my rural voice i will raise another day the muse shall tune her lays but now alas such crowding joys i find no words can speak the transports of my mind would phoebus warm me with poetic fire or would the mantuan muse my tongue inspire as great eliza shone in spencers line the greater carolina should in mine then would i emulate the tuneful throng and with her glorious name immortalize my song  a pastoral elegy at first in vales obscure the lyre i strung vales where the muse her annual labors sung now leaving these she ranges over the plains and tunes her voice to flocks and shepherd swains yet fresh in grief but feebly moves her wings weeps while she flies and trembles as she sings two country swains in friendship firmly joined loved each alike and were like brothers kind great caroline her royal bounty showed to one and raised him from the groveling crowd when straight his smiling looks and cheerful mien proclaimed the goodness of a gracious queen but gloomy sadness soon his face possessed and clouded all the joys before expressed the other gay and pleasant still appeared nor grieved for evils past nor future feared one day they met menalcas first began and thus the mournful tale alternate ran menalcas why colin do thou wear that pensive look and sighing stand supported by thy crook say from what cause this melancholy springs or do thou verify what damon sings  vain man can never satiate his desires  the more he has the more he still requires  today he is craving and tomorrow cloyed  new pleasures grow insipid when enjoyed so when our sheep on hills refuse to feed we straight remove them to the verdant mead where all intent the luscious herbage graze and for that day their pasture seems to please the next they range around the flowery space and bleating tell they loath the tainted grass  colin twas yesterday a giddy sheep i viewed which rose in cuddys fold and staggring stood while one with burly horns secure from pain ran enviously and pushed him down again so you vain jesting youth unmoved with care insult the hapless swain that is in despair  menalcas i nor insulted nor intended guile and if i jested twas to make thee smile but tell me swain what wondrous turn of fate oerclouds thy face that looked serene of late what is thy harvest blasted on the ground or has the royal carolina frowned unveil thy griefs and make thy sorrows known you know my friends misfortunes are my own  colin my harvest is not blasted on the ground nor has the royal carolina frowned but lately when the sun had gaily dressed the lofty mountains in a purple vest i early rose to tend my fleecy care wet was the grass and piercing cold the air my lovely sylvia stay behind i said till i have weaved a garland for thy head till i a bower with shady branches form to shun the scorching ray or rapid storm and when the dews exhaled which night distilled bless colin with thy presence in the field she answered not but from her bosom sent a deep presaging sigh before i went the sun had painted every object gay when to the cheerful field i took my way the lark with mattins welcomed in the morn the thrush and finch sat chirping on the thorn the swallows round in airy circles flew and ah poor colin then was joyful too but suddenly i saw the mists arise and darkning clouds overspread the dusky skies thhorizon seemed to cast a gloomy frown while from his airy height the lark sunk down the tuneful birds their joyous songs denied and boding owls and sooty ravens cried my drooping heart which felt unusual weight shocked with such omens ceased almost to beat yet these said i portend no evil while my royal mistress condescends to smile if she is propitious what can colin fear inured the lesser ills of life to bear thus said i took my way to yonder grove and formed with spreading boughs an arched alcove so close i twisted in each pliant spray as might exclude the wind or sunny ray with sweetest flowers i decked the mossy ground and strewn the fragrant woodbinds all around here when said i my sylvia comes afield this grateful bower a safe retreat shall yield if rainy here she may the storms evade if fair the branches will project a shade here sylvia shall with colin take her rest and colin here with sylvia shall be blessed as thus i spoke around i cast my eye and saw celestial celia drawing nigh i saw but wondered why her heavenly mien was clouded over that used to be serene celias the mistress of the flowery plain whose bountys known to every worthy swain not godlike pan presided with more care nor to arcadian shepherds was so dear when celia to the rural shade retires she every breast with rising hope inspires expecting swains with joyous looks proclaim the happy time and hail the generous dame as languid plants which half the year lie dead when spring approaches raise their drooping head she crossed the plains with a dejected air her pensive aspect showed her pious care and loath thunwelcome tidings to reveal she sighing spoke and left thunfinishd tale  ah poor unhappy swain return return  the sable clouds foretell a rainy morn  nor only is the day overcast with gloom  thy pleasing hopes are blasted all at home  thy sylvia o she said and dropped the rest but my presaging heart too rightly guessed i silent stood and spoke my grief with tears you know my heart was firmly linked to hers  menalcas i know your hearts are linked in friendship fast long may that mutual bond of friendship last may hymen to you both propitious prove and death but late untie the knot of love  colin o stop menalcas and my loss deplore the good the faithful sylvia is no more that gloomy morn she in my absence died and rigid death the last farewell denied another loss i could content have born but must the loss of sylvia always mourn my lovely sylvia was my softest theme my song by day by night my pleasing dream but now in sighs i spend the lingering day and weeping pass the tardy night away nor does thy friend indulge a needless care my loss is great and just is my despair  menalcas thy loss and sorrows equally are great but deaths the law of nature fixed by fate our flocks our herds our all precarious stands and fall we must when heaven our fall commands  colin yet flocks and herds are with reluctance spared and what are flocks and herds with her compared a hungry fox stole ten of cuddys lambs a lurching mongrel killed their bleating dams say did not cuddy for his loss repine but ah what loss was his compared with mine  menalcas i have a flute which damon lately made no shepherd on a sweeter ever played i tuned it yesterday and straight a throng of nymphs and swains ran crowding to my song my listening ewes awhile forsook their meat my tender lambs though hungry ceased to bleat i will tune again the soft harmonious lay music perhaps may chase thy cares away  colin menalcas musics for a lighter ill such woes as mine would baffle all thy skill upon his flute alexis often plays and strives to charm my sorrows with his lays upon his flute alexis plays in vain his lays though charming cannot charm my pain the tuneful birds rejoice on every spray my wanton lambkins in their pasture play in vain the tuneful birds rejoice in vain my wanton lambkins sport upon the plain with cheerful green the spacious fields are crowned and beauteous flowers adorn the painted ground the snowy blossoms on the branches shine a pleasing scene to every eye but mine for neither cheerful green that crowns the field nor snowy blossoms which the branches yield nor flowers that spread the painted meadows over delight my eyes now sylvia is no more  menalcas it is more than time thy mournful dirge to end for see the whistling ploughmen homeward tend our fleecy flocks stand waiting round the fold damp feel the dews the ruffling breezes cold the setting sun forsakes the blushing skies and hazy fogs from marshy grounds arise then fold thy sheep thy anxious cares remove nor weep on earth for her who sings above  on a good conscience the solid joys of human kind are those that flow from peace of mind for who the sweets of life can taste with vice and timorous guilt oppressed it is virtue softens all our toils with peace our conscience crowns gives pleasure when our fortune smiles and courage when it srowns calms every trouble makes the soul serene smooths the contracted brow and chears the heart within while guilty minds involved with woe anticipate the future blow which is to make damnation more complete the lesser hell in passage to the great bold and intrepid honest men appear for as they know no evil none they fear a glorious shield of virtue guards their breast armed with themselves they always walk at rest thus under bursting clouds and stormy skies when thunder roars and lightning flies the imperial eagles boldly rove nor dread the fiery bolt of jove while meaner birds in secret creep below and trembling fear and often feel the blow on music i music the coldest heart can warm the hardest melt the fiercest charm disarm the savage of his rage dispel our cares and pains assuage with joy it can our souls inspire and tune our tempers to the lyre our passions like the notes agree and stand subdued by harmony this found the melancholy king when david tuned the trembling string sweet music chased the sullen spleen away and made his clouded soul serenely gay ii while music breathes in martial airs the coward durst forget his fears or if the notes to pity sound revenge and envy cease to wound the power of music has been known to raise or tumble cities down thus theban turrets authors say were raised by musics magic lay and ancient jerichos heavnhated wall to sacred music owed its destined fall iii nor mortals only music love it chears celestial saints above sweet hallelujahs angels sing around their great ethereal king ceasless they sound the fathers praise the father too approves their lays for he as all things music made and seraphims before him played when over horebs mount he came arrayed in majesty and flame after the sounding trump sublime he rode the sounding trump proclaimed the approaching god iv music had being long before the solemn organ learnt to roar when michael over the heavenly plain advanced to fight the rebel train loud trumpets did his wrath declare in music terrible to hear and when the universe was made on golden harps the angels played and when it falls as fall it must music shall penetrate the dust the trump shall sound with the archangels breath and sweetly dreadful wake the dead from death on richmond park and royal gardens of blissful groves i sing and flowery plains ye sylvan nymphs assist my rural strains shall windsor forest gain a deathless fame and grow immortal as the poets name while not a bard of all the tuneful throng with these delightful fields adorns his this was writ in the year      since when great alterations and improvements have been made in the gardens and several poems published on the same subject song thy gardens richmond boast an equal theme and only ask an equal muses flame what though no virgin nymphs of cynthias train with belt and quiver grace the verdant plain what though no fabled consecrated floods flow over thy fields or murmur through thy woods my song thy real beauties shall pursue and paint the lovely scenes and paint em true a pleasing task nor slight shall be the praise if royal caroline accept the lays delighted often through the mazy groves the muse in pensive contemplation roves or climbs the slow ascending richmond hill hill whose brow hangs over the silver stream which rolls below where all around me shining prospects rise and various scenes invite my gazing eyes and while i view one object with delight new pleasing wonders charm the feasted sight now this allures now that attracts it most and the first beautys in the second lost thus in a grateful concert may we hear the sounds at once surprise and charm our ear the trembling notes in hasty fugues arise and this advances ere the former flies all seem to be confused yet all agree to perfect the melodious harmony beneath the mount with what majestic pride the sire of rivers rolls his silver tide let poets sing of hermus golden shore his amber foam and sands of shining ore nor tagus envy we nor fruitful nile whose fattning floods enrich the thirsty soil happy britannia boasts as fair a stream as great in bounties and as great in fame since denhams deathless muse has sung his tide and indias riches over his surface glide obsequious river when my eyes survey thy waves or east or west pursue their way now swiftly roll to meet the briny main at stated periods now return again how vain the schemes of infidels appear how weak their reasnings and the god how clear say atheists since you own by natures laws there is no effect produced without a cause why should the restless stream run to and fro and with alternate motion ebb and flow did not some being of superior force rule the wild waves and regulate their course hence lofty windsor to the sight appears and high in air her pompous turrets rears wide round her domes the spacious forest shines though brighter much in popes harmonious lines o would his tuneful muse my breast inspire with equal warmth with her sublimer fire then richmond hill renowned in verse should grow and thames reecho to the song below a second eden in my page should shine and miltons paradise submit to mine often lost in thought forgetful of my way i over the park through wilds of beauty stray where sportive nature wantons at her will and lavishes her bloom uncheckd by skill old venerable trees majestic rise sublime in air and brave the vaulted skies which free from cruel steel or labrers hand in peaceful age and hoary honor stand here when aurora first begins to dawn the wakeful larks spring mounting from the lawn poised by their plumes in lofty flights they play with joyful warblings hail the approaching day but when the sun displays a purple scene and drinks the pearly dew that decked the green a thousand tuneful birds in concert meet a thousand tuneful notes the groves repeat and when their music ceases with the day sweet philomela chants her pensive lay but hark i hear a louder music sound from woods and vales the various notes rebound it is albions king pursues the royal chase the nimble stag skims over thunbending grass the way which fear directs he trembling tries nor knows where fear directs or where he flies a hundred different sounds assail his ears a death in every different sound he fears and now he faintly moves a slower pace and closer now the hounds pursue the chase till in despair back on his foes he turns makes feeble efforts with his branchy horns short is the combat soon he yields his breath and gasping falls and trembling pants in death now to a softer theme descends my muse through artful walks her pleasing path pursues where lofty elms and conic lindens rise or where thextensive terras charms her eyes where elegance and noble grandeur meet as the ideas of its mistress great magnificently fair majestically sweet see on its margin fields of waving corn these bearded crops and flowerets this adorn ceres and flora lovingly embrace and gay varieties the landscape grace hence lead me muses through yon arched grove adorned with sand below and leaves above or let me over the spacious oval trace where verdant carpets spread the lovely place where trees in regular confusion stand and sylvan beauties rise on every hand or bear me nymphs to the sequestered cell where boil and newton mighty sages dwell whose fame shall live although the grot decay long as those sacred truths their works display how sweetly pleasing is this cool retreat when phoebus blazes with meridian heat in vain the fervid beams around it play the rocky roof repels the scorching ray securely guarded with a sylvan scene in natures livry dressed for ever green to visit this the curious stranger roves with grateful travel through a wild of groves and though directed often mistakes his way unknowing where the winding mazes stray yet still his feet the magic paths pursue charmed though bewildered with the pleasing view not so attractive lately shone the plain a gloomy waste not worth the muses strain where thorny brakes the traveller repelled and weeds and thistles overspread the field till royal george and heavenly caroline bid nature in harmonious luster shine the sacred fiat through the chaos rung and symmetry from wild disorder sprung so once confused the barbarous nations stood unpolished were their minds their manners rude till rome her conquering eagles wide displayed and bid the world reform  the world obeyed how blessed the man in these delightful fields new pleasures each indulgent moment yields let gayer minds in town pursue their joys exchanging quietness for crowds and noise consume the night at masquerade or play or waste in busy idleness the day i envy not augustas pompous piles since rural solitude more pleasing smiles o solitude the sages chief delight what numbers can thy lovely charms recite hail peaceful nymph thou eldest thing on earth nay like eternity thou had no birth the heavens alone can thy commencement tell ere michael fought or peccant angels fell before the skies with radiant light were clad in awful gloom and venerable shade the father thee his sole companion made when to creation first his thoughts inclined and future worlds were rising in his mind he sat with thee and planned the mighty scheme with thee adjusted the stupendous frame contrived how globes selfbalancd in the air with restless rounds should rule the circling year how orbs over orbs in mystic dance should roll what laws support and regulate the whole nor art thou yet impaired celestial dame thy charms are still attractive still the same with thee the mind abstracted from the crew may study nature and her ends pursue with thee i hear the feathered warblers sing with thee survey the beauties of the spring when blossoms leaves and fruits the branches yield and edens glory crowns the happy field here first the muse auspicious was the place rejoiced to see her royal guardians face how mild yet how majestic was her look how sweetly condescending all she spoke on every pleasing accent wisdom hung and truth and virtue dwelt upon her tongue o were i equal to the glorious theme then should my lays immortalize her fame or paint great george in peaceful laurels dressed with albions safety laboring in his breast who while contending nations round him jar and subjects wealth supports their monarchs war guards happy britain with his floating towers from purple slaughter and invading powers no plundring armies rob our fruitful plain but blessed with peace and plenty smiles the swain not so he smiles upon the foreign shores but starving walks through natures lavish stores poor peasants with their rigid burdens groan and till the glebe for harvests not their own what though their more propitious phoebus shines with warmer rays and chears the curling vines what though rich olives grace the fertile soil and the hot climate teems with fattning oil the hungry farmer views his crops in vain in vain the vineyard tempts the thirsty swain while their stern tyrants arbitrary power rifles the plains and ravages their store thy sons britannia from such evils free enjoy the sweets of peace and liberty a gracious sovereign smiles upon the throne and heaven confirms the happy realm his own avaro and amanda a poem in four cantos taken from the spectator vol i no xi canto i what ills from want of education flow from avarice what cruel scenes of woe i mean to sing except the tuneful maid neglect my numbers and refuse her aid say goddess first what made the youth explore a foreign clime and quit his native shore say too how on the barbarous isle he came what moved the kindness of the negro dame what could provoke a faithless youth to sell a friend whose only crime was loving well now had avaro twenty winters passed his blooming features every beauty graced in silver rings his loosely flowing hair hung over his shoulders with a comely air robust his limbs and daring was his soul and vigor crowned the wellproportiond whole his graceful charms the ladies often surveyed and often their eyes an amorous signal made but never could the tender passion move the stubborn youth was still averse to love yet though his breast was proof to cupids dart a more ignoble god enslaved his heart no mysteries of faith disturbed his head for mysteries of faith he seldom read that moral law which nature had impressed he blotted from the volume of his breast yet in his mind his fathers precepts bears who often rung this lesson in his ears  would you my son to happiness aspire  know gold alone can happiness acquire  he that has gold is powerful as a king  has valor virtue wisdom every thing  this to obtain your utmost skill bestow  and if you gain it be not careful how  if in the court or camp you take delight  then dare to flatter there or here to fight  or should the merchants life your fancy please  be bold and bravely venture on the seas  many by merchandise have gained renown  and made the indies wealth become their own the youth imbibed the precepts of his tongue neglecting every law of right and wrong taught by his sire to court destructive gain he burns to try his fortune on the main while other youths by wit or pleasure swayed frequent the play the ball or masquerade avaro studious in his chamber stays careless of balls of masquerades and plays there adds subtracts and with unwearied pain learns all the rules of interest loss and gain next from an old astronomer he tries to learn the planets journey through the skies with him at night when heaven serene appears he points the quadrant at the shining spheres the hyades and frozen pole surveys which guide the sailor over the distant seas then maps and models of our globe prepares and carefully inspects both hemispheres from east to west he views the spacious round pleased with the modern world columbus found in hope elate the youth impatient stands and seems to grasp both indies in his hands this sees the sire and hastily provides a vessel proof against the wind and tides the youth embarks the soft propitious gales arise and soon expand the swelling sails the ship glides swiftly over the liquid plain and neptune smiles and courts him on the main but see how mortals are the sport of fate how often unhappy striving to be great ere cynthia twice her monthly race had run an omen of the fatal storm begun the murmuring wind arises by degrees and rocks the ship and sweeps the curling seas now louder with impetuous force it roars and shoves the swelling surges to the shores till rapid rain and flakes of bickring flame with dreadful thunder vex thethereal frame struck with surprise the timorous merchant stands nor knows what he forbids or what commands nor safely back nor can he forwards go but trembling waits and fears the fatal blow long time the sailers work against the wind with fruitless toil to gain the port assigned till courage hope and all provisions failed and fear despair and want their souls assailed forced by the storm into a winding bay their joyful eyes an indian isle survey when straight they quit their ship and gain the shore and for recruits the savage land explore adjoining to the dreary beach there stood wild shrubs and trees that formed a gloomy wood where close obscured the crafty natives lay and watched the wandering crew remote from sea then forth they rush and strait their bows prepare too late the sailers see the approaching war in vain the brave engage or timorous fly the timorous and the brave promiscuous die the barbarous fields are stained with purple gore and dreadful groanings echo to the shore our youthful merchant escapes and flies alone his fear impels and safety prompts him on through dusky woods he takes his trembling flight the dusky woods conceal him from their sight till in the devious wilds remote from foes then on the ground he weeping vents his woes often cursed his hapless fate and often thought on what the hoary starmonger had taught how at our birth as different planets rule they form a wit or constitute a fool how in the maze of life we act as they attract retard or force us in the way and as he these uncertain censures made against the stars he thus exclaiming said the planets sure some noxious power display and rule my life with arbitrary sway else had i never forsook my native home nor in this baleful desert met my doom  and yet when i reflect i cannot see how globes insensible should influence me i choose my actions when the choice is made i nor invoke nor yet consult their aid when mortals act according to their will can heaven be called the author of their ill too late i find the stars are not in fault but it is that golden wish my sire has taught enticing gold that damned deceiving guide induced me first to stem the foaming tide fallacious charm that led me from repose now leaves me in a labyrinth of woes so when compacted vapors in the night skim over the fields with a delusive light the injudicious traveller surveys thalluring scene and courts the glistring blaze till tempted over a rocks impending brow he falls to some tremendous gulf below thus the unhappy youth laments his fate conscious of all the ills that round him wait till setting phoebus leaves the blushing sky and glimmering stars a feeble light supply the shades of night increase his anxious care and add a greater horror to despair canto ii all night in tears the pensive merchant lay and often wished and feared the coming day till on the hills the rising sun displayed his golden beams and chased away the shade harmonious birds salute his cheerful rays and hail the rosy morn with joyful lays while stretched upon the ground avaro moans answring their tuneful songs with piercing groans not distant far from where the youth was laid a purling stream in pleasing murmurs played and by the margin of the crystal flood two rows of trees in beautcous order stood whose branches formed a pendent arch above diffusing gloomy verdure over the grove an indian princess hither daily came pleased with the grateful shade and cooling stream she now was walking to her loved retreat and heard the mourning youth lament his fate fixed in amaze awhile she listening stood then swift approached him rushing through the wood the affrighted merchant rose with gazing eyes and timorous looks that testified surprise backward he starts the dame with equal fears recedes as fast and wonders what appears yet bolder grown she soon advanced again smit with the beauty of the godlike man his dress and fair complexion charmed her sight each glowing feature gave her new delight while love and pity both arose within and kindled in her soul a flame unseen with equal joy avaro now surveyed the native graces of the negro maid he viewed her arms with various ribbands bound her downy head with painted feathers crowned with bredes and lucid shells in circles strung which shone refulgent as they round her hung as when in splendid robes a courtly maid begins the dance at ball or masquerade the pearls and dimonds shine with mingled light and glittering pendants blaze against the sight so shone the beauteous shells around her waist and sparkling gems that decked her jetty breast all which avaros gazing eyes pursue charmed with her lovely shape disclosed to view each limb appears in just proportion made with elegance through every part displayed and now his cares dissolve new passions move and nature intimates the change is love not far remote a cooling grot was made in which the virgin often sought a shade thick shrubs and fruitful vines around it grew and none except herself the mansion knew to this obscure recess the royal dame rejoicing with her lovely captive came then from the branches with officious haste she plucks the fruits which yield a sweet repast that done she with her bow explores the wood pierced with her shaft the fowl resigns his blood then back she hastens to her cool retreat and for avaro dressed the grateful meat to slake his thirst she next directs his way where crystal streams in wild meanders stray nor lets him there exposed to foes remain but to the cave conducts him safe again so doats amanda on the merchant while she scorns the lovers of her native isle for all the heroes of her country strove with emulation to attract her love and when they could the painted fowls ensnare or pierce the savage beast in sylvan war the skins and feathers trophies of their fame they gave for presents to the royal dame all which she to her loved avaro brought and with them gaily decked his shining grot the spotted panther here she hung and there with paws extended frowned the shaggy bear here gaudy plumes appear in luster bright there shells and pearls diffuse a sparkling light as when to grace some royal princes hall the skilful painter animates the wall here warlike heroes frown in martial arms there a soft nymph displays her blushing charms a pleasing landscape next invites our eye and the room glows with sweet variety yet still to give her lover more delight lest what he daily saw should pall the sight when sol with purple clothed the western sky and shades extended showed the evening nigh she to some verdant grove the youth conveyed where nightingales harmonious music made soft flowerets were their couch and all around diffusive sweets perfumed the fragrant ground there often she would his snowy bosom bare often round her fingers wind his silver hair charmed with the contrast which their colors made more pleasing than the tulips light and shade nor was the youth insensible but soon repaid her love by showing of his own often would his bosom heave with speaking sighs often would he gaze and languish with his eyes now on her panting breast his head repose to meet his head her panting breast arose while in her soul ecstatic raptures glowed and her fond arms believed they clasped a god so lived the happy pair observed by none till both had learnt a language of their own in which the youth one evening in the shade beguiles the harmless unsuspicious maid leans on her breast and with a kiss betrays then vents his specious fraud in words like these witness ye gods and all ye blessed above for ye can witness best how well i love if ever among our blooming nymphs i knew such pleasures as my soul receives from you o dear amanda could i but with thee once more my happy native country see you should not there in lonely caves retreat nor trace the burning sands with naked feet your limbs which now the sun and wind invade should neatly be in softest silks arrayed in gilded houses gaily should you ride by horses drawn which prancing side by side neigh foam and champ the bit with graceful pride our time in pomp and peace should slide away and blooming pleasures crown the smiling day and when the setting sun forsook the skies approaching night should but increase our joys we would not on the chilling ground embrace nor foes as now should interrupt our peace but both reposing on some easy bed soft as the fleecy down that decks thy head the sportive god of love should round us play while we in raptures passed the night away then let us carefully my dear explore the haven where i first approached the shore perhaps we shall some floating ship survey safe to conduct us over the watery way nor let the foaming waves your steps retard i will guard you over and be a faithful guard how often alas is innocence betrayed when love invites and flatterers persuade how could the dame a stranger to deceit imagine such a heavenly form a cheat she paused she sighed then with a pensive look half loath and half consenting thus she spoke once has avaro escaped the raging main why would you tempt the fickle seas again to seek new dangers when in safety here would but provoke the deities you fear  sometimes i own we have been surpised by foes whose nightly walks have waked you from repose yet still i guard your sacred life secure and always will  what can amanda more thus said she clasped him in her loving arms embraced his neck and doated on his charms and now both show their passions in their look and now connubial hymen both invoke in sportive joys they closed the genial day while philomela sung the nuptial lay till soon the youth reclined upon her breast and golden slumbers sealed their eyes to rest canto iii soon as the sun began to gild the day and on the hills emit a trembling ray amanda from her flowery bed awoke sad was her heart and discomposed her look the briny torrent flows adown her cheeks while thus she to her dear avaro speaks o thou on whom my life and love depend if ever amanda claimed the name of friend if ever i gave thy troubled mind repose or hid thee when pursued with furious foes explain this dream that terrifies my breast the strangest fear or fancy ever impressed methought a god descended from the skies celestial beauty sparkled in his eyes like rays of phoebus shone his radiant hair his shape like thine like thine his graceful air a robe was neatly girt about his waist fine as my loved avaros silken vest his shining lips upon my breast he laid and softly pressed my hand and smiling said  arise my dear my loved amanda rise  an easier lodging waits thee in the skies  i am descended from the blessed abodes  to bear thee hence to heaven among the gods  no enemies shall there disturb thy rest  there with thy lover live for ever blessed thus said he raised me from the dewy plain and bore or seemed to bear me over the main but soon he led me to a distant isle where horrors reign and comforts never smile thick brakes and brambles choked the dreary coast the only product which the land could boast till a dejected servile race arose with gloomy sadness brooding on their brows this crowd promiscuous with incessant toil or rooted up the wood or ploughd the soil how each performed his task a tyrant viewed and sternly shook his whip and menaced as he stood sometimes to shun the direful lash they fled the insulting lord pursued with greater speed sure not so fearful fly the trembling bears to shun our hunters darts and missive spears sure not so swift our hunters ever pursued the trembling bears when flying through the wood as from the tyrants wrath they swiftly run or as the tyrant swifter urged em on each to his wonted task he drove again and made me mix among the servile train doomed with the rest to groan beneath the yoke alike i felt the dire correcting stroke but o what added most to my despair my godlike guide was false and left me there  as thus she spoke confused her looks appeared for still her soul the dreadful vision feared deciding reason from her seat withdrew and fancy painted all the scene anew the youth to cheer the drooping dame essayed when straight a boar came rushing through the shade the crashing woods proclaimed his rapid force while two fleet youths pursued the sylvan course the lovers started from their flowery seats surpised and each a different way retreats as when some musquets thunder has expelled two loving turtles from the verdant field both diverse through the wide ethereal plain fly swift and flying fear their mate is slain so parting devious fled the affrighted pair such was avaros such amandas fear the foaming boar between em swiftly past the nimble coursers urge the chase as fast till soon they pierce him with a mortal wound he falls and purple gore distains the ground then from the savage war they take their way and to their cave triumphant bear the prey soon as the sportive hunters left the wood the loving pair concealed no longer stood but trembling both forsook the dusky shade both trembling met upon the opening glade mute with surprise awhile they stood the man broke silence first and thus his tale began o dear amanda soon we have surveyed this mystic vision of the night displayed these are the frowning tyrants in thy dream that chased the slaves and we their flying game some part said she resembled this i own and some remains a riddle yet unknown what meant that god which still methinks i view that radiant deity so much like you and what the fields above which he proposed say if the mystery can be disclosed to whom the youth our active fancy seems for ever roving roving most in dreams for then the soul disburdend of her load soars high and grows prophetic like a god minds things when past as present to our view and by allusion knows the future too thus when to sleep your musing head reclined she kept our evening converse in her mind reflected on the joys my country yields joys sweet as those in yonder azure fields till soaring higher striving to discern her hidden fate and future fortune learn heaven showed her something like this morning chase by trembling slaves who fled their tyrants face perhaps to warn us timely from our bed for o my dear amanda had we stayed i had not lived to tell this mystic tale nor you to hear the secrets i reveal  but let us to my happy country steer nor longer wait impending ruin here so spoke the youth and with a gracious look he seemed to sanctify the words he spoke go she replied go where you are inclined your faithful lover will not stay behind if over the seas you shall attempt your way the seas shall not compel me here to stay nor will i fear the surges of the deep for surges often you say assail the ship calm and composed intrepid will i stand till you conduct me to your native land or if you would some other clime pursue then shall some other climate please me too and when the happy destined land we meet where providence shall fix our wandering feet with joyful servitude i will still attend on you my nuptial lord and dearest friend soon as aurora spreads her purple ray when you awake to chase the nimble prey i will also rise and with an equal art display the net or speed the pointed dart or search the plains and tasteful herbs provide or strip the vines and press their juicy pride each evening will i fondly deck your bed with sweetest flowerets gathered from the mead and when dissolved in downy sleep you lie i will wake and watch if foes approach too nigh to guard your life all hazards will i run and for your safety sacrifice my own to whom the youth no hazards shall you run nor for my safety sacrifice your own nor yet at evening fondly deck my bed with sweetest flowerets gathered from the mead nor shall amanda tasteful herbs explore nor shall avaro chase the savage boar a softer bed than flowers shall give you rest a choicer meat than fruits indulge your taste ten thousand things my grateful soul shall find to charm your fancy and delight your mind i will vary love a hundred different ways and institute new arts to make it please so shall our future race of children see a constant proverb made of you and me when british youths shall court the doubting dame and want expressions equal to their flame then strongly to attest it shall be said  true as avaro to the indian maid to whom amanda pausing at the name what meant avaro by the doubting dame has any of your british damsels made a doubt of what such godlike beings said or is it customary to your clime has ever youth committed such a crime as base ingratitude has any there deluded first and then forsook the fair i cannot think your love will ever decline nor can my radiant angel question mine by yon bright beams which paint the rising day by thy bright charms as beautiful as they by all our pleasing hours of love i vow to share your fate through every scene of woe content with you to yield my vital breath for life without you would but lengthen death with such sweet talk their moments they beguile both seem impatient for the destined isle he daily vows and daily is believed she daily hears and daily is deceived canto iv farewell bright goddess of the idalian grove farewell ye sportive deities of love no longer i your pleasing joys rehearse a rougher theme demands my pensive verse a scene of woes remains to be displayed indulgent love with slavery repaid ingratitude and broken vows and lies the mighty ills that spring from avarice provoke my lays your aid ye muses bring assist my tragic numbers while i sing say what ensued when on the briny deep the watchful dame beheld a floating ship she called and beckoned to it from the shore then to the youth the grateful tidings bore and said i something see like winged trees strange to behold fly swiftly over the seas their bulky roots upon the billows float say is not this the ship you long have sought or i mistake or by the gods command this comes to bear us to your native land then hasten see the partner of your heart with you her guide is ready to depart my father mother friends i bid adieu friends father mother not so dear as you to whom the youth with smiling brow replied o thou true pattern of a faithful bride who dare thy father mother friends resign and risque thy own dear life to rescue mine  if i forget the debt i owe to thee may all the gods forget their care of me in more wild deserts let me rove again nor find a friend like thee to ease my pain there let the vulturs wolves and tigers tear this body thou have kindly nourished here so saying to the beach he straight descends and by the flag discerns the crew his friends and now his heart exults within his breast his loving mate an equal joy confessed she with him gladly ventures on the main unthinking of her future toil and pain so to the plough the heifer yet unbroke walks cheerful on nor dreads the impending yoke till in the fields urged with the piercing goad she groans and writhes reluctant with her load the british bark was to barbados bound the expected shore the sailers quickly found where safe from danger now the perjured youth false to his former vows of sacred truth reflecting counts the interest he had lost while fate detained him on the indian coast the frugal thoughts suppress his amorous flame and prompt him to betray the faithful dame yet scarce he can the cursed fact pursue but hesitates at what he fain would do for though his avarice moves him to the ill his gratitude within him struggles still and twixt two passions neither guides his will as when two scales which equal loads suspend sway to and fro alternate both descend till undeclining each aloft abides nor this nor that the doubtful weight decides so stood the doubtful youth awhile nor would forsake the evil nor pursue the good till as the sailers in the haven stay to purchase slaves the planters crowd the key one asks for what the negro may be sold then bids a price and shows the tempting gold which when avaro views with greedy eyes he soon resolves to gain thalluring prize nor oaths nor gratitude can longer bind her fate he thus determines in his mind  suppose i should conduct this indian over  and thus instead of gold import a moor   would not my sire with stern contracted brows  condemn my choice and curse my nuptial vows  was it for this i learned the merchants art  only to gain a doting negros heart  was it for this the raging seas i crossed  no gold induced me to the indian coast  and gold is offered for this simple dame  shall i refuse it or renounce my flame   let amorous fools their tiresome joys renew  and dote on love while interest i pursue he added not for now intent on gold and dead to all remorse the dame he sold amanda stood confounded with surprise and silently reproached him with her eyes she often tried to speak but when she tried her heart swelled full her voice its aid denied and when she made her faultring tongue obey these words commixd with sighs found out their way  who can the mystic ways of fate explain  am i awake or do i dream again  is this the sad reward of all my care  was it for this i cheered thee in despair  the gods above if any gods there be  witness what i have done to succor thee  yet if my kindness cannot thy pity move  pity the fruits of our unhappy love  o let the infant in my pregnant womb  excite thee to revoke my threatened doom  think how the future slave in climes remote  shall curse the treacherous sire that him begot so spoke the mourning dame but spoke in vain thobdurate youth insults her with disdain not all her kindness could his pity move nor yet the fruits of their unhappy love but as the flames which soften wax display the same warm force to harden sordid clay that motive which would melt another heart more hardened his and made him act a double villains part he for the child demands a larger sum and sells it while an embryo in the womb and now he sternly takes her by the hand then drags her on reluctant to the land while as she walks her dismal fate she moans the rocks around her echo to her groans  o base ungrateful youth she loudly cries  o base ungrateful youth the shore replies  and can thou cruel perjured villain leave  thy tender infant too an abject slave  to toil and groan and bleed beneath the rod  fool that i was to think thou were a god  sure from some savage tiger art thou sprung   no tigers feed and fawn upon their young  but thou despisest all paternal cares  the fate of infants and their mothers prayers in vain she does her wretched state deplore pleased with the gold he gladly quits the shore the ruffling winds dilate the sails the ship divides the waves and skims along the deep three days the bellying canvas gently swells clear shines the sun and friendly blow the gales then frowning clouds invest the vaulted sky and hollow winds proclaim a tempest nigh fierce boreas loudly over the ocean roars smoke the white waves and sound the adverse shores while to increase the horrors of the main descends a deluge of impetuous rain the giddy ship on circling eddies rides tossed and retossd the sport of winds and tides redoubled peals of roaring thunder roll and flames conflicting flash from pole to pole while guilty thoughts distract avaros soul of life despairing though afraid to die one fatal effort yet he means to try while all the busy crew with panting breath were laboring to repel the liquid death avaro from the stern the boat divides and yields up to the fury of the tides tossed on the boisterous wave the vessel flies now sinking low now mounting to the skies till soon the storm decreased and by degrees hushed were the winds and calm the ruffled seas the sailers safely steer their course again and leave avaro floating on the main who landed quickly on a lonely isle where human feet never print the baleful soil a dreary wilderness was all appeared and howling wolves the only sound he heard a thousand deaths he views before his eyes a thousand guiltcreated fiends arise a conscious hell within his bosom burns and racks his tortured soul while thus he mourns  cursed be the precepts of my selfish sire  who bad me after fatal gold aspire  cursed be myself and doubly cursed who sold  a faithful friend to gain that fatal gold   o could these gloomy woods my sin conceal  or in my bosom quench this fiery hell  here would i pine my wretched life away  or to the hungry savage fall a prey   but can the gloomy woods conceal my sin  or cooling shadows quench the hell within  no like some spirit banished heaven i find  terrors in every place to rack my mind  tormenting conscious plagues increase my care  and guilty thoughts indulge my just despair   o where shall i that piercing eye evade  that scans the depths of hells tremendous shade so saying straight he gave a hideous glare with rolling eyes that witnessed strong despair then drew his pointed weapon from the sheath confusedly wild and all his thoughts on death to pierce his trembling heart he thrice essayed and thrice his coward arm denied its aid meanwhile a howling wolf with hunger pressed leaped on the wretch and seized him by the breast tore out his heart and licked the purple flood for earth refused to drink the villains blood to a young lady who had a cupid given her fair lady take a special care this pleasing toy become no snare the subtle god is full of wiles and mischiefs most when most he smiles beware to clasp him in your arms nor gaze too much upon his charms lest in a borrowed shape he wound as once unhappy dido found for while she viewed his smiling look her heart received a fatal stroke on the hon mrs horners traveling for the recovery of her health clarissa long has sought in vain physicians aid to ease her pain but now their aid she seeks no more nor longer will their drugs endure spite of their art her spirits fail her cheeks are turned a languid pale yet though her mortal parts decayed her nobler virtue does not fade her soul inflexible to ill in piety advances still so metals lie in chymic fires and while the grosser part expires the flames refine the golden ore and make it brighter than before she now a warmer clime explores to prove the air of foreign shores o may the temperate breezes bring salubrious medicines on their wing thou phoebus too propitious shine and since the power of physics thine send blooming health on every beam dispel her

neck her ruby lip and rosy cheek her graceful smiles and sparkling eyes her panting bosom fall and rise and now he clasped her in his arms it was all imaginary charms when rising to the height of bliss his lips essayed to take a kiss an orangewench trod on his foot and screaming  will you have some fruit surpised he dropped the pleasing theme and found his joys a waking dream he swore and wept

public good but meant her own often to the olympian field she turned her eyes and taught the racers how to gain the prize in schools and temples too she claimed a share while falshoods self admired

tears the laurel from her hair while nature seems to sympathize her care the glowing flowers that crown thenameld meads weep fragrant dews and hang their drooping heads the sylvan choirs as conscious

whenever the gods a noble race intend they suit the causes to the destined end nor yoke unequal hearts in nuptial love joves valiant bird disdains the fearful dove great minds by native sympathy combine as golden particles the closest join paternal virtues in their bosom roll allied in love by nobleness of soul hence thrones and sceptres shine neglected things hence royal anne prefers nassau to kings while britons with united hearts rejoice and willing senators applaud the choice to see their king to honor ever true discharge the debt to sacred william due immortal william by whose prudent cares we yet enjoy the fruits of all our wars our laws religion liberty and peace and even the blessings of the brunswic race nor thou illustrious orange blush to own thy honor thus allied to albions crown blessed with a princess in whose form we trace her fathers majesty and mothers grace bright orbs of power that with propitious ray dispel our clouds and beautify our day not as the comet raging through the air infects the world with pestilence and war but like the sun their beams of goodness glow inspiring life and chearing all below such are the glorious sire and gracious dame from whence the beauteous bride of orange came and shall unerring nature change her kind what lion ever produced a timorous hind the royal eagles royal eagles breed and heroes from heroic sires proceed romes founder thus confessed his race divine thus nassau copies the nassovian line thus annas noble stream of virtue flows high as the regal spring from whence it rose thrice happy nymph with every grace supplied thrice happy prince with such a heavenly bride in whom superior sense with judgment joins her beauty much but more her merit shines how glorious when such worth adorns the great we hear we see admire and imitate virtue in them attracts remotest eyes but in the vulgar soul unheeded lies as radiant phoebus darts superior light while smaller planets shun the watchful sight accomplished thus let her example fire the drooping muse and wake the sounding lyre to aid religion be her chiefest care heaven justly claims the soul it made so fair to stem the torrent of licentious rage and prop the virtues of a sinking age exalting science to her ancient height to raise declining arts and make the rude polite while great nassau whom native glory warms whenever his country calls him forth to arms may fire the belgians in the field of mars consult their peace or animate their wars paint his forefathers to their wondering eye and teach em how to conquer or to die like him who bravely dared to break their chain though held by all the force and fraud of spain for injured liberty the sword he draws resolved to gain or perish in the cause and having long the doubtful combat tried like caesar vanquished and like caesar king williams greatgrandfather the first great assertor of the belgian liberties assassinated at delph died though different far the motives of their mind that fought to conquer this to save mankind till praised lamented envied and admired the hero patriot and the prince expired o where did then the guardian angels hide nor watched to turn the guilty ball aside when he whom armed hosts could not withstand now falls a victim to one villains hand but rise ye muses quit the pensive lay nor damp the joys of this auspicious day since yet the glorious name of orange stands since royal anna seals the nuptial bands soon may imperial adolphs rise again again new fredrics thunder on the main rouzing the martial youth to wars alarms if proud iberians shine again in arms to guard their country from tyrannic power and be what glorious william was before nor shall the states invading forces fear ere pregnant time the promised heroes bear nor want allies their freedom to defend since brunswic reigns and albion is their friend as branching oaks protect the rural swain secure from summer heat and winter rain so shall our monarch with paternal aid his regal shelter over batavia spread long as the scepter fills his royal hand a true palladium shall insure the land and if the prescient muses guide my lay or future secrets phoebus can display the day shall shine distinguished from the rest that anna dignified and hymen blessed in which augustus fortifies his throne and plans a scheme of union for his son bespeaks allies for princes yet to come new friends to britain and new foes to rome proceed great monarch new allies to gain and with new nuptial leagues our peace maintain so shall thy beauteous nymphs secure with charms that safety other kings defend with arms they venus like could mars himself surprise and awe stern tyrants with their conquering eyes verses to the author in imitation of horaces ode on pindar by a divine applied to the marriage of his highness the prince of orange with anne princess royal of great britain who hopes to rival miltons flame with waxen pinions fondly flies his fall will give the sea a name while he attempts to reach the skies milton is like a flood whose tide swelled with tempestuous deluge roars which from some lofty mountains side resistless foams and knows no shores with sacred laurels justly crowned whether in bold unfettered strains his towering muse the common bound superior to all rhyme disdains whether the realms of endless day he fill with wars and rude alarms or set in terrible array seraphic legions clad in arms aloft with all their forests thrown see hills from their foundations razed see angels hurled with vengeance down when the messiahs standard blazed or leads he to connubial bowers the newformd pair the teeming ground smiles with a wilderness of flowers diffusing gales of fragrance round lo adam with majestic mien for empire and command designed consummate beauty crowns his queen with dignity and sweetness joined while he the charming scene displays where innocence and pleasure reigned delighted with his sacred lays we hear it lost and feel it gained

distance only can admire him lessening to the sight as the poor be with endless toil to suck the thyme and blooming rose skims over richmonds fragrant soil thus i with pleasing pain compose you with a happy genius blessed in bolder strains shall nassau sing when anna by the graces dressed he to the nuptial dome shall bring anna enriched with various charms by the indulgent care of heaven than whom into his longing arms no greater treasure can be given not though with riches of the east at his command the ganges flow though with full empire he possessed whatever ambition wished below ye nereids with propitious gales the gilded vessel kindly aid let cupids fan the swelling sails and waft him to the royal maid this was written before the prince came to england when thames with floating forests

shores for blessings which they lent convey around while hymeneals ring my voice to highest pitch i will raise thrice happy if i can but sing an humble ode to nassaus praise you soaring in heroic verse by native strength of wing upborn his godlike virtues shall rehearse and beauties which the bride adorn he in your lays shall finished rise for council or thembattled field immortals the contested prize to her superior charms shall yield then ravished with prophetic views succeeding glories shall presage and from the genial bed the muse raise princes to improve the age who bravely prodigal of blood shall prove that to set free mankind and conquer for the public good the race of nassau was designed thus great alcides poets feign by labors gained the seats above countries preserved and monsters slain assert the genuine son of jove the answer when i in feeble verse essayed nassau and annas praise a lyric muse flew over my head and dropped a branch of bays i would have fixed it on my brow but phoebus said forbear it is vanity to touch the bough and sacrilege to wear give it the bard who boldly dares attempt the roman lyre who wisely checks but not impairs the towering pindars fire thus sir to you in phoebus name the laurel wreath i send and since the god denies me fame am glad it crowns my friend on delia singing and playing on music i when delia tunes her vocal song and strikes the trembling strings the listening audience round her throng admiring while she sings ii but when we view the skilful fair we are struck with more surprise before she only pleased our ear but now inchants our eyes iii beauty and harmony combined like secret charms betray like ghosts in magic rings confined we cannot stir away iv so birds imprudent fall to ground when pleasing notes they hear charmed with the pipers artful sound till taken in his snare to the right honorable william clayton esquire now lord sundon on his being elected representative in parliament for westminster without opposition to you great steward of the public trust true to your king and to your country just no venal bard his joyful tribute brings nor envy sure can censure what he sings since each impartial tongue your praise declares the muse but echoes what the poet hears some by their birth to senates lay their claim whose folly shames the seat which honors them but you whose merits moved the peoples voice unanimous to make so wise a choice with solid sense and prudent conduct show you grace the senate not the senate you where in the list of patriots could we find a sounder judgment a sincerer mind or where a juster hand to poise the scale of kings prerogative and public weal nor this you strive to sink nor that extend bigot to neither side to both a friend so flow the spirits through our vital frame nor yet this member chill nor that inflame true to your principles you never stray from public good though interest lead the way for public good you still employ your tongue and rather than commit you suffer wrong when south sea    0 waves oerflowd the british plain and members bartered honesty for gain no gain no place nor profit could control the stubborn virtue of your steady soul you firm to honor truth and conscience stood unfashionably just and obstinately good but why should i in feeble numbers tell those virtues which your actions paint so well for all the actions of your life proclaim a subjects loyal love a patriots fame your care to keep the peoples interest sure your zeal to guard the princes crown secure make prince and people both espouse your cause witness their latest choice and loud applause when crowded streets with acclamations rung and claytons praises dwelt on every tongue parties themselves agreed your worth to boast or differed only who should praise it most while timorous candidates the test declined and to your nobler brow the palm resigned so fly the stars before the rising sun and from his brighter beams withdraw their own to mr winder now fellow of corpuschristi oxford in answer to a latin epistle which he sent me i soon as your partial lays i saw i guessed your crafty views and thought you writ in verse to draw a bill upon my muse ii but since the treasure you convey comes from the roman mine forgive me if i cannot repay the value of your coin iii while on thy manly lines i dwell lines that might pope employ what strange vicissitudes i feel of sorrow love and joy iv now pleasure charms my glowing soul to hear thy pompous song in soft majestic numbers roll like flaccus sweet and strong v but quickly sympathizing pain succeeds my short delight to find thy moving mournful strain describe thy mr winder was much afflicted with sore eyes when he sent the epistle loss of sight vi i grieve to think machaons art can give thee no relief i weep and wish my grateful heart could cure or share thy grief vii no more to me encomiums send in such a learned strain but if you would compliment your friend present him half your pain viii to phoebus make thy music soar to him direct thy lays invoke his aid and healing power to purge the visual rays ix for if your lyre but strike his ear the lyre you lately strung the god of verse and light must hear a suit so sweetly sung a description of a journey to marlborough bath portsmouth etc to the right honorable the lord viscount palmerston while some my lord the roman coast explore survey the fanes and trace their beauties over studious of arts by which ingenious boil now draws the plan or now erects the pile more bounded in my fancy and my purse i over domestic plains pursue my course and every pleasing object in the way the muse shall sing if you accept her lay when cancer fiercely glowed with phoebus heat and clouds of dust flew even in brentfordstreet over hounslowheath my early course i steer for robbers famed but i no robbers fear let gold like guilt increase the misers grief a poets purse like virtue dares a thief colebrook i quickly pass and soon my eyes survey the royal towers of windsor rise charmed with the theme of popes harmonious song i check my steed and slowly move along as lingering mariners contract their sails to feast on odours of arabian gales but lest my lord your patience should accuse the dull narration of a tedious muse i will not sing each trifle that occurred how much i eat and drank and whipped and spurred how often my palfry stumbled in the way till a little village near farringdon in berks hatford ends the travel of the day where kind a farmer once the authors master and still his friend menalcas partner of my soul revives me with his friendly flowing bowl yet forces no intemprate bumpers round except when delias health the glasses crowned a thousand labors past we now run over what scenes we acted and what toils we bore no party feuds nor politics we name the joys of friendship mostly were our theme warned by the clock we now retire to rest till rising phoebus streaked the purple east breakfast soon over we trace the verdant field where sharpened scythes the laboring mowers wield straight emulation glows in every vein i long to try the curvous blade again as when at hockleyhole old gamesters view young combatants their martial sports renew a youthful vigor fires their ancient soul nor former wounds their courage can control again they mount the stage again they play again they bear the noble prize away so with ambition burns my daring breast i snatch the scythe and with the swains contest behind em close i rush the sweeping steel the vanquished mowers soon confess my skill not long at this laborious sport i stay but with my friend to where the author lived a thresher charlton take my way twas there my lord induced by potent ale swains leave their ploughs and threshers quit their flail your money which his lordship sent to treat the threshers bounty soon provokes the bells to ring clowns dance boys hollow and hoarse cobblers sing not greater was the joy in ancient greece when aesons son produced the golden fleece than now appeared in every threshers breast soon as your gold sung prologue to the feast why should the muse recite our bill of fare and with a long description tire your ear none can your generous treat with want reproach all eat enough and many drank too much full twenty threshers quaff around the board all name their toast and every one my lord no cares no toils no troubles now appear for troubles toils and cares are drowned in beer till soon the cholric fumes of liquor rise flush in their face and sparkle in their eyes they now the rustic feats of manhood boast who best could reap or mow or thresh the most contention doubtful all with anger burn while each appears a hero in his turn hard words succeed so far can beer prevail that blows are menaced even without the flail till thus our landlord rising from his chair like prudent nestor stops impending war  what madness friends what madness can engage  your minds to burn with this unseemly rage  for shame stain not with blood our grateful cheer  desist from blood  or else desist from beer  are these the only thanks you give my lord  and is it thus his favors you reward  if no respect you pay this cheerful feast  yet pay the noble founder some at least   he said abashed the conscious heroes stood shook hands and thirsted more for beer  than blood another glass to temples health they pour and praise their liquor much his bounty more often as this  0th of june on which his lordship treats the threshers every year day returns shall threshers claim some hours of rest sacred to temples name often as this day returns shall temple cheer the threshers hearts with mutton beef and beer hence when their childrens children shall admire this holiday and whence derived inquire some grateful father partial to my fame shall thus describe from whence and how it came  here child a thresher lived in ancient days  quaint songs he sung and pleasing roundelays  a gracious queen his sonnets did commend  and some great lord one temple was his friend  that lord was pleased this holiday to make  and feast the threshers for that threshers sake thus shall tradition keep my fame alive the bard may die the thresher still survive next over pewseys fertile fields i haste fields with the bearded crops of ceres graced while pleasing hopes my grateful bosom cheer but soon they vanished  rev mr stanley rector of pewsey who first encouraged the author stanley was not here from hence the muse to silver kennet flies on whose green margin

adorned its awful height till want of water forced the thirsty crowd to seek the vale where crystal rivers flowed there bishop poor who built the cathedral poor the first auspicious work began first for a temple drew the glorious plan then quickly makes the sacred columns rise and bids the lofty spire invade the skies the prudent people too with equal haste new dwellings built which far their old

with propitious gales we quickly view britannias strength her guard and glory too where spithead georges dreadful eagles waiting stood to bear his fatal thunder over the flood the wondrous scene delights my gazing eyes at once imparting pleasure and surprise intrepid sailers swarming in the sky intent on business different labors try some stride the yard or towering mast ascend some on the ropes in airy crowds depend thick as the insects round the poplar play when phoebus gilds em with a western ray but unexpected dangers often deceive the daring man who tempts the foamy wave while on the fleet we all delighted gaze the sudden winds arise and sweep the seas with rapid force they fly and from the ship disjoin the boat and drive it over the deep our cautious pilot quickly shifts the sails reverts his course against the furious gales o chloe then what ruthless pains distressed thy dizzy head and racked thy tender breast how often did the bard thy fate bemoan how often did he wish

herself sublime in air she ranges every plume with prudent care tries if her pinions can her flight sustain then springs away and soars above the main but see the smoking fiery forge appears vulcanian sounds surprise our listening ears see busy smiths around their anvils sweat their brawny arms the glowing anchor beat alternately the chiming hammers fall and loud notes echo through the sooty hall such happily on the sounding anvil rung when first the harp melodious tubal strung as tubalcain the ductile metal wrought and vulcans heavenly art to mortals taught the brother pleased to hear his hammers chime soon harmonizd their notes to proper time mans bosom then sonorous organs warmed the softer lyre his gloomy sorrows charmed while tyrants hearts unusual pity found and savage tempers

invites us to the fleet a table elegantly spread we found and loyal healths the captain pushes round augustus first and all the royal line give sweeter flavor to the sparkling wine wager and norris

public prelates fame who graced the river with a stately frame known by the flowery meads which round it lie and beauteous walks that charm the students eye where courtly addison attund his lays and raised his own by singing drydens praise hail happy bard whose genius still could shine in every art for every art was thine whether thou did the critics pen engage the critics pen improved the poets rage whether thou did the heros deeds rehearse the heros deeds shone brighter in thy verse or did thy tragic muse sublimely tell how stubborn cato for his country fell parties no more retained their factious hate all pitied caesars honored catos fate nor less thy soft diurnal essays please that glass where every fool his folly sees where virtue shines with such attractive grace she tempts the vicious to her chaste embrace o may thy labors be a star to guide my thoughts and actions over lifes devious tide if pride or passion check my doubtful sail let thy instructions lend a friendly gale to waft me to the peaceful happy shore where thou immortal bard art gone before then those who grant me not a poets name shall own i left behind a better fame penelope to ulysses paraphrased from ovid these lines i send impatient of your stay to you my lord who kill me with delay yet crave not any answer back beside yourself the best of answers to your bride sure troy so hateful to the grecian dames is ruined now with dire consuming flames though scarcely troy nor all her king could boast was worth the trouble which her ruin cost o had lewd paris sunk beneath the tide when over the seas he sought the spartan bride i had not then accused the lingering day nor weaved to charm the tedious night away nor in the bed deserted and forlorn lain weeping cold and comfortless till morn whenever of dangers in your camp i heard those dangers threatened you i always feared for love like mine no cold indiffrence bears it feeds on timorous thoughts and anxious cares i fansyd furious trojans round thee came and trembling ever dreaded hectors name if any said antilochus was slain antilochus was he who caused my pain or if in borrowed arms patroclus bled i wept because his craft no better sped when rhodian blood had bathed the lycian spear the rhodian tlepolemus youth again renewed my care in fine whatever grecian chief was killed my fearful heart like srigid ice was chilled lest flattering fame my doubtful ears should cheat and for my lords proclaim anothers fate but heaven propitious to my chaste desire preserved you safe and troy consumed with fire but now the other grecian chiefs return and on their smoking altars offerings burn their useless arms they consecrate to peace and trojan spoils the grecian temples grace each youthful bride some pleasing gift affords to welcome home their safereturning lords their safereturning lords in songs of joy resound the vanquished fates of ruined troy the wondering sages crowd around to hear the trembling girls admire the tales of war the wives stand listening while their husbands tell how greece had conquered and how ilion fell one stains a table with the purple draught and shows the furious battles which you fought paints with the wine which from the glass he pours camps rivers hills and all the trojan towers and this says he is the sigean plain and here the silver simois rolls his train there stood old priams stately palace here achilles pitched his tent ulysses there here mangled hector dreadful in his fall affrights the steeds that drag him round the wall your son who sent by me to nestors court to seek his father brought me this report from nestors mouth and how the thracian lord in sleep became a victim to your sword how dolon fell into your crafty snare  but o ulysses you too boldly dare too fearless through the camp of foes you rove mindful of wiles forgetful of your love slaying so many in the gloomy night one friend alone to aid you in the fight it was not thus you rashly used to go among the midnight terrors of the foe fondly of me you formerly have thought with prudence acted and with caution fought heaven knows with fear my trembling bosom beat to hear my son your daring deeds relate till told how you victoriously returned safe to your camp with thracian spoils adorned but what avails it me your arms have thrown troys stately walls and lofty turrets down as when they stood if i am robbed of thee troys fallen to others standing still to me to others who with captive oxen toil to turn the glebe and till the trojan soil and while with crooked ploughs they discompose thillburyd ashes of their slaughtered foes while phrygian fields grown fat with native blood bear fruitful crops where stately ilion stood while verdant harvests hide their ruined wall i mourn my absent lord who wrought its fall nor can i know the land where you reside nor who nor what detains you from your bride whatever sailers on our coast appear hopeful to find some tidings of my dear i fly to them and ask em over and over if ever they saw you on some foreign shore then to their hands a letter i impart to give it you the partner of my heart if chance or destiny should ever prove so kind to lead them to my absent love we sought for you at ancient nestors court but sought in vain we heard no true report we sent to ask the spartans too but they knew not the climate where you lingering stay o had apollo saved his sacred town  ye gods why did i ever wish it down if that were standing and ulysses there i nothing but the chance of war should fear i should not then be singly cursed to cry others would fear the war no less than i but now a thousand whimsies feed my care nor know i what to hope or what to fear yet fearing all that fancy can suggest unnumberd troubles rack my anxious breast upon the land whatever dangers reign i fear those dangers make you there remain upon the seas whatever storms increase i fear those storms detain you on the seas while thus my foolish thoughts uncertain rove perhaps you revel with a foreign love perhaps you ridicule your bride at home tell how she spins or drudges in the loom suspicious thoughts that vex my jealous mind begone and vanish into empty wind if cruel fate did not obstruct the way my lord would never make so long delay your long delay my father often blames and often chides me for my constant flames my constant flames shall ever true

blown on the rolling surface of the deep the mourning maid at length reclines to sleep while conscious visions labor in her breast and airy specter discompose her rest sometimes she seems upon her native shore blessed with the beauteous youth as heretofore hears him converse while from his tuneful tongue melodious sense in melting music rung sometimes she finds or seems at least to find his shattered vessel forced before the wind with foaming waves and furious tempests tossed the mast and broken sails and sailers lost sometimes her dream in frightful forms displayed a crowd of martyrs cruel love had made lamenting thisbes shade before her stands shows her capacious wound and purple hands now lyric sappho in the tide expires now faithful porcia eats the living fires at length awaking from her dream she hears a latian voice which thus salutes her ears unhappy christian maid for such at least you by your decent habit seem expressed say whence you came and hither how conveyed exposed to sea without the seamans aid soon as the nymph her native language hears her frighted soul was filled with doubts and fears she thought the adverse wind or refluent main had forced her back to liparis again till starting up a spacious land she spies barbarian caves and cots her sight surprise she sees a matron on the neighboring strand nor knows the matron nor the neighboring land o whither whither am i blown she cries what dens and caves appear before my eyes and who inhabit em or beasts of prey or men less kind and crueller than they to whom the matron fly nor dare to trust the faithless people of this hated coast here sailers often their hapless fate deplore who escape the seas are wrecked upon the shore for when the forceful wind and foaming deep to this inhuman coast impel the ship around the beach the rude barbarians stray destroy the mariners and seize their prey by others death they keep themselves alive subsist by rapine and by ruin thrive unhappy fate the mourning nymph replied o had i perished in the safer tide for much i fear the land i now survey dooms me to greater evils than the sea and yet what greater ills can fate provide than thus to seek for death and be denied not so my felix escaped the raging waves him neptune sunk and me unkindly saves saves only to increase my former woes to fall perhaps by more ungenrous foes or to indulge some lustful tyrants will but o ye heavens avert the fatal ill protect my honor in this foreign coast the only blessing which i have not lost the listening matron wonders with surprise nor hears unmoved the weeping damsels cries but leads her to her neighboring cottage where she chears her fainting soul with homely fare condoles her grief and begs her to disclose her country cares and cause of all her woes excited by her words the pensive maid preludes with sighs and thus reluctant said o hospitable dame why would you move a wretch to tell a tale of hapless love which in relating must renew my grief nor can i hope nor you bestow relief yet since you seem a partner of my care it is just a partner know the weight i bear not far from aetnas flaming mount i came from liparis and constance is my name great honors and estates my sire possessed and o too much to make his daughter blessed i once with fame and fortune was supplied nor envied empresses their pomp and pride now like a meteor fallen from its height my glorys vanished and extinct my light  full twenty years in happiness i passed and every year was happier than the last young felix then his love began to show young felix was the cause of all my woe a beauteous youth endowed with manly grace but far his noble soul excelled his face and though his niggard fate had wealth denied the want of wealth by virtue was supplied two years to win my doubtful heart he strove two years my doubtful heart declined his love yet still he pressed me with his amorous tale nor found at length twas fruitless to assail for by degrees insensibly i came to first approve and then indulge his flame nor could his suit nor would his vows reprove i heard with joy nor thought it sin to love till in my breast imperious cupid reigned alas how easy love a conquest gained and now my reason checked my will no more but fed the flame it strove to quench before yet durst not an immodest thought approve love ruled my heart but honor ruled my love i scorned to stain my virtue with a king as much my lover scorned so mean a thing what could we do what cannot love inspire the youth reveals his passion to my sire and in such melting accents made it known as might have moved all fathers but my own but proudly he my lovers suit repelled and frowning thus our mutual ruin sealed no more presumptuous youth thy passion name suppress the sparks before they rise to flame how dare thou vulgar wretch ignobly born my daughters scandal and her fathers scorn aspire to wed so far above thy fate he sternly said and forced him from his gate o avarice what evils do thou cause breaking the bands of love and natures laws go hungry god and rule the narrowsould collect and guard their cursed bewitching gold fit province for thy reign too mean to prove the charms of nuptial life and joys of love ah what avails to gain a pompous name with boasted titles of paternal fame derived from ancestors of noble blood things common to the vicious and the proud refulgent equipage and gaudy shows fictitious ornaments of real woes if love be absent pomp and worldly gain but gild our cares and varnish over our pain o had my cruel father thought like me i never had proved the dangers of the sea nor ever wandered here a banished maid and o dear felix thou had not been dead  so speaks the trembling nymph and while she speaks the pearly torrents stream adown her cheeks cold clammy sweats and throbbing sighs arise slow moves the blood and dizzy roll her eyes so much affected with her lovers fate she struggled groaned and fainted from her seat her hostess straight a grateful cordial sought and to her lips applies the cheerful draught washing her temples with reviving oil the vital spirits answer to her toil the purple tide begins to roll again again diffuses life through every vein and now she sighing raised her drooping head and is my death she cries again delayed why did you check me on the brink of fate better the soul had fled her loathsome seat death is the only good i wish to know end of my pain and period of my woe to whom replies the dame unhappy fair rely on heaven nor let your soul despair teach me to give your troubled heart relief or teach me how at least to share your grief your mournful story much affects my mind yet something seems remaining still behind o much constantia says remains to come the fatal part that finishes my doom for when my felix felix now no more was banished from my haughty fathers door not able to obtain me for his bride nor willing to resign me though denied hope from despair his daring soul conceives a bark he builds to plough the briny waves then called a few domestics to his aid embraced me in his arms and sighing said o thou for ever dear for ever blessed at once the joy and trouble of my breast since poverty expels me from thy arms since wealth alone is worthy of thy charms i swear by all the mighty powers above sad fate that drives me from the nymph i love to try my fortune on remoter shores and seek the gold thy sire so much adores perhaps the planets unpropitious here in other climes may kinder aspects wear may lead me where the rocky dimonds lie or where the golden mines may wealth supply if not the last sad pleasure is to die such was the fatal vow he rashly made o fatal vow and fatally obeyed struck dumb my tears the want of words supplied his mixed with mine increased the pearly tide yet lest i should his resolution shake he rushed away and mounted on the deck his hasty crew expand the swelling sails strong rolls the sea before impulsive gales the crooked keel the frothy flood divides swift flies the ship and rushes through the tides my lover long my gazing eyes pursue as long my lover kept me in his view reluctant so departing souls prepare to wing their doubtful flight they know not where reluctant so expiring bodies lie nor willing these to stay nor those to fly twice twenty days i spent in fruitless tears before the fatal tidings reached my ears how felix sailing over the watery way was wrecked on rocks and perished in the sea o then what trouble grief and anxious care confused my soul and bent it to despair i cursed the cause that forced him to expire o heaven forgive me if i cursed my sire i fled his house and sought the lonely grove the gloomy witness of my former love where once resolved to seek the shades below i drew the knife to strike the mortal blow till piety the cruel thought suppressed and checked the roman courage of my breast i trembling saw two doubtful paths nor knew which path was best to shun or which pursue opposing passions in my bosom strove and conscience now prevailed and now my love as when the wind and tide a contest make the sailer trembling sees his vessel shake this way and that and both by turns reclined as swells the surge or blows the furious wind so was my soul with different notions swayed of this of that of both and all afraid ah why should mortals of their reason boast which most deserts em when they want it most for when the troubled minds confused with pain it is but an ignisfatuus of the brain which if our wandering souls from virtue stray but leads us more and more from virtues way so led it me to stem the devious tide and seek for death where wretched felix died not distant far a fishing vessel stood nor wholly on the land nor in the flood arrived to this i rowed it from the shore and bent on death the tide i now explore expecting soon the friendlyfurious wave would give my troubles and myself a grave but when i saw the billows round me flow the boundless skies above and seas below scared with the terrors of the watery space i wrapped my mantle round my timorous face then lay me down to all the dangers blind chance was my compass and my pilot wind blown here and there i floated on the deep which rocked my eyes but not my fears asleep for now my dreaming soul in fancys maze a thousand tragic airy ghosts surveys which fluttered round me and reproaching said die coward follow felix to the shade why would thou wish to live now he is dead but when at length your friendly voice i heard my vision ceased the specter disappeared thus have i told but cannot dispel my care for who can conquer love or cure despair thus she and thus capresa spoke again so was she called who waked her on the main unhappy nymph compose your troubled mind nor doubt the gracious guide of human kind that god who saved you from the foamy wave will doubtless guard the life he deigned to save vouchsafe to take the counsel i can lend at susa heaven has blessed me with a friend much famed for wealth for pious actions more no husband and no children but the poor let me conduct you to her friendly gate too small my cottage for a guest so great she will protect you from barbarian foes with prudent counsel mitigate your woes and charm your ruffled soul to soft repose blessed partner of my grief the damsel said some angel surely sent you to my aid for now some dawning rays of hope appear that chase away the clouds of dark despair this pause of pain and interval of grace shall be employed in search of future peace then guide and guard me to your noble friend so may you never want this aid you lend and as we travel deign to let me know to whom so many thanks i justly owe what hapless fortune cast you on this land what occupation here employs your hand sweet conversation may suspend my care dispel my grief or make it less severe so shall i easier reach the neighboring town and listening to your fate forget my own thus she and thus the pensive dame replies with briny drops distilling from her eyes fain would i lovely nymph suspend your care dispel your grief or make it less severe but were i all my fortune to explain twould not alleviate but increase your pain for in your soul such sparks of nature glow as make you share your neighbors joy or woe the christian faith i secretly embrace though doomed to dwell among a pagan race trepanum wasted all my bloom of life where long i lived a farmers happy wife my careful loving husband tilled the soil nor was the field ungrateful to his toil for every summer ceres crowned the plain each autumn filled the barn with golden grain so thick the verdant harvest yearly stood the meadows seemed to groan beneath their load our fleecy flocks were fruitful of their young hail were our oxen and our horses strong nor did our kine of milky produce fail but with distended udders filled the pail twas then alas how often have i cried i would not wish to be a monarchs bride when all around my little infants came hung on my knees and lispd their mamas name or met their father with the evening ray embraced his neck and kissed his cares away soon as their riper age could labor bear we sent em forth to feed the fleecy care where often have we spent the summers day charmed to behold the wanton cattles play what pleasure twas to see the skipping lambs what music when they bleated for their dams we thought our joys could never be increased love peace and plenty joined to make us blessed but see how fortune holds her fickle reign she raises up to tumble down again for now our thread of happiness was spun the gains of twenty years were lost in one twas in the season when the verdant mead begins to ask the mowers crooked blade before the wheat receives the yellow stain or milky juice is hardened into grain a gale of poison baleful eurus cast the vernal product sickend with the blast our meadows straight a saffron scene disclose our infant apples quit the blighted boughs pease wheat and barley withered in the fields and nature one abortive harvest yields nor stopped it here the flying plague began to spread the bane in beasts and thence to man first died our sheep upon the russet plain next swelled our oxen with a fatal blain here tumbles over her meat the moping cow there drops the panting horse before the plough at length the dire contagion spread so wide my virgin children made the tomb their bride this nature bore  but when our landlord sent his officers to seize my lord for rent and he to shun the prison flies the shore lists on the sea to tug the laboring oar i wept i raved i cursed the baleful air and fled my native land but not my care thus banished here a widow and a wife condemned to suffer not enjoy a life i toil for those who catch the finny prey the toils are great but very small the pay their scaly fry to market often i bear often in the ocean wash their thready snare and then was washing when with great surprise you and your floating vessel met my eyes now heaven defend us both the nymph replied and can such rage in christian minds reside what could the cursed inhuman tyrant wrest thy tender husband from thy loving breast when all thy wealth was lost thy children dead o virtue virtue whither art thou fled why must such evils on the guiltless flow ye heavens is innocence rewarded so so spoke the nymph her friend no more replies for now priscillas dome attracts their eyes approaching to her friendly gate they found the generous lady dealing alms around to needy souls a hapless helpless crowd who daily blessed her hand for daily food when thus capresa hail for ever blessed it is godlike thus to succor the distressed yet none of these who claim your christian aid deserves it more than this unhappy maid who once was blessed with fame and riches too though fickle fortune now is turned her foe unlike the mendicants who daily share your friendly bounty and maternal care to whom the lady with a gracious look that seemed to breathe compassion while she spoke sure decency forbids a guest so great should undistinguished with the vulgar eat no deck my table with the choicest fare the nymph with me a kind repast shall share for by her looks if truth may be divined that lovely body clothes a lovely mind she said and constance low obeisance made then gladly followed where priscilla led within the gate a spacious room she found whose walls were beautified with tapstry round where pious tales appeared so lively wrought the work seemed vital and the figures thought here in the shade the jewish patriarch stood feasting the sons of heaven with earthly food while there the good samaritan confessed his kindness and reproached the cruel priest with many more a charitable band the skilful labor of priscillas hand hither the dame conveyed a sweet repast rich meats and rosy wines the table graced they eat they drank in pleasing converse joined and cheered at once the body and the mind the call of nature being soon suppressed thus spoke the lady to her youthful guest say lovely stranger for i long to know so may propitious heaven remove thy woe whence thus reduced by famine sword or fire what sire thy beauty boasts what land thy sire perhaps some princess banished from her home thus condescends to grace my rustic dome if so i greatly fear my homely feast has been unworthy of my royal guest she said the nymph unfolds her tale again the prudent dame attempts to sooth her pain and thus replied though weighty are your woes the weightiest ill with patience lighter grows then bear with patience all that heaven designed whose ways are just though difficult to find planned for the general good of human kind gods paths in winding mazes often lie too intricate for feeble reasons eye most regular when in confusion lost most constant when they seem to vary most perhaps his mercy forced you thus to roam to shun a more unhappy fate at home for with one evil he removes a worse and blesses often with what we think a curse then let your soul at fortune not repine but trust in heavens protection next in mine in me you still shall find a faithful friend with whom in time your troubles all may end but since you now are harassed out with woes refresh your weary soul with sweet repose and when you wake at morning may you find heavens balmy comfort heal your wounded mind thus cheered the nymph obsequiously withdrew and bathed her cares in sleeps refreshing dew till phoebus rising from the shades of night with rosy keys unlocked the gates of light bright as his beams arose the beauteous maid and to her patroness returning said what thanks propitious lady shall i give for all the godlike bounties i receive o let my silence thank you for i know words cannot express the gratitude i owe to whom replies the venerable dame no other thanks but gratitude i claim the terms of charity are never hard love and compassion are their own reward a soul that succors virtue when distressed can with reflection make a noble feast which nourishes the mind and overpays a generous deed with selfapproving praise such was their converse till domestic care invites priscilla from the youthful fair who sat in pensive solitude and strove to soften or suspend the pains of love at length the linen on her knee she spread and with her needle worked the docile thread young thisbes fate she first began to frame but soon commits her labor to the flame next drew she hero sinking in the main then razed the finished image out again both these displeased her though judicious art and rays of nature shone in every part at length her own unhappy tale she chose and lively paints the scene of all her woes her charming felix first the linen graced by whom her father frowning stern she placed her lovers parting next to these appears but weeping here she soiled her work with tears next on the seas she drew her floating ship next her own boat slowwandring over the deep by these she fixed capresa on the strand who waked her first and welcomed her to land the good priscilla last employed her art whose aspect spoke the bounty of her heart her friendly roof a refuge for the poor the horn of plenty pendent over the door diffusing blessings still and still increasing more all these confessed such beauty skill and care not helen better wove the trojan war while hector paris and their martial train with grecian heroes battled on the plain here let us leave the lovely nymph awhile to pass her tedious hours in pleasing toil her absent lover now my song pursues whose valiant deeds require a nobler muse swiftpiniond fame which often babbling flies to bear unwelcome truths and oftner lies had spread the ductile error far and wide how wandering felix perished in the tide but felix safely reached the thunic port and soon arrived to honors in the court his wisdom there the wisest peers excelled his valor more surpassed em in the field when first he to the royal palace came an accident occurred to raise his fame a noble lord there was of great renown rebelled against the king and claimed his crown great preparations made he for the fight nor less the monarch to defend his right but summoned all to meet the daring foe whose strength could wield a sword or bend a bow and promised to reward their martial care with honors equal to their deeds in war now rings the region with the foes alarms terrific shines the field with burnished arms the martial trumpet sounding from afar with dreadful notes proclaims approaching war the royal army valiant felix joined intrepid courage animates his mind fixed in the front the foe he bravely dares like pallas prudent and as bold as mars say muse what goddess that tremendous hour aided the youth with such unusual power bright venus conscious of the lovers smart sharpened his sword and pointed every dart fierce as a lion through the lines he sprung and forced his foes like trembling stags along as when resistless winds rush over the deep and from its anchor force the driving ship or furiously against the woodland roar the leafy harvest tumbling flies before so rushed the hero on the adverse band so fled the legions from his powerful hand till soon the rebel lord he prisoner made and to the king his captive prize conveyed now reaps the youth the glory of his toil to him the monarch gives the martial spoil rewards his valor with a noble post and makes him first commander of his host thus quickly felix gained a deathless name thus was his labor crowned with wealth and fame but wealth and fame insipid things appear to give them taste he wants the lovely fair the lovely fair oppressed with equal grief to make her happy wants the glorious chief his fame which soon at susa was revealed heroic actions seldom lie concealed with pleasing wonder struck constantias ears and filled her doubtful soul with hopes and fears for though the wise priscilla often strove with prudent counsel to suppress her love her love was only lessened not suppressed but glows again again distracts her breast as when in rural cots the flames aspire and laboring peasants quench the mounting fire if chance a latent spark remain behind in heapy ashes fanned with ambient wind the fires again with former fury rise flame through the roof and flash into the skies so in her bosom glows the amorous fire and fills her tender soul with soft desire and is my felix yet alive she says and is he crowned with wealth and deathless praise no no i fear the flattering tale deceives methinks i see him plunging in the waves ah why ye heavens are feeble mortals cursed in things uncertain to believe the worst no rather let me seek the thunic court there with my eyes confirm the blessed report hope flies before and points the pleasing way love urges on and love i must obey so saying to priscilla straight she came and with her thoughts acquaints the pious dame the pious dame with tender pity swayed approves the passion of the loving maid and with capresa guards her to the place resolved herself to view the heros face the hero meets em at the regal gate arrayed in armor formidably great for on that morning by the kings command the chief was to review the martial band his studded chariot darted splendour round his stately coursers neighing pawd the ground the nodding plumes around his temples wave with awful grace and beautifully brave he knew the approaching nymph but in surprise the joyous stream descended from his eyes the nymph beheld the weeping chief nor knew for what he wept nor whom she came to view his martial dress bespangled over with gold the dreadful warrior not the lover told but when he cast the helmet from his head and through the gates the blushing damsel led she knew her lover clasped him to her breast while silent eloquence her joy confessed the conscious pains an absent lover bears despair fallacious hope and anxious fears for want of words were painted with their tears and when at length their crystal sluices ceased the joyful hero thus the nymph addressed ye gods and have i then my charmer found and are my labors thus completely crowned yes let me clasp thee to my longing arms drink in thy breath and feed upon thy charms as widowed turtles roving round the fields through all the fruitful stores which nature yields cursed in the midst of plenty cannot eat but starve lamenting for their absent mate thus have i been with fame and riches graced yet wanted thee to give my riches taste but say how came this wealth i wanted most what brought my love to this barbarian coast he said and now the joyful damsel spoke the dangers which she suffered for his sake shows him the dame who found her on the tide priscilla too who all her wants supplied then prostrate on her knees before him bends and begs him to reward her faithful friends the grateful chief by native goodness swayed embraced em both and soon the nymph obeyed but first before his royal master came and begs he may resign his post of fame at which the monarch frowns with awful eyes till felix straight who saw his passion rise falls on the ground and to his master shows the various scene of all his amorous woes this heard the king resumes his former grace love tuned his soul and smoothed his ruffled face he raised the hero bids the nymph appear the nymph approached him with a modest fear before his awful throne submiss she fell and to him straight unfolds thamazing tale mute on the ground awhile he fixed his eyes then is the force of love so great he cries we falsely man the worlds commander call thou mightier monarch love command all young ammons self could not thy power confine the world his subject was but he was thine then smiling thus he cheered the trembling fair henceforward lovely nymph dismiss thy care for since thy love has conquered wind and sea cursed be the king that is crueller than they let hymen straight confirm the marriage ties thou justly have deserved the nuptial prize thus said he crowned the heros martial care with riches far superior to the fair due thanks returned they to priscilla came bestowing gifts and honors on the dame capresa next with age and labor worn in comely robes the grateful pair adorn with ample wealth her former bliss restored and from the seas redeemed her nuptial lord her nuptial lord again enjoys his wife again delightful freedom crowns his life till nature calls him to resign his breath in honorable age and peaceful death this done the loving couple quit the shore and joyfully the destined port explore while sportive nereids round their vessel play and wanton cupids hail em on their way rough thetis self assumes a pleasing smile glad to return em to their native soil where sacred hymen joined their mutual hands and heaven indulgent

friends you therefore who are worthy friendships name and cherish in your breast the genuine flame attend to what a faithful muse imparts a muse unpracticed in fallacious arts though young in life that life has made her know a friendly aspect often conceals a foe that though so many seeming friends abound for one that is true a thousand false are found when first you strive a faithful friend to find explore the secret motives of his mind nor rashly credulous his friendship trust before you know what passion rules him most but as a horseman checks the coursers speed till he has tried the temper of his steed so check the reins of friendship till you prove what sways the person interest or love avoid the fop impertinently vain and shun the slave who flatters you for gain beware of him who sells you for a jest but most of all beware the leaky breast who hopes to keep his wine the season round must first be sure his cask is sweet and sound nor should a formal fool your friendship

agreeing with your own the heart and lion at a distance keep wolves company with wolves and sheep with sheep so we by natures sympathetic powers most love those tempers that resemble ours yet if it be too difficult to find a friend so justly molded to your mind among the virtuous few select the best and such is he whose failings are the least let him a modest freedom always claim to praise your virtues or your vices blame nor be displeased his mild reproof to hear for friends may often kindly be severe the best sometimes each other may control yet not destroy the harmony of soul rough notes

suffering mind unveil your bosom to your other part your friend shall share the burden of your heart alleviate every ill your soul sustains double your pleasures and divide your pains be zealous for your friends whenever you know their reputation censured by a foe nor with a faint excuse degrade your friends the man who coldly praises discommends or are they justly censured for a crime reprove them mildly at some proper time in private chide all failings which you find in public praise the beauties of their mind place all their virtues in the clearest light omit their faults or touch them very slight as painters when they draw a beauteous face contract a blemish heighten every grace neither let passion pride or private ends or changing fortune make you change your friends who varies

the former and usurp their room succeeding billows thus the foremost throng tides roll on tides and waves urge waves along not but we may with a new friend engage before we see an old one quit the

cool our love and quench the friendly fire vile avarice assumes the greatest power a god which base ignoble souls adore to pleasure him a tide of broken vows needful libations on his altar flows yet never satisfied he craves for more and keeps his votaries in plenty poor who worships him will break the friendly bands whenever the sordid selfish god commands others there are induced by thirst of praise and even the greatest men this passion sways who quit their friends for honors of the state and turn their love into the rankest hate nor is it wonder these desert their friends since all are foes who will not serve their ends for wild ambition like a torrent roars which when obstructed climbs thopposing shores till to the top the laboring flood attains swells over the banks and foams

by wisdoms safer rules for twere but labor lost to counsel fools detest the wretch who never can courage find to speak the genuine dictates of his mind but like the sirens sweet pernicious song at once would charm and ruin with his tongue yet some there are in social bands allied who with blunt truths err on the other side void of goodnature and goodbreeding too they sourly censure every thing you do o never flatter even a monarchs pride nor with the sternness of a cynic chide but when you would an erring friend reprove let gentle cautions show the motives love do not begin with rashness to exclaim but rather hint the fault before you blame it is not enough your admonitions just prudence must guide it or the labors lost friends should allure and charm us into sense harsh counsels not reform but give offense nature impatient of severe reproof loves mild instruction but abhors the rough as fruits and flowers improve with gentle rain but fade if rapid storms overflow the plain some men are friends when fortune fills the sails and wafts you on with favorable gales but quit the tottering ship and make to shore when storms descend and adverse surges roar long as in credit power or place you stand their fawning formal friendship you command with twenty squeezes and a hundred bows as many compliments as many vows they swear your interest shall be their own and wish the time to make it better known like false hot coursers waiting for the chase which foam and neigh and proudly spurn the grass intent to run but droop their jaded crest and fail you most when most you want their haste we make a prostitute of friendships name if only complaisance supports our claim and yet there are of this polite degree who treat you still with forced civility in each obliging art so well refined though ever false they never seem unkind not that my muse would decency offend for it is goodbreeding polishes a friend nor shines it less with truth and virtue joined than comely features with a noble mind but those whose friendships most in speeches dwell neglect the fruit and trifle with the shell true friendship more intrinsic worth affords defined by actions better than by words a warm affection that can never cool concord of mind and music of the soul which tunes the jarring strings of life to love shows men below how angels live above there are in friendship such attractive charms it draws esteem from those it never warms see how qui clamores tota cavea nuper in hospitis and amici mci m pacuvii nova sabula cum ignorante rege uter eorum esset orestes pylades orestem se
