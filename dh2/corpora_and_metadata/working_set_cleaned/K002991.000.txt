king henry the vii or the popish impostor  a tragedy  as it is acted by his majestys servants at the theater royal in drury lane  london printed for r francklin in covent garden r dodsley in pall mall and j brotherton in cornhill mdccxlvi price is   d  preface the following piece was designed as a kind of mirror to the present rebellion and the imagined advantage of having it acted before that unnatural flame could be extinguished was the reason why it was so hurried in the writing being begun and finished in less time than is necessary tor the forming the fable only of a correct play it was the six weeks labor of an actor who even in that short space was often called from it by his profession the players for the sake of dispatch had it to study act by act just as it was blotted and the only revisals it received from the brouillon to the press were at the rehearsals of it so that we must bespeak the readers indulgence for numberless incorrections through the whole but more particularly for the measure and diction the author having neglected them so much that he cannot call the manner in which it is written either prose or verse but accidentally both it is certain apologies for bad writing seldom procure remission from the rigid yet the most flagrant crimes when ingenuously confessed and followed by repentance admit of extenuation from the benevolent  n b the lines marked with commas were omitted after the first nights acting the play being too long in the performance  prologue spoken by mr macklin breathes there a briton longs for popish chains while smithfield fire our english annals stains when popish rage and persecution blazed with british blood on altars rome had raised when matrons saw their sons in flames expire their husbands crackling in religious fire then rome gave laws our kings and council swayed while albion mourned her liberties betrayed but now she smiles our laws are all our own which rule alike the cottage and the throne no tools of power our properties invade no heads are chopped for plots the court has made by such base arts her empire rome maintains axes her arguments her logic chains to these a martyr gallant russel fell and sidney bled whose crime was writing well but under george such practice is unknown for freeborn subjects guard and grace his throne a prince like him our author shows to night who fought for freedom and his regal right the temporary piece in haste was writ the six weeks labor of a puny wit with melting measure critic rules unfraught artless he writes  just as rude nature taught no golden lines no polished verse has he but all like british courage rough and free for once then  judge not by critic but by patriot laws where genius fails support your favorite cause  epilogue spoken by mrs woffington by hal delivered from my marriage vows catherine again is free to choose a spouse the man who offers fairest shall succeed if british born or of old huntleys breed of romenursed husbands i have had enough o ladies they are all such dastard stuff that i my self equipped in cap and jerkin am every whit as good a prince as perkin it is true the boy was loving soft and tender but in the main an arrant poor pretender jesting apart  now ladies what do you say what is your judgment of this hasty play for your decision here the author stands let the poor rogue have mercy at your hands in sooth we are much beholden to his art for in a female form he has placed a manly heart and if in her bright character you find superior spirit and a roman mind know from the life her principles he drew and hopes the piece shall live which copies you  dramatis personae king henry mr delane oxford mr berry dawbney mr woodburn bishop of york mr havard stanley mr winstone sir robert clifford mr

sevez frion we all were on the brink of fate a nobleman who knew him when a child avowed him an impostor born at tournay the son of one john osbec  not the heir of englands king  audaciously assumed this staggered many of the court who warmly opposed his audience i at length stood up and in full council strait produced our letters from charles of france his holiness the pope and maximilian of bohemia and as they all recognize his royal birth the objection vanished and the king resolved to give him instant audience and support befitting regal state oppressed and wronged  frion most reverend sir your industry and zeal so warmly active in this pious cause will ever make you dear to france and rome  sevez frion with religious joy we will revenge the irreverent contempts lately offered to our holy church by unholy england my functions secular and religious shall to their utmost stretch to fix this perkin on englands throne henry has refused our king by my contrivance his daughter margaret which affront has sown the seeds of hate too deep within his youthful mind ever to be weeded out his souls on fire and burns with eagerness to pour invasion into their haughty land to loose at once his unremitting grudge on a proud neighbor and a dreaded rival but frion though we abound in scottish blood ready to be drained against englands peace yet treasure is wars strongest sinew and without that quickening aid the devouring body wastes to needy peace that must be had  frion holy sir it is ready for years large collections have been making in england spain and everhelping france these sums for the present are lodged with me but now a special order from his holiness divests me of the charge and to your care commits the trust  sevez our unerring fathers confidence does honor to my zeal i will bestow the treasure as his holiness directs and the religious cause demands but how stands ireland what hopes from thence  trion none the apostate slaves are fallen off from rome and firmly fixed in the usurpers cause kildare clanrikard with many others on whom we built absolute assurance have at their own charge armed their friends and followers and joined the english general poinings for which may divine vengeance taint their air and visit them to late posterity  sevez how are the english affected toward us  frion as our hearts could wish sir robert clifford and many others all of high rank and eminent esteem in discontent at present with their king by gold and promises have i firmly fixed yet more the usurpers bosomfriend the man nearest his heart crossed in ambitious views has secretly vowed revenge and is ours by oath and heart so that englands measures are betrayed as soon as formed  sevez so far then probability attends us and gives almost assurance of success but one thing more  is perkin well prepared can he affect the blush of innocence has he the steadfast eye that looks against enquiry can he stand the shock of gazing numbers and tell his tale without confusion is he master of the false tear and feigned sigh for to a crowded presence he must speak  frion he is not to be taught his lesson now the blended care of nature and of art have stamped him perfect a majestic mein a countenance where sweetness and command smile awfully together a deportment courtly but not effeminate a skill that calls him master of most languages but chiefly english with a soothing carriage which beggars the persuasion of his tongue his supposed aunt margaret of burgundy has formed his education she has made him a living history of englands factions the various interests battles revolutions the friends the enemies of either house this of plantagenet or that of lancaster he is master of many languages but chiefly english to ingratiate him with the people and stamp him native  sevez the king is soft and warm susceptible of pity prompt to receive the impression of humanity if perkin do but tell his tale with skill the unwary youth will sympathize in sorrow and take and keep what form his art bestows  frion doubt not his art my lord he is complete and often has rehearsed his kingly part in france in flanders and in italy where admiring crowds have wondered forth his praise and given natural marks of majesty in look tone gesture gate and voice and credulous talebelieving women to whom appearances are sacred truths have at his welltold tale dissolved in tears thus my lord like a graceful wellskilld actor he steals where ever he plays his princely part or popular applause or melting pity  sevez frion some subtle means must be contrived to fling divisions firebrarnds amongst the english for should they join their hearts and resolutions the united power of europe nay the world could not prevail against them  frion care is taken on every side our emissaries ply and blacken the usurper gold and prayer alternately are used and with success to bribe his council and to win his subjects richards divine hereditary right a right infallibility confirms and which that power makes indefeasible is preached amongst them strengthened by the terror of bulls anathemas and hell eternal to those who disbelieve or disobey  sevez it is well but we must haste the king expects us i will conduct the youth is he ready  frion he is my lord  sevez frion in your public manifestos be sure you promise free power of worship to the lollards and all separatists men fight by halves with a kind of bastard courage on rebellions side without religion but when that is hooked in why then biggotry flaming biggotry tunes rebellions discord into pious loyalty and makes men fight with hot enthusiastic vigor and forget the name of rebel for then the cause and quarrel are no longer earthly but derived of heaven exeunt  scene ii king of scotland

skriek of death awaked me  when horror stiffening horror seized my frighted soul close by my side i saw my dying brother all weltring in his gore murders butchered prey the grim assassins  their hands yet reeking with the royal blood seized me  shuddering  i kneeled and begged for mercy instantly as if great providence had interposed the murderers  soulstruck  stood ghast and flank at length soft mercy and relenting nature warmed about their hearts and the upraisd hand unnervd by pity the fatal dagger dropped  sevez o heavenly care of injured royalty  k scot we must be marble not to melt at this  perkin the repenting men with tears assured me of my life and safety and straight returning to my cruel uncle deceived him with the account that both were dead to tournay thence with speed i was

in your court  exeunt all but sevez and frion sevez thus far the gale blows right and all goes well  but frion we must leap another bound another danger still must be encountered i must apprize thee that our scotch nobility proud and tenacious of their ancient rights vent daily murmurs and form close cabals forsake the court and bitterly inveigh against the church as having usurped of late too much authority in temporal sway loud are their complaints that by priests and frenchmen they are precluded from the royal ear some of these factious spirits have been quelled some of them banished and their lands confiscate others imprisoned nay and some cut off yet still their dreaded leaders do remain alexander gordon earl of huntley the young lord daliel and archibald douglas earl of angus still they erect their crests and with impunity vent their black malice against the church and us  frion how have they escaped  sevez through fear not lenity their friends are numerous their possessions large their deaths would be forerunners of our ruin else let me speak it like a true romish churchman their irksome beings had not now perplexed us they have absented long from court and council but late a special summons from the king has ordered their attendance here to day on pain of banishment and confiscation  fri but holy sir i doubt these headstrong lords will not assent to aid our perkins claim  sevez no matter frion we can do without them for me i am determined and for the king he acts by my controuling will not his own it is not prudent that the church of rome should ere let kings or rulers think for themselves the unerring see should ever be their guide as to those heretic lords their assent for perkin is our least concern we have more important views upon them  death death frion huntley must not live he stalks and roars but one day more in freedoms spacious forest the toil is set for the unwily lion and his own boundless spirit drives him in he thinks the king mislead and will bellow without guile or guard for the fool is brave even to romantic madness  scotlands good so strongly burns within him it appears his only passion freedom is his god which he so idolizes he would make the world his proselytes did they but hear him  frion lord sevez it is not fit such men exist  sevez o they are dangerous in a court like ours where the kings interest wanders from the peoples but his majestys prepared  and resolved this day by my advice to silence huntleys free speaking or his head answer the default  frion omniscient wisdom still directs your mind and points your purpose to some holy end but my right reverend sir one thing remains unsettled yet which only you can finish  you know this perkin burns for huntleys daughter scotlands gay ornament and natures pride this angellooking maid this katherine gordon to young lord daliel has been late betrothed the follower and fervent friend of huntley your wonderworking wisdom now must break this fatal knot or englands blazing crown will sit like death upon his princely head  sevez this business in the council has been weighed the king resolves to gratify his wish and give the lovely katherine to young perkin which match will either fix this dangerous huntley in our cause or with enraged madness break his proud stubborn heart for his daughter next to liberty is his earthly idol but i must leave you  for the council sits to found those factious lords  i must attend exit  frion my brother priest is zealous in our cause his pride and avarice must be the tools with which we work  they are sharp and handy and in a priest who sways the royal mind will rid much business gordons lovely daughter who is of royal blood to perkin joined will knit the scots to us indissolubly for after marriage should they find the cheat twill then become their interest to conceal it nay to espouse it too  which if they do refuse the magazines of romes affrighting vengeance in damning bulls and terrible anathemas shall to the liquid gulf of penal flames devote their black their superstitious souls till penitence and gold buy out their pardon exit  scene iii the council chamger the king sevez sir david bruce

public weal  king their sickness is all pretense  but admit him exit sir david bruce and returns with huntley lord huntley welcome to the royal walls of holyrood and well we wish you never had estranged them it would have joyd us much to have seen the lords daliel and angus here as you are subjects nobles and kinsmen we with your love and we entreat all lets that may impede our concord be removed your presence will be gladness to our heart therefore be oftener in our eye  huntley my liege i am unfashiond for your court my speech like my manners are plain and uncourtly i have been bred a soldier a scotch soldier not an italian flatterer my old body is dried and chilled with toilsome marches through numbing frost and scorching heat to grapple with my countrys foe i have not been used to silken coverli is and solon beds  but to the friendly played and swampy earth and my best lodging often has been the dryest turf the blooming hither the wholesome fern our unlettered bards then flattered not the living but praised the dead their songs were not who steeped deepest in italian luxury or decked gayest in foreign frippery but who had most wounds in battle or fought hardiest in their countrys cause this court was not then the rendezvous of italian minstrels priests and legates  but the hospitable home of scotch nobility whose ancestors this realm coevald and when grown strengthless by fighting scotlands battles grew venerably gray in her faithful councils  where are they now here are none such your nobles are strangers to your court your courtiers strangers to your nobles  k scot huntley to taunt and to revile was not the purport of our summons but to counsel and assist  huntley sir counsel void of freedom may flatter and mislead but never can assist freedom is the guide the unerring guide to sacred truth in a nations council the freeborn subjects indisputable right and never suffered prohibition yet but from priests and tyrants  k scot  sir to your vast hightaught notions of freedom we are no stranger rabble kerns too we hear copy your licentious knowledge and in rude saucy language dare revile our sacred person libellously branding our wisdom with french and priestrid weakness  huntley my liege when the yoke galls nature will wince arrests imprisonments and confiscations compose your subjects dreams and break their restless sleep we lie down with anguish at our state  and rise despairing ever to see it mend and the heartstinging prospect that opens to our view is posterity scourged by french and romish tyranny  k scot o sir your distempered fancy frames sprites and goblins men of sounder judgments never see  huntley pray heaven it may be fancy  my liege i have fought my countrys battles in sweat and blood when every object to eye and ear and thought brought certain death into the mind the whole a moving scene of busy fate and after battle i have seen the hardfought conquered field strewn with death and slaughter there i have beheld our gallant helpless nobles breathing out final groans their active blood baked and clotted by scorching heat or swallowed by the greedy suncrackd earth there i beheld brothers and kinsmen stripped and piled on mangled heaps of slaughter  kerns and thanes promiscuous there searching for my dear my darling only son i found his wellknown headless trunk all gashd and mangled  with his brains dashed and scattered against a bloodstained oak  yet these were sights of joy to what i now behold i see my country bleeding in her vital vein i see her nobles banished imprisoned and assassind i see scotlands dregs compose her councils all concerns sacred civil and military sold and hucksterd as in a public mart i see majesty  deluded majesty hemmed in by a band of crawling parasites who taint his royal mind with a kings bluest plague seditious jealousy of his best subjects o awake awake anointed sir and be the father not the tyrant of your people ferret from your court these rats who will undermine the roof that shelters them and leave your fame and country to perish in the ruins  sevez lord huntley your illmannerd heat of temper makes you forget the presence you are in the homage and respect due to majesty you wilfully and audaciously omit  hunt the homage and respect the envenomed slander and the telltale pickthanks you mean my lord which taint the purest loyalty to blackest treason  sevez my lord your manners grow foul and beneath your rank  hunt my priest your pride grows insolent and above your rank and the same recipe that discharges the black stains from your conscience will cleanse my manners  sevez stains from my conscience lord  hunt ay priest twas my phrase  sevez my liege this treatment in your royal presence too is beyond the sufferance of wholesome policy and human nature  it demands instant chastisement  hunt chastisement priest  sevez ay chastisement lord  k scot  huntley  be calm why how now sir have you forgot our presence  hunt  no my lord  rows to to the king then with a stifled rage turns to sevez  you are a priest  in council  but no matter   it is well  o scotland scotland how is thy spirit broke when that a kernbred upstart rometaught priest dares hold a rod of menaced chastisement over the minds of freeborn peers  k scot huntley you grow seditious  hunt my liege truth will ever be sedition while france and italy direct your council  k scot sir my allies of france and holy rome must not be reviled by you or any slanderspreading subject within my realm  sevez pray my good lord if heart will give you leave will you inform his majesty and council in what this outstretchd power of rome consists  k scot ay huntley let us cooly hear at once these arbitrary and oppressive grievances in church and state and if they appear such our royal word is gaged for the redress  hunt ay sir now you speak like a king whose noblest office is to hear and to redress  k scot proceed sir in your grievances you have free leave  hunt most heartily i thank your majesty your gracious boon i will accept and in my homely plainness dreadless use it though i were sure this freedom were my last to begin then  freespeaking parliaments are thrown aside as superfluous in our state and prostitute bulls from marketing rome supply their place the regal council of the realm consists  first of william sevez now the popes legate a man issued from the base perfidious clan of vile mackgreger he with religious guile and gallic craft infacinates the royal mind the subjects lives their rights and properties he grinds and arbitrates with tyrant will and to pleasure subtle france misguides our land to a perfidious war in support of an impostors title against our true allies the faithobserving english  sevez dread sir this insult to distressed royalty is not to be borne  king scot let him proceed it is the last time he speaks in scottish council  hunt be it so my liege then it is the last service i shall do my country but to your council since it is my last right against your priest an english minstrel stands who though at home a vagrant now gives vote in council here and for scotlands honor keeps a court auction for royal boons where the highest bidder rises to preferment there are many more of the like nature about your palace and though excellent in their various talents yet there is one they all unite in which is  a servile thoroughpaced obedience in court measures to gall your subjects and oppress the land  king scot lord huntley freedom of speech was your request  you had it and by my troth full freely hast thou used it we know to gloss matters is not your use plaindealing however rude is the mark you aim at you have portraid a most lively speaking picture of our self our council our religion and our laws and it is but meet such highcolourd patriotism should be rewarded therefore we here solemnly engage our royal word before our upstart romedirected council to reward your treasons with immediate death  hunt treason my liege  king scot ay treason frontless traitor  hunt my misguided king  as you love fair truth  for my sacred master your dead fathers sake who in horrors of the raging battle proved my loyalty do not call me traitor the traitors blood is cold and treacherous mine tho old and dearth is hot and loyal now indeed it cannot gush as twas wont when lavished daringly in your defense and your houses cause yet in scotlands right it still can trickle a sacrifice to your misguided vengeance be kind then sacred sir take  take my old life but murder not my fame for a traitors name stabs deeper in a loyal heart than all the tortures tyranny can invent  k scot sir for your time you may find better use it is not of long duration employ it to advantage sir david bruce he is your prisoner convey him to the castle  hunt my kind liege  to the virtuous man extent of life is but of small concern to me it is none but how life is spent ought to be a kings first care for as the welfare of millions depends on him his life demands the strictest circumspection kingship is not an office of rapine riot tyranny and will but of care affection duty and circumscription inviolable to the subjects right if to remind a monarch of this duty be deemed a traitors office  would to heaven your council were all such it is the treason for which i wish to live and if it be the treason for which i die next to the field of battle in our dear countrys cause it is the best the noblest death a freeborn soul can meet and now farewell whom i honor as my king obey as my master reverence as my father love as my friend and lastly to that which contains and is dearer than them all a long long farewell  my ruined country  huntley led off as to the castle of edinburgh sevez if your faithful sevez my honored king may presume farther to advise angus and daliel both should die for lord huntleys death should they survive it instead of quenching their enkindled spirits would like flames pent up in fulld caverns make them burst forth and blaze with treble fierceness besides my liege the confiscation of their lands will be a double prop to your royal power first will punish and deter foul traitors who would lessen or subvert your royal sway next twill be a rich exchequer to push the war against scoffing england who with eye contemptful views scotlands king as poor and

from his tenderness innate and extreme affection to this unhappy stanley will extend his royal mercy beyond its prudent bounds and grant him pardon of all his treasons ox will he why then it is pity he should ever be without a traitor in his bosom for a blacker or one so unprovoked history cannot produce  enter king attended king well lords what says our apostate minion have you condemned him  york his treasons have sir which were as manifest as foul and dangerous the conscious guilt of his conspiracy pressed him so close it forced confession from him unimportund  king o lord bishop that argued shame and sorrow for his folly and though in lettered law it stands against him yet in our mercy and the softness of our friendly nature it pleads strongly for him extremity of law is sometimes too sharp even for our traitorous subjects on whom especially when penitent chastisement should fall not with a rigorous cruelty but paternal sorrow as the fond father corrects his truant child let me then lords for this unhappy man i once called friend wear a grateful pity in my breast he gave me life and crown in bosworth field let me repay the debt and give him life too justly forfeited by foul rebellion  ox my lord from my heart i wish the treason could be punished and the unhappy traitor spared but i believe your subjects at this juncture expect examples of public justice it gives me grief to say it but clamor is so violent against him amongst all degrees of people that i fear mercy at this time would be an act dangerous to yourself and state  york lord oxford councils well the insolence of this rebellion must be crushed with speedy war and laws utmost rigor amongst the great ones more particularly in whom when traitors most power of mischiefs lodged and though mercy in season is a kings heavenly attribute yet to use it now would i fear be deemed a dangerous weakness  king then be it so  since englands weal demands it that we shall ever make the sole guidance of our laws and will  did he assign no cause for his flagitious crimes  york none sir when urged his humble request was to see his royal master ere he died that then the motives of his discontent should have free and ample declaration  king o york i will see him but it is a hard trial of tender nature to see the man we have loved surrounded by guilt and death the king indeed at such a sight may stand unmoved but the friend in spite of justice will relent and soften into womanish pity exeunt  scene ii an apartment in the tower enter stanley in black guards etc  stanley what awful pomp attends the traitors death what preparations to affright his soul yet all are slight the guilt he feels within outshocks them all enter king york oxford dawbney lords yeomen of the guard ha the king  once my joy  my ambition my greatest happiness but now my reproach my terror  king see lord bishop the unhappy man is covered with confusion and cannot turn this way he looks as death would be a more welcome guest to his afflicted mind than our reproachful presence  the king approaches him o stanley how different is this interview from that in richards tent when bosworths slaughtered scene was over when the tyrant richard lay extended in our view my first thought was how to reward your love and loyalty i made you master of the tyrants wealth  the spoil was mighty  and had it been immence as columbus late discovered mines my oerflowing heart would have thought it poor  poor as beggars alms for my stanleys friendship  my mind  my treasure  my will has since been yours  my all at your direction what then could provoke your black your atrocious perfidy  stan ambition misguided restless insatiate ambition  king o thou unhappy mark of human frailty from patriot honor fallen to traitorous shame sure the utmost height of human glory is steadiness in our countrys good myriads of blessings are poured on the patriots head all are anxious for his health and welfare and the people from their abundant their overflowing hearts shout out their acclamations as he passes by his example millions are made virtuous even parricides who for traitorous gold would stab the vitals of their maternal land are forced to sculk behind a patriot mask lest the good mans spiritstirring virtue hurl popular vengeance on the villains head this is the patriot  now see the reverse see in yourself the traitor whom all men curse not his noble titles nor all the honors treacherous wealth can heap can screen him from popular shame nor ease from selfreproach his guiltstabd heart here you both stand the patriot this the traitor that pointing to the bishop and stanley the one englands invaluable blessing the other her deepest blackest vilest curse  stan o sir i feel the sad condition it has thrown guilt intense into my breast and tells me i deserve the worst of deaths my countrys laws or your just vengeance can inflict  king why say  should we grant you life should mercy be so abused so prostituted where where could you reside with whom associate none  patriots would shun you out of virtue traitors out of policy then the greatest blessing our power can give or your sad state admit  is instant death  stan it is my liege  and my request to see you was not to protract or sue for life  but to atone in some degree my guilt by full confession of the groundless cause which has for ever damned my fame then know sir your goodness has undone me  your royal kindness heaped such abundant favors on me that my ambitious soul was lost in prospect of boundless power your fatherinlaw my brother you raised to the earldom of darby envy and exorbitant ambition made me request the earldom of chester which without injury manifest you could not alienate being ever annexed to englands heir but i with love of power intoxicated unused to meet repulse from that moment like a poisonous serpent whom you had nourished in your kindly bosom lost sight and memory of all gratitude former favors by this refusal i changed to injuries and my wild ambition to inflamed revenge which i sought to gratify by stabbing my dear country through my friend and royal masters side this sir was my dark my hellish state of mind which is a glaring but faithful picture of ambitious disappointed courtiers who never know peace of mind till they destroy the state or in their treason meet their death and if my example may stand a beacon to the lavish fondness of future kings and to the pride of insatiate minions my crime will be of service to my country so farewell the best of kings  the warmest friend the kindest master  and oh for
